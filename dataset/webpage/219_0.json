Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://biographyscoop.com/andy-hurley/", "page_content": "Andy Hurley Biography, Age, Net Worth, Family, Parents, Drummer , Career\n\nAndy Hurley Biography\n\nAndy Hurley is an American musician who performs music.

However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.

His mother raised him throughout his youth and adolescence.\n\nAndy\u2019s first musical instrument was the saxophone, which he learned to play well, and he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nIn college, he studied anthropology and history because pursuing a professional career in music was not on his agenda. He had believed since he was a child that humans should live as they did thousands of years ago, in their most primitive state, but as he grew older, most of his views disappeared.\n\nAndy\u2019s first exposure to professional music was when he was in high school, and he was gradually developing an interest in playing the drums.\n\nIn 1996, Andy was looking for possibilities to play with large bands, so he joined numerous hardcore punk and heavy metal bands, including Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket, and The Kill Pill, to pursue his aspirations.

Wentz, on the other hand, was going through a lot of emotional turmoil at the time, which included a failed suicide attempt.\n\nIt was claimed that he was unable to handle the band\u2019s newfound success, which, among other factors, caused the band to take a break for a period of time in 2009.\n\nAndy became involved in a number of other projects and performed with many bands, including the heavy metal outfit The Damned Things. The band was largely a collaboration, including members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax, and Every Time I Die, and they published their debut album, \u201cIroniclast.\u201d\n\nEnabler, another hardcore band, hired Andy, and in the summer of 2012, Enabler released \u2018All Hail the Void,\u2019 their debut album with Andy as a drummer.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined FocusedXminds, a straight edge hard rock band.
