Gli uomini di stato devono essere disinteressati Transcription\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.[1]\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.[2] Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley.[3] Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.[2]\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600 miles (970 km) south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast.[2] Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,[4] became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".[5]\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.[4]\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.[6] In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.[7]\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N).[8] In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland.[9] Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.[10]\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.[11] In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.[12]\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\"[13] Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.[13]\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church[14] and a Mason.[15] He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland.[13] After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.[1]\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family.[n 1] The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100 feet (30 m) wide and 100 feet (30 m) long.[5] The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout.[5] The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.[5]\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\n^ avenues in the 21st century) are numbered in ascending order beginning west of Front Street (later named [16] Central Portland lies on the west side of a bend in the north-flowing Willamette River .

Lewis (1826-1897) emigrated to Portland, Oregon, in 1851. He founded a mercantile firm, Allen and Lewis, with Lucius H. Allen.\n\nRelated Resources"}, {"url": "https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv98844", "page_content": "John Ainsworth (Jack) Mills, Portland banker and civic leader, was born in Portland, Or., on September 25, 1930, the son of Abbot Low Mills, Jr. (1898-1986) and Katherine Ainsworth Mills (1903-1993). He is the descendent of many prominent families in Portland and in the New York City area, including the Mills, Low, Smith, Couch, Lewis, and Ainsworth families.\n\nThe Low family first gained prominence as merchant seamen and ship owners in 18th century New England. Many family members settled in Salem, Mass. Around 1830, as the Salem harbor became difficult to navigate, Seth Low (1782-1853) moved with his wife Mary Porter Low (1786-1872) and their children to Brooklyn, N.Y. There the family achieved great success in shipping and overseas trade. Their activities extended as far as China, and they became leaders in the silk and tea trade, among other commodities. Their ships included the well-known clippers, Houqua and N.B. Palmer. Seth Low's children included Abiel Abbot Low (1811-1893), who served as the head of the firm of A. A. Low & Brothers; the ship captain Charles Porter Low (1824-1913), who later became a prominent land developer in Santa Barbara, Calif., after 1873; Edward Allen Low (1817-1898); and Josiah Orne Low (1821-1895). A daughter, Ellen Porter Low (1827-1898), married Ethelbert Smith Mills, scion of a wealthy land-owning Long Island family. A son of Abiel Abbot Low, Seth Low (1850-1916) was a well-regarded political figure who served as mayor of Brooklyn, president of Columbia University, and reform mayor of the consolidated New York City.\n\nThe Mills Family was connected to the Lows, as noted above, through the marriage of Ellen Porter Low to Ethelbert Smith Mills (1815-1873), but also through the marriage of Josiah Orne Low to Martha Elizabeth Mills (1819-1884). The Mills family came to America from England in 1630, when they settled in Jamaica, Long Island. In 1683 Timothy Mills purchased extensive properties near Smithtown, Long Island, including what is now Mills Pond. The family later intermarried with the Smith, Helme, and Low families. One son of Ethelbert Smith Mills and Ellen Porter Low Mills was Abbot Low Mills (1858-1927), who came to Oregon around 1883 and eventually settled in Portland.\n\nIn the east, Abbot Low Mills pursued a somewhat independent career, starting a tea business as a teenager in Richmond, Va. He later graduated from Harvard University (1881) and entered the family business in New York City. After moving to Oregon around 1882 with a Harvard classmate, William Addison Howe, he tried chicken farming in Yamhill County, then opened a bank in Colfax, Wash., with Charles F. Adams in 1885. Mills helped to found the town of Pullman, Wash., and may have served in the Washington territorial legislature. In 1889 he and Adams organized the Security Savings and Trust Company in Portland. In 1899 Mills became vice preisdent of Portland's First National Bank and in 1903 was elected its president. He was active in numerous political and civic organizations throughout the state. Elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1903, he became Speaker of the House in 1904.\n\nIn 1891 Abbot Low Mills married Evelyn Scott Lewis (1865-1936), the daughter of prominent Portland merchant Cicero Hunt Lewis and granddaughter of pioneer John Heard Couch, who had developed the original city center. Among the couple's children were Abbot Low Mills, Jr. (1898-1986), who followed his father into a banking career. In 1924 the younger Mills married Katherine Ainsworth, daughter of banker John Churchill Ainsworth (1870-1943), himself the son of a leading Portland businessman John Commingers Ainsworth (1822-1893). Mills, Jr. worked first as vice president of the First National Bank, then moved in the late 1900s to the U.S. National Bank, which had been founded by the Ainsworths and was headed by Mills's father-in-law. In 1952 Abbot Low Mills, Jr., was appointed a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington, D.C. by President Harry Truman. He was re-appointed under succeeding presidents and served until 1965. His wife, Katherine Ainsworth Mills, served as the head of volunteers for the American Red Cross.\n\nThe Ainsworth Family began in Oregon with John Commingers Ainsworth (1822-1893), who was one of the most important business and civic leaders in late 19th century Portland. Born into a poor family in Ohio, Ainsworth began working on river steamboats in his teens, eventually becoming a captain on the Mississippi River. He came to California during the 1849 gold rush, moved to Oregon the following year, and took command of the Willamette River steamboat Lot Whitcomb. He went on to build and operate a fleet of steamboats on the Columbia River and founded the Oregon Steam Navigation Company in 1860, and later the Oregon Portage Railroad. Ainsworth's dominance of transportation on the Columbia River was a boon to the development of Portland, which came to be a nexus of inland waterways and ocean-going shipping. Eventually he founded the Ainsworth National Bank, which became the United States National Bank in 1902.\n\nLeadership of the bank passed to Ainsworth's son, John Churchill Ainsworth (1870-1943), whose daughter Katherine married Abbot Low Mills, Jr., in 1924. Their children included John (Jack) Ainsworth Mills (1930- ), who was educated at Cornell University and became vice president of the U. S. National Bank. In 1952 he married Katherine Leadbetter (1932- ), member of another prominent Portland family. It was Jack Mills who preserved the present collection of family papers and presented them to the Oregon Historical Society in 2002."}]}
