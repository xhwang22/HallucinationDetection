Before they graduated high school, they had toured Japan. A deal with Lookout! Records led to the band signing to Atlantic in 2001. Albums such as 2002's Spend The Night and 2004's Gold Medal garnered critical raves and won the band fans at all points on the globe, but not enough of them to maintain a major-label deal. Unbowed, The Donnas formed their own Purple Feather Records label, and in 2007 released their most bracing album yet, Bitchin'.\n\nThrough it all, the driving force behind The Donnas is Torry Castellano. The petite powerhouse rocks her Pearl kit with an almost tectonic force. Perhaps the reason she plays with such passion is the fact that she's lucky to be playing at all: In 2003 an acute case of wrist tendinitis (caused by holding her sticks wrong) almost ended her musical career. But through surgery, physical therapy, and a new approach to drumming, Castellano is back on the throne, and better than she's ever been.\n\nMusicRadar caught up with Torry Castellano backstage for a podcast interview before a recent Donnas show in New York City. Listen to the podcast below, and there's more information on The Donnas' official website.\n\nPart one - Torry discusses the band's formation, growing pains, and being tagged as 'punk.'\n\nPart two - She talks about maturing musically, her almost career-ending tendinitis, and future plans."}, {"url": "https://zerotodrum.com/torry-castellano/", "page_content": "Torry Castellano is an American percussionist and the former drummer of The Donnas. She announced her retirement from drumming in July 2010. She was born on January 8, 1979, in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nTorry Castellano \u2013 The Drummer of The Donna\n\nTorry Castellano was the drummer of all-girl hard rock band The Donnas from 1995 until she announced her retirement in July 2010. She replaced Stacey Blades, who replaced Torry\u2019s high school friend, Suzi Gardner. Castellano has also contributed to an eponymous song by the band.\n\nTorry Castellano\n\nTorry Castellano appeared in all of The Donnas\u2019 music videos, until 2010. She did not appear in \u201cToo Bad About Your Girl\u201d, because she was pregnant with her first son at the time of filming.\n\nCastellano\u2019s first public performance with the band was in October 1995, at a club called The Phoenix in Toronto. She has been playing drums since the age of 12. She studied under jazz drummer Joe Morello when she was 14 years old and continued to study percussion at the University of Miami where she was part of their drumline. As a kid, Torry played snare drum in her school\u2019s marching band.\n\nTorry Castellano had long red hair until she cut it short sometime around 2005-2006. There were rumors that Torry dyed her hair orange but this was not true. Torry Castellano got her first tattoo in 2003, the number \u201c14\u201d on her left wrist. She has since acquired many more tattoos. She states that she is very interested in art and its history, science, music, nature/wildlife, dreaming, magic and mythology.\n\nBefore playing drums she played guitar for a year. At first, the girls only had one drum set, so Castellano shared with Brad Bobst. They had two sets of drums once the band started to get serious. She went to Lynbrook High School in San Jose, California where she graduated with the class of 1997. After high school, she attended UCLA before dropping out to pursue her music career.\n\nDuring her time in The Donnas, Torry recorded seven studio albums, two EPs, and one DVD. Her favorite songs to play in the band were \u201cYou Make Me Hot\u201d (from Pins and Needles), \u201cToo Bad About Your Girl\u201d (from American Teenage Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Machine), and \u201cFall Behind Me\u201d, which she wrote.\n\nThe Donnas bandmate, Brett Anderson, said that Castellano\u2019s look was not that of a \u201cpunk-rock girl\u201d and it took her time to develop that edge needed in the band. The Donnas announced on their official website on July 8, 2010, that Torry Castellano had left the group due to wanting to spend more time with her family and her injury. On July 23, 2010, she announced on her blog that she was leaving The Donnas to pursue a career in photography.\n\nTorry Castellano Projects\n\nLate in September 2010, Torry began working as a photographer at Rolling Stone magazine. She is the first female staff photographer for the magazine and one of only six women to have ever been a staff photographer there.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, Torry released her first book of photos, \u201cTaken By Torry\u201d. The book features 200 images of celebrities like Katy Perry, Paris Hilton, Eminem, and Jessica Simpson.\n\nTorry Castellano was interviewed for the 30 Days Out documentary of The Replacements reunion tour. She expressed her love for The Replacements and how they have been an influence on Torry over her career as a drummer.\n\nAt the age of 21, Torry Castellano purchased a house with her brother, Christian Castellano. They have both lived there since, and it is still being rented out to new tenants.\n\nTorry Castellano has two sons with her husband Michael Stagliano (who is a contestant on season 8 of the show The Bachelorette). Torry\u2019s second son was born in September 2008. Torry Castellano\n\nTorry Castellano Performing\n\nTorry Castellano Retired from The Donna\n\nCastellano announced on the band\u2019s website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas on July 9, 2010. It\u2019s quite big news.\n\nAlthough she decided to retire from The Donna, Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band."}, {"url": "https://www.moderndrummer.com/2008/01/torry-castellano-2/", "page_content": "Torry Castellano: The Grip Of Death\n\nAlthough Donnas drummer Torry Castellano still encourages the idea of being a self-taught musician, she\u2019s quick to admit that she had to learn the hard way that improper technique can cause serious problems. A few years ago after a bout with tendinitis rendered Torry out of commission for several months. After touring for over a year on her pop-punk band\u2019s 2002 release, Spend The Night, Castellano\u2019s problems became so severe that she had to undergo surgery and physical rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to physical therapy, they called it \u2018the grip of death,\u2019\u201d Torry recalls. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh no, you do that?\u2019 But it all ended up being really good. I learned a different technique, and I think I\u2019m a better drummer because of it. It\u2019s all about letting the stick do the work. That way you\u2019re not going crazy, holding the stick so tightly that you\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d\n\nBesides applying the new technique, Torry began doing warm-up exercises and reconfigured her four-piece Pearl kit. Since then she\u2019s successfully (read: pain-free) recorded and toured behind two more Donnas albums, including 2004\u2019s Gold Medal and their latest, the arena rock\u2013flavored Bitchin\u2019.\n\nCastellano credits producer Jay Ruston (Meatloaf, Polyphonic Spree) for helping to shape her performance on this latest recording. \u201cHe definitely encouraged that four-on-the-floor type beat,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich was a really good direction because I love that beat. But I was asking, \u2018Should I really put it in more than one song?\u2019 He was like, \u2018It sounds great.\u2019 And when we play those songs live, the rhythm really gets into people.\u201d\n\nWaleed Rashidi"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Torry_Castellano", "page_content": "What we do.

During her recovery, she had to take drum lessons to re-learn to hold drum sticks the correct way.[4] For Gold Medal, she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time.\n\nA shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008 at the House Of Blues in Anaheim, California. Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band, Greatest Hits Vol. 16.\n\nShe attended Santa Monica College before transferring to Stanford University, majoring in political science.[5] Castellano graduated from Stanford with distinction and attended Harvard Law School.[6] While at Harvard, she interned for Adalah,[7] Habeas Corpus Research Center, and Article 36. [8] As a Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellow at Harvard, she designed a legal research project on the way cracks in domestic and international legal frameworks lead to a deprivation of rights for the residents of areas that are de facto no man\u2019s land, created by protracted conflicts, focusing on East Jerusalem and eastern Ukraine. She interviewed key human rights attorneys working to protect human and civil rights, Israeli government officials, and local residents in the Kafr Aqab neighborhood.[8]\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Torry%20Castellano", "page_content": "Torry Castellano\n\ndr, bvoc, perc, *1979 US, San Francisco\n\nMusician of Rock and Alternative\n\nA.k.a.

Torry began playing drums when she was young and continued playing them until she was twenty-one years old. Torry then played bass in many early rock bands before going solo and discovering her true singing talent. She has been described as a very talented \u201cfolk artist\u201d due to her interesting vocal style which incorporates a range of tones and pitch variations. Torry has also opened for numerous popular musicians including George Harrison, Eric Clapton and Johnny Jenkins.\n\nTorry Castellano has made twenty-four studio albums and twelve self-written songs. One of her most popular songs \u201cDonna Jane\u201d from her album \u201cTroublemaker\u201d was inspired by the death of her friend and fellow musician Patti LaBelle. This song became a huge hit for Torry and is still currently being used in many schools and churches to this day. Torry Castellano also appeared in the movie \u201cThe Social Network\u201d as an attractive and sexy lead character.\n\nTorry Castellano was previously a professional volleyball player.

She lost her ability to play volleyball due to carpal tunnel syndrome, but she has retained her love of sports and is still as passionate as ever. Torry has also drummed for some of the best known American percussionists such as Les Claypool, Paul McCartney, Pino Palladino, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea of the Bluegrass, Dave Matthews and Yngwie Malmsteen.

She states that she has always had long brown hair that is tied back. During our online interview, I noticed that Torry wears glasses and has light skin.

Consisting of Jack Conte \u201906 and Nataly Dawn \u201909, it all began when Dawn first opened up for Conte at the CoHo, as they explained in a recent performance at Bing Concert Hall. They made a splash in the music world when their first song,\u201dHail Mary,\u201d was featured on the front page of YouTube. Their unique music videos \u2013 which are designed to reflect transparency in the music-making process by showing all the instruments they use \u2013 and amiable, down-to-earth demeanors, compounded with their musical talent and eclectic instrumentation, make them an endearing couple to watch out for.\n\nJon Nakamatsu\n\nClassical pianist Jon Nakamatu \u201992 boasts an unlikely life story. Before becoming the first American since 1981 to receive the Gold Medal at the prestigious International Van Cliburn competition, he taught German at Saint Francis High School. Upon winning first prize in 1997, Nakamatsu became an instant rock star in the classical music world, despite never studying music, either at a conservatory or at Stanford. A flurry of performances followed, with Nakamatsu touring extensively throughout North and South America, as well as Europe. Recording with Harmonia Mundi USA, he has released 13 CDs and continues to maintain a busy performing schedule today, including a not-to-be-missed visit to Stanford in March. Nakamatsu received his BA in German Studies in 1991 and master\u2019s degree in education in 1992 at Stanford, but in his heart he knew he belonged in the concert hall. \u201cMusic,\u201d he said in a Web Concert Hall interview, \u201cwas my ultimate goal.\u201d\n\nTorry Castellano of The Donnas\n\nTorry Castellano \u201913 came to Stanford already having had a successful run in the music industry as the drummer for the all-female rock band The Donnas.

After several successful albums and tours, a shoulder injury forced Torry to retire from drumming.

In an interview with The Daily a few years back, he explained how gratifying it is \u201c[to] just be able to travel around the world and play shows to people [whom] we\u2019ve never seen or met, who don\u2019t even speak our language.\u201d\n\nMikel Jollett of The Airborne Toxic Event\n\nBefore becoming lead singer of alternative rock band The Airborne Toxic Event, Mikel Jollett \u201996 graduated from Stanford with a degree in psychology. Born out of a dark period in his life when his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and Jollett with an autoimmune disease, The Airborne Toxic Event was formed in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silverlake. Since their formation, the band has played several headlining tours, as well as Coachella and Lollapalooza.

The Donnas announced on their official website on July 8, 2010, that Torry Castellano had left the group due to wanting to spend more time with her family and her injury. On July 23, 2010, she announced on her blog that she was leaving The Donnas to pursue a career in photography.\n\nTorry Castellano Projects\n\nLate in September 2010, Torry began working as a photographer at Rolling Stone magazine. She is the first female staff photographer for the magazine and one of only six women to have ever been a staff photographer there.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, Torry released her first book of photos, \u201cTaken By Torry\u201d. The book features 200 images of celebrities like Katy Perry, Paris Hilton, Eminem, and Jessica Simpson.\n\nTorry Castellano was interviewed for the 30 Days Out documentary of The Replacements reunion tour. She expressed her love for The Replacements and how they have been an influence on Torry over her career as a drummer.\n\nAt the age of 21, Torry Castellano purchased a house with her brother, Christian Castellano. They have both lived there since, and it is still being rented out to new tenants.\n\nTorry Castellano has two sons with her husband Michael Stagliano (who is a contestant on season 8 of the show The Bachelorette).

A few years ago after a bout with tendinitis rendered Torry out of commission for several months. After touring for over a year on her pop-punk band\u2019s 2002 release, Spend The Night, Castellano\u2019s problems became so severe that she had to undergo surgery and physical rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to physical therapy, they called it \u2018the grip of death,\u2019\u201d Torry recalls. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh no, you do that?\u2019 But it all ended up being really good. I learned a different technique, and I think I\u2019m a better drummer because of it. It\u2019s all about letting the stick do the work. That way you\u2019re not going crazy, holding the stick so tightly that you\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d\n\nBesides applying the new technique, Torry began doing warm-up exercises and reconfigured her four-piece Pearl kit. Since then she\u2019s successfully (read: pain-free) recorded and toured behind two more Donnas albums, including 2004\u2019s Gold Medal and their latest, the arena rock\u2013flavored Bitchin\u2019.\n\nCastellano credits producer Jay Ruston (Meatloaf, Polyphonic Spree) for helping to shape her performance on this latest recording. \u201cHe definitely encouraged that four-on-the-floor type beat,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich was a really good direction because I love that beat. But I was asking, \u2018Should I really put it in more than one song?\u2019 He was like, \u2018It sounds great.\u2019 And when we play those songs live, the rhythm really gets into people.\u201d\n\nWaleed Rashidi"}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Torry%20Castellano", "page_content": "Torry Castellano\n\ndr, bvoc, perc, *1979 US, San Francisco\n\nMusician of Rock and Alternative\n\nA.k.a.

There was a collection of songs that would push the quartet beyond their Ramones-meet-AC/DC soundscape, and time was booked at a high-end Los Angeles studio, with the renowned Scott Litt producing the sessions. But that\u2019s when things got a little tricky.\n\n\u201cWe took meetings with a bunch of people, picked one producer [Litt] and started pre-production with him and moved down to L.A. [from the Bay Area],\u201d explains bassist Maya Ford, formerly known as Donna F. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work out, so we ended up not working with him. We had a lot of meetings and he was really cool. We love R.E.M., and so everything he said, he sounded like he would be really great to work with, but then when it came down to it, our ideas didn\u2019t match. He was going for a different sound than we were going for and he didn\u2019t get our references. We didn\u2019t understand each other.\u201d\n\nThe clock was ticking and the band had to find a producer quickly. Fortunately, Butch Walker, fresh from successful sessions with Avril Lavigne, was available to meet the band. \u201cWe had four or five people to pick from and we had meetings. We just liked Butch the best. He was just really nice and easy to talk to,\u201d Ford recalls. \u201cWe were really looking for someone who we\u2019d be comfortable with who would be like our friend \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t be mean to us if we didn\u2019t understand them and wouldn\u2019t get their feelings hurt if we didn\u2019t like their idea. And he\u2019s young and cute and funny. We weren\u2019t looking for for some crazy producer who was a visionary.\u201d\n\nFor Walker, who cops to being a lifer with the band, it was a good match. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about [what happened with Litt]. I never really got into it too much with the girls, but, obviously, there was some sort of falling out and it just didn\u2019t work out. They had to kind of go into make-a-record mode real quick with somebody and they didn\u2019t want to go in blind. I think after I met with them, we all vibed on the kind of record they wanted. I knew what kind of growth record they wanted to make and I knew they were at that stage of their career where they needed to do it. We all liked the same records growing up and so we sat there and mainly just talked about songs and bands that we like and what we wanted to achieve from some of those influences. I think that\u2019s what locked us in.\u201d\n\nOnce the match was set, singer Brett Anderson (Donna A.), guitarist Allison Robertson (Donna R.), drummer Torry Castellano (Donna C.), Ford and Walker got busy in pre-production. \u201cWe pretty much did it the way I like to do it, which is listening to the arrangements, changing a few of those things around and maybe discussing drum patterns and things like that,\u201d Walker says. \u201cThe things that are the core of the song so that we don\u2019t have to sit there and focus on the things that happen later in the session, like vocals. I tend to be pickier than most people about the melodies and harmonies and stuff like that; generally, most people would be about getting a kick drum sound. At the end of the day a kick drum sound is not going to affect sales. Let\u2019s hope not. There seems to be a lot of engineer/producers out there that would disagree with you on that. But I don\u2019t come from that school.\u201d\n\nTo get the sessions started, Walker, the band and engineer Paul David Hager went into Black in Back, a studio owned by American Hi-Fi bandmates Stacy Jones and Jamie Arentzen. (The same studio was once owned by former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson, and it\u2019s where R.E.M. recorded \u201cMan on the Moon.\u201d) \u201cIt\u2019s a small studio with a great drum room, a pile of mic pre\u2019s and a Pro Tools|HD rig,\u201d Hager says. The team then moved to Conway Recording Studios, but kept all the sessions in Pro Tools to make sure things went quickly. \u201cWe were trying to do 14 songs in four weeks,\u201d Hager explains.\n\nLike so many contemporary projects, this one employed a number of plug-ins and an assortment of outboard gear. Hager explains, for instance, that Anderson\u2019s vocal chain went from a Shure SM7 into a Chandler EMI 2-channel preamp into a GML EQ and then a vintage 1176. (When they moved to Conway, the chain changed with a 1081 mic preamp.) Hager notes that very little pitch correction was used. \u201cMaybe for a note here or there, but she sang really well. We tried to get enough takes of her singing that if she sang something a little flat, we could find something someplace else,\u201d he reports. \u201cA note really has to be bad for you to want to fix it. If you tune the vocals perfectly, especially with guitar bands, then your guitars sound out-of-tune. Guitars will resonate in a certain way, especially electric guitars with distortion, and they aren\u2019t going to be in perfect pitch. A lot of records nowadays sound like someone tuned the vocals pitch perfect and then everything else kind of sounds a little out-of-tune. There is no such thing as Auto-Tune for guitars.\u201d\n\nBackground vocals were recorded through a Telefunken 251 with the rest of the chain the same as Anderson\u2019s. The mic choice was crucial. \u201cIt kept the character of the voice different from the lead vocal,\u201d Hager explains. \u201cIf you start using the same mic, sometimes you get a lot of the same frequencies poking out.\u201d\n\nRobertson\u2019s guitars \u2014 an assortment of \u201960s-era Gibson Les Pauls and SGs \u2014 were run through a couple of Marshall cabinets. One of the cabinets was miked with a Royer 121, a Shure SM57 and a Neumann U87, and the second was miked with the 121, a 251 and an SM57. \u201cI would blend them,\u201d Hager says. \u201cSometimes it would just be the Royer, sometimes it would be all of them, and we always tracked a room mic [an 87]. It just added some ambience, especially if there was a place where the drums stopped and it was just a guitar riff for a second. Then you could bring that up. Whether Chris [Lord-Alge, who mixed the album] used it or not, I don\u2019t know. You never know with Chris.\u201d Robertson used a pair of different amp heads \u2014 a vintage Marshall and a rare White model. At times, Hager adds, Robertson\u2019s guitars went through a Fender Vibrolux: \u201cWe would run that through a Marshall cabinet. An amp running 4 ohms going into 16 ohms crunched it up a little more.\u201d\n\nThe bass tracks provided by Ford were run through an Evil Twin DI into a Lang EQ and an 1176. \u201cOnce I got her takes down and everything was where it should be, then I\u2019d re-amp it later through an Ampeg SVT, just to give it something different from the DI. It was just another option,\u201d he says. The SVT was miked either with a FET 47 or a Sennheiser 421.\n\nOne factor that the team had to take into consideration when they went in to record the album was an injury that drummer Castellano suffered over the summer of 2003. She underwent surgery in the fall of that year and her recovery ran into the sessions, so the band tracked all of their parts before she laid down anything other than a temp track. Hager\u2019s miking technique for the drums included a pair of AKG C-12s overhead; a D-12 inside the kick drum, an NS-10 on the outside and a FET 47 further out from the kick; a 57 and 451 on top of the snare and a Sennheiser 441 underneath; and Neumann KM54s on the toms. Hager put an SM7 on the hi-hat and used a pair of 251s and a C-24 behind Castellano\u2019s head for room tones.\n\nHager also sings the praises of some other \u201ctoys\u201d he used on The Donnas\u2019 sessions, such as a Shure Level Lock compressor that he purchased three years ago on eBay. \u201cI could never get the damn thing to work and it became a pet project [for the engineers at Conway]. By the time we got to the last song, \u2018Gold Medal,\u2019 they got it to work,\u201d he says. He also used Crane Song\u2019s TDM Phoenix plug-in liberally throughout the recording. \u201cIt kind of does this tape emulation thing that\u2019s hard to explain. It definitely adds apparent loudness to things that tape would normally do, but it gives you control. On each channel, you can dial in the amount of it you want instead of using analog tape where you get that sound on all 24 tracks or whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cThis made the overhead mics a little clearer and gave the kick and snare a little more saturation. Basically, I would put all the guitars, drums and vocals through that before it got to Pro Tools.\u201d\n\nFor Walker, this was a fairly straight-ahead affair and he knew from the start that the bandmembers were not interested in remaking any of their previous albums. \u201cThose were classic Donnas [records], and anybody that comes to this album saying, \u2018Man, Butch really destroyed and screwed up that band,\u2019 they\u2019re going to have to answer to the band on that one. It was all their decision to go into this, evolve musically the way they have with this record, which is slower tempos, big grooves, more interesting progressions and, God forbid, minor key songs,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cThere are a couple of ballads, but nothing Bon Jovi-ish. It\u2019s all pretty cool, almost Beatles-like stuff. Like \u2018Revolver\u2019 [The Donnas\u2019 song, not The Beatles\u2019 album] and \u2018Is That All You\u2019ve Got for Me\u2019 are songs that have a new sound. \u2018Gold Medal\u2019 sounds like Revolver-era Beatles, which is great. You know what else is great? These girls are smart, and if that\u2019s their influence, they\u2019ll call it out in a minute. They don\u2019t just look at The Ramones and AC/DC. They know what they are doing.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/torry.castellano/1793915", "page_content": "Torry Castellano\n\nmusician\n\nJanuary 8, 1979 San Francisco, California, United States of America\n\nShe met future bandmates Maya Ford, Brett Anderson and Allison Robertson in junior high school.
