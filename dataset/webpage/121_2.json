Bullard remained the majority owner until this winter, when Ron Cain increased his stake in the team and, shortly thereafter, took over CEO duties from Petrovek, who remained president of business development.\n\nChurch said he believes Petrovek retains his ownership stake. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not an owner,\u201d Church said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\nCalls to Petrovek, Cain and Bullard were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a prepared statement, Petrovek said, \u201cMy decision allows Ron to steer the ship on his own course and begin a new journey for the brand and our fans and sponsors as the team prepares for the 2014-15 season.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cain thanked Petrovek for his service.\n\n\u201cBrian is at the top of his game,\u201d Cain said. \u201cOur loss will be another\u2019s gain.\u201d\n\nCain lauded Petrovek\u2019s success in attracting the AHL all-star game to Portland in 2003 and 2010 and his involvement in civic and charitable organizations. Petrovek has served on the boards of Maine Medical Center, the United Way of Greater Portland and Portland\u2019s Downtown District.\n\nPetrovek was also the face and voice of the team\u2019s difficult and extended lease negotiations with trustees of the Cumberland County Civic Center in 2003, 2010 and 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it three more years,\u201d he said after grudgingly signing a 2003 agreement. \u201cWe will not play in the building three years from now unless it has been renovated or the economic terms are different.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Petrovek flirted with moving the franchise to Albany, N.Y., before agreeing to a two-year extension. After voters approved a $33 million bond in 2011 to renovate the civic center, its trustees reached an agreement with the Pirates on a one-year lease with an eye toward a longer-term deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a deal, which seemed to be imminent in April 2013, fell apart in August. In September, the team filed a lawsuit and then announced that its entire 38-game home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\n\u201cWith any sports team, there\u2019s a certain amount of friction around the guy who\u2019s the face of the organization,\u201d said Chris Hall, CEO of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cCertainly, the last year and a half has been difficult, but people should reflect on all the good years and the contributions. The city of Portland is well known as a great minor-league sports town. Well, one of the reasons is because of people like Brian Petrovek.\u201d\n\nThe first few months in Lewiston included three sellouts and an average attendance of more than 2,600 fans. The Pirates won a franchise-low 10 \u201chome\u201d games. They ended the season with a 10-game losing streak and an average attendance of 2,185 \u2013 the only one of 30 AHL franchises below 3,000.\n\nA new five-year lease with the civic center was announced in February, after Cain became majority owner and the Pirates dropped their lawsuit against the county-owned facility.\n\n\u201cRon, Lyman and I started talking more definitively about the opportunity and need for change as the ink dried on a new long-term lease with the civic center and the completion of the renovation project,\u201d Petrovek said in his statement.\n\nNeal Pratt, chairman of the civic center\u2019s board of trustees, said he and Petrovek often disagreed, but their relations were never disagreeable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrian was always a zealous advocate for the team and a tireless promoter of the Pirates brand,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cHe tried to do what was best for his team and his business and I respect that and wish him well.\u201d\n\nPratt said the list of Petrovek\u2019s charitable efforts is impressive.\n\n\u201cHe has done a lot of volunteer work for the community,\u201d Pratt said, \u201cand I think he should be recognized for that.\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, Petrovek pleaded guilty to operating under the influence as part of a deal to avoid jail time after he crashed his Jeep Wrangler into the concrete barrier on Spring Street in Portland. His blood-alcohol content was measured at three times the legal limit for driving.\n\n\u201cWhat his legacy will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Church. \u201cMy hope is that people look at the big picture and recognize all the good that has come with his leadership of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn another, unrelated change, the Pirates lost their general manager Monday when Brad Treliving, former assistant GM of their parent NHL club, the Phoenix Coyotes, was hired as GM of the NHL\u2019s Calgary Flames.\n\nGlenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: GlennJordanPPH"}]}
