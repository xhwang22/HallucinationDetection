{"Joe Brown began his professional baseball career in 1906 with the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League.": [{"url": "https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/st-louis-stars-st-louis-giants-1906-1943/", "page_content": "The St. Louis Stars were a Negro League Baseball team that originally played independently, but later joined the National Negro League (NNL). The team\u2019s original name was the St. Louis Giants, and it was formed in 1906 by African American bank messenger and baseball fan, Charles A. Mills. Mills was successful in his attempt to approach ballpark owner Conrad Keubler to invest in a local team called the Leland Giants. Former Leland Giants third baseman Dick Wallace became the new team\u2019s manager, and during his tenure, Wallace assembled a core group of veteran players. He signed first basemen Ben Taylor and Tullie McAdoo, shortstop Joe Hewitt, catcher/ outfielder Sam Bennett, pitchers Bill Drake and Bill Gatewood, and outfielders Charles Blackwell and Jimmie Lyons.\n\nThe St. Louis Giants won the 1912 and 1913 St. Louis City League Championships but were unable to beat the top ranked Indianapolis ABC\u2019s and the Chicago American Giants in the western championship in the following years. By 1920, the Giants finished sixth in an eight-team league, with a 25-32 record. The team, now in the newly formed National Negro League, acquired star center fielder Oscar Charleston in 1921 and he helped the Giants surge to second place with a 40-28 record. After the 1921 season, team owner Mills sold the team to Dick Kent and Dr. Sam Sheppard who renamed it the St. Louis Stars. The Stars played in Stars Park, one of the few facilities built especially for a Negro League team.\n\nThe Stars inherited most of the Giants roster with the exception of Charleston. It dropped to fourth place in 1922, with a 35-26 record, and in 1923 the team fell to sixth place, with a 28-44 record. Later in the year the team acquired several players from the Toledo Tigers, as well as new manager and third baseman Candy Jim Taylor. Taylor later brought in left-handed pitcher Cool Papa Bell, first baseman Mule Suttles, shortstop Willie Wells, and pitcher Ted Trent. By 1924, the team rose to fourth place in the league, at 42-34, and by the following year they rose to second place, with a 38-12 record. Taylor left in 1926, and the team fell to 49-30, in third place. Taylor returned to the team in 1927, bringing the Giants back to firth place in 1928, with a 66-26 record. The team won two more pennants before folding with the NNL in 1931."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/St-Louis-Cardinals", "page_content": "St. Louis Cardinals, American professional baseball team established in 1882 that plays in the National League (NL). Based in St. Louis, Missouri, the Cardinals have won 11 World Series titles and 23 league pennants. Second only to the New York Yankees in World Series championships, St. Louis is the oldest major league team west of the Mississippi River and one of baseball\u2019s most consistently successful franchises.\n\nOriginally known as the Brown Stockings (1882) and the Browns (1883\u201398) and playing in the American Association (AA), the franchise met with almost immediate success, winning four consecutive AA pennants from 1885 to 1888. In 1892 the team moved to the NL, where it struggled, finishing in last or second to last place in five of their first seven seasons in the new league. In 1900 the franchise became known as the Cardinals after one year with the nickname \u201cPerfectos.\u201d The team continued to play poorly through the first two decades of the 20th century, but in 1915 it added future Hall of Fame infielder Rogers Hornsby, who sparked a Cardinals turnaround. In 1926 Hornsby guided the team to its first pennant in 38 years and a berth in the World Series, where the \u201cCards\u201d defeated the New York Yankees in seven games. Another all-time great infielder, Frankie Frisch, led the Cardinals to three World Series appearances between 1928 and 1931, including one series win (1931). In 1934 future Hall of Fame pitcher Dizzy Dean won 30 games (and his brother Paul won 19) for a charismatic World Series-winning Cardinals team with a rough-and-tumble style that earned it the nickname \u201cthe Gashouse Gang.\u201d\n\nBritannica Quiz Great Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nIn 1941 Stan Musial joined the club. Musial became arguably the Cardinals\u2019 most beloved star, playing 22 seasons in St. Louis and leading the team during the most successful period in franchise history. The Cardinals teams of the 1940s finished first or second in the NL standings in every year of the decade save one. They appeared in four World Series over that span and won three of them (1942, 1944, 1946), the last of which was famous for outfielder Enos Slaughter breaking an eighth-inning tie with the Boston Red Sox in the deciding seventh game by scoring from first base on a line drive over the shortstop\u2019s head\u2014a tremendous demonstration of hustle that became known as the \u201cMad Dash.\u201d\n\nAfter a period of relative decline in the 1950s, the 1960s brought another Cardinals renaissance. Led by the dynamic pitching of Bob Gibson and the speedy Lou Brock, the Cardinals played in three seven-game World Series in the decade, with their series wins in 1964 and 1967 coming against the Yankees and the Red Sox, respectively. The Cardinals\u2019 1964 championship was notable for ending the Yankees\u2019 remarkable mid-century dynasty that saw the New York team win 14 pennants in 16 seasons. In 1966 the team moved into Busch Memorial Stadium (renamed Busch Stadium in 1982), which would serve as the franchise\u2019s home until 2005. The team began to play in a new ballpark, also called Busch Stadium, in 2006. In 1970 the Cardinals traded away outfielder Curt Flood, who then sued Major League Baseball to challenge the club\u2019s ability to trade him without his permission, which later led to the establishment of free agency. The outstanding defensive shortstop Ozzie Smith joined the team in 1982 and helped them win the World Series in his first year in St. Louis. Smith\u2019s Cardinal teams returned twice more to the World Series in the 1980s, losing both times.\n\nIn 1996 the Cardinals hired manager Tony La Russa, who would go on to become the winningest manager in team history. The following year, St. Louis added slugger Mark McGwire, whose chase of the single-season home run record in 1998 made him a local icon (though allegations of steroid use would later damage his reputation among Cardinal fans). Superstar slugger Albert Pujols joined the team in 2001 and led them to a return to the World Series in 2004, which was a sweep at the hands of the resurgent Red Sox. In 2006 an underdog Cardinals squad advanced to the World Series, where it easily defeated the favoured Detroit Tigers to become the champion with the lowest regular-season winning percentage in baseball history, after having posted a win-loss record of 83\u201379.\n\nThe Cardinals made just one postseason appearance between 2007 and 2010, a Division Series loss in 2009, but in 2011 St. Louis staged a remarkable comeback to advance to the playoffs after trailing the Atlanta Braves by 8 1/2 games in the Wild Card standings with just a month left in the regular season. The Cardinals then upset both the Philadelphia Phillies and the Milwaukee Brewers in the postseason to advance to the World Series. There St. Louis defeated the Texas Rangers in a dramatic seven-game series that included an 11-inning game six in which the Cardinals twice came within one strike of losing the World Series before getting timely hits to extend\u2014and eventually win\u2014the contest.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The team\u2019s run of success continued in 2014 with another division title and a berth in the NLCS (a five-game loss to the Giants). After setting a franchise record with its fifth straight postseason berth in 2015, the Cardinals failed to reach the playoffs in 2016. The team then posted a series of winning seasons that failed to result in a postseason berth until 2019, when St. Louis captured a division title and advanced to the NLCS, where the team was swept by the Washington Nationals. The Cardinals also qualified for the playoffs in the 2020 and 2021 seasons\u2014the former of which was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014but both times the team lost in the Wild Card round."}, {"url": "https://sabr.org/journal/article/joe-e-brown-a-clown-prince-of-baseball/", "page_content": "This article was written by Rob Edelman\n\nThis article was published in The National Pastime (Volume 27, 2007)\n\nYou will not find Joe E. Brown\u2019s name in a major league box score. But in his way, he is as much a part of baseball lore as the Gas House Gang, the Whiz Kids, and the House That Ruth Built.\n\nJoe E. Brown was a movie star: a wide-mouthed co\u00ad median whose face was his fortune. The zenith of his popularity came in the 1930s, when he appeared in a se\u00adries of hit comedies produced by Warner Bros. Three of them-Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer the Great (1933), and Alibi Ike (1935)-featured Joe E. as comical baseball players. Moreover, Brown was around the game all his life. He played baseball. He loved baseball. And he was a vigorous proponent of the game.\n\nJoseph Evan Brown was born on July 28, 1892, in Holgate, a small town in northwestern Ohio. His parents were warm and loving but desperately poor, and young Joe E. was determined to abandon his roots and embrace a life of adventure. \u201cI remember when I was a little guy going to school, stopping to look at a big 24-inch sheet announcing the arrival of the circus,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cAnother boy was with me. I pointed to the aerial act and said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u2019 I remember it clearly. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to be.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u201d\u2018\n\nAnd so, at the age of nine, Joe E. lived out what for other youngsters would be a storybook fantasy as he left home to join the circus. He became the junior member of The Five Marvelous Ashtons, an acrobatic act that toured the country performing under big tops and in vaudeville theaters. He earned $1.50 a week for the honor of being tossed through the air, and often being bloodied. As he grew into adolescence, Brown developed into a solidly proficient acrobat. While playing a date in San Francisco, he experienced firsthand the 1906 earthquake. It was around this time that he linked up with acrobats Tommy Bell and Frank Prevost and became the junior member of the Bell-Prevost Trio, a vaudeville act.\n\nDuring this period Brown managed to play baseball whenever he could. He wrote in his autobiography, Laughter Is a Wonderful Thing, that his passion for the game \u201cpredates my first days at school, of that I\u2019 m sure, so it probably began when I learned to walk.\u201d In his youth, he explained, he\n\nbegan haunting the knotholes around big league ball parks when 1 wasn\u2019t on stage or practicing. And in the spring, after a season of sore ankles, skinned wrists, and broken legs, baseball as a career held more than a casual interest for me.\n\nIn 1908, Brown decided that he would seek summer employment as a ballplayer. Tim Flood, manager of the St. Paul Saints in the American Association, signed him as a second sacker, but his season ended abruptly when he broke his leg while sliding into third base. During the next few summers he played for various semipro teams in the Toledo, OH, area, including the Crowley All-Stars, Young Avondales, and Needham\u2019s All-Stars. One of the many baseball-related photos printed in his autobiography features a serious-looking Brown, with arms folded, garbed in a Crowley All-Stars uniform and posing with a dozen teammates.\n\nIn 1911, when he was 19, Brown was offered a Boston Red Sox contract. At the time, he also had a lucrative offer to appear in a burlesque show. He already had spent a decade in show business, and realized that his best chance for long-term success was on the stage. So burlesque won out over baseball.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1915, Brown wed Kathryn Frances McGraw. The couple eventually became the parents of two sons and two adopted daughters. As Joe E. now had a family to support, his career choice was appropriate given his now-steady employment on the stage. By this time, he had morphed from acrobat to comic actor. On occasion, he even incorporated baseball into his stage act. The New York Times described one such routine, in which \u201ca young pitcher [is] harried by batters, umpires and base runners.\u201d Brown often quipped that he\n\nonce had a major league job. The manager wanted me to play third base. He said that ifT couldn\u2019t reach the ball with my hands, I would open my mouth and catch it between my teeth. I tried it once and darn near swallowed the ball.\n\nHis Great White Way debut came in Jim Jam Jems (1920), and he spent the decade as a headliner appearing on Broadway and touring in stage shows. But he was not through playing baseball. In 1920, Brown worked out and appeared in exhibition games with the Red Sox.\n\nThroughout his career, newspaper or magazine pro\u00ad files of Brown invariably cited his love of baseball-and his talent for playing the game. As far back as March 1921, the Boston Globe reported that Brown \u201chas recently received an offer from the New York Americans to play with the team this year.\u201d The actor added,\n\nAt one time I played [semipro ball in Toledo], but an accident to my arm made it necessary for me to give it up. Since then I have received many offers to go back into baseball but it would be rather foolish alter I had started a successful career on the stage.\n\nWhile a fine athlete \u2014 his athleticism is ever apparent in his baseball films, as he tosses balls and belts line drives without the aid of special effects or body dou\u00adbles \u2014 it is debatable whether Brown possessed the talent to sustain a major league career. During a moment of candor in a 1937 interview, he even admitted, \u201c[There] are a lot of stories about my baseball playing, but most of my big-league experiences happened in the imagina\u00adtion of various writers.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s celebrity status, however, did allow him to maintain his insider access to major leaguers. On April 18, 1922, the Boston Globe reported, \u201cThe Red Sox and Yankees occupied boxes last night at \u2018Greenwich Village Follies\u2019 at the Shubert Theatre as guests of Joe E. Brown, the principal comedian in the show.\u201d The item concluded by noting that Brown \u201cwas formerly a profes\u00adsional baseball player.\u201d\n\nBy this time Brown\u2019s calling card was his face rather than his physical aptitude. A Boston Globe profile of the comic began: \u2018\u201dDid you ever see anything so funny as that man\u2019s expression,\u2019 exclaimed a woman in the audi\u00adence at the Wilbur Theatre\u2026 as she gazed upward at Joe E. Brown, comedian of\u2019 Jim Jam Jems.\u201d\u2018 The article continued, \u201cHe has a comic style particularly his own, and not the least part of his success is the expression of his countenance. He doesn\u2019t have to say a word to get a laugh.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the nature of Brown\u2019s comedy primarily was physical-and it was a wonder that he did not become a silent cinema comedian. His screen debut did not come until the dawn of the sound era, in Crooks Can\u2019t Win (1928), an inauspicious melodrama. He quickly established himself, however, upon signing a Warner Bros. contract and appearing in a series of come\u00ad dies in which he alternately played two character types, both of whom were rubes. One was self-centered, with a mouth that was figuratively and literally big. The other was more shy and naive.\n\nBrown\u2019s three baseball films were especially popular. The first was Fireman, Save My Child, in which he starred as \u201cSmokey\u201d Joe Grant, an absentminded, Rube Waddell\u00ad like small-town firefighter whose pitching prowess earns him a spot with the St. Louis Cardinals. Just as he was starting his screen career, Brown had been cast in the road production of Elmer the Great, Ring Lardner and George M. Cohan\u2019s stage comedy about a none-too\u00ad bright hurler (originally played by Walter Huston) which opened on Broadway in 1928. Jack Oakie starred in the first screen version, titled Fast Company (1929). Brown was tapped for the remake, in which his character, Elmer Kane, is a small-town rube/home run hitter who plays for the Chicago Cubs and falls for a flighty actress. Finally, in Alibi Ike, Brown played Frank X. Farrell, a fireballing Cubs rookie right hander who is as brash and overconfident as he is talented.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. decided to sign him to a contract, Brown asked the studio to provide him with his own baseball team. It was written into his contract that Warner Bros. would pay for the team\u2019s uniforms, equip\u00adment, and travel expenses. The ball club was named Joe E. Brown\u2019s First National All-Stars; it consisted of studio employees and former professional players, and was pitted against all-star, semipro, college, and Negro League nines up and down the Pacific Coast. Decades later, Brown described the contract as a \u201cpip.\u201d\n\nAs he settled into his Hollywood lifestyle, the come\u00addian was at the epicenter of Southern California baseball. In February 1932, he and Buster Keaton-another screen star whose love for baseball was legendary-were involved in an all-star fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Olympic games. Over 8,500 fans packed Wrigley Field to see the Joe E. Browns defeat the Buster Keatons, 10-3. Rogers Hornsby, Gabby Hartnett, Paul and Lloyd Waner, Sam Crawford, Billy Jurges, Stan Hack, Tris Speaker, Dave Bancroft, Carl Hubbell, Charlie Root, Pat Malone, Johnny Moore, and Pie Traynor were a few of the big leaguers who participated.\n\nBrown also was instrumental in getting his baseball pals parts in movies. Frank Shellenback had a supporting role in Fireman, Save My Child; Shellenback and a roster full of ballplayers (Herman \u201cHi\u201d Bell, Guy Cantrell, Dick Cox, Cedric Durst, Ray French, Mike Gazella, Wally Hebert, Wally Hood, Don Hurst, Smead Jolley, Lou Koupal, Wes Kingdon, Jim Levey, Bob Meusel, Wally Rehg, Jim Thorpe, and Ed Wells) appear as big leaguers in Alibi Ike.\n\nIn 1934, a Los Angeles Times reporter asked Brown, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really ask Dizzy and Daffy Dean to accept a picture contract, did you?\u201d His response:\n\nWhy not? They\u2019re fine boys, interesting, natural, lovely characters. When I was sitting next to Dizzy in Detroit [during the World Series], with the fans swarming around him for autographs, he whispered, \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? Five years ago I didn\u2019t even own a pair of shoes.\u201d They\u2019re not swell-headed. Besides, Warners wired me to ask them\u2026\n\nThe Dean boys soon were starring in Dizzy and Daffy (1934), a Warner Bros. two-reel comedy short in which Shemp Howard (of the Three Stooges fame) remarks, \u201cThe only Dean I ever heard of is Gunga.\u201d\n\nBrown also reportedly-and inadvertently-played a more direct role in the \u201934 series. According to the Los Angeles Times, Detroit hurler Schoolboy Rowe \u201ccaught part of his pitching hand in a door jamb\u2026and subse\u00adquently had the bruise aggravated by a hearty good-luck hand-shake from Joe E. Brown, the film comedian.\u201d\n\nFrom 1932 through 1935, Brown was a part owner of the American Association Kansas City Blues. In 1935, the rumor circulated that he was considering purchasing the Boston Braves, but this came to naught. Brown organized a semi pro basketball team whose roster was stocked with ex-UCLA Bruins. He owned racehorses, and often could be found at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, and other Southern California racetracks. His Beverly Hills home housed a trophy room for his rapidly growing collection of autographed baseballs, bats, caps, and other sports memorabilia. He accumulated hundreds of items, from lumber used by Babe Ruth and Nap Lajoie and a cap worn by Eddie Collins to a baseball autographed by England\u2019s King George V, a football jersey worn by Red Grange, Gene Tunney\u2019s and James J. Braddock\u2019s boxing trunks, and a first-edition copy of Henry Chadwick\u2019s 1868 book, The Game ofBase Ball, the initial hardcover baseball tome. Alas, most of the memorabilia was destroyed later in a house fire.\n\nDecades later, Brown recalled that upon learning that Lou Gehrig was about to retire, he wrote the Iron Horse to request the ballplayer\u2019s first baseman\u2019s glove for his collection. \u201cLou wrote back, asking me to name anything but that, and I understood but I felt bad about having asked,\u201d he explained.\n\nNot long afterward, he retired. In the fall of that year [ 1939] I went to New York to see the Yankees play in the World Series. Just before gametime a batboy came up to me and asked me to come to the Yankees\u2019 bench. Well-Lou was waiting there. He was very ill, by then, so thin and gaunt that I was startled at his appearance. But he smiled and held something out to me \u2014 it was his first baseman\u2019s glove. \u201cHere it is, pal,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Brown\u2019s popularity was waning. He left Warner Bros., appeared in some independent movies, and concluded his starring career in a series of low\u00ad budget Columbia Pictures comedies released in the late 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nBut Brown did not fade from the public eye. During World War II, he proved that his heart was as big as his mouth as he became one of the first Hollywood celebri\u00adties to volunteer to entertain the troops. Brown trekked to combat zones from North Africa to Italy, the Pacific is\u00ad lands to Australia and New Zealand, bringing laughter to the Gls. He once estimated that he had traveled over 200,000 air miles during the war. Ever the jokester, he quipped, \u201cWhen I opened my mouth in the South Pacific, 8,000 mosquitoes flew in.\u201d Even though he was a civil\u00adian, Brown reportedly was allowed to pack a carbine and ride in a tank while on Luzon, the Philippine island.\n\nFor his tirelessness in entertaining the troops, Brown was given a Bronze Star as well as a special citation, voted by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, for his \u201cmeritorious service.\u201d However, he and Kathryn person\u00ad ally felt the brunt of the war. Their eldest son, Don Evan Brown, a captain in the Army Air Corps, died at age 25 in October 1942, when his plane crashed near Palm Springs during a training exercise.\n\nIn 1945, as the war wound down, Brown signed to tour as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey, Mary Chase\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy. He opened in Chicago and eventually appeared in the play well over 1,000 times on stages from Broadway to Australia. He also returned to the screen, and gave a highly regarded dramatic per\u00adformance as a small-town minister in The Tender Years (1947). He was ideally cast as Cap\u2019n Andy in the second remake of Show Boat ( 1951), and gave what easily is his best-remembered performance as a loony millionaire in Billy Wilder\u2019s Some Like It Hot ( 1959). Here, as he slyly winks at the camera, Brown ardently romances Jack Lemmon\u2019s jazz musician-in-drag. His closing line\u00ad \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect\u201d-is one of the more famous in film history.\n\nBaseball, of course, remained an intrinsic part of his life. \u201cWhenever he doesn\u2019t have a matinee, he\u2019s at some sports event,\u201d noted sports columnist Braven Dyer in 1946, while Brown was performing Harvey in Chicago. From 1953 to 1964, he served as first president of the PONY League, comprising teams made up of 13- and 14-year-olds. Long a supporter of the UCLA Bruins baseball team, the school\u2019s Westwood ballyard was named \u201cJoe E. Brown Field.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1953 season, Brown conducted pre- and post-game interviews for the New York Yankees and did five innings of play-by-play-three on television, and two on the radio. Radio-television critic Warren Bennett wrote that Brown was \u201cas relaxed before the cameras as an old shoe. Shy, diffident ball players loosen up for him as they never did for his predecessor, the illustrious Joe DiMaggio.\u201d Brown told Bennett, \u201cWhat I want to do is talk to the baseball fan who loves the game so much he stands in line to get a good seat.\u201d\n\nIn l955, his 37-year-old son, Joe L. Brown, replaced Branch Rickey as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. But Joe E. remained firmly rooted in Southern California-and as the Dodgers abandoned Brooklyn for Los Angeles, he was well-suited to become a high-profile promoter of West Coast baseball. In October 1957, not long after the team played its final game at Ebbets Field, Brown was the master of ceremonies of a star-studded luncheon at Los Angeles\u2019 Statler Hotel, held in honor of the team.\n\nBrown was among the leaders in the battle for the \u201cYes\u201d vote that would approve the Dodgers\u2019 contract with the city of Los Angeles, and result in the construc\u00adtion of Dodger Stadium. He became general chairman of the Taxpayers Committee on Yes for Baseball, and pre\u00addicted that the Dodgers would lure baseball fans from far across the region-particularly if they competed in a spanking-new ballyard. The actor clearly was jockeying for support when he observed, near the start of the 1958 season, \u201cDodger President Walter O\u2019Malley hopes to admit 300,000 youngsters [free of charge] to Coliseum games this season, and will up the figure to 600,000 when the club builds its own stadium in Chavez Ravine.\u201d He added, \u201cThe boy whose idol is Duke Snider or Junior Gilliam can\u2019 t go very far wrong in his future life.\u201d\n\nJoe E. Brown quietly lived out the rest of his life. He died at age 81 on July 6, 1973, of pneumonia and heart failure. Kathryn, his wife of 58 years, survived him. Brown was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, which houses the remains of entertainment in\u00addustry legends from George Burns and Gracie Allen to Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, and Spencer Tracy.\n\nBrown\u2019s life may be summed up by the title of a classic Hollywood film, albeit one in which he did not appear: It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. \u201cThere\u2019s been tragedy, when we lost our boy,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cBut l\u2019ve had the chance given every other citizen in a free country of living my life as I wanted to live it and becoming what I wanted to become.\u201d\n\nROB EDELMAN most recently authored the box liner notes and an essay on early baseball films included on the DVD compilation Reel Baseball: Baseball Films from the Silent Era, 1899-1926.

Brown\n\nJoseph Evans Brown was an American actor and comedian, remembered for his amiable screen persona, comic timing, and enormous smile. In 1902 at the age of nine, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvellous Astons which toured the country on both the circus and vaudeville circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into Vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy into his act and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s first appearing in the musical comedy Jim Jam Jems.\n\nIn late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with Warner Bros. He quickly shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy On with the Show. He starred in a number of lavish Technicolor Warner Brothers musical comedies including: Sally, Hold Everything, and Song of the West. By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name began to appear alone above the title of the movies in which he appeared.\n\nHe followed in Fireman, Save My Child, a comedy in which he played a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, with Elmer, the Great with Patricia Ellis and Claire Dodd, and Alibi Ike with Olivia de Havilland, in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn 1933 he starred in Son of a Sailor with Jean Muir and Thelma Todd. In 1934, Brown starred in A Very Honorable Guy with Alice White and Robert Barrat, and in The Circus Clown again with Patricia Ellis and with Dorothy Burgess and with Maxine Doyle in Six-Day Bike Rider. Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played Francis Flute in the Max Reinhardt/William Dieterle film version of Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, and was highly praised for his performance. The following year saw Polo Joe with Carol Hughes and Richard \u201cSkeets\u201d Gallagher, and Sons O\u2019 Guns. In 1933 and 1936, he managed to become one of the top ten earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic Film Fun for twenty years from 1933."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/sports/baseball/19brown.html", "page_content": "Joe L.

The National Association of Amateur Base Ball Players rejected African American membership in 1867, and in 1876, owners of the professional National League adopted a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to keep Black players out. Subsequent African American players found their greatest opportunities with traveling teams until 1920, when Rube Foster launched the Negro National League. Reformulated several times with new leagues and owners, Negro League baseball enjoyed periods of success in the early 1920s and again after the Great Depression . However, Jackie Robinson \u2019s integration of baseball in 1947 prompted a slow but irreversible influx of talent to the majors, and the remaining Negro League teams generally folded by the 1960s.\n\nFormation of Baseball\u2019s Color Line\n\nAs the expanding popularity of baseball in the United States led to the formation of amateur clubs in the second half of the 19th century, African Americans were among those joining the action. Records exist of an abbreviated game between two Black teams as far back as 1855, and by the end of the decade there were several African American clubs in the New York area.\n\nHowever, the continued development of the sport led to attempts to exclude Black players from its highest ranks. In 1867, the National Association of Amateur Base Ball Players elected to reject applications from African American clubs. In 1876, the professional National League was formed by owners intent on keeping it a white man\u2019s game.\n\nRegardless, African Americans continued to play and even thrive at various levels of professional baseball. In 1884, catcher Moses Fleetwood Walker of the Toledo Blue Stockings became the first African American to play in what was then considered a major league. However, Walker and fellow African Americans often faced outright hostility and physical intimidation from both teammates and opponents. In one case, 19th-century superstar Cap Anson of the Chicago White Stockings threatened to cancel a game with Toledo if Walker was in the lineup.\n\nSeveral of the top Black players of the era, including infielders Frank Grant and Bud Fowler and pitcher George Stovey, relocated to the prominent International League playing in New York, New Jersey and southeast Canada. However, racial tensions persisted, and in 1887 African Americans were barred from signing new contracts in that circuit as well.\n\nBy the 1890s, Black players were increasingly facing exclusion from organized baseball and finding more opportunities with traveling teams. The Cuban Giants, formed in 1885 under the pretense of being dark-skinned Latin Americans, traversed the East in a private railroad car to play local squads. Fowler\u2019s Page Fence Giants enjoyed impressive success against both Black and white opponents, winning 118 of 154 games in 1895.\n\nThe close of the century brought an end to formal integrated baseball. In 1899, Bill Galloway appeared in five games for Woodstock, Ontario, of the Canadian League. Save for attempts to pass African Americans off as Spanish or Native American, there would be no more Black players in white professional leagues for more than four decades.\n\nRise of the Negro Leagues\n\nSegregation notwithstanding, Black players continued to find ways to foster high-level competition in major northern cities. The first \u201cColored Championship of the World\u201d was held in 1903, with pitcher Rube Foster leading the Cuban X-Giants to victory over the Philadelphia Giants.\n\nAttempts to establish an organized circuit sputtered on several occasions: The integrated International League of Independent Baseball endured a rocky season in 1906 before dissolving, and the planned National Negro Baseball League came and went in 1910 before a single game was played. Top teams like the Leland Giants of Chicago and the Lincoln Giants of New York enjoyed some staying power, but were often at the mercy of white booking agents who controlled access to large stadiums.\n\nRube Foster Founds The Negro National League\n\nA turning point for Black baseball came in 1920, when Rube Foster founded the Negro National League. It launched with eight teams: Chicago American Giants, Chicago Giants, Cuban Stars, Dayton Marcos, Detroit Stars, Kansas City Monarchs, Indianapolis ABCs and the St. Louis Giants.\n\nAn enterprise of Black ownership, its early financial success prompted the formation of the Eastern Colored League in 1923. The two circuits converged to play the World\u2019s Colored Championship in 1924, and continued the annual series until 1927.\n\nStability proved fleeting for the Negro Leagues, however, as players jumped from squad to squad in pursuit of the highest bidder, and teams skipped league games when a more lucrative exhibition offer surfaced. A vital leader was lost when Foster was institutionalized in 1926, and the Eastern Colored League folded in 1928. It reformulated as the American Negro League in 1929, but the Great Depression proved costly to professional Black baseball, with the Negro Southern League and a few strong independent clubs emerging as the only entities to survive the 1932 season.\n\nIn 1933, Pittsburgh Crawfords owner and numbers kingpin Gus Greenlee restarted the Negro National League. That year he introduced the East-West All-Star Game in Chicago, which became the sport\u2019s biggest annual event, attracting more than 50,000 fans at its peak.\n\nThe Negro Leagues enjoyed a resurgence of success thanks to the backing of owners who became rich through gambling and other illegal operations, as well as the dazzling performances of top players. Some, like catcher Josh Gibson, earned renown for hitting tremendous home runs, but Black baseball primarily became known for showcasing a style of speed, daring play and showmanship. Its most famous player, pitcher Satchel Paige, might guarantee to strike out the first six batters he faced, or order his outfielders to the dugout in the middle of an inning. Still, its stars knew to buckle down during exhibitions against white All-Star teams, and enjoyed a strong record in those matchups.\n\nIn 1937, the Negro American League was formed from teams in the Midwest and South to counter the Negro National League. The sport\u2019s health seemingly stronger than ever, an estimated 3 million fans turned out to watch Negro League teams play in 1942, with its World Series revived that September.\n\nJackie Robinson Integrates Baseball\n\nBy that point, the push to integrate major league baseball was slowly gaining steam. In 1942, former UCLA athletic star Jackie Robinson and another Black player named Nate Moreland were granted a cursory workout with the Chicago White Sox. The 1944 death of Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, a strict segregationist, provided another opening, and in 1945 sportswriters engineered tryouts for Negro Leaguers with the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Red Sox, the latter again involving Robinson.\n\nAs it turned out, Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey was already scouting African Americans, ostensibly for a new Negro league but in reality for his major league team. He forged a secret arrangement with Robinson in August 1945, and shook the baseball world with his official announcement in October.\n\nFollowing an outstanding season with the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, Robinson officially integrated major league baseball by manning first base for the Dodgers on April 15, 1947. On July 5, former Newark Eagles star Larry Doby became the second Black big leaguer by suiting up for the Cleveland Indians. Three more appeared in the majors by the end of the year, and the following season, after signing the now-42-year-old Paige, Cleveland went on to win the World Series.\n\nThe End of the Negro Leagues\n\nThe successes of Robinson, Doby and other African Americans like Roy Campanella and Monte Irvin drew the attention of Black communities and drained the Negro Leagues of its fan base. The Negro National League disbanded in 1948, and the Negro American League limped through the 1950s, its attempts to sign white players and women having little lasting impact on the turnstiles.\n\nIn the meantime, despite the growing power of the civil rights movement, major league baseball was proving slow to change; as late as August 1953, only six of its 16 teams were fielding Black players. However, the historic accomplishments of young stars like Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Ernie Banks soon prompted organizations to change their ways, and in 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate with the addition of infielder Elijah \u201cPumpsie\u201d Green.\n\nThe following year, the Negro American League folded. Some longtime clubs like the Monarchs attempted to stay afloat, but the combination of lower-grade talent and strengthening of major sports franchises led to their extinction through the decade, with only the Indianapolis Clowns managing to survive as a traveling team until ceasing operations in 1989.\n\nOn December 16, 2020, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred declared that the seven Negro leagues would be recognized as official major leagues, with their players' records and statistics counted in baseball\u2019s record books.\n\nPhoto Galleries\n\nWhen he made his Brooklyn Dodgers debut on April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson became the first African American to break the Major League Baseball color barrier.

Their home games were played in Sportsman\u2019s Park at 2911 North Grand Boulevard, which also served as the home field for the National League Cardinals. The Browns are best remembered by baseball fans today as being one of the most consistently bad teams in major-league history and for fielding a number of unique players, such as one-armed outfielder Pete Gray and dwarf pinch-hitter Eddie Gaedel. The Browns won the American League pennant once, in 1944, but never won a World Series championship. Since 1954 they have played in Maryland as the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nBeginnings\n\nCasual sports fans might be confused by other early St. Louis teams and stadiums known as the Browns and Sportsman\u2019s Park. The first professional team in St. Louis was organized in 1875 as the Brown Stockings, later simply the Browns. This team played at the original Sportsman\u2019s Park, at the same location as the later Browns\u2019 facility. In the 1880s these Browns won four American Association championships and twice defeated teams from the National League in contests that were forerunners to the modern World Series. The two leagues combined in 1892 to form a larger National League, and by 1900 the old Browns had moved to a new ballpark and changed their name to the Cardinals. When the American League formed in 1901, one of its franchises was in Milwaukee, but this team moved to St. Louis prior to the 1902 season, the club name was changed to the Browns, and a new Sportsman\u2019s Park was built on the site of the old one.\n\nThe Robert Hedges Era\n\nMissouri native and carriage mogul Robert \u201cColonel Bob\u201d Hedges was the man responsible for bringing the American League Browns to St. Louis. After purchasing the team and moving it from Milwaukee, Hedges, who had anticipated the ascent of automobiles and sold his carriage manufacturing business in 1900, invested first in constructing a new wooden grandstand on the site of the old Sportsman\u2019s Park before play began in 1902; he subsequently built one of baseball\u2019s first concrete-and-steel stadiums on the same property in 1909. This ballpark not only was the Browns\u2019 home for the remainder if their time in St. Louis but also served as the home field for the crosstown Cardinals from 1920 until 1966, when it was replaced by Busch Memorial Stadium downtown.\n\nHedges brought a number of innovations to the game, including the first electric scoreboard, first public address announcer, and first canvas tarp used to cover the infield during rain delays. He immediately set out to make his club competitive and to lure customers away from the more-established Cardinals. Cleaning up and rebuilding the dilapidated ballpark was a first step. Hedges also instituted promotions such as Lady\u2019s Day to expand his potential fan base and worked to turn the ballpark experience into a more family-friendly middle-class outing by clamping down on drinking, gambling, and what was commonly referred to as \u201crowdyism.\u201d\n\nHedges soon realized that a quick way to build a winning club with a loyal fan base was by pirating some of the Cardinals\u2019 best players. Outfielder Jesse Burkett and shortstop Bobby Wallace, two future Hall of Famers, were soon lured away with better salaries. In 1903 the American and National Leagues reached an understanding respecting each other\u2019s contracts, but until then jumping leagues was a common practice, often leading to bidding wars for top players. At first, Hedges\u2019s plan was successful. The 1902 squad finished 98\u201378, in second place behind the Philadelphia Athletics, and outdrew the Cardinals. This would be the high point for the Hedges era, however. The team had only three other winning seasons during his ownership and failed to finish as high in the standings again for the next twenty years. The Browns became a mediocre team, with former stars nearing the end of their careers filling out the roster more as gate attractions than as competitive ballplayers.\n\nThe most important signing during Hedges\u2019s tenure was of a backup catcher and utility fielder out of Ohio Wesleyan named Branch Rickey. A subpar player, Rickey fared much better during a fifty-year career as a baseball executive that began with the Browns in 1914. Among Rickey\u2019s early experiments were creating a \u201cfarm system\u201d of minor-league teams dedicated to producing talent for the parent big-league club and holding a mandatory spring training for his players in a region with a warm climate. Both would be quickly adopted by most other major-league teams. Under Rickey\u2019s guidance, the Browns improved over the next few seasons on the field and at the gate.\n\nThe Phil Ball Era\n\nFollowing the 1915 season, Hedges sold the Browns to Phil Ball, a St. Louis refrigerator magnate, reportedly turning a $400,000 profit on the sale and thus becoming the only Browns owner ever to make money on the team. New owner Ball almost immediately began to make poor decisions. The first was letting Rickey leave (or pushing him out, depending on the account). During their first meeting, the hard-drinking Ball is reported to have greeted the teetotaler Rickey by saying, \u201cSo you\u2019re the goddamned prohibitionist?\u201d Their relationship deteriorated from there. Rickey was fired as field manager but remained in the front office. When Rickey was offered a position as the Cardinals\u2019 general manager at the end of the 1916 season, Ball objected after having previously given his blessing and threatened to take action in the press, leading to a falling out between the two men. Under Rickey\u2019s guidance, the Cardinals turned into one of baseball\u2019s best teams in the 1920s and remained at or near the top of the National League for the next two decades. The Browns were overshadowed by their crosstown rivals.\n\nThe best player in the Browns\u2019 history was almost certainly first baseman George Sisler. Signed by Rickey in 1915, Sisler had a Hall of Fame career over the next fifteen seasons, twelve of which were spent with the Browns. He held a lifetime .340 batting average and won league batting titles with a .407 average in 1920 and a .420 mark in 1922. His 257 hits during the 1920 season remained a major-league record until 2004. However, at the pinnacle of his career, Sisler missed the entire 1923 season due to an eye infection that caused him to suffer from double vision. He mounted a comeback the following year and eventually played another effective seven seasons, but never regained his pre-illness form. Retiring as a player in 1930, Sisler was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939 and now has a statue outside of the current Busch Stadium, the only Brown represented among the many great Cardinals players.\n\nLed by Sisler, 24-game winner Urban Shocker, and American League home-run champion Ken Williams, the Browns had one of their best seasons in 1922, notching 93 victories and finishing just one game behind Babe Ruth and the first-place New York Yankees. Their days as contenders, however, were numbered. Failing to invest in the farm system started by Rickey, the Browns fell into a vicious cycle of bad teams that attracted little public attention, drew few fans, and made little money to spend on better players. The team\u2019s best gate attractions tended to be Hall of Fame players in the declining seasons of their careers, including former Cardinals Rogers Hornsby and Jim Bottomley. When the Great Depression arrived at the end of the decade, it hit the Browns particularly hard. Attendance declined precipitously, bottoming out at 80,922\u2014an average of just 1,050 fans per game\u2014in 1935. The team hit rock bottom and stayed there.\n\nThe Barnes, Muckerman, and DeWitt Era\n\nWhen Ball died in 1933, no one wanted to buy the team. It was managed through a receiver for three seasons until Cardinals team treasurer and Rickey prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Bill DeWitt Sr. and his father-in-law, investment banker Donald Lee Barnes, purchased a majority interest in 1936, with DeWitt serving as the club\u2019s general manager. In an effort to raise capital and increase fan interest in the team, stock in the club was offered to the public for just five dollars per share. This generated local interest and raised a considerable amount of revenue, but spreading team ownership over thousands of individuals would cause headaches for later owners trying to consolidate control of the team. The last shares were not bought back until 1976, when the club had already been in Baltimore for more than twenty years.\n\nWith hard economic times and the Cardinals fielding more competitive teams through the 1930s and early 1940s, attendance for the hapless Browns continued to plummet. One game in 1933 drew precisely thirty-four paying fans, a record for lowest official attendance that stood until a game was played in 2015 at which no fans were admitted due to civil unrest nearby. By the end of the 1941 season, DeWitt and Barnes were ready to move the club to Los Angeles and had obtained informal permission from the American League to relocate. A formal vote was on the league owners\u2019 meeting agenda for the morning of December 8, but the shock of the attack on Pearl Harbor the previous day, and the anticipation that travel restrictions would be imposed with the nation now at war, rendered the issue moot. The Browns were consigned to remain in St. Louis.\n\nSomewhat ironically, the team then had its greatest success during the depths of World War II. The wartime draft gutted the rosters of most teams, but not the Browns, who were compiled mostly of castoffs from other teams and players nearing the end of their careers. Most of the Browns were ineligible for the draft because they were either too old or designated 4F from previous injuries. Of the 340 major-league players drafted during 1943 and 1944, only one was from the Browns.\n\nThe 1944 season was the team\u2019s high-water mark. They finished with an 85-69 record, the lowest winning percentage of any American League pennant winner at that time, and advanced to play the Cardinals in the World Series. In the last World Series ever played entirely in one stadium, the Cardinals prevailed, four games to two. With most rosters still depleted by the military in 1945, the Browns managed another winning record the following season but were unable to defend their league pennant. In the postwar years they quickly reverted to their accustomed place in the American League\u2019s second division as star players returned from military service to rejoin other teams.\n\nFollowing the 1944 season, Richard Muckerman, a minority shareholder, bought the majority interest from Barnes, with DeWitt staying on as general manager and owning a minority interest. Muckerman\u2019s first season as majority owner witnessed what at first glance was one of the oddest, most eccentric, and downright bizarre events in the team\u2019s history: the Browns added a one-armed center fielder to the 1945 club. The real story, however, is not as weird as it would seem. Pete Gray was severely injured in a car accident as a boy, resulting in his right arm being amputated at the elbow. He grew up playing baseball in sandlots, learning to both catch and throw using his left arm, and became a local standout. Minor-league owners were understandably cautious about signing him, but as the military draft continued to decimate club rosters in both the major and minor leagues, spots started to open up for him, and he was able to demonstrate his clear abilities. In 1944 he was the MVP of the AA Southern League, batting .333 and leading the league with 68 stolen bases. Any player putting up those numbers in the high minors, especially given the shortage of players during the war years, would likely have been given a shot on a big-league club. While Gray started the season well, fielders quickly learned how to play him, and given his physical limitations, he was unable to adjust his batting style to compensate. He finished the season, and his major-league career, playing 77 games and batting .218. Gray played several more productive seasons, however, in the minor leagues.\n\nThe postwar Browns had little in the way of a radio network, and what they did have was far smaller than the Cardinals\u2019 network. They did have quite a color man, though, in Dizzy Dean. One afternoon during the 1947 season, the Hall of Fame pitcher and Browns broadcaster was strongly endorsing the station\u2019s sponsor, the Falstaff Brewing Corporation, when he lamented at length over the air how bad the Browns\u2019 pitching was and lectured on how he could do better. Management, being always open to an attraction, signed him as a pitcher nearly a decade after he had last played in a major-league game. Dean threw four scoreless innings before going back into retirement. His performance did little to raise the Browns\u2019 prospects.\n\nThe Bill Veeck Era\n\nHaving exhausted all available capital and with no sign that better days were coming for the Browns, DeWitt decided to sell the controlling share of the club midway through the 1951 season to Bill Veeck, a former owner of the Cleveland Indians and teams in the minor leagues. Veeck brought to St. Louis a deep knowledge of the game, an almost singular talent for promotions, and a penchant for angering other team owners. It was this last quality that would finally drive the Browns out of St. Louis for good.\n\nVeeck came to St. Louis with a plan. He was convinced that the city was no longer big enough for two big-league clubs, and that the rapid postwar growth of cities on the West Coast and in the Sun Belt had created new markets that major-league baseball would inevitably court. Knowing the Browns\u2019 performance was unlikely to improve dramatically in the near term, Veeck planned to use showmanship and promotions to increase his club\u2019s attendance at the expense of the Cardinals and gradually push the National Leaguers toward one of the many cities clamoring for a franchise. For a while, the Cardinals\u2019 ownership seemed happy to oblige, as rumors of financial troubles circulated.\n\nVeeck soon engaged in a series of stunts that put the Browns back in the public eye. The most memorable was recruiting Eddie Gaedel, a 3\u20197\u201d performer, to pinch-hit during a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers in 1951. Donning a uniform with the number 1/8, Gaedel presented an impossibly small strike zone and unsurprisingly walked on four pitches. The American League voided Gaedel\u2019s contract the next day. Later that season, Veeck also staged Grandstand Managers Night, in which some four thousand fans were seated in a special section and given signs saying \u201cyes\u201d on one side and \u201cno\u201d on the other. They effectively replaced the Browns\u2019 manager, using their cards to vote on the starting lineup and to make in-game decisions. The Browns won the game against the Philadelphia Athletics, 3\u20132, with A\u2019s owner-manager Connie Mack sitting in the stands and voting for plays against his own team. Another Veeck move was to bring in American folk legend and former Negro Leagues star Satchel Paige as a relief pitcher for the Browns. Ancient for a baseball player, Paige nevertheless pitched effectively for the Browns for three seasons and made two All-Star game appearances. Veeck played up the marketing angle: Paige usually sat in the bullpen on a rocking chair with a blanket across his lap while waiting to be called into the game.\n\nThrough the 1952 season, Veeck\u2019s plan appeared to be working: despite continuing to lose, the team\u2019s attendance increased by about 300,000 fans while the Cardinals\u2019 dropped by around the same number. The battle for the hearts of St. Louis baseball fans seemed to be breaking Veeck\u2019s way, especially after Cardinals owner Fred Saigh, convicted of felony tax evasion, was forced to sell his club at the end of the season. It seemed certain that the Cardinals would be purchased by a consortium of businessmen in Houston and moved to Texas, but at the eleventh hour Anheuser-Busch owner Augustus \u201cAuggie\u201d Busch bought the team and vowed to keep it in St. Louis. Knowing he could not compete with the financial resources of the country\u2019s largest brewery, Veeck began to make plans to move the Browns. Late in the 1953 season, he thought the American League would agree to let him move the team from St. Louis, but a majority of the other owners, piqued by his showmanship and what they considered his lack of respect for the game, voted him down. A Yankee shareholder allegedly told Veeck, \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep you in St. Louis and bankrupt you, then we\u2019ll decide where the franchise is going to go.\u201d Out of options, Veeck sold the club to a group based in Baltimore, and in 1954 the team began play as the Orioles. With the Browns\u2019 departure, the Cardinals were left in sole possession of major-league baseball in St. Louis."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/St._Louis_Browns", "page_content": "St. Louis Browns (AL) [ edit ]\n\nIntroduction [ edit ]\n\nThe St. Louis Browns are perhaps history\u2019s worst Major League franchise. The Browns existed from 1902 to 1953 in the American League and managed just 11 winning seasons over that span. They lost more than 100 games eight times, finishing dead last in the AL 10 times. They finished as high as second in the AL standings just three times. The Browns won just one pennant, in 1944, when the majors were not at full strength due to World War II. In 1954, following eight straight losing seasons, the Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe Original St. Louis Browns [ edit ]\n\nThe name St. Louis Browns was first used in 1883, by the St. Louis entry in the American Association. It was a shortening of the name Brown Stockings used by previous St. Louis teams in the National Association and in the National League from 1875 to 1877. The first edition of the American Association team, which played in 1882 was also known as the Brown Stockings. The Browns, under rambunctious German-born owner Chris Von der Ahe, were the strongest and most colorful franchise in the American Association, winning pennants four straight seasons (1885-1888), winning one World Series (1886), tying another (1885) and losing two. The Browns moved to the National League in 1892 when the American Association merged with the National League, and eventually became the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900.\n\nThe American League Browns [ edit ]\n\nThe American League's St. Louis Browns appeared in the league's second season, in 1902, when the Milwaukee Brewers relocated to St. Louis. The team took the old moniker abandoned by the Cardinals, and built their stadium, Sportsman's Park, on the site of the park of the same name used by the old Browns. Neither St. Louis team had much success during the 1900s and 1910s, and to make matters worst, a third major league team, the St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League competed with them in 1914 and 1915.\n\nThough the pennant-winning Browns of 1944 are more famous (or infamous), the best Browns team ever was probably the 1922 edition. That team won a franchise-record 93 games, finishing just one game behind Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees. They led the AL in both hitting and pitching, led by George Sisler\u2019s .420 BA, 39 home runs from Ken Williams (four more than Ruth, who missed six weeks that season due to a suspension) and the strong pitching of Urban Shocker (24 wins, 2.97 ERA). The Browns also set their all-time attendance record that season, 712,918. In 1923, Sisler, unquestionably the greatest of all Browns, missed the entire season with sinusitis, and St. Louis fell to 5th place. The Sisler-led teams of the 1920s would never seriously contend again.\n\nAfter years of futility, the Browns tried to pull off a bold move following the 1941 season, when they sought permission from the league to relocate to Los Angeles, CA. This was a full decade and a half before baseball actually proceeded which such a move. They had preliminary approval from other owners, had secured rights to play in L.A.'s Wrigley Field and had been promised additional financial backing by west coast banker A.P. Giannini. They were ready to purchase the Pacific Coast League's Los Angeles Angels and move them to Long Beach, CA, in order to secure territorial rights. They had also hammered out agreements with both TWA Airlines and the Chicago, IL-to L.A. Santa Fe Railroad to assist in drawing up a feasible schedule. The rival Cardinals were delighted, with owner Sam Breadon offering them $250,000 to assist in getting them out of town. Unfortunately, the final vote granting approval was scheduled for Monday, December 8, 1941 - and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, HI on December 7th completely upset that apple cart: with President Franklin D. Roosevelt having declared war, every team including the Browns voted against the proposed move.\n\nIn 1944, the Browns finally won their first and only pennant, edging the Detroit Tigers on the final day of the season when the immortal Sig Jakucki beat the New York Yankees, 5-2. While the Browns probably owe much of their success in 1944 to depleted wartime rosters across the league, they did have some legitimate talent. First baseman George McQuinn was an All-Star before the war, shortstop Vern Stephens, among the best Browns ever, was one of the top hitting shortstops of his day, and the Browns had a solid starting pitching staff featuring Jack Kramer, Nels Potter, and Denny Galehouse. The Browns' roster also suffered from wartime depletion, as their best hitter and starting center fielder Wally Judnich missed the entire season, while Galehouse, talented starting pitcher Steve Sundra, and power hitter Chet Laabs missed most of the season to either military service or employment related to the war effort. Naturally the Browns fell short in the World Series, losing 4-2 to the neighboring St. Louis Cardinals. The Browns pitched well enough to win (team ERA of 1.49 in the series), but were doomed by anemic hitting, managing to score just 12 runs in 6 games.\n\nIn 1947, the Browns became the second American League team to integrate (following the Cleveland Indians), adding Negro League players Willard Brown and Hank Thompson to the roster in July. Thompson played decently for the last-place Browns, hitting .256, while Brown struggled, hitting under .200. The Browns showed no patience with either man, sending both back to the Negro Leagues in August. Thompson went on to have a solid career with the New York Giants, while Brown, a Negro League star and a future Hall of Famer, never played in the majors again.\n\nThe Bill Veeck Years [ edit ]\n\nIn 1951, Bill Veeck purchased the Browns, and for a time it appeared the lowly franchise was on an upswing. Veeck renovated Sportsman's Park, changed the Browns\u2019 uniforms, and, most importantly, he began stockpiling talent. While Veeck\u2019s Browns period is perhaps best known for his Eddie Gaedel midget gag, Veeck did bring a number of quality players to St. Louis, such as Virgil Trucks, Vic Wertz, Clint Courtney, Johnny Groth, and Satchel Paige. These newcomers, along with existing Browns talents like Roy Sievers, Bob Turley, and Don Larsen, might have given Veeck a chance at success in St. Louis, but it was not to be.\n\nAt the end of Veeck's first full year as owner, 1952, the Browns had improved by 12 wins over 1951 and had nearly doubled their attendance from the previous season. According to his autobiography, Veeck was fully aware that St. Louis could not support two baseball teams, and his plan was to drive the Cardinals out of town. Veeck's grand scheme was wrecked that same year when the Busch family, with its vast beer fortune, purchased the Cardinals. No longer able to compete financially, Veeck decided to pack up and move the Browns before the 1953 season. Initially, Veeck planned to move to Milwaukee, but the National League outmanoeuvered him and the Boston Braves moved in. Veeck next targeted Baltimore, MD but the American League voted him down. Veeck also considered Los Angeles again, but at the time such a move did not seem feasible.\n\nWith the team unable to move, the Browns' 1953 season would be a miserable disappointment for the Browns. The St. Louis fans were fully aware of Veeck's plans to move the team and stayed away from the ballpark. Out of money, Veeck had to unload several of his top players, including Trucks, his best pitcher. The demoralized, depleted Browns lost 100 games. After the season mercifully ended, Veeck again attempted to move to Baltimore. Once more the AL voted Veeck down. In his autobiography, Veeck contends that the other American League owners conspired to keep him in St. Louis in 1953 and 1954, in an effort to bankrupt him. Veeck certainly was not popular among the other owners due to his often outlandish methods, and the fact that these same owners quickly voted to allow Clarence Miles to move the Browns to Baltimore, having denied Veeck the same move a year earlier, seems to substantiate Veeck's claims. With no other options, Veeck sold the Browns to Miles, a Baltimore lawyer, and the AL subsequently voted to allow the Browns to move.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles were born (or, more truthfully, re-born) and the Browns were no more. The Orioles would soon trade away most of the remaining talent from the Veeck era (including Sievers, Wertz, Turley, and Larsen), and it would be several years before the franchise finally began to win.\n\nUnofficial All-Time Browns Team [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nEdward Achorn: The Summer of Beer and Whiskey: How Brewers, Barkeeps, Rowdies, Immigrants, and a Wild Pennant Fight Made Baseball America's Game , Public Affairs, Perseus Books Group, Philadelphia, PA, 2013.

(National Baseball Hall of Fame Library.)\n\nIntroduction\n\nAchieving on-field success has often proved elusive to owners of the Baltimore Orioles and its predecessor teams, the St. Louis Browns and Milwaukee Brewers. The franchise, dating back to the inception of the American League, frequently vexed its chief executives, including the likes of businessman Phil Ball, baseball impresario Bill Veeck, and more recently, attorney Peter Angelos. While the ballclub occasionally tasted victory, it endured long stretches of futility often aided by owner ineptness and undercapitalization.1\n\nCompetitive difficulties began in the team\u2019s early years as the saying, \u201cFirst in shoes, first in booze, and last in the American League,\u201d became popular, capturing the Browns\u2019 reputation for incompetence.2 When the team moved to Baltimore after the 1953 season, it had the worst franchise won-lost record of the eight ballclubs in the league. Even the Washington Senators, whose \u201cFirst in war, first in peace, and last in the American League\u201d epithet inspired the Brownie descriptive, had a better record than St. Louis.3 While Baltimore eventually began to field winning teams in the early 1960s they reverted to losing ways as the twentieth century ended, experiencing a run of 14 consecutive losing seasons.\n\nOver the years, various owners contributed to subpar performances through unwise decisions. Ball made a fatal mistake in letting his general manager, Branch Rickey, go to the Cardinals. Rickey\u2019s contributions to the Cardinals\u2019 success eventually fueled the Browns leaving St. Louis. More recently, Angelos has received criticism for Baltimore\u2019s dismal play during the past 20 seasons.\n\nThere were, however, periods of enlightened leadership. Robert Hedges, first owner of the Browns, promoted the game to a wider clientele by banning the sale of alcohol and instituting Ladies Day. His then-innovative reconstruction of Sportsman\u2019s Park in 1908 into a steel and concrete facility led the way in designing future ballparks. Hedges also had the foresight to hire Rickey to run the team. While Rickey\u2019s tenure was cut short by Ball, he was with the club long enough to obtain the services of George Sisler, the greatest of all Browns players.4\n\nBrewery magnate Jerold Hoffberger presided over several decades of Orioles dominance as they won six division titles and two World Series. His organization served as a role model for all of baseball spanning the 1960s through the mid-1980s. In the 1980s, inspiration for the precedent-setting Oriole Park at Camden Yards was encouraged by Hoffberger\u2019s successor, Edward Bennett Williams. Its retro style ushered in a new era of ballpark architecture, helping stimulate a renewed interest in baseball.\n\nIn the Beginning\n\n\n\nThroughout the ballclub\u2019s history, owners had to deal with daunting challenges such as scandals, strikes, and world wars. None, however, faced the experiences of brothers Henry and Mathew Killilea in 1901. They not only had to oversee the Milwaukee Brewers operations, but also assure the American League\u2019s success in challenging the National League\u2019s supremacy in baseball. Their ownership of the Brewers lasted only one year, a circumstance dominated by the overarching conflict between the two leagues.\n\nAfter the 1900 season, Ban Johnson, president of the then Class A American League, announced that players under his jurisdiction wouldn\u2019t be governed by the National Agreement, a covenant that decreed participants would honor a player\u2019s contractual agreements with their respective teams. Effectively this meant he would begin raiding teams in the National League for their \u201creserved\u201d players.5 Johnson was establishing a new major league.\n\nHe needed top-notch players for his league, and the National League\u2019s self-imposed player salary cap of $2,400 per year made it easy to lure them to his fledgling organization. A rush of players to the new league was immediate. Eventually, nearly two-thirds of American League rosters came from the National League.6 Significantly, his raid included such standouts as Nap Lajoie and Cy Young.\n\nIn addition to attracting players through higher wages, Johnson played a longer strategy. A significant factor in determining a team\u2019s financial viability was (and still is) the population base from which it drew: the larger the base, the greater chance of success. Placing teams in large metropolitan areas was paramount, especially before popular usage of the automobile left people were dependent on mass transportation. Shifting franchises to these locales became crucial for the league\u2019s survival.\n\nWhen the National League dropped Baltimore, Cleveland, and Washington after the 1899 season, Johnson added them to his circuit at the expense of less populated venues. Grand Rapids, with a population of less than 90,000, simply could not match Cleveland\u2019s potential to draw fans from a base of over 380,000 inhabitants. Johnson also placed teams in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia to compete directly with the senior circuit. Detroit and Milwaukee, both founding franchises in the Western League, rounded out the new major league. As 1901 began, the rearrangement looked like this:\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nSource: 1900 US Census via InfoPlease.com\n\nThe league did well in 1901. Despite not having teams in two of the largest cities in the country, New York and St. Louis, Johnson\u2019s clubs generated attendance of nearly 1.7 million, favorably comparing to the National League\u2019s 1.9 million fans.\n\nWhile these developments boded well for the American League, the same could not be said for the Brewers. Milwaukee\u2019s performance in 1900 had been successful; it finished a close second to the Chicago White Stockings. But in 1901 the Brewers were overwhelmed by events stemming from the American/National League conflict.\n\nWith the movement of franchises to larger cities, Johnson also attracted substantial capital to Cleveland, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The Brew City\u2019s Killilea brothers could not hope to compete financially with these owners, and their ability to successfully attract players from the senior circuit. It was a sad turn of events for Matthew Killilea, who had not only been active in running the Brewers but also proved a solid legal adviser to Johnson during the league war years.\n\nKillilea, son of Irish immigrants, was an attorney and minor politician in Milwaukee. He and nine other local businessmen became involved with the Brewers as a matter of civic pride.7 Increasingly entwined in team affairs, he was instrumental in construction of Milwaukee Park at 16th and Lloyd, a facility designed to accommodate minor-league competition. Killilea developed a reputation for fairness in dealing with his players and extended efforts to provide a competitive team. Most often, however, until Connie Mack began managing the team, this last objective was not met, the Brewers usually finishing well out of the pennant race.8\n\nFrequently called on to provide legal expertise as the league grew and conflict with the National League continued, Killilea was integral to the process of incorporating the White Stockings franchise for the 1900 season.9 Earlier, he had worked with Johnson to rebuff efforts to have Western League players transferred to the National League as well as securing new franchises to stabilize the growing circuit.10\n\nProprietorship of the Brewers went through several iterations over the years. By 1901 Henry Killilea as president and Fred Gross as treasurer were co-owners of the team.11 Killilea\u2019s expertise notwithstanding, Milwaukee\u2019s relative lack of financial backing became apparent when National Leaguers flocked to the new circuit. Beginning in the 1901 season, more than 100 players with experience in the senior circuit jumped to the Americans; more than 70 came directly in the first two years of its existence.12 Just three frontline players joined the Brewers; financial competition was just too keen for players to sign with Milwaukee.\n\nHugh Duffy, a future Hall of Famer, was the best of the three. Named manager to start the 1901 season, the 34-year-old, who had hit .440 in 1894, batted a creditable .302 in half a season. He replaced Connie Mack, who had moved on to the Philadelphia A\u2019s, a shift orchestrated by Johnson to strengthen the new franchise. Other additions, pitchers Ned Garvin and Pink Hawley, generated a combined 15-34 record.\n\nAs if not drawing top-flight players was obstacle enough, Matt Killilea struggled with tuberculosis, which forced extended absences, further distracting the beleaguered franchise. Even before the season began, there were rumors that Milwaukee would move. Most suggested the team would move to St. Louis, if not in 1901, certainly in 1902.13\n\nSt. Louis was a logical destination, a metropolis Johnson had eyed for some time. It was the fourth largest city in the nation, with the added allure of preparing to host the 1904 World\u2019s Fair. Unlike most East Coast cities, St. Louis allowed Sunday baseball, and competing for fans with the National League Cardinals made the contemplated move an even more attractive venture.14\n\nThe relocation rumors were true. Both Johnson and Chicago owner Charles Comiskey had requested that Killilea shift the team to St. Louis before the season began. Killilea refused \u201cwith protestations of civic pride,\u201d at the same time promising that if the team did not perform well during the season he would move.15 That Killilea could resist Johnson and Comiskey was uncommon; most often the autocratic Johnson had his way. It reflected the regard both Johnson and Comiskey had for the Brewers owner.\n\nWhile Killilea obtained a reprieve, he could not dislodge Johnson\u2019s uneasiness as the season was about to start. After an exhibition game between Chicago and Milwaukee \u2014 handily won by Chicago \u2014 Johnson became alarmed at the Brewers\u2019 level of play. He canceled further exhibition games between the two teams during the spring. \u201cThe games were unfair to the Milwaukee team and gave a false impression. The Brewers were not represented by their full strength and the opinion might be formed before the season begins that the White Stockings are stronger than Milwaukee.\u201d16\n\nJohnson\u2019s concern was justified. Neither the franchise\u2019s situation nor Killilea\u2019s health improved. Killilea\u2019s brother Henry, also an attorney, stepped in to direct the team during his brother\u2019s absence, but to no avail.17 The team lost its first five games, bounced between seventh and eighth place for two months then settled into the cellar for good on June 30.\n\nEarlier that month, a meeting of American League owners convened in Chicago. Afterword, news leaked out that St. Louis and/or New York would replace Milwaukee and/or Cleveland. Mathew Killilea countered the rumors, commenting that he would \u201cpersonally vouch for the retention of this city (Milwaukee) in the circuit.\u201d He said he had turned down an offer by St. Louis businessmen of $30,000 for the franchise.18\n\nDespite these disavowals, talk of a shift carried through the season. Killilea continued to insist the Brewers would not move and were not for sale. In August, he said he had turned down another offer \u2014 now $42,000. By then, the impression had formed that Killilea was bargaining for the best price the franchise could draw. The team finished dead last, 35\u00bd games behind the White Sox.\n\nAttendance for the year at Milwaukee was 139,034, second to last in the American League, affected by continued rumors that the club was moving.\n\nThe season had not ended before The Sporting News reported that Jimmy McAleer, former manager of the Cleveland Blues and a great recruiter of National Leaguers to Johnson\u2019s circuit, would manage the St. Louis team in 1902.19 This was before any word came that St. Louis would have a team.20 Over the next several weeks, additional stories found their way into TSN about the presumed move. The baseball weekly, operated by the Spink family in St. Louis, was particularly anxious to have an American League team in the city. Virtually every week through the next two months, an article referring to St. Louis replacing Milwaukee appeared in the paper.21\n\nMatters came to a head in Chicago the first week of December when American League owners convened to discuss what seemed a foregone conclusion. While the franchise shift did take place, the path toward its doing so proved curious.\n\nAs Matt Killilea\u2019s health worsened, his brother Henry had assumed a more prominent role in running the Brewers. Apparently, his part now included controlling ownership of the club. When American League executives sanctioned transfer to St. Louis with Matt still being associated with the club, Henry objected. Concerned with his brother\u2019s well-being, he wanted Matt to retire from baseball. Matt wished to stay in the game. Finally, in a meeting that lasted nearly 12 hours, Henry gave up his interest and the transfer took place with Matt and treasurer Fred Gross controlling the new St. Louis franchise under terms that were not made public.22\n\nMilwaukeeans were displeased. The Milwaukee Daily News denounced Killilea and Gross, saying they \u201chave pink tea in their veins instead of sporting blood\u2026\u201d for not staying with Milwaukee. The Milwaukee Journal expressed similar sentiments, noting, \u201cIt is a very clever trick of the American League bunch in keeping Killilea \u2026 on their staff with ground awaiting them in Milwaukee in case St. Louis should go to the bead.\u201d23\n\nThe Milwaukee Sentinel countered these reactions with a pragmatic observation: \u201cThe owners of the Milwaukee club removed their team to St. Louis as a business proposition. They expected to sell out, but in the absence of capitalists in the Mound City to shoulder the burden made it necessary for them to carry the load themselves, and it is possible they may make their independent fortunes as a result of the move. The Killileas and F.C. Gross stated that Milwaukee could not adequately support the expensive team they had secured; so they had to leave the city.\u201d24\n\nThe Sentinel was perceptive. Killilea and Gross had maintained ownership of the team in the absence of local capitalists in St. Louis. The seriously ill Killilea and Gross, lifelong Milwaukeeans, did not make for a secure and stable St. Louis franchise ownership. It was an absence that did not continue for long; their control of the St. Louis franchise was short-lived. Ban Johnson was going to make sure of it.\n\nRobert Hedges, first owner of the St. Louis Browns. (Library of Congress, Bain News Service)\n\nEnter the Browns\n\n\u201cI went into baseball purely as a business.\u201d \u2014 Robert Lee Hedges, Browns owner\n\nSeeking to capitalize on past legacy, the new club appropriated the Browns as the team\u2019s nickname. Even before the shift to St. Louis had been finalized it was being referred to as the Browns, a deliberate attempt to hearken back to the old St. Louis Brown Stockings, a successful franchise in the defunct American Association from the late 1880s that had won four pennants in a row.25\n\nIn late January 1902, it became public that Matt Killilea planned to dispose of his stock to St. Louis investors.26 Johnson on hearing of the impending deal \u201ctook the first train to St. Louis\u201d and spent a day with the principal parties to ensure protection of league interests. While a St. Louis Republic article describing this development seemed to suggest rapidly evolving events, it actually represented culmination of a long process in attracting resident ownership of the team.\n\nIn this situation, Johnson was far from the detached individual portrayed by the Republic. Two days after Killilea\u2019s intentions became public, it was revealed that Johnson and Comiskey \u201cwill meet with local parties who will take charge of the club\u201d and that their names would soon be publicized. The Republic article surmised that one of the individuals involved in negotiations for the team was a Mr. R.L. Hedges, formerly of Cincinnati and then living in Kansas City.\n\nConjecture had it that Hedges, described as a retired carriage manufacturer, would have some connection with the ballclub.27 He and Johnson had known each other since Johnson was a sportswriter in Cincinnati; they had stayed in touch over the years.28\n\nAlthough Hedges emerged as the major force in controlling the franchise, it was not apparent at first. When Sporting Life announced stockholders in the ballclub, they were with the exception of Hedges all prominent St. Louis businessmen. Ralph Orthwein, George Munson, C.J. McDiarmid, and John P. Bruce each committed to purchase 50 shares in the club valued at $100 per share, half paid up-front and representing 40 percent ownership.29 Hedges\u2019 300 shares were the remaining 60 percent, a majority interest in the Browns. Upon consummating the deal, Hedges moved to St. Louis. He lived there the rest of his life.\n\nNumerous sources reflected various figures as to the team\u2019s selling price; the January 28, 1902, issue of the St. Louis Republic estimating a figure in the range of $50,000. Whatever the final price, Henry Killilea seemed pleased with the transaction\u2019s conclusion: \u201cYou may say that the deal has been hanging fire, but that everything was satisfactorily arranged. \u2026 Matt was never in favor of going to St. Louis, and when the opportunity came to sell out at a higher price he willingly consented. We were treated liberally by the men purchasing and have no complaint to make.\u201d30\n\nMatt Killilea died on July 27, 1902, a victim of tuberculosis. After his death, The Sporting News wrote of Killilea: \u201cHe was the brains of the American League, having advised Ban Johnson in all his moves before and after the war started with the National League. Even the genius, John T. Brush, with all his baseball experience, failed to cope successfully with the Milwaukee magnate, although the latter was new to the game compared to the Cincinnati man. Charlie Comiskey and other well known magnates have said that Matt Killilea had all the other leaders beaten by a mile when it came to base ball law.\u201d31\n\nMatt\u2019s brother Henry went on to briefly own the Boston Red Sox (then called the Americans), possibly financed with some of the proceeds from the sale of the Browns. Respected for his legal acumen, Killilea received credit for his expertise in helping to gain peace between the American and National Leagues in 1903, the same year his Americans won the World Series.32\n\nOnce the transaction was final, the principals selected officers. Orthwein became president and Hedges secretary-treasurer. Several histories of the Browns have Orthwein heading the team in its first year. Although being president of the Browns reinforced this impression, Orthwein was a minority stockholder. Hedges was always the principal owner.33\n\nOrthwein assumed the presidency to give the team a sense of legitimacy in the community. Hedges, from Kansas City, was viewed as an outsider. The Sporting News explained that Orthwein \u201cwas made nominal head of the new club to impress upon the public it was a St. Louis institution and not under alien ownership.\u201d34 He was a millionaire, serving as secretary of the Sempire Clock Company and as director of the Orthwein Investment Company. Also known as a sportsman, Orthwein owned the then famous champion saddle horse Rex McDonald. At 25, he was the youngest president in either league.35 The paper noted that the club\u2019s policies \u201cwould be shaped and affairs managed by Secretary Hedges who has a controlling interest in its stock.\u201d\n\nOrthwein proved a minor and transitory figure in the Browns history. He was a somewhat eccentric figure. In 1903 TSN noted creation of a deed of trust to manage Orthwein\u2019s property and to \u201cdeal with his indebtedness,\u201d one of several untoward incidents in his life.36 At the end of the 1903 season, a single sentence in the St. Louis-Dispatch noted that Hedges had succeeded Orthwein as president of the club.37 Although later versions of his leaving the Browns suggest dissatisfaction with the team\u2019s management, Orthwein\u2019s shaky financial position probably decided his departure.38\n\nHedges is an obscure figure in baseball\u2019s narrative. His team lacked color, did not shine on the field or generate outstanding players. Yet, during his 13-year run as owner, Hedges showed an innovative side seldom equaled by his contemporaries.\n\nWhile Orthwein came of wealth, his father generating a considerable fortune as a grain merchant, Hedges rose from more common stock. His tale of overcoming adversity ran along the line of a Horatio Alger rags-to-riches story. Born near Kansas City in 1869, he overcame several personal tragedies. His father died when Hedges was 13; four years later, two brothers were killed in a tornado.\n\nDespite these calamities, Hedges worked his way up from being a civil servant to launching a buggy-manufacturing firm in Hamilton, Ohio. Always shrewd in the way of business, he sold the concern in 1900, foreseeing its\u2019 future demise at the hands of a coming automobile industry. Hedges then moved into the financial world, representing J.P. Morgan\u2019s various enterprises in the Midwest. Soon thereafter, lured by Johnson, he joined a select group of individuals investing in the American League.\n\nMany owners at the time were former players or patrons who saw themselves as \u201csportsmen\u201d indulging in a costly hobby or obligation to serve the civic good. Hedges was neither. \u201cI went into baseball purely as a matter of business,\u201d he said.39 Although the Browns\u2019 performance was mostly mediocre during Hedges\u2019 tenure, he held to this principle, with the Browns consistently turning a profit.\n\nTaking over the Browns was a daunting proposition for Hedges. The first priority was finding a ballpark for the team. Old Sportsman\u2019s Park, site of play for the American Association Browns, became the new Browns\u2019 ballfield \u2014 partially out of availability but also hinting at past glories. Renovation of the disused facility commenced as a new grandstand was constructed and the bleachers restored amid a general makeover.40 It was ready for play on Opening Day 1902.\n\nThrough the winter months, while financial transactions took place, McAleer proceeded to sign players for the Browns, focusing on disgruntled National Leaguers. The results of his efforts were stunning; he obtained six players from the Cardinals alone. Three were pitchers Jack Harper, Jack Powell, and Willie Sudhoff, who had combined for 59 Cardinals wins in 1901. Future Hall of Famers Jessie Burkett and Bobby Wallace followed suit. With these and other players, the Browns looked to be formidable going into their inaugural season in St. Louis.\n\nThe wholesale invasion of the Cardinals\u2019 roster set off a spate of lawsuits, the Cardinals defending their rights to control players through the reserve clause. Courts eventually upheld the Browns actions because then standard player contracts did not offer mutuality and were in violation of antitrust legislation.41\n\nOf lasting importance was a legacy of ill feelings that formed between the two teams. Intracity rivalries were to be expected, but the Browns\u2019 raid on the Cardinals generated a deep animosity that continued until the Browns left St. Louis. Hedges subsequently came to realize the cost to his team\u2019s good will. He and said that if he had to do it over, he would probably have sought players from National League teams other than St. Louis.42\n\nAs the season commenced, Hedges found ways to improve attendance. One concerned the rowdy nature of fans attending Browns games. Ban Johnson\u2019s continuing initiative in running the American League was to remove unsavory and disorderly elements from ballparks. His efforts encouraged increased attendance by a wider public, long put off by disruptive elements. Theodore P. Wagner, attending his first Browns game in the early 1900s, recalled half a century later, the gantlet of abuse fans had to endure: Women who attended \u201c\u2026received a raucous and often ribald welcome from the beer drinkers\u2026\u201d Wagner\u2019s memories were of a \u201c\u2026Sunday afternoon filled with \u201cbrew bombs,\u201d fisticuffs and excitement.\u201d43\n\nAlthough American League teams for the most part followed Johnson\u2019s strictures on dealing with disruptive fans, the Browns were commencing play in a heretofore National League town where such limits had not been encouraged or endorsed. Hedges proceeded to promote a family-friendly environment by employing security personnel and banning the sale of alcohol at games. A complimentary initiative revolved around what became known as \u201cLadies Days,\u201d games at Sportsman\u2019s Park.\n\nHedges frequently receives credit for creating Ladies Day.44 In a series of articles nearly half a century after he took over the Browns, baseball writer Sid Keener said, \u201cWhile many owners claim credit for introducing \u2018Ladies Days\u2019 to baseball this writer (Keener) awards that honor to Hedges. During the mid 1900\u2019s women rarely patronized sporting events \u2014 baseball especially. There were those rowdies out on the ball field! And you didn\u2019t want your mother, wife, daughter, or sweetheart to hear those nasty words!\u201d45\n\nDespite Keener\u2019s recollections, the idea of encouraging women to attend ballgames took place in the National League\u2019s early days and was an offered feature of Milwaukee Brewers baseball.46 Tickets were offered to women at a reduced price on special days of the week or if accompanied by a man. Although Hedges may not have come up with this promotional idea, he certainly popularized it in St Louis.\n\nDuring the season, and over the years, Hedges became a familiar figure in St. Louis, attending business luncheons and civic functions, talking about his team, often providing free tickets with the invitation, \u201ccome out to the ball park as my guests.\u201d To those wary of games based on prior experiences, \u201cUncle Bob,\u201d as he came to be known, invited them to witness how attendance at a game had been transformed.\u201d47 Hedges\u2019 presence extended to the ballpark, where he often appeared, greeting fans, and roaming the stands during play, efforts that gradually won followers to the team.48\n\nKeener recalled watching Hedges in action at the ballpark nearly a quarter-century later. \u201cTwo men and a woman who seemed to be in their early 60\u2019s were trying to edge their way through the mob. There wasn\u2019t a vacant seat in the ballpark when Mr. Hedges spotted them. \u2018You\u2019ll pardon me,\u2019 said Mr. Hedges. \u2018This place is too crowded for the lady. Won\u2019t you be kind enough to do me a favor and accept seats in my private box?\u2019 He had an usher escort them to his seats behind home plate to watch the game. He ended up viewing it while standing on a concrete post, holding on to an iron beam.\u201d49\n\n\u201cFirst in shoes, first in booze, and last in the American League\u201d\n\nWith new players recruited prior to the 1902 season, the Browns became a contender. Their first game was auspicious, a victory over the Cleveland Blues on April 24, 1902, at Sportsman\u2019s Park. St. Louis went on to battle the Philadelphia A\u2019s for the league lead well into September. At the height of the pennant race, Hedges\u2019 innovative nature came into play: He offered his players 25 percent of the gross receipts should they win the league championship.50 Illegal today, it was a novel concept at the time. The gesture, however, proved academic as the Browns faded in the stretch, finishing second, five games out.\n\nFueled by their solid play, the Browns outdrew the Cardinals by over 45,000 fans, making for a successful season. Overshadowing the local scene, however, baseball\u2019s landscape remained decidedly unsettled; the two leagues were still at war. During the winter of 1902, National League owners had come to the realization that the American League was here to stay. The new circuit had outdrawn the old, 2,206,454 to 1,683,012. It was time to end the conflict. Both leagues understood that profits would continue to decline as long as players could make one team bid against another for their services. The National League sent out peace feelers, which Johnson and his owners cordially received. Within weeks, a settlement to resolve differences concerning territorial rights and ownership of individual players came to the owners for approval.\n\nWhile most were willing to sign off, New York Giants owner John T. Brush proved recalcitrant. Johnson, wishing to take advantage of New York\u2019s population base, had shifted the Baltimore Orioles franchise into New York, begetting a team later to become known as the Yankees, a transfer that enraged Brush. Further, Brush was going to lose three quality stars, George Davis, Ed Delahanty, and Kid Elberfeld, to the American League. If these factors were not enough to set Brush against the settlement, he was also going to lose a star pitcher. Hedges had lured Christy Mathewson to the Browns with what looked to be a lawful \u201cironclad\u201d contract. Mathewson had been making $1,500 annually with the Giants. Hedges offered $4,000. A $500 advance sweetened the bargain.51 Brush was so much against the agreement that he won an injunction to stop the process. Although he canceled the injunction, Brush remained opposed to the conflict\u2019s resolution.\n\nAll indications pointed to Mathewson going to the Browns based on his having signed with them and receiving an advance. Yet the final listing of assignments had him staying with the Giants. By letting Mathewson stay with New York, Brush\u2019s recalcitrance toward the settlement dissipated. It subsequently came to light that Hedges willingly gave Mathewson up to bring closure to the dispute. \u201cMy individual and club interests were of comparatively minor importance when the future of baseball was at stake,\u201d he said. Later, he recalled, \u201cI lost a pennant for St. Louis in that deal, but I brought about peace in the baseball world.\u201d52\n\nIn retrospect, Hedges and St. Louis lost more than a pennant. One can only speculate on how Mathewson might have affected the Browns\u2019 fortunes over the years, including the franchise\u2019s eventual move to Baltimore.\n\nThe Browns\u2019 success in 1902 proved their best performance during Hedges\u2019 time as owner of the team. Just once more would they finish in the first division under Hedges; the rest of the time they resided in the bottom half of the league, including six finishes in seventh or eighth place. Although there were flashes of excellence, such as outfielder George Stone winning the batting title in 1906 and the acquisition of George Sisler, most of the talent Hedges garnered for the club proved second-rate. His astuteness in the business world did not translate into success on the playing field. Over the years, \u201cUncle Bob\u201d gradually earned a new moniker, \u201cTail-End Bob.\u201d\n\nOne reason suggested for the Browns\u2019 plodding performances was that the ability to scout out top-notch prospects was lacking.53 Perhaps Hedges\u2019 entry into the game from outside baseball worked against him. Unlike Comiskey or Mack, who had years of experience in developing a network of acquaintances able to discover talent, Hedges\u2019 inexperience impeded his ability to ascertain quality personnel.\n\nHe also left an impression that in dealing with player personnel, his actions were as an individual dealing in commodities, rather than in creating a winning team. The Sporting News describes Hedges\u2019 ability to obtain minor-league players who were \u201csold to major league clubs for large sums.\u201d Yet, the same article noted, \u201cScarce one of these players \u2018made good\u2019 with the major-league clubs to which they were sold.\u201d54 Hedges\u2019 dealings in player personnel were so sharp they left fellow owners with a sense of unease, that he was \u201ctoo canny a businessman for the good of the game.\u201d55 This reputation eventually hurt him within baseball\u2019s hierarchy, working against his ability to do business with other teams.\n\nIn time owners refused to trade with him. Sid Keener, writing for the St. Louis Times, wrote, \u201cIt has been common talk in American League baseball circles for years and years that other magnates would not exchange with Hedges. Figures prove this. \u2026 The American League, failing to shoo Uncle Bob out of the league, has entered into a combination to prevent him from getting his club back in the first division.\u201d56 Cleveland and Philadelphia, respectively, thwarted his efforts to obtain Joe Jackson and Home Run Baker.\n\nDespite the team\u2019s less than sterling performances, it often turned a profit. Several external developments worked in Hedges\u2019 favor. While Sunday baseball was legalized, horse racing became illegal in 1905. It had been one of few sporting events the public could afford. Simultaneously, Hedges continued innovating, introducing features to give the stadium a friendlier setting. He commenced use of an electric scoreboard, provided a public-address announcer at games, and employed detectives to rid Sportsman\u2019s Park of gamblers.57 These factors contributed to increased attendance at the ballpark. Moreover, it did not hurt that the Cardinals were equally inept, finishing just once in the first division while Hedges ran the Browns. On average, the Browns outdrew the Cardinals by nearly 40,000 a year.\n\nThe Browns lumbered through several years of indifference until 1908. Then, thanks in part to picking up castoffs Bill Dinneen and Rube Waddell, they made a solid run at the pennant. Both had comeback seasons, keeping St. Louis in the race before they finished a close fourth. More than 600,000 fans came to the ballpark, over triple that of the crosstown Cardinals, and generating a profit of $165,000.\n\nFlush with success, Hedges reinvested over $70,000 in reconstructing Sportsman\u2019s Park, creating a steel and concrete structure, one of the earliest of its kind, and allowing for an increase in capacity from 18,000 to over 24,000.58 The refurbished facility provided little in the way of inspiration in 1909. Dinneen and Waddell dropped from a combined 33-21 to a 17-21 record as the team fell to seventh place. McAleer, too easygoing for his own good, some said, was let go after having piloted the team for eight seasons.59 Despite the increased capacity at Sportsman\u2019s Park, the Brownies\u2019 falloff caused attendance to drop from 618,947 to 366,274, sixth in the league.\n\nTo replace McAleer, Hedges hired Jack O\u2019Connor, a former Browns catcher. Hedges had taken note of O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201csuperior knowledge of the sport,\u201d and \u201chis knack of doing the unexpected or outguessing his adversary,\u201d when O\u2019Connor had played for the team.60 It proved a disastrous appointment. Not only did O\u2019Connor lead the team to its worst record in the franchise\u2019s young history, he involved the club in a disreputable incident, caught Hedges up in a legal battle, and decidedly raised the ire of Ban Johnson. All this came out of play on the last day of the season.\n\nSt. Louis was finishing last \u2014 20\u00bd games behind seventh-place Washington \u2014 as attendance dropped to less than 250,000. They were playing a doubleheader on the last day of the season against the Cleveland Naps. While the games had no meaning in the standings, they did play a role in the batting race. Cleveland\u2019s Napoleon Lajoie, then second to the less popular Ty Cobb, made eight hits against Browns pitching, seemingly winning the batting crown.\n\nHis spree was achieved under bizarre circumstances. Most of Lajoie\u2019s hits were bunts down the third-base line toward rookie Red Corriden, playing his position suspiciously deep. After a questionable play, Browns coach Harry Howell allegedly offered a bribe to the official scorer to give Lajoie a hit. Hedges, in attendance, was not pleased with what he saw.\n\nAs it turned out, Hedges wasn\u2019t the only one displeased. Numerous complaints about the nature of the games surfaced. Johnson, getting a whiff of events, saw a threat to the integrity of the game and launched an investigation. Hedges soon fired O\u2019Connor. It turned out that Corriden was playing deep under orders from O\u2019Connor, who admitted, \u201cThe games Sunday were a farce.\u201d O\u2019Connor and Howell were banished from the game. When Hedges fired O\u2019Connor and Howell, it was clear to those in the know that he was acting under Johnson\u2019s direction.61\n\nO\u2019Connor was not finished with Hedges, however. His contract covered 1910 and 1911. Hedges refused to pay O\u2019Connor for 1911. O\u2019Connor took him to court and won in 1913, forcing payment of $5,000 for 1911.62 The case did little in the way of credit to either man, O\u2019Connor being shown up for his lackadaisical management of the team and Hedges for his evasiveness on matters concerning the contract while under oath.63\n\nShortly after the season ended, rumors circulated that Hedges was going to sell the Browns. There was truth in the rumors; a transaction was in process. As recalled 40 years later by Hedges\u2019 attorney, Montague Lyon, in The Sporting News, a group of St. Louisian Racquet Club members decided that they wanted to purchase the club from Hedges.64 Hedges at the time owned just over 60 percent of the club, minority stockholders being Ben C. Adkins, John E. Bruce, W.E. Orthwein and C.J. McDiarmid.65 The would-be purchasers, headed by local financier E. Manning Hodgman, deposited $30,000 with Hedges as down payment on a $300,000 purchase price. They had 10 days to determine whether to go through with the matter, failure to do so generating forfeiture of the down payment.\n\nThe reasons offered for Hedges\u2019 decision to sell varied. Lyon was quoted in Sporting Life as saying, \u201cMr. Hedges\u2019 health has been impaired by worry and hard work since the close of last season and his friends and his wife finally prevailed upon him to sell the club and accordingly the deal with the Hodgman syndicate was closed. After the stock has been transferred, Mr. Hedges will go to Arizona on personal business and finally to Europe for his health.\u201d66\n\nOther sources pointed to a different reason: that Hedges faced outside pressure, especially from Johnson, to sell the Browns. The article quoting Lyon alluded to efforts to oust Hedges because of the Browns\u2019 poor showing, the O\u2019Connor incident, and a disagreement with Comiskey concerning possible tampering charges involving a White Sox player. Comiskey, Hedges, and Johnson denied all this conjecture.\n\nThe deal, subsequently vetted by Johnson and others representing the American League, eventually collapsed. The would-be investors began squabbling about apportioning responsibilities in running the club, as a result missed payment deadlines for completing the purchase. Hedges granted an extension, hoping disagreements could be resolved, but the dispute went beyond resolution, and the transaction was never consummated. The investors lost their $30,000 down payment.\n\nAs the deal collapsed, Hedges, full of effusiveness, said he was \u201cnever feeling better in (my) life and is eager to get to work and resurrect the lowly Browns from the graveyard brigade.\u201d Once the transaction failed, he rapidly reassumed control of the Browns and named shortstop Bobby Wallace manager for the 1911 season. It proved nearly as unfortunate a choice as was the selection of O\u2019Connor.67\n\nWallace, the peerless-fielding shortstop, was a future Hall of Famer who had been with the Browns since 1902. He took the job against his better judgment. \u201cI never had the slightest desire to be a major-league manager and all knew it,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cBut Ban Johnson, Bob Hedges, and Jimmy McAleer persuaded me that the Browns were in a sort of a jam and it was up to me, as an old standby, to do what I could.\u201d68\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s efforts had generated a 47-107 record. With Wallace, the team\u2019s record was near identical, at 45-107, prompting another last-place finish. Early in 1912, as the team continued to perform poorly, first baseman George Stovall replaced Wallace. The Sporting Life article describing his appointment as a playing manager provided insight into Stovall\u2019s nature as well as his perspective on what St. Louis needed. \u201cI am going to have a conference with President Hedges, and I am going to tell him that he will have to get me some players and get them in a hurry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club is in bad shape. \u2026 If he expects me to make a showing and win some games he\u2019ll have to give me the material.\u201d\n\nThe same article noted that the Browns were going through the motions, lifeless; that there were \u201cno rowdies,\u201d no \u201cpepper and fighting spirit.\u201d Mindful of Hedges\u2019 business practices, the Sporting Life correspondent offered a telling observation: \u201c[T]o make Stovall\u2019s reign a success Colonel Hedges will have to bring along some of those high-priced minor-leaguers who go to other teams at fancy prices.\u201d69\n\nUnder Stovall, the team marginally improved, enough to eke out a seventh-place finish ahead of the New York Highlanders (later Yankees). There was a sense of optimism as the Browns entered 1913 with Stovall at the helm. However, before the season was over, he earned Ban Johnson\u2019s wrath for an on-field incident.\n\nIn early May, Stovall got into an argument with umpire Charlie Ferguson. As Browns infielder Jimmy Austin described it, the dispute climaxed when \u201cGeorge let fly with a big glob of tobacco juice \u2014 ptooey \u2014 that just splattered all over Ferguson\u2019s face and coat and everywhere. Ugh, it was an awful mess. It was terrible\u201d70 Suspended for several weeks, fined, and forced to write a letter of apology to Ferguson, Stovall complied. However, he had crossed the line with Johnson and Hedges, not only assaulting the authority of an umpire, but also behaving in a manner counter to the image of the game that they were trying to project. Stovall would have to go. Hedges, who had now made three consecutive poor selections as managers, did not have far to look in finding a successor.\n\nHedges Prot\u00e9g\u00e9: Branch Rickey\n\nBranch Rickey came to St. Louis from the White Sox in 1905. A backup catcher, he was an oddity in the majors. Deeply religious, Rickey refused to play ball on Sundays and reported to the team only after he had completed coaching responsibilities at Allegheny College in the spring. He also proved to be a mediocre player.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Hedges was impressed with Rickey\u2019s incisive knowledge of the game and an uncanny knack for evaluating talent. After Rickey\u2019s playing career ended in 1907, Hedges and Rickey kept in touch while he continued coaching at Allegheny. Their association was one of mutual respect. Hedges admired Rickey\u2019s baseball acumen. Rickey appreciated Hedges\u2019 ability to advance in the world and run the Browns using solid business sense.71 Eventually Hedges hired Rickey, who was failing as a lawyer in Boise, Idaho, to do part-time scouting work for the Browns in1912. The next year he offered Rickey a position as assistant and business manager to start in June, after he completed his coaching obligations.72\n\nRickey\u2019s joining the Browns came at an inauspicious time. Arriving on the heels of Stovall\u2019s altercation with Ferguson and subsequent suspension, Rickey soon found himself in conflict with Stovall. Stovall sensed the precarious nature of his position. He chose to confront Hedges and by extension Rickey. Unhappy that Hedges would not grant him authority to make player transactions, he was dismissive of the talent Rickey wished to bring to the Browns, commenting, \u201cI wasn\u2019t running a primary school of baseball in connection with my work as manager of a big-league club.\u201d73 This, plus a growing realization that Stovall was working to recruit players to the newly forming Federal League while still employed by the Browns, forced Hedges\u2019 hand. He dismissed Stovall in September, replacing him with Rickey.74\n\nHedges\u2019 decision to bring Rickey to St. Louis was sound, but events and situations limited the progress he could make. During Rickey\u2019s time with the Browns, the team improved, but Hedges\u2019 constrained financial situation and the emergence of the Federal League hampered progress. Although baseball history notes Rickey\u2019s ultimately successful career, he was at the time a relative novice in the business of the game, experimenting with what worked and what didn\u2019t. Although his ultimate loss to the Cardinals proved fatal to the Browns, there is no assurance that had he stayed with them he would have enjoyed the same success he later experienced with the Cardinals. The Browns were undercapitalized.\n\nThis was for the future. Rickey\u2019s first order of business was to improve a club that had again finished last. Hedges felt the best way to do this was through development of a farm club or system. He had earlier explored purchasing the Kansas City Blues, asking Rickey to run the operation. Rickey, still tied to his coaching duties, turned Hedges down; the deal later fell through.75\n\nThe Browns, like all major-league teams, could protect only a limited number of players on their roster, placing excess talent on minor-league teams, rights to the player going to the minor-league club. Handshake agreements between major-league owners and their minor-league counterparts allowed return of the players should the player prove to be of big-league caliber. Frequently, however, this practice did not work. Players were often sold to the highest bidder; the work of scouts and teams who had found prospects went for naught. Such was the case with Hedges, as teams with more capital to draw on routinely outbid him.76\n\nThe need to establish a system to protect prospects grew more acute with the hiring of Rickey. He had a wide range of connections from his college-coaching days who referred players his way. Even before joining the Browns, Rickey had referred a player to Hedges, only to see him outbid.\n\nIn seeking to resolve this matter, Hedges and Rickey attempted another arrangement. An opportunity presented itself to fund local businessmen in Montgomery, Alabama, to purchase the Montgomery Rebels. Under the proposed arrangement, the Browns could acquire players off the roster for $1,000 at the end of the season. That deal fell through, as the prospective owners could not agree on financial terms. Subsequently, in January 1914, baseball\u2019s then ruling National Commission ruled these types of agreements illegal.77 Although he was stymied, Hedges\u2019 thoughts for working relations between major- and minor-league teams would see fruition under Rickey at another time and another place.\n\nOne player would not get away from the Browns. In 1912 George Sisler began to play for Rickey at the University of Michigan. Upon graduating, Sisler signed with the Browns, an act that eventually caused chaos in baseball\u2019s hierarchy. Previously, when Sisler was still in high school, he had signed a contract with a minor-league club although he did not receive any money or play in any games. The contract eventually progressed through the minor leagues to the Pittsburgh Pirates, whose owner, Barney Dreyfuss, argued that Sisler belonged to him. After a protracted battle, which finally came to the National Commission for adjudication, it was ruled that the contract was invalid as Sisler was underage at the time of the signing. Having played for Rickey, who was by now with the Browns, Sisler signed with St. Louis. The commission\u2019s decision proved so acrimonious that it was a contributing factor in the replacement of the commission by the commissioner system. Sisler went on to be the Browns\u2019 greatest player. Once again, Hedges\u2019 Browns had been in the middle of controversy.78\n\nWhile these developments took place, spring training for the 1914 season had begun; Rickey applied his college-honed training techniques to major-league players. Sprinting exercises, sliding practices, various pitching drills, and lectures on baseball theory characterized St. Louis\u2019s preparation for the 1914 campaign. These were radical concepts for which Rickey drew much ridicule. Cardinals manager Miller Huggins said, \u201cI believe Manager Rickey has a lot of very good ideas, but I am not strong for theory.\u201d On Rickey\u2019s use of specifically designed sandpits to improve sliding skills, Huggins said, \u201cNo ballplayer can learn these things sliding in pits.\u201d79 Despite such criticism, Rickey continued his training strategies.\n\nIt was a mark of Hedges\u2019 management style that he not only backed Rickey\u2019s unorthodox methods but also encouraged him to challenge the status quo. Hedges\u2019 willingness to stand out from the crowd, to initiate a unique way of doing things, did not set well with his contemporaries. Rickey\u2019s approach paid off as the Browns climbed out of the cellar into fifth place in 1914, winning 71 games, their best performance since 1908\u2019s run for the pennant. Normally the Browns\u2019 improvement would have been the source of great satisfaction. However, times were uncertain for established major-league baseball as the fledgling Federal League was competing for players and fans.\n\n\u201cBaseball people, as a rule, are generally allergic to new ideas.\u201d \u2014 Branch Rickey, who struggled as the St. Louis Browns manager in 1913-15 before moving to the Cardinals and finding lasting success. (National Baseball Hall of Fame Library)\n\nUnfortunately for the Browns, one of the better-financed Federal League teams was located in St. Louis. Underwritten by businessman Phil Ball, the St. Louis Terriers made serious inroads in the Mound City\u2019s fan base. The Terriers\u2019 emergence came just as Hedges seemed to be making headway in developing a contending team.\n\nPrior to 1910, the Browns yearly attendance averaged well over 300,000. In their 1908 challenge for the pennant, it rose to more than 600,000. The team\u2019s subsequent deterioration dropped attendance to near 200,000 each year from 1910 to 1913, the worst in the league and a drag on the American League\u2019s overall financial viability. The team\u2019s-fifth place finish in 1914 improved attendance, an accomplishment that might have been greater except for the Terriers\u2019 presence.\n\nHowever, in 1915, the Terriers became a contender, narrowly losing the championship to the Chicago Whales as both their St. Louis rivals finished sixth. Hedges\u2019 club drew just 150,358 patrons, the lowest since he purchased the team.\n\nAs the 1915 season neared completion, plans developed to resolve conflict with the Federal League. Establishment of the league had hurt the two senior circuits as their gate dropped from over 6 million in 1913 to less than 5 million in 1914 and 1915.\n\nThe decreased attendance, coupled with escalating player salaries, strained most teams financially. At the same time, the Federal League\u2019s failure to attract significant National and American League players, coupled with aggressive legal actions and indifferent attendance, contributed to a dubious future for the upstarts.80\n\nHedges had played his part in holding players within the American League. The Browns did not lose a single player off their roster to competing leagues. It was not for the lack of trying.\n\nIn 1914 Stovall, now associated with the Federal League, persuaded one of Hedges\u2019 players, Earl Hamilton, to sign a three-year contract with the Kansas City Packers at twice what he was making with the Browns. Despite being in the midst of a three-year contract with St. Louis, Hamilton agreed. Upon hearing of the defection, Hedges met with Hamilton\u2019s parents with an offer to renegotiate the contract. He convinced them that it was best not to sign with an \u201coutlaw\u201d league, and they persuaded Hamilton to stay with the Browns.81\n\nAll these factors led to demise of the Federal League. Fed players were dispersed to American and National League teams. What was not part of the agreement but understood by all parties to be a major factor in reaching settlement was that Phil Ball could purchase a major-league team, initially thought to be the Cardinals. This turn of events came out of meetings Ball and Johnson had beginning on the eve of the 1915 season. Years later, J.G. Taylor Spink related that in an attempt to hasten the end of the Federals, he arranged to have Ball and Johnson meet on a social basis at McTague\u2019s, a local \u201cgathering place for sportsmen.\u201d82\n\nIt was an unlikely pairing of two iron-willed individuals but they found they enjoyed each other\u2019s company. The two met on subsequent occasions and came to agree that the \u201cruinous war,\u201d as Spink described it, needed to end. Johnson realized that if Ball were to become an owner in the majors, the transaction might aid in resolving the conflict. Likewise, Ball understood his rather substantial advantage in the situation.\n\nBall\u2019s interest in the Cardinals failed to carry when their owner, Helene Britton, after showing initial interest in selling, decided to hold on.83 Johnson, who held considerable sway over American League owners, persuaded Hedges to sell. He likely had an easy time of it as Federal League competition had worn Hedges down. Toward the end of the 1915 season, after rain cancelled a lucrative doubleheader, he shared with sportswriter Sid Keener, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can take this much longer. This \u201cwar\u201d with the Federals, a losing ballclub, and now a rained-out Sunday.\u201d84 Tired, realizing that Rickey might be on the right track but that it would take too long to create a winning club, Hedges wanted out.\n\nHedges owned approximately 60 percent of the team as negotiations began. Ball received an option on the team provided he put down a $30,000 deposit before Christmas. As Christmas came near, Hedges seemed to be having second thoughts about selling.85 One of the Browns\u2019 stockholders delegated to pick up the deposit showed up at Ball\u2019s office right before Christmas, and said it was probably too late to go to the bank and get the $30,000. Ball asked if he wanted the deposit. \u201cThe banks are all closed, and you can\u2019t get it now,\u201d the stockholder said. Ball pulled out $30,000 in gold certificates. \u201cHere it is.\u201d The Browns representative refused to take it, sweeping it to the floor. Ball replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you don\u2019t take it, the woman who cleans up this place will.\u201d Ball left the office. The Browns representative soon followed with the $30,000 in hand.86\n\nThe team sold for between $425,000 and $525,000. Various sources differ.87 Either way, Hedges realized quite a return on his $30,000 investment. The deal did not go smoothly. During final negotiations, it came out that there was a $40,000 liability because Hedges had been helping his ballplayers over the years with advances and loans. That issue was resolved but there was one final hangup. At the last meeting, there was a dispute over a tax of $4.90. Ball recalled, \u201cI had already given drafts for over half a million dollars, and was not only hungry but disgusted. I finally tossed a $5 bill on the table and said, \u201cPay it, let\u2019s eat.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the Browns, Hedges stayed in St. Louis and went into banking. He died on April 23, 1932, the victim of lung cancer. In a bit of irony, his son Robert Jr. married the daughter of Sam Breadon, who eventually came to own the Cardinals.88\n\nRobert Lee Hedges was the only Browns owner who made money on the team. He followed his stated goal of running the ballclub like a business, and in so doing ensured that games were fit for the public\u2019s viewing. His innovations, providing announcers and electric scoreboards, and keeping rowdy elements out of the ballpark, helped popularize the game. Other ideas Hedges championed included the use of multiple umpires to officiate games and the establishment of a farm system to develop players. Both of these eventually came into being, the latter under his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Branch Rickey. Shrewd in the business sense, generous, one who often saw a bigger picture than his contemporaries, Hedges twice took critical actions to end baseball warfare, in 1903 ceding Mathewson to the Giants and 1915 when he sold the Browns to Ball. Both steps brought peace to the game.\n\nPhilip De Catesby Ball\n\n\u201cFor my own recreation\u201d\n\nOther than the fact that they were self-made men, Robert Hedges and Philip Ball were two distinct personalities. Hedges, while a perceptive businessman, was suave and smooth in his dealings. Ball showed an impetuous and short-tempered side while running the Browns. Their guiding light in running the Browns differed. Hedges saw it as a business endeavor, Ball a hobby to enjoy.\n\nUnder Hedges, the Browns were the more popular team in St. Louis. Although the Redbirds now have a rich history of pennants and World Series crowns, their performance during the first quarter of the twentieth century was dismal. During Ball\u2019s first several years as owner of the Browns, they would continue to hold the advantage in attendance and popularity.\n\nHowever, by the time Ball died in 1933, not only had his team lost favor to the Cardinals, more importantly the franchise had become moribund. He was one of many owners who presumed that because that they had thrived in other endeavors, success would follow in baseball.\n\nBall\u2019s approach to running the Browns came out of an early drive to succeed and not a little bit of family heritage. Born in 1864, he came from Keokuk, Iowa. His father, Charles, was a captain during the Civil War and reputedly one of the most proficient poker players in the service. Ball\u2019s great-uncle, Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, fought in the War of 1812 and the Mexican War.89 Jones partially inspired Ball\u2019s mother, who named her son Philip De Catesby, dropping the Ap for De.90\n\nBall\u2019s early years were adventuresome, embracing a wide range of experiences while roaming the country. He was a cowboy, worked on a railroad survey gang, and killed buffalo for their hides before getting into the ice industry.91 Ball\u2019s interest in the business eventually led him to build refrigerated storage facilities. By the time his career ended, he directed a company that operated plants in over 150 locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, becoming a millionaire many times over in the process.\n\nDuring his early years, while working at an ice plant in Shreveport, Louisiana, Ball played catcher for a local team and entertained hopes of a professional career. That hope ended during an altercation involving a knife, his left hand almost severed. His prospects dashed, Ball maintained interest in the game, manifesting itself as the Federal League emerged. Otto Stifel, a brewer prominent in Mound City politics and a booster of its interests, assembled a group of local businessmen, including Ball, to endow the effort. They raised several thousand dollars as an initial investment. Although well-intentioned, most of the participants did not command the massive financial wherewithal to fund a third major-league team for St. Louis.92\n\nWhen the requirement came to fully vest in the club, virtually all of the original investors except Ball and Stifel withdrew. They backed the Terriers through the Federal League\u2019s two seasons of existence, then purchased the Browns. Although Ball purchased the team from Hedges, he was not the sole owner, holding 2,850 (77 percent) of the 3,700 shares. Other owners included Stifel with 733 shares, James W. Garneau, 109 shares, and L.B. Von Weise and S.L. Swarts, 4 shares each.93 He later reminisced, \u201cBaseball is my hobby. I got into the game with the Feds for my personal recreation, and I\u2019m going to stick.\u201d94\n\nAfter Ball took ownership of the franchise, he wasted little time making changes. He named Fielder Jones manager, replacing Rickey. Jones had managed the White Sox to a World Series championship in 1906 and more recently nearly guided Ball\u2019s Terriers to the Federal League pennant in 1915. The move was probably beneficial for the Browns, as Jones had proven success running a team while Rickey\u2019s talents were best suited to front-office endeavors.95\n\nThe reorganized club had Ball as president with Garneau, Jones, and Stifle as vice presidents. Von Weise became the Browns secretary.96 Ominously for Rickey, he was not included on the slate of key officers. Ball\u2019s opinion of Rickey was clear the first time they met. \u201cSo you\u2019re the God-damned prohibitionist!\u201d said Ball, swiping at Rickey\u2019s teetotaler perspective on life.97 Despite Ball\u2019s feelings, he was obligated to keep Rickey on the payroll thanks to a long-term contract signed under Hedges\u2019 aegis.\n\nThe Browns prospered in 1916. Settlement of the Federal League conflict and Ball\u2019s purchase of the team included transferring players from the Terriers to the Browns. The Browns gained pitchers Dave Davenport, Bob Groom, and Eddie Plank, whose combined 41-35 record helped generate a 79-75 record, their best since 1908. Attendance jumped to over 330,000, more than 100,000 better than the crosstown, last-place Cardinals.\n\nHelene Britton may not have been ready to sell the Cardinals after the Federal League wars, but as the 1916 season concluded, she decided it was time to do so. She had just endured a painful divorce, the team was draining money from her estate, and, with attendance at a league low of 224,308, she wanted out.\n\nA group outside St. Louis, collaborating with Cardinals manager Miller Huggins, showed an interest in purchasing the team. That option potentially included moving the franchise. Alarmed, local baseball-minded businessmen gathered and, working with Britton\u2019s attorney, began to generate a plan to purchase the team through a public stock offering. As this process began, a search commenced to find someone to run the team. An informal polling of several sportswriters and sports editors unanimously suggested Rickey would be the best choice.98\n\nAccordingly, the prospective purchasers through their spokesman, James Jones, approached Rickey about whether he had interest in becoming president of the Cardinals. Rickey, who had long understood his future with the Browns was limited, said he would speak to Ball about obtaining release from his contract. According to Rickey\u2019s later recollection, Ball had assured him that if any opportunity came to improve his position, Ball would not stand in the way. And, Rickey said, Ball gave his permission, telling him, \u201cI\u2019ll help you with the contract. Have another meeting with those bastards and get enough to make it good.\u201d\n\nArmed with Ball\u2019s encouragement, Rickey soon signed with the Cardinals; only to have Ball suddenly go back on his word. Ball\u2019s about-face came after he heard from Ban Johnson. Ball told Rickey, \u201cI\u2019ve just talked to Ban Johnson. It\u2019s all off. He said under no circumstances must this fellow be lost to the American League.\u201d Rickey told Ball he had just signed a contract, there was no turning back. The Browns owner, fearing Johnson\u2019s wrath, told Rickey he would deny ever having encouraged him to go with the Cardinals. Rickey, stunned by Ball\u2019s about-face, responded, \u201cMr. Ball, whether or not I ever go with the Cardinals, I\u2019ll never work another day for you!\u201d99\n\nBall sought an injunction to prevent Rickey from breaching his contract. Ball winced as Rickey recounted their conversations in court, including his denigrating opinions of the prospective Cardinals owners. Faced with an increasingly uncomfortable position \u2014 Rickey would not work for him even if he won the case \u2014 Ball\u2019s attorneys obtained an injunction delaying Rickey\u2019s joining the Cardinals for 24 hours. Ball may have saved face on legal grounds but he lost overall. Because of this, more than any other factor, the Browns would eventually be lost to St. Louis. It was not apparent at the time or for a few years, but with Rickey\u2019s move, the Cardinals franchise began to ascend at the Browns\u2019 expense. It was telling that Johnson, not Ball, knew of Rickey\u2019s potential.\n\nOne of the first things Rickey did after going over to the Cardinals was help put in place \u201cThe Knothole Gang.\u201d This program, sponsored by Cardinals stockholders, allowed poor youngsters to attend games. Lifetime Cardinals fans came out of this promotional initiative, whose ramifications the Browns realized only too late.\n\nBall replaced Rickey with minor-league executive Bob Quinn. Quinn had been the longtime business manager for Columbus in the American Association. While he was not as broad a visionary as Rickey, Quinn\u2019s reputation as a solid baseball executive and shrewd judge of talent attracted Ball.\n\nScrupulously honest, Quinn quickly set Ball straight on his business philosophy while negotiating to join the Browns organization. The Browns owner told Quinn, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to the job. All you need is bunk and bluff.\u201d Quinn replied, \u201cI have never practiced bunk or bluff in my life.\u201d100 That exchange reflected the different perspectives each had on running the ballclub. Moreover, it showed that Quinn knew how to deal with the aggressive and demanding Ball, who only respected those who stood up to him. Over the next several seasons, Quinn, interrupted by World War I and Ball\u2019s occasional meddling, gradually assembled the great 1922 club that narrowly missed winning the pennant.\n\nOne never knew what Ball might do. Early in his ownership, Ball, who enjoyed flying, decided to fly into Detroit to see his team. Arriving at the team hotel, he went into the dining room to see his players. None were there. He learned that they took their $5 daily meal money, went to a cheap restaurant, spending about 75 cents, and pocketed the rest. Incensed, feeling he was being cheated, Ball dropped the per-diem arrangement, instead forcing players to sign for their meals in the hotel. Often generous, he balked at what he saw as being taken advantage of in matters as trivial as this.101\n\nQuinn\u2019s first year with the club, 1917, tested his resolve. The team fell to seventh, owing in part to several key injuries. As if this were not challenge enough, Ball\u2019s meddlesome nature made a poor season miserable. The team had fallen into last place in September when Ball responded to the question \u201cwhat was the matter with his team?\u201d He responded that \u201che didn\u2019t know, and wasn\u2019t competent to judge, but that a lot of people had been telling him the players were \u2018laying down\u2019 on the manager and he meant to kid (sic) them where it would hurt \u2014 in their pay checks.\u201d102\n\nAs a TSN article pointed out, it was one thing for \u201ca thousand or two\u201d other people to point out that the level of play was indifferent. It was quite another for the owner of the team to share such sentiments publicly. Ball subsequently claimed he had not said players were performing indifferently. However, by giving credence to the comments of others and saying that financial repercussions for apathetic effort might follow, he essentially endorsed those observations. Further exacerbating the situation, Ball made it known he thought only three players on the team, Jimmy Austin, Hank Severeid, and Sisler, were giving their all.\n\nThe next day Johnny Lavan, Del Pratt, and Burt Shotton, each of whom resented Ball\u2019s comments, asked that he apologize. Ball backed off, and offered to have a retraction printed. Despite this, several days later Lavan and Pratt sued Ball for libel, setting off a chain reaction.103\n\nBefore the 1918 season began, St. Louis traded all three players \u2014 Lavan and Shotton to Washington, Pratt to the Yankees. The trial for libel began during spring training with plaintiffs commencing their efforts by deposing rival players to offer their opinions of Lavan and Pratt\u2019s play. Ty Cobb averred during deposition that the pair \u201chad always been honorable\u201d and that Ball had \u201crushed into something without thinking.\u201d104\n\nUnder the specter of additional players testifying throughout the season, pressure commenced to settle the case as soon as possible. Ban Johnson, Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert, and manager Clark Griffith of the Washington Senators pushed Lavan and Pratt toward resolution of the matter.105 Under pressure from their new teams, they agreed to settle the matter for $2,700 apiece.106 Significantly, Johnson worked the details out with Quinn, not Ball.\n\nAlthough Ball claimed he did not have to pay a cent to settle the dispute, the American League footing the bill, he lost a fine player in Pratt. Part of the challenge St. Louis faced in the early \u201920s was finding a serviceable second baseman. This incident reminded all that Quinn not only had to deal with the business of running a ball club, but managing an impetuous owner as well.\n\nSt. Louis Browns owner Phil Ball, second from left, meets with American League owners Frank Navin (Detroit Tigers, far left), Clark Griffith (Washington Senators, middle), Ben Shibe (Philadelphia A\u2019s, second from right), and American League president Ban Johnson, far right, in Chicago, circa 1920. (Chicago History Museum, Chicago Daily News collection, SDN-062283)\n\nThe Browns, and all of baseball, felt the effects of World War I. At first the war had little impact on the game but as it continued, the draft, enlistments, or pressure to work in war-related defense jobs increasingly affected player availability. Additionally, in 1918, the government \u201cadvised\u201d the major leagues to shorten the season by a month. Attendance at American League games in 1917 dropped 50 percent, from 3.4 million in 1916 to 1.7 million. Browns attendance decreased from 335,000 to 122,000. Amid these and other war-related incidents, Sisler biographer Rick Huhn wrote, attendance further suffered from race riots in the city, which helped deter fans from going to games at a segregated Sportsman\u2019s Park. Ball and Quinn could do nothing more than bide their time on improving the franchise.107\n\nPhil Ball is often recalled for his irascible tendencies, for speaking without thinking or interfering in the team\u2019s operations, as he did in the case of Lavan and Pratt. Often overlooked is that Ball had the wherewithal to trust Quinn, giving him authority to make deals. It was Ball\u2019s money to spend \u2014 he trusted Quinn to do it wisely. Once the war ended, Quinn resumed improving the team through trades and acquisitions. He obtained Wally Gerber, Bill Jacobson, and Ken Williams out of the military. Williams, second only to Sisler in ability, came to St. Louis as a pairing of Quinn\u2019s ability to recognize talent and Ball\u2019s willingness to spend $4,500 to obtain it.108 Quinn subsequently purchased second baseman Marty McManus from the minors as well for $5,000 a high figure at the time.109\n\nRay Gillespie, a sportswriter for the St. Louis Star, commented on Quinn\u2019s role in running the Browns, \u201cHe and he alone could handle Phil Ball during his cranky spells.\u201d110 On one occasion, he asked Ball to okay a $2,000 bonus for pitcher Urban Shocker. Shocker, obtained by Quinn from the Yankees in a deft deal, had won 20 games, one of four times he would do so for St. Louis. Ball sarcastically retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to do with my money \u2014 get generous?\u201d He felt that players were not worthy of their salaries because they did not work as hard as those employed in his ice-plant business.111 Quinn was having none of that. \u201cNot generous \u2014 only honest,\u201d Quinn replied. Shocker received the bonus.112\n\nToward the end of his life, Ball claimed he made money on the Browns only once, in 1922, \u201cnot before or since\u201d however, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said that the 1924 season \u201cmarked the eighth time in eleven seasons the team earned money for the present ownership.\u201d Presumably, that time span included Ball\u2019s ownership of the Federal League Terriers.113\n\nBall\u2019s outlook on how little he cared about making a profit made itself felt during Quinn\u2019s tenure. As a story goes, Quinn called off a game with the Red Sox because of rain. An angry Ball asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason for this? Why isn\u2019t there a game?\u201d Quinn told Ball there were only a few hundred fans in the stands and that the game would be part of a doubleheader, making the event more profitable. Ball roared at Quinn, \u201cBob Quinn, let me tell you something. I worked myself to a frazzle at the office so I could see this game, and if you want to keep your job, don\u2019t ever do anything like this to me again.\u201d114\n\nWhile Quinn was building a contending team, Otto Stifel sold his minority interest in the Browns to Walter Fritsch.115 Stifel had induced Ball to become owner of the Terriers, then joined with him to purchase the Browns. For the most part, his was a silent presence. Prominent in local politics, he saw his finances begin to unravel over the years. Described as a \u201csportsman,\u201d he lost heavily on horse racing. Stifel\u2019s brewery interests fell victim to the imposition of Prohibition in 1918. Anticipating its impending passage, he converted his commercial activities to manufacturing of oleomargarine and butter substitutes, which proved far less lucrative. Less than a year after severing his connection with the Browns in December 1919, Stifel killed himself. He left a somewhat confused suicide note blaming his financial fall on Prohibition, banks, family, and friends. The note said, \u201cI lost my head and appealed to Walter Fritsch and Phil Ball.\u201d No further explanation of how they were involved in this tragedy ever surfaced.116\n\nFritsch, to whom Stifel referred, had purchased Stifel\u2019s shares. A longtime acquaintance of Ball\u2019s, Fritsch was associated with the Benjamin Moore paint company in St. Louis, specializing in promotion of their products for auto and rail manufacturers. More of a fan than anything else, he had little influence in running the club. Content with being treated as \u201cone of the boys,\u201d Fritsch often joined in spring-training drills, socialized with players and traveled with the club during the season.117 He maintained a box down the third-base line, often the first to buy his season ticket each year, even after selling his interest in the club.\n\nUnder Quinn\u2019s patient efforts, the Browns slowly improved, finishing fourth to reach the first division in 1920; they had not finished that high since 1908. They were still the favored team in St. Louis. The Cardinals under the management of Rickey on and off the field were steadily improving and drawing better, in no small part because of Rogers Hornsby, arguably the best player in the National League. The Browns countered with George Sisler, probably second only to Babe Ruth in the American League. More often than not, they continued to draw more fans than the Cardinals, in 1920 by over 90,000 fans.\n\nIn 1920 Ball made another decision that was a major factor in the eventual demise of the Browns franchise. Robison Field, the Cardinals\u2019 ballpark, had fallen into a state of severe disrepair. Sam Breadon, by now the Cardinals\u2019 president, did not have the wherewithal to refurbish or refinance a new ballpark. He estimated that it would cost over half a million dollars to overhaul the facility.118 By 1920, the place had become a firetrap, ready to collapse, Breadon was told by a building inspector friend that the ballpark would not pass a fire inspection.119\n\nDesperate, not having the cash to fix the ballpark, Breadon approached Ball to see if he could rent Sportsman\u2019s Park for the Cardinals\u2019 home games. Ball rebuffed him: \u201cAre you crazy, Sam? I wouldn\u2019t let Branch Rickey put one foot inside my ballpark. Now get out yourself.\u201d Facing financial calamity, Breadon was persistent. After several attempts, he finally asked Ball to listen to his plea. Ball relented.\n\n\u201cI was a poor boy \u2014 a very poor boy \u2014 in New York. I came here to St. Louis, nearly starved at first, but eventually made some money in the automobile business. I got into the Cardinals with that fan group \u2014 soon got in over my head \u2014 and much of my money is in the club. We\u2019re heavily in debt, and our only chance to salvage what we put into it is to sell the Cardinals\u2019 real estate (the ballpark) for $200,000, get out of debt, and move to Sportsman\u2019s Park. You\u2019re a rich man, Mr. Ball; money doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, but I\u2019m about to go broke, and only you can save me.\u201d120\n\nIf anything over the years, Ball respected determination, and often behind his blustery fa\u00e7ade resided the temperament of a caring individual. Breadon\u2019s entreaty hit the mark.\n\n\u201cSam, I didn\u2019t know you were hooked so bad. I admire your frankness, and what\u2019s more I admire a fighter, a man that doesn\u2019t quit easily. Get your lawyer to draw up a contract, insert a rental figure you think is fair and I\u2019ll sign it. Even if it included having that Rickey around the place.\u201d121\n\nWith Ball\u2019s agreement to take on the Cardinals as tenants, Breadon was able to sell Robison Field for $275,000, clear outstanding debts, and provide working capital for the future. One of the main initiatives Breadon \u2014 and Rickey \u2014 could now pursue was establishment of a minor-league system that generated competitive clubs for decades to come.122\n\nThe team improved in 1921, finishing third, and in 1922 came in second, one game behind the Yankees, setting an attendance record of almost 713,000. The Browns had reached the zenith of their popularity in St. Louis. Although various numbers were shared over the years, it was estimated that Ball made more than $300,000 in 1922.123 He was generous in sharing profits with players and management, an action that further contributed to undoing the franchise. A large bonus for Quinn enabled him to join a consortium of investors who bought the Boston Red Sox. Quinn was replaced by William Friel, a former player and minor-league executive. Friel never gained the level of confidence with Ball that Quinn had enjoyed. He lasted with the club until 1932 before being eased out of the organization.124\n\nThe Browns proved a one-year wonder. In 1923 they tumbled to fifth, wracked by dissension and the devastating loss of Sisler for the entire season due to sinus maladies. Ball blamed manager Lee Fohl for the team\u2019s decline and began interfering in management of the team, firing Fohl in midseason. Ball\u2019s meddling, kept in check with Quinn running the team, gradually increased over the ensuing years\n\nSisler returned to the team in 1924, never the same player who averaged .400 between 1920 and 1922. Ball made him the Browns\u2019 player-manager. It was a position Sisler did not want and for which he was temperamentally unsuited. The team, however, finished fourth and third the first two years of his tenure.\n\nAfter the 1922 season, Ball considered expanding the capacity of Sportsman\u2019s Park. It was around this time that he faced a personal crisis. His doctors told him he was going to die soon. Convinced this was the case, he sold all his business holdings; TSN estimated they were in the range of $5 million. When the doctors\u2019 prognosis proved faulty, Ball got back into the ice-plant business.125 Convinced he was on the road to recovery, Ball plunged ahead with plans he had been contemplating to refurbish Sportsman\u2019s Park.\n\nThe $500,000 project began in 1925. Expansion of the grandstands increased seating by 10,000, with extension of the second deck going all the way down the foul lines. Plans went forward despite the Cardinals having balked at a rent increase to cover the improvements. Ball finally decided to start the project without their cooperation.126 The project finished in time for the 1926 season. It proved a boon \u2014 to the Cardinals. That season the dynamics of major-league baseball in St. Louis underwent a seismic shift in fan loyalty \u2014 a shift that remained permanent for the remaining life of the Browns franchise.\n\n1926 and Beyond: Ascendancy of the Redbirds\n\nAs the 1926 pennant race began, every major-league team except the Browns and Cardinals had won at least one pennant since the modern baseball era began in 1901. During the 1925 season, the Browns finished third behind the Senators; the Cardinals came in fourth behind the pennant-winning Pirates, showing marked progress over their sixth-place effort the year before.\n\nIt was still a Browns town. From 1902 through 1925, the Browns\u2019 attendance averaged nearly 60,000 more than that of their National League counterparts.127 Figures for 1925 reflected the same relationship, the Browns drawing over 50,000 more than the Cardinals. In 1926, however, this would all change as St. Louis\u2019s allegiance irrevocably shifted to the Redbirds.\n\nThe Cardinals won the pennant and a thrilling seven-game series against the Yankees, and in the process generated an attendance nearly 400,000 greater than that of the seventh-place Browns. Rickey\u2019s farm system came to fruition. From 1926 until the Browns left St. Louis in 1953, the Cardinals won eight more pennants. The Browns won one. Over that time the Browns averaged about 250,000 yearly attendance; the Cardinals nearly 660,000. Only once did the Browns outdraw the Cardinals \u2014 in 1944 when they won their lone pennant. From 1926 through 1953, their attendance was the lowest in the league save for two seasons during World War II.128\n\nThe remaining years of Ball\u2019s ownership saw the team\u2019s fortunes decline. Several factors contributed, including Ball himself. Without the calming presence of Quinn, Ball\u2019s abrasive and at times eccentric personality became more pronounced. One person with whom he clashed was Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the commissioner of baseball.\n\nTheir quarrel originated when Landis, then a federal judge, presided a case brought by the Federal League owners against the National League. Landis\u2019s inaction in resolving the case had a decided influence on the Federal League\u2019s eventual demise. While Ball was able to transfer his ownership from the Terriers to the Browns, there was no love lost for Landis.\n\nBall\u2019s animosity toward Landis continued after Landis became commissioner. He was the only owner not to sign the document that made Landis commissioner. When Landis and Ban Johnson engaged in a power play, Ball backed the increasingly beleaguered American League president.\n\nFurther conflict emerged when Ball took Landis to court in 1930 over the status of a minor leaguer in the Browns system. Landis ruled in favor of the minor league club. Ball took Landis to court, arguing that he had no authority to act on the matter. Ball lost and planned an appeal. Landis summoned American League owners to his office and told them to live up to their agreement giving him broad authority to run the game or he would quit. The owners backed Landis.129\n\nSince the departure of Quinn. nobody had been able to blunt Ball\u2019s harsher side. In 1928 Ball brought Lee Carle \u201cL.C.\u201d McEvoy into the Browns organization as vice president. McEvoy began his career as a college athletic director before getting into the oil industry in Oklahoma in 1913. He did quite well financially, and his interest in sports, particularly baseball, led him to become a minor-league executive. In 1920 he became president of the Western League. His work attracted Ball\u2019s attention and in 1928 Ball put him in charge of the Browns\u2019 minor-league affiliates.130 Within a few years, McEvoy took over Friel\u2019s functions as business manager. Friel resigned in December of 1932, his role with the club having become superfluous after what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch described as \u201cseveral bad seasons \u2014 financial as well as artistic.\u201d131 McEvoy proved somewhat able to curb Ball\u2019s rougher side on occasion but not always.\n\nMcEvoy\u2019s joining the club coincided with a jump in the Browns\u2019 fortunes. After two seventh-place finishes, the Browns jumped back into the first division in 1928, helped by the solid performance of players like pitcher Alvin Crowder and outfielder Heinie Manush. But their finish was no match for the Cardinals, who won their second pennant.\n\nIn mid-1930 Manush supposedly snubbed Ball when the owner wanted to visit with him. Almost simultaneously, Ball attended a game when Crowder was pitching. Crowder, outraged after an umpire called a ball on a crucial pitch, threw the ball into the stands. It narrowly missed hitting Ball and his guests. Angered, Ball called Clark Griffith, owner of the Senators, and dealt Crowder and Manush from the club at a decided disadvantage to his team. In 1929 Crowder went 17-15 and Manush hit .355. After they left, the Browns never finished higher than fifth under Ball\u2019s watch.132\n\nBy then Ball had soured on the team, expending minimal funds on their operations. In 1931 only 27 players were brought to spring training. Offering minimum contracts, Ball sought to improve performances by offering bonuses to play better. Former major leaguer Bill Killefer had been hired to manage the club but his ability to lead the team was hampered by Ball\u2019s increasing interference. Killefer recalled, \u201cPhil Ball, the owner, had a bonus arrangement with every player on the club, but I didn\u2019t know it. I\u2019d give the bunt sign to someone like Red Kress, and he\u2019d look at me like I was crazy and then swing from the heels. His bonus, it seemed, paid off on so many home runs.\u201d133\n\nWhile the Cardinals won consecutive pennants in 1930-31, the Browns went downhill. By 1933, attendance was just over 88,000 fans. The Depression compromised Ball\u2019s ability to spend money on the team. As the season entered the closing weeks, Ball contracted septicemia at his summer home in Minnesota. Also suffering from high blood pressure, Ball died on October 22, 1933, his 69th birthday. A year earlier, in an interview with Harry T. Brundidge for The Sporting News about his ambitions, Ball responded, \u201cTo win a pennant, of course.\u201d His obituary in TSN a year later closed with this observation: \u201cAnd Ball the true sportsman, went away without that pennant. Instead he had his first cellar champion in 1933.\u201d134 Indeed he had, as the Browns finished nine games behind the seventh-place Boston Red Sox. It was their first eighth-place finish in 20 years, a sad ending for Ball\u2019s tenure as owner of the Browns.\n\nInterregnum: The Phil Ball Estate\n\nBall\u2019s estate immediately assumed ownership of the club. Given the right deal, Mrs. Ball would sell the Browns. Immediate speculation centered on oil mogul Harry F. Sinclair as a potential buyer.135 Sinclair, owner of Sinclair Oil, had been a heavy financier of the Federal League.136 Speculation on Sinclair\u2019s possible interest noted his close relationship with Ball and suggested there had been financial dealings between the two \u2014 even to the point that Sinclair may have held part-ownership in the Browns. However, the same article noted that Sinclair\u2019s \u201cattitude toward costly sporting ventures had cooled\u201d in recent years. Nothing ever developed out of that line of conjecture.\n\nWithin several weeks of Ball\u2019s passing, the Browns\u2019 board of directors named Louis B. Von Weise president. Von Weise had been a minority stockholder in the club since Ball\u2019s takeover in 1916. Having a business background, he and his brother initially operated a department store; subsequently Von Weise became associated with Ball\u2019s business ventures. Gradually he became known as Ball\u2019s \u201cright-hand man,\u201d a trusted confidant serving in various capacities as a director and vice president of Ball\u2019s far-flung concerns.137 At the time he was named president, Von Weise was director of the City Ice and Fuel Company of Cleveland. Neither Von Weise nor McEvoy had any experience in running the baseball side of the club.\n\nVon Weise immediately made it clear that the board would defer to manager Rogers Hornsby. \u201c(Hornsby) knows the ropes, is an aggressive, sound thinking man and I propose to let him have full sway with the teams and the players he will work with,\u201d Von Weise said.138\n\nOne of Ball\u2019s last actions as owner of the team had been to hire Hornsby as manager in July 1933. He had been recommended by various individuals, had been successful as manager of the Cardinals\u2019 World Series team in 1926, and still had the ability to pinch-hit occasionally. Ball hoped to lure local fans to the ballpark on the strength of Hornsby\u2019s accomplishments with the Cardinals.\n\nOn the face of it, Von Weise\u2019s pronouncement seemed wise. The challenge facing him and Hornsby did not so much concern the players Hornsby had to work with but rather the financial health of Ball\u2019s estate. It could not support the ballclub in a manner required to improve its lot. While TSN noted the estate\u2019s desire to sell, timing was poor \u2014 1933 was in the depths of the Depression and \u201cwaiting till better times came\u201d became the operative strategy.139 Von Weise, perhaps hoping to set the tone for negotiations, indicated a tentative feeler to purchase the club at $300,000 was out of the question \u2014 he suggested that even a price tag of $400,000 was well below the mark.140 This maneuvering did nothing to generate interest in a club that was no longer investing in its future or making bids for the talented players necessary to improve, if not maintain, the franchise\u2019s worth.\n\nThe Browns struggled through the next several years, selling off promising players to meet financial obligations as the estate continued withholding capital from the ailing club. In 1935 only 80,922 came to Browns games. At one, just 34 people showed up. As Hornsby later put it, \u201c[W]e were under the estate of Mr. Ball and had to sell some players to keep going.\u201d141 The downward spiral continued through the 1936 season.\n\nVon Weise tried to revive interest in the club, announcing a \u201cPhil Ball Memorial,\u201d which gave deserving high-school students passes to Browns games. It was an attempt to emulate the Cardinals Knothole Gang, which had started nearly 20 years earlier, but in the overall scheme of things it was too little, too late.142 Lack of commercial savvy hurt the club as well. When Von Weise was asked about continuing radio broadcasts of games, he observed, \u201cI think the radio has its good features \u2014 then again we have our paying clientele to look after. It might even have been that we were giving away the thing we were trying to sell.143\n\nIn fairness to Von Weise, he was in the unenviable situation of trying to maintain an impoverished asset and at the same time run his own business interests. By the middle of 1934, he was spending much of his time out of town overseeing various ice operations and felt he needed to relinquish the presidency of the Browns.144 Plans were floated to have William R. Cady, Ball\u2019s son-in-law, assume the presidency, but opposition from the Ball estate prevented this action, forcing Von Weise to stay on.145 This evidence of internal discord, and Von Weise\u2019s occasional interference with player transactions counter to Hornsby\u2019s recommendations, did not engender a needed sense of stability.\n\nThe American League openly pushed for sale of the club. League President William Harridge, committed to finding a buyer, felt that \u201cthe club would gradually decay, lose prestige and become a drain on the heirs.\u201d He thought that an estate running the franchise robbed the club of the clear leadership St. Louis required.146\n\nAt the end of 1935, a syndicate headed by one Walter M. Smith, described as \u201cgeneral manager for Woolworth Stores in the Southwest,\u201d was prepared to offer $325,000 for the club; the estate\u2019s asking price was $375,000. After meeting with representatives of Ball\u2019s estate, Smith commented, \u201cWe have already made considerable progress. \u2026 I am confident we can raise sufficient money to put over the deal. Much remains to be done of course, but at our next meeting considerably more progress should be made.\u201d The article describing Smith\u2019s interest noted that if the purchase went through, Smith would become president and George Sisler, vice president. This most popular Brownie was living in St. Louis and running a sporting-goods store.147 Within weeks the deal collapsed as Smith backed out of negotiations. While Sisler was mentioned as trying to arrange a new group of investors, nothing came of the effort.148\n\nThere the matter stood through 1936 as the Browns remained moribund, playing in the lower echelons of the second division. In late August, Von Weise was interviewed while visiting St. Louis. His remote control of the club was illustrated when he mentioned attending his first game of the season. He said the franchise was \u201cin good financial condition.\u201d However Von Weise\u2019s glowing commentary fell on deaf ears. It was observed that after Von Weise said everything was doing fine, \u201cthe newspaper fellows ran right back to their offices, swallowing their hot dogs on the way to make the editions.\u201d Sportswriter Dick Farrington wrote sarcastically, \u201cSo you see, the Browns are not so bad after all. They are ahead of the Athletics and there is no ninth place.\u201d149\n\nAfter the 1936 season, criticism was no longer limited to external comments: Hornsby began to take aim at the team\u2019s leadership. In an interview carried in TSN, the manager bemoaned the lack of talent, especially pitching, and then ventured into areas beyond the playing field. \u201cThere are three or four playboys on the team. They are fellows who must be handled like a chain gang. But you couldn\u2019t put all these fellows in their places by continuing to fine only one of them.\u201d The article said that front-office interference prevented disciplinary actions from taking place. It added, \u201cA breach seems to have come between Rog (Hornsby) and Louis Von Weise, remote control president of the club,\u201d an unmistakable comment on the team\u2019s absentee control.\n\nHornsby observed that nothing had been done to improve the Browns, and probably wouldn\u2019t until winter meetings in December, a rather dismal outlook. Farrington\u2019s article observed that there had been some rumors on potential buyers of the club but that at that point they were just rumors.150 Things were about to change rather quickly.\n\nOther clubs in the league suffered from St. Louis\u2019s poor attendance. Trips to Sportsman\u2019s Park consistently lost money as traveling costs easily outpaced the visitors\u2019 share of the gate. Pressure mounted on Von Weise and the estate to sell a franchise decreasing in value. Von Weise, desperate to unload the Browns, offered a $25,000 fee to anyone who could produce a buyer for the club.151\n\nDon Barnes Buys the Browns\n\n\u201cSomething should be done to revive the American League club in St. Louis\u201d\n\nThat fee would be earned by Ball\u2019s former nemesis, Branch Rickey. Rickey\u2019s assistant was Bill DeWitt Sr. and DeWitt\u2019s wife was best friends with Anita Barnes. She was the daughter of Don Barnes, president of American Investment Company. The innovative firm specialized in financing installment payments on automobiles.152\n\nOne night DeWitt and his wife had dinner with Barnes and his daughter. As DeWitt later related, \u201cJust to make conversation, I mentioned the Browns\u2019 story and Don said he was interested in getting into baseball. It floored me. I knew him only as a fan. It had never occurred to me that he might want to buy in.\u201d153\n\nBarnes took a different approach than his predecessors in creating a deal. He suggested to DeWitt, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we let the public own it. That\u2019s the way to build up interest.\u201d Obtaining approval from the Missouri Securities Commission, Barnes sold baseball fans on buying stock in the team at $5 a share.154 The complicated process of putting together a consortium of investors private and public began.\n\nBall\u2019s estate asked $325,000 for the franchise. Sportsman\u2019s Park was not included in the deal, although it would soon become part of the overall negotiation process. From the outset DeWitt was included in the Browns\u2019 plans, tentatively as business manager with the blessings of Rickey and Breadon.155 Intentions were that Hornsby would continue managing.\n\nEven though the sale of the ballpark was not part of the negotiations, rental of the facility quickly became a central part of the discussions. Barnes and his investors felt the $35,000 annual rental was excessive given that the Browns\u2019 attendance had been under 100,000 for several seasons.156\n\nOther issues emerged. Barnes\u2019s group, having seen the success night baseball garnered in Cincinnati in 1935, asked that the American League\u2019s ban on night games be lifted, a request that was honored. In this, the Cardinals who were using Sportsman\u2019s Park, supported Barnes.157\n\nThe Ball estate also demanded that the American League pay them an eighth of the league\u2019s \u201creserve fund,\u201d claiming Ball had paid into it over the years since 1916 and that the estate deserved recompense. League officials denied this request, arguing that the fund was set up to protect the entire league, the unstated premise being that Ball went into this arrangement knowingly. Yet another wrinkle to be ironed out was DeWitt\u2019s role in the purchase; owners who would vote on accepting Barnes\u2019s eventual offer had to feel comfortable that there was no \u201cinter-league or inter-club connection.\u201d While not a major concern, the issue had to be addressed.158\n\nTSN identified several people associated with Barnes\u2019s efforts to purchase the club: DeWitt, Andrew Johnson, Edgar E. Rand, Brad Shinkle, Talton Francis, and Alonzo G. Curtis. Rand\u2019s father was chairman of the board of the International Shoe Company, a major shoe manufacturer in St. Louis. Johnson was vice president. Francis was with Francis Brothers Investment Company. Shinkle was vice president and treasurer of the Johnson, Stephens and Shinkle Shoe Company. Curtis was a retired Grand Rapids industrialist. Others mentioned as part of the syndicate were described as in some way \u201cidentified\u201d with Barnes\u2019 American Investment Company.159 That two shoe manufacturers were involved in the purchase could have nothing but revived the old saying \u201cFirst in shoes\u2026\u201d\n\nAll potential issues that might have blocked the deal were soon swept aside. Within a matter of weeks, American League owners gave their approval for his purchase on November 12, 1936, at a meeting in Chicago. There was good reason to approve Barnes\u2019s offer. Nearly three years earlier Von Weise had decried a proffered tender of $300,000 for the club, intimating that an offer of $400,000 would also be too low. Over the ensuing years moribund attendance proved to have an adverse affect on the franchise\u2019s value and on revenue rival clubs received for playing in St. Louis. The Ball estate wanted out of a worsening situation and Barnes\u2019s legitimate offer of $325,000 relieved it of a deteriorating asset.\n\nAmerican League owners saw Barnes\u2019 offer as a way out of their difficulties. Barnes, somewhat in the driver\u2019s seat, got the deal he wanted. At the Chicago meeting Barnes hammered the owners for approval to play night games. Heretofore opposed to evening contests, they acquiesced, granting conditional approval for Barnes to move ahead on this initiative. Agreement on the ability to play night games (he would have to finance installation of lights at Sportsman\u2019s Park together with the Cardinals), and obtaining lower rent for Sportsman\u2019s Park satisfied Barnes and his backers.\n\nDeWitt subsequently described essentials of the financing. Stockbrokers arranged for 1,300 people to buy $100,000 in shares. Barnes put $50,000 into the purchase of the team, as did Curtis. DeWitt invested $25,000. International Shoe Company, a major St. Louis shoe manufacturer put in a further $50,000 as did the league.160 An additional $175,000 was raised to finance working funds for the purchase of ballplayers and ongoing expenses.161\n\nWith approval of Barnes\u2019s purchase, control of the Browns passed from Ball\u2019s estate. Ownership under the Ball regime was just shy of 20 years. Although figures varied at the time he purchased the Browns, it was estimated that he spent anywhere from $425,000 to $525,000. With a selling price of $325,000 \u2014 and taking into account money spent covering near-annual deficits in operating expenses \u2014 the investment had not been a good one.\n\nThe new owner of the Browns was somewhat similar to Hedges and Ball, a self-made man. Born in Chicago in 1894, he grew up in humble circumstances, his father having died when Barnes was 2. Moving to Springfield, Illinois, Barnes entered the business world and at the age of 22, formed the Illinois Investment Company. As opportunities beckoned, he moved to St. Louis in 1930, heading the American Investment Company, which at the time he purchased the Browns operated out of 24 offices. This was built on an original investment of $2,500.162 Oper"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/athletes/satchel-paige", "page_content": "(1906-1982)\n\nWho Was Satchel Paige?\n\nLeroy Robert \"Satchel\" Paige honed his pitching talents in reform school. Denied entry to the Major Leagues, he began his professional baseball career in the Negro Leagues in 1926 and became its most famous showman. Paige finally broke through to the Majors as a 42-year-old rookie, and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSatchel Paige was born Leroy Robert Page circa July 7, 1906, in Mobile, Alabama. He was the seventh of 12 children born to father John, a gardener, and mother Lula, a washerwoman. It was Lula who added the \"i\" to their surname not long before Paige was to start his illustrious career; he maintained that she changed it to sound \"high-tone.\"\n\nAccording to Paige, his mother sent him to earn money carrying luggage for businessmen at the train station, but he was frustrated with the pittance it paid. So he rigged a pole to carry several bags at once to make the job pay better, and his co-workers purportedly told him, \"You look like a walking satchel tree\"; hence his unique nickname.\n\nA run-in with the law, through petty theft and truancy, got Paige \"enrolled\" in reform school at age 12. But his stay at the Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs, Alabama, may have been a blessing in disguise. His baseball talent, coupled with big hands and feet on his long, lanky frame\u2014he would grow to 6'4\"\u2014were recognized by coach Edward Byrd as assets that could be developed.\n\nByrd taught Paige to pull back, kick his foot high in the air and, as he came down, bring his arm from way behind and thrust his hand forward as he released the ball, giving it maximum power as it hurtled forward. Paige later said, \"You might say I traded five years of freedom to learn how to pitch.\"\n\nProfessional Baseball Career\n\nWith African American players barred from the Major Leagues, Paige began his professional career in 1926 in the Negro Southern League. His record with the Birmingham Black Barons did not go unnoticed and he moved quickly through the ranks of the Negro National League teams, becoming a popular draw among audiences.\n\nPaige played for teams all over the country, from California to Maryland to North Dakota and even in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Between contracts, Paige built quite a following through barnstorming tours, which consisted of exhibition games against other professionals and regional talent that provided extra money. In one such game, he was hired to front a team called the \"Satchel Paige All-Stars\" and ended up pitching to New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio, who called him \"the best and fastest pitcher I've ever faced.\"\n\nPaige also once opposed St. Louis Cardinals ace Dizzy Dean in a series of exhibition games, winning four of them. Afterward, Dean noted, \"If Satch and I were pitching on the same team, we'd clinch the pennant by the fourth of July and go fishing until World Series time.\"\n\nOne downside to all this travel and team-jumping was a lack of statistics, since even in official Negro League games, there could be a dearth of statisticians or record keepers. According to some accounts, Paige compiled 31 wins against just four losses in 1933, and also accumulated streaks of 64 consecutive scoreless innings and 21 straight victories. Paige insisted that he kept his own records and reported pitching in more than 2,500 games and winning 2,000 or so, as well as playing for 250 teams and throwing 250 shutouts, staggering numbers when compared to those of Major League pitchers.\n\nMajor League Recognition\n\nIn 1948, Paige's dream came true. With the big league color barrier broken by Jackie Robinson and the Cleveland Indians in need of extra pitching, owner Bill Veeck gave the veteran Negro League star a tryout. Veeck reportedly laid a cigarette on the ground and told Paige to think of it as home plate; the hurler then threw five fastballs, all but one sailing directly over the cigarette.\n\nOn July 7, 1948, his 42nd birthday, Paige became the oldest player to debut in the Major Leagues, as well as the first Negro League pitcher in the American League. Drawing huge crowds when he pitched, Paige went 6-1 with an outstanding 2.48 ERA in half of a season, helping the Indians win the World Series. He pitched one more season with Cleveland, then played for three years with the St. Louis Browns.\n\nDespite his age, Paige continued to tour regularly for hefty appearance fees. At age 59 on September 25, 1965, he became the oldest player in Major League history, marking the occasion by throwing three scoreless innings and allowing just one hit for the Kansas City Athletics. He finished his big league career with a 28-31 record, 32 saves and a 3.29 ERA.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nOne of baseball's most famous players of any color, Paige lived the sort of life in which myth became difficult to separate from reality. According to the stories, he was once served divorce papers by a wife as he walked out to the mound at Wrigley Field, and another time pitched for Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo's team to decide the outcome of an election. Still, the accounts of his unparalleled talents were likely true; Paige was renowned for his hard fastballs and his signature \"hesitation\" pitch, but he could do anything with the ball that he wanted.\n\nPaige wrote a couple of autobiographies, including Maybe I'll Pitch Forever: A Great Baseball Player Tells the Hilarious Story Behind the Legend, in which he secretly lamented not being the first Black player in the Major Leagues instead of Robinson, but he bore it with equanimity.\n\nDespite his incredible longevity, Paige rarely addressed the issue of his age, often quoting Mark Twain: \"Age is a question of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThe legendary pitcher died of a heart attack in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 8, 1982, less than a month before his 76th birthday.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Leroy Robert Page\n\nBirth Year: 1906\n\nBirth date: July 7, 1906\n\nBirth State: Alabama\n\nBirth City: Mobile\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: A trailblazing player in the Negro Leagues, baseball pitcher Satchel Paige also became the oldest rookie in Major League history and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.\n\nIndustries\n\nBaseball\n\nAstrological Sign: Cancer\n\nSchools\n\nIndustrial School for Negro Children\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nSatchel Paige was the first Negro pitcher in the American League and the seventh Negro big leaguer overall.\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Satchel Paige became the first African American pitcher to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nSatchel Paige is the oldest rookie in baseball history, debuting in the major leagues on his 42nd birthday.\n\nDeath Year: 1982\n\nDeath date: June 8, 1982\n\nDeath State: Missouri\n\nDeath City: Kansas City\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Satchel Paige Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/athlete/satchel-paige\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: May 6, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}], "Joe Brown's batting average was .239.": [{"url": "https://captaincalculator.com/sports/baseball/batting-average-calculator/", "page_content": "Calculator\n\nPlease note: This calculator requires javascript to function\n\nDefinition \u2013 What is Batting Average?\n\nBatting Average is the percentage of at bats that result in a hit.\n\nA higher batting average is seen as the player being a better hitter.

But it\u2019s the other occasions that are concerning \u2013 less universal than New Year\u2019s Eve, yet somewhat more communal than Aunt Margie\u2019s birthday.\n\nThis phenomenon extends to sports. \u201cOn This Date\u201d used to be a nice little filler piece in daily newspapers, highlighting famous upsets, no-hitters and hat tricks from years past. But in the Twitter era, the content-is-king mantra has led to include a lot of remembrances that previously would not have made the cut. Furthermore, the dates being celebrated are often not of the round-number variety, but rather the 17th anniversary of this and the 23rd of that, and the 31st of that one over there. Enough already.\n\nAnniversaries of sports events \u2013 certainly those deemed meaningful enough to produce a piece on a broadcast or a video or in a column \u2013 should generally be limited to the round numbers. Maybe we should try making 10-year increments the norm, with exceptions made for 5-, 25- and 75-year acknowledgments. With those ground rules, let\u2019s peruse baseball\u2019s past to find some anniversaries worth celebrating this season.\n\nExactly 100 years ago, Babe Ruth produced what some historians consider to be not only his best season, but the greatest offensive season by anyone in MLB history. In 1921, his second year with the New York Yankees, Ruth\u2019s total of 59 homers eclipsed his major-league record of the previous season by five, and his .378 batting average still stands as the highest by a player who hit 50-plus home runs. Ruth\u2019s long-standing record of 60 homers in a season, set in 1927, stood until Roger Maris broke it in 1961, now 60 years ago. The current single-season record of 73 home runs, set by Barry Bonds amid controversy in 2001, is now 20 years old. And the standard for great pennant races and explosive endings is still the one that gripped baseball fans 70 years ago, when the New York Giants overcame the Brooklyn Dodgers\u2019 lead of 13.5 games, forcing a best-of-three playoff to determine the National League title. In the decisive third game, the Giants trailed 4-1 in the ninth inning, only to rally for the win on Bobby Thomson\u2019s three-run homer \u2013 \u201cthe shot heard \u2019round the world.\u201d\n\nSo years ending in a \u201c1\u201d have furnished their share of baseball memories and then some. Still, there\u2019s one such year not yet mentioned that leads the list.\n\nIn 1860, Longfellow wrote that hardly a man then alive could remember the famous midnight ride of Paul Revere, 85 years earlier. Given the increases in U.S. population and longevity, we can\u2019t say that hardly a person alive can recall the American summer of 1941; but the number of folks who can recall that time with clarity is diminishing daily. The year started with President Franklin Roosevelt, recently elected to an unprecedented third term, publicly maintaining a stance of neutrality even as war consumed much of the globe outside the Americas. It ended with the United States having been drawn into the war after the attack on its fleet at Pearl Harbor, and with the nation in an all-out mobilization effort.\n\nIn the months in between, America\u2019s pastime delivered a season to remember, and one that today, 80 years later, still sparkles with a special glow. For while most Americans kept a wary eye on the European and Asian wars, a large subset of Americans known as baseball fans were thrilled by the day-to-day drama of their favorite sport. And while the pennant races were won by the Yankees and the Dodgers \u2013 their meeting in that year\u2019s World Series was the first of a record 11 such meetings \u2013 the real focus was on a pair of star players: Yankees center fielder Joe DiMaggio and Boston Red Sox left fielder Ted Williams.\n\nBaseball was the unquestioned king of the American sports scene in 1941. And Williams (left) and DiMaggio (right) were two of the game\u2019s biggest stars. (AP Photo/File)\n\nBack in 1941, baseball was the unquestioned king of the American sports scene. Its hold on the country was illustrated by the printing of its box scores in just about every important newspaper in the country on a daily basis. True, interest in baseball statistics was then only a fraction of what it was to become, but interest in star players was likely even more intense back then. That had been best illustrated by Ruth himself: During a 22-year career from 1914 to 1935, he not only made the remarkable transition from top-line pitcher with the Red Sox to every-day outfielder with the Yankees, but he set all-time home run records of 714 in his career and 60 in one year. His every move was tracked by newspapers, magazines and newsreels.\n\nDiMaggio was 26 years old during the 1941 season, and had already established himself as the greatest offensive force in the game. A highly touted minor leaguer, he immediately exceeded expectations upon his debut with the Yankees in 1936. Through five seasons, his average season had produced a .343 batting average with 34 home runs, 138 RBIs, 194 hits and 123 runs (despite the missing 90 games over that five-year period). DiMaggio still owns the major-league record for RBIs over a player\u2019s first five seasons. Not incidentally, the Yankees won the World Series in each of his first four years with the team.\n\nWilliams joined the Red Sox at age 20 in 1939, and posted numbers nearly as impressive as those of his fellow Californian. Over his first two years, he maintained a .336 batting average while averaging 27 homers, 129 RBIs, 189 hits and 133 runs. He also possessed a discerning batting eye, averaging over 100 walks per season en route to a career total over 2,000.\n\nBut while DiMaggio and Williams were extraordinary power hitters, both men were disadvantaged in that regard by the home parks in which they played. DiMaggio played in cavernous Yankee Stadium, where home-run distances to left and left-center field (where a right-handed batter such as Joe D. would hit most of his long balls) were mammoth, while right field offered an inviting short porch to lefties. Williams, a left-handed hitter, played in Fenway Park, where the distances to right and right-center field were similarly unyielding to home runs, while left field offered the looming presence of the Green Monster, an invitingly short 37-foot wall. Nevertheless, DiMaggio finished his career with 361 home runs (tellingly, only 148 were hit at Yankee Stadium, and 213 in road games) while Williams knocked out 521 (248 of which were hit in Boston, and 273 elsewhere).\n\nHowever, while Williams hit a major-league-leading 37 homers and DiMaggio 30 in the 1941 season, in that year, their home run totals were not the particular focus of fans nationwide. Rather, it was the accumulation of base hits that brought them glory and daily attention. For in that same season, DiMaggio put together a fabulous streak of making at least one hit in each of 56 consecutive games, while Williams fashioned a season\u2019s batting average of .406.\n\nA hitting streak is a strange bird when it comes to baseball statistics. There are certainly other statistics that have greater ability to identify the most productive seasons, or parts of seasons, in baseball history. But not everyone is a baseball scientist. The concept of a hitting streak is so easily grasped that it has appeal for even the most casual of fans, and therein lies its importance. Moreover, that the streak is on the line every day brings another level of interest; the closest thing might be the inning-by-inning interest generated by a potential no-hitter, but, of course, that\u2019s limited to a single game.\n\nFor years now, sports-radio debates have chewed over which achievement (DiMaggio\u2019s 56-game hitting streak or the .406 average achieved by Williams) would be more likely to be equaled or surpassed some day, and which is more meaningful. Joltin\u2019 Joe\u2019s streak easily surpassed all similar efforts. He chased down the prevailing record for a hitting streak within one season \u2013 44 games \u2013 and also the record for a streak without a single-season restriction \u2013 45 \u2013 both done by Willie Keeler in the 1890s. In the years since Joe set that standard, the most national attention given to a hitting streak came when Pete Rose put together a 44-game run in 1978.\n\nMeanwhile, Williams still stands as the only player in the past 90 years to bat .400 or better in either the American or National League. The highest averages in either of those leagues since 1941 were .390 by George Brett in 1980 and .394 by Tony Gwynn in 1994 \u2013 a season that was shortened by a players\u2019 strike.\n\nBut if someone asked you in April of 1941, who would be the more likely, Williams or DiMaggio, to hit .400 for the season, chances are the choice would have been the Yankee Clipper, who at the time, was also considered the greater and more famous player. Additionally, Williams had broken a bone in his ankle during spring training and did not make his first start until Boston\u2019s sixth game of the season on April 22. Remarkably, by then, DiMaggio was batting .528 (19 for 36), and he already had four homers and 14 RBIs in only eight games.\n\nWilliams sat out a few more games after his first start, then went 2 for 13 over a three-game stretch shortly after his return. On the morning of May 3, his average stood at .308 \u2013 plenty good for anyone else, but subpar for the man whose greatest life goal was to walk down the street and hear passersby exclaim, \u201cThere goes the greatest hitter who ever lived.\u201d But things soon picked up: During May, Williams set a furious pace, propelled by seven games of three or more hits, and he ended the month with an 11-game stretch in which he went 24 for 40 (.600). That lifted his season average to .429.\n\nDiMaggio, meanwhile, had cooled off significantly following his torrid start. Remember that .528 batting average over his first eight games of the season? Over his next 20 games, he hit just .194 with one homer and seven RBIs. Joe D. went hitless in seven at-bats as the Yankees were swept at home by the Cleveland Indians in a two-game series on May 13-14.\n\nThings didn\u2019t brighten much the next day when the Chicago White Sox visited the Bronx. DiMaggio\u2019s throwing error on the second batter of the game allowed the Sox to score their first run on the way to a 13-1 rout. That made it 11 losses in the last 16 games for the Yankees, who were in fifth place by the time the Sox left town. Left-hander Eddie Smith went the distance for the Sox in that May 15 game, with New York\u2019s only run coming in the first inning on DiMaggio\u2019s two-out single. But from that tiny acorn grew the mighty oak, for Joe would not again be held hitless for more than two months.\n\nIn one of those delicious coincidences sometimes lost in the pages of history, Williams had also started a hitting streak on that same day. He battled DiMaggio day by day, through the month of May and the first week of June until the Williams streak ended at 23 games on June 8 in Chicago, where he was 0 for 2 with three walks. Frequency of walks was a point of differentiation between the two stars: DiMaggio loved to swing early in the count, and never drew more than 80 walks in a season. Williams preached patience and waiting for a good pitch. Until turning 40, and but for brief appearances in the two seasons that he spent largely in Korea, he had never failed to walk 80 times in a season, with 11 seasons of 100-plus walks and six seasons over 140.\n\nPlayers With 900+ Hits, 600+ Runs & 150+ Home Runs in First 5 Seasons\n\nPlayer Seasons Hits Runs Home Runs RBIs Joe DiMaggio, NYY 1936-40 971 613 168 691 Ted Williams, BOS 1939-46 925 683 165 638 Albert Pujols, STL 2001-05 982 629 201 621 (All Time)\n\nDuring the length of his 23-game streak, which turned out to be the longest of his career, Ted batted .489 (43 for 88), well above Joe\u2019s .374 average (34 for 91) over the first 23 games of his streak. And Williams didn\u2019t suddenly stop hitting just because his streak ended or because a page was torn off the calendar. Even as DiMaggio knocked out hits, game after game, Williams kept his average above the .400 mark. And all the while, those two baseball stars shared headlines with one former star and darkening world events.\n\nThe Yankees travelled through an old-fashioned 15-game road trip from May 27 to June 12, visiting six cities, and as they did, the story of DiMaggio\u2019s hitting streak spread. Joe started the trip with a four-hit game \u2013 including a three-run homer \u2013 at Washington in game No. 12 of the streak. And by the time the trip ended, the streak was up to 26 games, and DiMaggio provided a fitting coda with a single and then a 10th-inning homer to beat Chicago and send the team back on the train to New York.\n\nBut despite the team\u2019s increasing success on the field, that trip had included an especially somber moment. When the Yankees\u2019 train arrived in Detroit following a June 2 game in Cleveland, the team learned that their former captain Lou Gehrig had died that day in New York at age 37. It came barely two years after he had been forced out of the Yankees lineup due to the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the disease later known by Gehrig\u2019s name. The irony was that it was also in Detroit two years earlier that Gehrig went to manager Joe McCarthy and told him that he wanted to be removed from the lineup, ending his record streak of 2,130 consecutive games played. Now, McCarthy and catcher Bill Dickey (Gehrig\u2019s onetime roommate) returned to New York for the funeral.\n\nThe news, sports and otherwise maintained a furious pace. On June 17, DiMaggio hit in his 30th straight game, surpassing the Yankees record shared by Roger Peckinpaugh (1919) and Earle Combs (1931). Five days later, Americans woke to the news that Germany had abrogated its non-aggression agreement with the Soviet Union and sent its armies across the border, a significant widening of the war.\n\nOn June 24, the Yankees hosted the St. Louis Browns, and Joe\u2019s streak, then at 35 games, survived a close call. Bob Muncrief had held DiMag hitless in three at-bats, but after Muncrief allowed a two-run homer to Tommy Henrich in the eighth, the Yanks led 6-0. According to Muncrief, his manager, Luke Sewell, then came to the mound and ordered him to walk DiMaggio, the next hitter, for no discernible reason other than to end his streak. Muncrief said that he refused to do it, and Joe lined a single to left.\n\nTwo days later, another close call. After seven innings, DiMaggio, now at 37 games, had gone hitless in three at-bats, and because he was due to bat fourth in the bottom of the eighth and the Yankees led 3-1, there was no certainty that he would bat again. Rookie Johnny Sturm popped out, but Red Rolfe walked. Up stepped the Yanks\u2019 No. 3 hitter, the hard-hitting Henrich, who had homered his last time up. Every Yankees fan and player had fingers crossed that Henrich would not bounce into an inning-ending double play and potentially end Joe\u2019s streak. But Henrich, also fearful of a double play, had thought the situation through and got permission from manager McCarthy to bunt and avoid the double-play possibility. After the sacrifice, DiMaggio came up with a runner on second and two out.\n\nNow in today\u2019s baseball, there would be little doubt that the hottest hitter on the planet would be intentionally walked with first base open. But the ethos of the game was somewhat different in 1941. Browns submarine righthander Elden Auker pitched to DiMaggio, who rifled an RBI double into the left-field corner. The streak was alive at 38.\n\nThree days later, in a doubleheader at Washington, the Clipper tied and then broke George Sisler\u2019s American League record of 41, set back in 1922. And he did it with a good measure of drama: Between games of the doubleheader, Joe\u2019s bat was stolen from the Yankees bat rack, and he had to use another piece of lumber in the second game. On his fourth trip to the plate, Joe singled to surpass Sisler\u2019s mark in the seventh inning. A DiMaggio friend spent five days tracking down the stolen bat, which arrived back at Yankee Stadium before the game on July 5. Joe was delighted to re-connect with his old business partner, then promptly homered in the first inning.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 28, the Yankees had taken over first place in the standings and their lead grew rapidly after that. During that month of June, the Yankees, as a team, also created another astounding major-league record streak. They hit at least one home run in each of 25 consecutive games from the second game of a June 1 doubleheader in Cleveland through both games of that doubleheader in Washington in which DiMaggio tied and broke Sisler\u2019s record. The Yankees\u2019 home run streak was not surpassed until the Texas Rangers homered in 27 straight games in 2002. (The 2019 version of the Yankees reclaimed the record held so long by their predecessors when they homered in 31 consecutive games.)\n\nSo by the end of June, the Clipper had hit in 42 straight games \u2013 two shy of Keeler\u2019s single-season record set in 1897. On July 1, over 52,000 Yankee Stadium witnesses saw Joe rap out hits in each game of a doubleheader and his first-inning single in the nightcap tied Keeler\u2019s single-season record. He broke that mark the next day in style, albeit with only 8,600 fans in attendance, with a fifth-inning home run.\n\nWilliams kept plugging away even as newspapers, magazines and radio focused on DiMaggio\u2019s streak. While their paths would occasionally cross when their teams met, Williams later revealed that he was also a middleman in keeping one particular DiMaggio family member apprised of Joe\u2019s progress. For Dominic DiMaggio, Joe\u2019s younger brother, was then in his second year as the center fielder for the Red Sox. When the team played at home, from his post in left field, Williams had easy access to the guys operating the famous manual scoreboard embedded at the base of the Green Monster. When Joe would get a hit, one of the operators would alert Ted, who would call over to Dominic something like, \u201cDommie, I have some news\u2026 Joey just got his hit\u2026\u201d\n\nA more significant crossing of paths between New York\u2019s No. 5 and Boston\u2019s No. 9 came on July 8 in Detroit, site of the annual All-Star Game. The event had been created eight years earlier as an adjunct to the Chicago World\u2019s Fair and was greeted by Depression-era fans not as a pleasant sideshow, but as a serious battle between the leagues. The players and managers felt the same way. Sure, there were special All-Star Game rules limiting how many innings pitchers could throw. But unlike today\u2019s version of the game, when it seems that the goal of each manager is to cram as many names as possible into the box score, back then, both leagues were in it to win it and the game\u2019s biggest stars would play all nine innings.\n\nThere were no bigger stars, of course, than DiMaggio, with his ongoing hitting streak at 48 games, and Williams, hitting .405, who batted third and fourth, respectively, in the American League lineup and played the full game. Williams supplied an RBI double in the fourth inning and DiMaggio doubled and came home on brother Dom\u2019s hit in the eighth, but the National League led 5-3 heading into the bottom of the ninth.\n\nWith one out, two hits and a walk filled the bases for Joltin\u2019 Joe, who rapped what looked like a game-ending double-play ball to shortstop. But the throw by the pivot man, second baseman Billy Herman, pulled first baseman Frank McCormick off the bag, and Joe was safe as a run scored. Now with two out, Williams came up to face the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Claude Passeau, who had slipped a third strike past him in the previous inning. This time, Ted belted one long and far into the upper deck in right field, and laughed and clapped his way around the bases to give the American League a 7-5 victory. As a measure of the importance with which the All-Star Game was then regarded, Williams often cited this home run as the greatest hit of his career.\n\nWilliams is greeted at home plate by DiMaggio (5) and coach Marv Shea after hitting a dramatic ninth-inning home run to give the AL a 7-5 victory in the 1941 All-Star Game in Detroit. (AP Photo, File)\n\nThe Yankees started a western trip after the break, and DiMaggio sizzled with hits in all three games in St. Louis, all four in Chicago, and in the series opener in Cleveland to run his streak up to 56 games. (By the way, the hit he had in the All-Star Game did not count in the official records of regular-season play.) He had become, according to John Drebinger of the New York Times, \u201cthe central figure of the baseball world.\u201d Incredible, yes. Unprecedented in the major leagues, yes. But not without precedent in DiMaggio\u2019s personal history. Because believe it or not, while playing for his hometown San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1933, the 18-year-old version of DiMaggio had hit safely in 61 consecutive games.\n\nNight games were still rare in Major League Baseball in 1941, with limits placed on how many after-dark contests each team could host. But on the evening of July 17, the Yankees played under the lights at Cleveland before a mammoth crowd of 67,468, which at the time was the largest ever to see a big-league night game. In the first inning, Joe\u2019s hard smash to third base was backhanded near the foul line by Ken Keltner, who threw him out. Joe drew a full-count walk in the fourth and then in the seventh, Keltner again thwarted a bid for a hit on another hard grounder. In the eighth, with the Yanks leading, 4-1, DiMaggio came up with the bases full and one out as Jim Bagby replaced starter Al Smith on the mound. Bagby got the Yankees star to hit into a double play, and it would take a miracle for DiMag to get another at-bat.\n\nBut in the bottom of the ninth, it looked as if a Cleveland rally might give him another shot. A pair of singles and Larry Rosenthal\u2019s triple produced two runs before a man was out and the Yankees\u2019 lead was cut to 4-3. The subtext was on everyone\u2019s mind: Should Cleveland tie the game but not win it in the ninth, the Yankees would hit in the 10th and DiMaggio would be due up fourth with a chance to extend his streak. Yankees\u2019 relief ace Johnny Murphy induced the first out on an infield grounder with Rosenthal holding third. When the next hitter, Clarence Campbell, tapped back to the mound, Rosenthal tried to score but was caught in a rundown and eventually tagged out. But Campbell failed to advance to second during the rundown, which meant that with lefty-hitting Roy Weatherly coming up, first baseman Johnny Sturm played close to the base, holding Campbell on.\n\nSo Sturm was in the perfect spot to field Weatherly\u2019s sharp grounder right down the foul line for the final out. Had Campbell advanced to second on the rundown, Sturm would have been playing off the line and might not have reached Weatherly\u2019s hot shot. Then Joe may have had another shot in the 10th, but instead, it was finally over. While the Yankees won 4-3 and moved to a seven-game lead in the standings, DiMaggio\u2019s streak had ended at 56 games. One game too soon. Joe later told teammate Phil Rizzuto that had he reached 57 games, Heinz would have paid him $10,000 for an endorsement of its popular \u201cHeinz 57\u201d brand.\n\nDiMaggio had hit .408 (and the Yanks had gone 41-13 with two ties) during the most famous 56-game stretch in baseball history. Then, the day after being blanked in Cleveland, he initiated a new 16-game hitting streak, during which he batted .426. So think back to the July 17 game in which the streak ended: If not for Keltner\u2019s play down the third-base line in the first inning and Sturm\u2019s play down the first-base line in the ninth, DiMaggio\u2019s streak may have reached 73 games!\n\nMeanwhile, as Williams was savoring his game-ending homer in the All-Star Game, little did he know that his next hit wouldn\u2019t come for 12 days. A twisted ankle, the same right ankle that Ted had injured in the spring, limited him to pinch-hitting for most of a week. His average stood at .395 the day that DiMaggio\u2019s streak ended and dropped a couple of points after a pinch-hitting appearance on the 19th. But when he belted a three-run pinch-homer in St. Louis on July 20, it foreshadowed a return to the starting lineup and a return to bashing AL pitchers. It was the first of Ted\u2019s 19 hits in his next 35 at-bats, and just like that, his average stood at .412 to DiMaggio\u2019s .381 on the evening of August 2, the last day of Joe\u2019s 16-game streak. Their batting averages would not again stand that close the rest of the season.\n\nDiMaggio had already captured his prize \u2013 the longest hitting streak in major-league history \u2013 but Williams was still in pursuit of his. A .400 average had not been achieved in either the American or National League since the New York Giants\u2019 Bill Terry batted .401 in 1930. No American Leaguer had hit .400 since the Detroit Tigers\u2019 Harry Heilmann finished at .403 in 1923. Each of those players, however, reached .400 with a significant advantage: From 1908 to 1930, Major League Baseball\u2019s scoring rules contained the sacrifice-fly rule, by which a batter would not be charged with a time at bat (and his batting average would not fall) if his fly out resulted in a baserunner scoring.\n\nIn the last five of those seasons, the rule was even broader: Any advance of a baserunner on a fly out, including from first to second or from second to third, exempted the batter from a time at bat. Following the 1930 season (in which the overall MLB batting average was .296, the highest in any season since 1900), the leagues eliminated the sacrifice-fly rule completely. It came back in its original form for one season in 1939 before it was eliminated again. Then it returned for good in 1954.\n\nTed Williams\u2019 Monthly Splits, 1941 Season\n\nMonth Games Hits At-Bats Average Home Runs RBIs April 9 7 18 .389 1 5 May 26 44 101 .436 6 22 June 28 35 94 .372 8 29 July 22 27 63 .429 6 19 August 35 43 107 .402 10 26 September 23 29 73 .397 6 19\n\nWhat this meant for Williams is that the math of the scoring rules made it more difficult for him to hit .400 in 1941 than it was for Terry in 1930 or Heilmann in 1923. In fact, in baseball\u2019s modern era (starting with the beginning of the 20th century), only one player in either league had hit .400 in a season in which the sacrifice-fly rule was not in force: Napoleon Lajoie did that with Cleveland in 1901, in the AL\u2019s first season as a recognized major league. Back then, though, the rules aided Lajoie in a different manner: In the AL\u2019s first two seasons, foul balls were not counted as strikes.\n\nOver the last two months of his pursuit of .400, Williams consistently kept his batting average above his target. It dipped down to .402 after he went 0 for 5 in a pair of games at Cleveland. But he responded with an amazing 20-for-39 run over the next 14 games and stood at .413 on September 10 with just 15 games left on his team\u2019s schedule.\n\nHowever, Ted proceeded to lose 12 points off his average over a 12-day span. He managed only 10 hits in 37 at-bats, a .270 pace that lowered that .413 average to .401 with three games remaining: a Saturday game and a Sunday doubleheader at Philadelphia against the last-place Athletics.\n\nConnie Mack, the Athletics\u2019 owner/manager, nominated three youngsters to face Williams: Roger Wolff, Dick Fowler and Fred Caligiuri, each of whom had made his big-league debut earlier in the month. This was not something particularly to Ted\u2019s liking, since he attributed so much of his success to his knowledge of pitchers he was facing. Here, there was not much to study.\n\nWolff pitched the Saturday game, and though Boston won, 5-1, Williams was held to one hit in four at-bats. At that point, with 179 hits in 448 at-bats, his average had fallen to .39955, the first time it was below .400 at game\u2019s end since July 24. What happened next is, to this day, a confusing jumble of contradictions and wrong assumptions. In Ted\u2019s autobiography, My Turn At Bat, he wrote that manager Joe Cronin told him that because his average was \u201cofficially .400,\u201d he could sit out the final day\u2019s games to protect his average. Ted said that he recoiled at the thought of not playing, and Cronin complied by penciling him into his usual cleanup spot on Sunday.\n\nThe exactness of Cronin\u2019s words is important here. He may or may not have said precisely what Ted recalled. Cronin may have honestly believed that because batting averages are usually, for convenience, rounded off at the third decimal spot, it meant that at .39955, Williams was \u201cofficially\u201d batting .400. But that was not the case, now, then, or ever. In fact, the opposite is true. Baseball\u2019s official rules specify that a batting average is computed by dividing the number of hits by the number of official at-bats. There is no direction to round off the batting average to three figures; again, that was a mere matter of convenience. In fact, on more than one occasion in baseball history, a close race for the batting title has been decided by dragging the batting average to a four-place decimal before one player\u2019s advantage over another becomes apparent.\n\nIndeed, eight years later, Williams himself would be edged for the batting title on the final day of the season by Detroit\u2019s George Kell. Kell finished at .3429 and Williams at .3427. They were not declared \u201cco-champions\u201d simply because each average would round up to .343 for convenience. Kell had the higher average, and so he was the champion and Williams was not. That was not a good day for Williams: Besides losing that 1949 batting title on the last day of the season, his Red Sox also lost the American League pennant by a game when they dropped that final game to \u2013 who else? \u2013 the Yankees.\n\nHad today\u2019s sacrifice fly rule been in place in 1941, Williams (shown here that year) would have finished with a .413 batting average. (AP Photo/File)\n\nFortunately for all, Cronin\u2019s misunderstanding of what it means to be a \u201c.400 hitter\u201d did not prevent Williams from playing on the final Sunday. The key at-bat was his first of the day. Mathematicians knew that Williams\u2019s average would increase by just over .00133 with every hit, but would fall by nearly .00089 with every out. Leading off the second inning, Ted was told by Philadelphia catcher Frankie Hayes that manager Mack had directed the pitchers to challenge Williams \u2013 not to pitch around him (Ted had already drawn 147 walks that season, and he finished with an on-base percentage of .553). Then, umpire Bill McGowan offered some advice to Williams, who had spent several hours the previous night nervously walking the streets of Philadelphia with his friend, Red Sox clubhouse attendant Johnny Orlando. As Williams recalled, McGowan, while sweeping off home plate, volunteered that in order to hit .400, \u201ca batter has got to be loose.\u201d\n\nTaking those words to heart, Williams stepped in against Fowler. The first two pitches were called balls, and Ted rapped the next one into right field for a hit \u2013 the first, and most important, of his six hits in the doubleheader. For not only did it lift his average to .40089, but it meant that Williams would not fall below .400 if he made an out on his next at-bat. That certainly took some of the pressure off The Kid\u2019s shoulders.\n\nHe led off the fifth inning with a long home run \u2013 his 37th of the season \u2013 to lift his average to .40222. He now would still be above .400 with outs on his next two at-bats. Batting next in the sixth against lefty reliever Porter Vaughan, Williams singled again before producing another hit off Vaughan in the seventh. He was now 4 for 4 and had lifted his average from .39955 to .40487. Had he gone hitless in five at-bats the rest of the afternoon, he still would be above .400.\n\nThe rest of the day fell into place. Williams reached on an error in his last at-bat in the first game and went 2 for 3 in the nightcap, finishing the day with six hits in eight at-bats and concluding the season at .406. A few other details of the day: After trailing 11-3 in the first game, the Red Sox came back to win 12-11. In the second game, Caligiuri bested future Hall-of-Famer Lefty Grove 7-1. Grove had earned his 300th win on July 25, but failed to win any of his six subsequent starts and the game in which Ted cemented his .406 average was Grove\u2019s last in the majors. That game was ended because of darkness after eight innings \u2013 which merely denied yet one more ovation from the Philadelphia fans for Ted, who would have led off the unplayed ninth inning.\n\nHad today\u2019s sacrifice fly rule been in place in 1941 (today\u2019s rule being virtually the same as the one that was used from 1908 to 1925), Williams would have been credited with eight sacrifice flies during the season. Eliminating eight at-bats from the computation, his final batting average would have been not .406, but .413! Williams became the first, and still the only, player in either the American or National League to hit .400 or better in a season in which there was no sacrifice-fly rule and in which foul balls counted as strikes.\n\nDiMaggio and Williams accomplished what they did under a national spotlight that, while seemingly harsh at the time, was far less bright than one produced by today\u2019s addition of 24/7 television and cable TV, online coverage and social media. (Even radio was not yet fully developed in 1941; for instance, Yankees games were first regularly broadcast in the New York area in 1939, but they went off the air in 1941 because the team, station and sponsor could not agree on a proper rights fee.) The pressure felt by Joe and Ted would be magnified today, especially the day-to-day pressure present for DiMaggio.\n\nThe math of hitting in 56 consecutive games would be difficult even if done in a vacuum with no attention. To that point, we examined our database to find cases of hitting streaks that were long in certain categories of games that would not be contiguous on a team\u2019s schedule. Therefore, the streaks might escape attention. For example, hitting streaks in home games or road games, games played against a certain team, games played in a particular month or on a particular day of the week, or, since 1969, games against divisional or non-divisional opponents. During what baseball likes to call its \u201cmodern era\u201d (and only in baseball is that term used to mean \u201csince the start of the 20th century\u201d), in none of those sub-categories did we find a hitting streak as long as 56 games, even when we removed that element of day-to-day pressure! (For example, Ted Kluszewski likely didn\u2019t know that he had a 44-game hitting streak in Sunday games during 1954 and 1955, so he produced it without the media bugging him about it every Sunday.) We didn\u2019t even find a streak in any of those categories as long as 50 games.\n\nAs for the immediate aftermath of the 1941 season, the Boston Globe quoted Ted as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this even surpasses the All-Star homer as my biggest thrill.\u201d In later years, though, he still identified that All-Star homer as his \u201cbiggest hit.\u201d DiMaggio, of course, advanced to the World Series and for the fifth time in his six years in the majors, his Yankees emerged as world champions. On November 11, the baseball writers announced that DiMaggio had bested Williams to win the AL MVP. It was the second time that The Yankee Clipper had been so honored, previously winning in 1939. Joe finished with 291 points in the weighted balloting; Ted had 254.\n\nAnd then, less than a month later, everything changed. The United States entered the world conflict, and all American efforts were directed toward it. President Roosevelt, in response to a query from the baseball commissioner, opined that baseball should continue during the war for purposes of national morale, though many star players would eventually be inducted into the armed services. DiMaggio and Williams did play in the 1942 season. Joe played a career-high 154 games, though his figures for homers, RBIs and batting average were all, to that point, career lows. Ted won the American League Triple Crown, leading in batting average, homers and RBIs, but was somehow beaten out by another Yankees player, second baseman Joe Gordon, for league MVP honors. After that season, Williams and DiMaggio joined many other major leaguers in the military and neither played big-league ball again until 1946.\n\nDiMaggio missed the seasons in which he was 28, 29 and 30 years old and returned to the majors at 31. Williams (whose birthday was in August) missed the seasons that he would have started at age 24, 25 and 26, returning at 27. Later, Williams went back into the service during the Korean conflict. He played a total of just 43 games over the 1952 and 1953 seasons when he was 33 and 34.\n\nLegitimately, these were peak years missed by these great players and there has always been speculation on the career totals that they (and others) would have reached without that interruption. Despite that, however, their achievements written into the record books during 1941, that last year of American innocence, have proven to be indelible.\n\nResearch support provided by Evan Boyd.

(AP Photo/Joe Puetz)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Higher velocity and increased shifts led to the major league batting average dropping to .243, its lowest since 1968.\n\nDefensive shifts and 100 mph pitches set records this season, contributing to the worrisome offensive decline Major League Baseball is trying to address.\n\nWhen the average dropped this low more than a half-century ago, MLB lowered the pitcher\u2019s mound. Next year\u2019s rules changes announced last month include the first restriction on shifts, a decision made over the objection of the players\u2019 association.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve engaged in a process to develop rules that will bring back the best form of baseball,\u201d Commissioner Rob Manfred said at the time.\n\nThe major league average was .269 in 2006 but fell to .254 in 2016 and .245 during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, then dropped by one point in each of the following years. The only seasons with lower averages than this year were the record low of .237 in 1968 along with 1967 and the deal-ball era seasons of 1884, 1888 and 1908.\n\nDefensive shifts on balls in play totaled 66,961 this season, Sports Info Solutions said Monday, up from 59,063 last year and 2,349 in 2011. The major league-best Dodgers led this year with 2,912 shifts and NL Central champion Cleveland had the fewest at 1,600.\n\nBatting average for left-handed hitters was .236 this year, down from .254 in 2016, when lefties were one point below the big league average.\n\nLuis Arraez\u2019s .316 average for Minnesota was the lowest by an American League batting champion since Boston\u2019s Carl Yastrzemski hit .301 in 1968.\n\nVelocity has a lot of do with the fall. There were 3,356 pitches of 100 mph of more, 0.05% of the major league total of 703,918, according to MLB Statcast. That was up from 1,829 in 2021 and 1,056 in 2019.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Jhoan Duran had the most 100 mph pitches with 392, followed by Cincinnati\u2019s Hunter Greene (337), St. Louis\u2019 Jordan Hicks (274) and Ryan Helsey (237) and Seattle\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz (209).\n\nDuran averaged 100.8 mph with his fastball, Mu\u00f1oz 100.2 and Hicks 100.1.\n\n\u201cEvery time that bullpen door swings open, it\u2019s velocity,\u201d Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. \u201cThe guys, they weren\u2019t like that. The closers weren\u2019t throwing like they are now. But it\u2019s kind of the way they are growing up and now they are trained \u2014 and amazing to me, the number of them, too. It\u2019s like they just keep coming.\u201d\n\nThe average four-seam fastball velocity was 93.9 mph, up from 93.7 mph in 2021 and 93.1 mph in 2015, when Statcast first began measuring.\n\n\u201cThe way the game is now, everybody\u2019s throwing that hard. It\u2019s not fun to face, but it\u2019s just how the game is,\u201d Seattle\u2019s Ty France said. \u201cTo be able to step in the box on this stage, it was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nHome runs dropped to 5,215 from 5,944 last year and a record 6,776 in 2019.\n\nThe gap between strikeouts and hits narrowed to 1,135 from a record 2,661 last year. Strikeouts topped hits for the first time in 2019.

Brown spent much of his free time trying to hunt down Joe memorabilia -- baseball cards, autographs, personal meetings, and organized a Joe Shlabotnik Fan Club, complete with a newsletter which folded after one issue.\n\nShlabotnik was demoted to the minors after having a .004 batting average over an entire season; his one hit was a bloop single with his team comfortably ahead. His greatest achievements included making spectacular plays on routine fly balls and throwing out a runner who had fallen down between first and second. After being sent down to the Green Grass League (a bush league), Shlabotnik retired as a player and agreed to manage the Waffletown Syrups. Sadly, he was fired after only one game, after calling for a squeeze play ... with no one on base.\n\nLinus van Pelt once invited Shlabotnik to a testimonial dinner for Charlie Brown; unfortunately, the ballplayer got lost en route from his day job at a car wash. Another time he was scheduled to appear at a sports banquet where fans could dine with their favorite athletes (the guest list included Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Jack Nicklaus, and Peggy Fleming), and Charlie Brown, Linus, and Snoopy bought tickets to sit at Joe's table. He was the only athlete who didn't show up, explaining later that he had marked the wrong event, city, and date on his calendar.

Our holy place was Sportsman\u2019s Park, the brooding, gothic pile of steel on St. Louis's North Side, where the city\u2019s two professional baseball teams, the Cardinals and the Browns, played. From the outside on a dark night, the ballpark loomed up like a cathedral, a study in hooded arches. At first you glimpsed only flashes of green sliced by rusting steel columns. It took a minute to adjust to this\u2014baseball was still in black and white on television, and here was a new world of blinding whites and greens. The chalky basepaths and the balls themselves seemed to be an unworldly, incandescent white.\n\nThe crowd was white, too\u2014except for one section, the pavilion in right field. There, a phalanx of black faces looked back at us with what I imagined to be stony stares, pebbles on a green lawn, facing the concrete of all colors. Black people were limited first by law and then by custom to sitting only in the right-field stands. I remember wondering what they thought of this arrangement. Perhaps they did not find it unusual. St. Louis was then\u2014and still is\u2014one of the most segregated cities in America.\n\nThis sad history came to mind this week as St. Louis erupted in protests and looting following the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in the North Side suburb of Ferguson. Brown, a college-bound student, was shot to death by a police officer even though he was apparently unarmed. Soon after the shooting, the protestors were squaring off against police lines; after lining up, the protestors turned their backs on the officers in a symbolic gesture. It was like being in Sportsman\u2019s Park, with black and white crowds facing off across an abyss.\n\nThere is no large city in America more burdened by racial tension and mutual suspicion than St. Louis. The racial and economic problems that have beset America\u2019s cities are particularly intense in my hometown. Despite the city\u2019s large black population, the single black person I met during my childhood in the 1950s was my parents\u2019 housekeeper, Willie Brown. She would arrive at our house once a week and go to the basement to change into her maid\u2019s dress. St. Louis is the city that produced Miles Davis, Chuck Berry, and Josephine Baker. Yet when Michael Brown died, white and black residents quickly drew back to their default positions of mutual distrust: Black people took to the streets to express their anger, while white citizens expressed dismay at the chaos.\n\nBlack people took to the streets to express their anger, while white citizens expressed dismay at the chaos.\n\nThere are echoes of this throughout the city\u2019s history. Almost a century ago, on July 2, 1917, the Illinois city of East St. Louis erupted into a week-long race riot\u2014the worst in American history, with an estimated 300 deaths. The precipitating event was a rumor that a white man had been killed by a black man\u2014a mirror of Michael Brown\u2019s death.\n\nIn 1949, just a few blocks from my beloved Sportsman\u2019s Park, the echo appeared again. Here stood the largest public swimming pool in the nation: Fairground Park Pool, opened in 1913. It had limestone-and-brick bathhouses and a circular pool that was 440 feet across. Nineteen lifeguards watched over the thousands of swimmers who came every day.\n\nIn those sweltering, fetid summers before air-conditioning, the pools were always crowded. Though it was a municipal facility and theoretically open to all, Fairground Pool was in practice an all-white, segregated preserve. But as the city's black population slowly began to expand into the North Side, pressure built to allow access for all. In 1949, a new Democratic mayor, Joseph Darst, took office in St. Louis. Elected on the coattails of another popular Missourian, Harry Truman, Darst put his campaign manager, John O'Toole, in charge of the city's pools and parks. O'Toole said he \"could see no basis for keeping Negroes out of the pools. They are citizens like everybody else and have every legal right to enter any public facility.\" O'Toole announced that Fairground Park Pool would be open to all on the first day of the season, June 21.\n\nBelatedly recognizing the potential for tension, Darst attempted to convince the city's TV stations and newspapers to play down the story. The Post-Dispatch buried it, but the Globe-Democrat splashed the news across its front page: \"Pools and Playgrounds Opened to Both Races.\" When the pool opened that afternoon, about 30 black and 200 white swimmers lined up, eyeing each other nervously. As the swimmers entered and played uneasily in the water, maintaining careful distance from one another, a large, unruly crowd of white people gathered outside the gates of the pool, \"nearly all of them carrying baseball bats, sticks, and clubs,\u201d according to an oral history of St. Louis in the collection of the city\u2019s Mercantile Library. A half-dozen police officers arrived and began escorting away the black people who were leaving the pool. But they made no effort to disperse the crowd. A few older men began haranguing the teenagers: \"You want to know how to take care of them niggers? Get bricks and smash their heads.\" As evening approached, groups of white people began threatening black people who approached the pool and randomly beating those who were leaving, chasing them and shouting, \"There're some niggers!\" One besieged black youth pulled a knife and beat a 20-year-old white cement-company worker. Police rushed to his rescue.\n\nBy the evening, the crowd had grown to 5,000, swollen by baseball fans arriving for the Cardinals' game against the Giants that night. The riots only got worse\u2014they did not stop until after midnight. Miraculously, no one died\u2014though ten black people and two white people had been hospitalized.\n\nOne of the African American swimmers at Fairground Pool that day, Walter Hayes, later recalled, \"I never knew that hatred actually traveled in waves. I could feel and see those hate waves, similar to heat waves coming at you on a hot, sunny day in a desert, coming from the crowd. It was an eerie feeling.\"\n\nThen, and now, the root cause of the violence was segregation. During and after the Depression, thousands of African American families had migrated up the Mississippi to St. Louis. The New York Times editor Gerald Boyd, who grew up in the city, remembered, \u201cBlacks filed off the highways and out of the train depots into slums that were already brimming with new transplants. Jobs were plentiful in huge plants producing everything from beer to bricks, from shoes to steel. But not everyone found work, and in close quarters, crime and illness were on the rise.\u201d\n\nThen, and now, the root cause of the violence was segregation.\n\nVirtually all of the area's major retail businesses were downtown\u2014retailers had not yet followed the white community to the suburbs\u2014so the center city was the only place to shop. But black people were routinely refused service at the lunch counters at department stores, dime stores, and drugstores. At some places, African Americans were allowed to eat\u2014but only if they were standing up. They called it \u201cvertical segregation.\"\n\nAt movie theatres like the rococo Fox Theatre, black people were allowed in only one week a year, called Brotherhood Week. Blacks were not welcome at all in the Forest Park Highlands, the amusement park where my friends and I spent summer afternoons. They could ride city buses, but the schools were segregated. The ballpark itself was an island of green surrounded by one of the largest pockets of poverty in the city. When the young piano prodigy Bobby Short first played for a week at the St. Louis Theatre in 1937, he had to eat in his dressing room because the nearby restaurants would not serve him. When I met Short years later, and we talked about his time in St. Louis, he did not mention this experience.\n\nIn recent years, African-Americans have slowly moved out of the inner city into the ring of suburbs that surrounds St. Louis. But even there, the city\u2019s historical pattern of racial separation prevails in the rigidly monochromatic suburbs. Michael Brown died in Ferguson, where blacks represent two-thirds of the population of 21,000\u2014but only three of the 53 police officers.\n\nThis is what race looks like in the usually warm-hearted city where I grew up, what race has looked like for decades. As William Faulkner famously wrote, \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/173465817/joe-leroy-brown", "page_content": "Baseball/GM for Pittsburgh Pirates\n\n\n\nJoe L.

The Pirates were National League East division champions from 1970 to 1972 and in 1974 and 1975. Mr. Brown retired after the 1976 season, but returned as general manager on an interim basis to finish out the 1985 season.\n\n\n\nJoe L. Brown was born on Sept. 1, 1918, in New York, a son of the comedian and actor Joe E. Brown, who briefly played minor league baseball and drew on that in a comic show-business routine simulating a harried pitcher.\n\n\n\nMr. Brown was reared in Southern California and played football at U.C.L.A. After serving in the Army Air Forces in World War II, he worked his way up as an executive in the Pirates\u2019 minor league organization.\n\n\n\nMr. Brown lived in Newport Beach, Calif., but recently entered an assisted living facility in Albuquerque to be near his daughter, Cynthia. He is also survived by his son, Don.\n\n\n\nIn June, Mr. Brown was honored at the Pirates\u2019 PNC Park along with players from the 1960 team on the 50th anniversary of its World Series championship.

He was 91.\n\n\n\nSon of actor Joe E. Brown.\n\n\n\nHis death was announced by the Pirates.\n\n\n\nWhen Mr. Brown became the Pirates\u2019 general manager after the 1955 season, he succeeded Branch Rickey, who had orchestrated pennant-winners with the St. Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers before embarking on a youth movement in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\nThe Pirates had finished at or near the bottom of the league for the previous six seasons. But drawing on a core of young players, most notably the future Hall of Fame outfielder Roberto Clemente, and engineering shrewd trades, Mr. Brown put together the Pirates\u2019 1960 World Series champions.\n\n\n\nThat team, managed by Danny Murtaugh, whom Mr. Brown hired in 1957, gave Pittsburgh its first World Series championship since 1925 and its first pennant since 1927.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe beat a pretty good Yankee team with Mantle, Maris, Ford, Berra,\u201d Mr. Brown told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette earlier this year. \u201cThe Pirates had not won in so long that nobody remembered what it was like. Pittsburgh is a football town. But we showed it was also a baseball town.\u201d\n\n\n\nLong after he retired, Mr. Brown displayed photos of Bill Mazeroski\u2019s World Series-winning home run in Game 7 at his home.\n\n\n\nIn building the 1960 champions, Mr. Brown blended Clemente, Mazeroski, Dick Groat and pitchers Bob Friend, Vern Law and Roy Face with players he obtained in trades: center fielder Bill Virdon, third baseman Don Hoak, catchers Smoky Burgess and Hal Smith, and pitchers Harvey Haddix and Vinegar Bend Mizell.\n\n\n\nJoe L. Brown in November 1956. Building a strong farm system that produced the slugging Willie Stargell and Latin players discovered by the scout Howie Haak, Mr. Brown set the groundwork for the outstanding Pirates teams of the 1970s.\n\n\n\nThe 1971 Pirates, a diverse team that fielded the majors' first all-black starting lineup in a Sept. 1 game against the Philadelphia Phillies, won the World Series, defeating the Baltimore Orioles. The Pirates were National League East division champions from 1970 to 1972 and in 1974 and 1975. Mr. Brown retired after the 1976 season, but returned as general manager on an interim basis to finish out the 1985 season.\n\n\n\nJoe L. Brown was born on Sept. 1, 1918, in New York, a son of the comedian and actor Joe E. Brown, who briefly played minor league baseball and drew on that in a comic show-business routine simulating a harried pitcher.\n\n\n\nMr. Brown was reared in Southern California and played football at U.C.L.A. After serving in the Army Air Forces in World War II, he worked his way up as an executive in the Pirates\u2019 minor league organization.\n\n\n\nMr. Brown lived in Newport Beach, Calif., but recently entered an assisted living facility in Albuquerque to be near his daughter, Cynthia. He is also survived by his son, Don.\n\n\n\nIn June, Mr. Brown was honored at the Pirates\u2019 PNC Park along with players from the 1960 team on the 50th anniversary of its World Series championship. By then, the Pirates had endured 17 straight losing seasons.\n\n\n\nMr. Brown pointed to the team\u2019s young players and held out hope while acknowledging unrest among Pirates fans.\n\nJoe Jr's ashes are scattered in the ossuary and his name was never placed on a plaque."}, {"url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13039026/charles-ed-brown-st-louis-suicide-jump-death/", "page_content": "A PROMINENT attorney jumped to his death on Monday from the 11th floor of the office building where he worked, police said.\n\nCharles \u201cEd\u201d Brown, 61, jumped from the high-rise building in St Louis, Missouri, around 4.30pm and landed on a roof down below, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\n2 Charles 'Ed' Brown, 61, jumped from the 11th floor of his office building tower in St Louis on Monday, according to reports Credit: Facebook\n\nBrown wore an eye patch and was frequently seen in TV advertisements and billboards in the area.\n\n\"We are shocked and devastated,\" David Shulman, of the law firm Brown & Brown, said in a statement.\n\n\"We request the privacy of the family is respected during this most difficult time.\"\n\nHis law firm, Brown & Brown, is located on the 11th building of Gateway Tower, from where the well-known lawyer apparently jumped.\n\nPolice said homicide detectives went to the scene to investigate, but Brown\u2019s death is being investigated as a suicide.\n\nAccording to the Post-Dispatch, Brown, along with his brother, Dan, created Brown & Brown in 1993 for personal injury and criminal defense cases.\n\n2 The building where Brown & Brown is located in St Louis, Missouri Credit: Google Maps\n\nThe pair reportedly starred in a local video series called On the Road with Brown & Brown that saw them touring metropolitan destinations in the area.\n\nBrown was \u201cmost recognizable for his eye patch which covers an injury he received when he was a child,\u201d KMOX radio station reported.\n\nBrown & Brown commercials that aired in the area often included memorable lines like: \"If you can't come to us, we'll come to you.\"\n\nThe law firm\u2019s website states that Brown was a principal partner at the office, concentrating on criminal law and traffic cases.\n\nPer his bio on the site, Brown began his career \u201cby working for Citicorp and as a Law Clerk with the Illinois 5th District Appellate Court.\u201d\n\nBrown returned to St Louis to form Brown & Brown with his brother.\n\nThe lawyer was fluent in Russian and loved playing sports in his free time.\n\nShulman said Brown loved his family \u201cand enjoyed tennis, riding his motorcycle, sports cars, and traveling the world.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text Crisis Text Line at 741741.\n\n[pod_component pod_component_config_id=\"BB1w9H6DA\" pod_component_config_url=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/nu-sun-pod-component-config-prod/BB1w9H6DA.json\" pod_component_config_loader_url=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/nu-sun-pod-loaders-prod/1.71.1/componentLoader.js?74679\" src=\"https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.thesun.co.uk%2Fnu-sun-pod-widgets-prod%2Fiframe-pod.html%3Fid%3DBB1w9H6DA%26script%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesun.co.uk%2Fnu-sun-pod-loaders-prod%2F1.71.1%2FcomponentLoader.js%3F74679%26config%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesun.co.uk%2Fnu-sun-pod-component-config-prod%2FBB1w9H6DA.json\"]"}, {"url": "https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/saint-louis-mo/charles-brown-10225544", "page_content": "IN THE CARE OF\n\nCharles Robert Brown was born on June 10, 1929 in Saint Louis, MO and passed away on June 6, 2021 in Saint Louis, MO and is under the care of.\n\nVisitation will be held on June 11, 2021 at 9:30 am at Immacolata Catholic Church, 8900 Clayton Rd, Saint Louis, MO.
