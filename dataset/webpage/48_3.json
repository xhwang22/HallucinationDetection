The English actor was best known for his roles in several memorable British television series such as \"Porridge\" (BBC1, 1974-77), \"The Two Ronnies\" (BBC1, 1971-77), and \"Open All Hours\" (BBC2, 1973-1985). The middle child sandwiched between two sisters, he was born Ronald William George Barker on September 25, 1929, the son of Leonard and Edith Barker. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with theater and humor. He took up amateer dramatics, despite his father's objections. Barker attempted to join the Young Vic theater in London, but he instead found his acting footing at the Manchester Repertory Company. Barker's entry to the entertainment industry was slow at first, but he eventually made his debut as a professional actor in 1948 in a performance of J.M. Barrie's \"Quality Street.\" His first lead role was in \"The Guinea Pig\" as a working class boy at a public school. Barker soon realized that he preferred comedy over drama. In 1951, he joined the Oxford Playhouse where he appeared in such plays as \"He Who Gets Slapped.\" By 1955, Barker had quite a prolific theater career with over 350 plays and he was soon ready to take on other media.\n\nBarker's success at the theater enabled him to easily transition to radio work. In 1956, he lent his voice to play Lord Russett in \"Floggit's\" in his first radio performance. After several years in radio, Barker appeared on television for the first time in the show \"I'm Not Bothered,\" headed by Glenn Melvyn, an actor whom Barker met back in his theater days. In an uncredited role, Barker made his feature film debut in \"Wonderful Things!\" (1958), a British comedy that starred Frankie Vaughan and Jocelyn Lane. Barker continued to make headway in television and eventually landed a break by joining the satirical sketch series, \"The Frost Report\" (BBC, 1966-67), led by British television personality David Frost and featuring iconic British comedian John Cleese before he founded Monty Python. It was also on \"The Frost Report\" that Barker met Ronnie Corbett, who would become one of Barker's frequent collaborators in the future. Through David Frost, Barker was given his own show in 1968 called \"The Ronnie Barker Playhouse\" (Rediffusion, 1968), a six-episode series that showcased Barker's comedic talents.\n\nAlthough he was now a recognized figure in British television, Barker's popularity had yet to rise to its pinnacle. BBC was impressed by the comedic material Barker and Corbett had performed in the 1971 BAFTA Awards and granted them their own show. \"The Two Ronnies\" began its long run in 1971 to immediate success. The comedic sketch show was lauded for its variety and sharp wit, and won several BAFTA TV awards for Barker and Corbett in the Best Light Entertainment Performance category. \"The Two Ronnies\" opened up more opportunities for Barker on television. The BBC let him produce two sitcom pilots, which eventually became the series \"Porridge\" and \"Open All Hours.\" From 1974 to 1977, \"Porridge\" centered around two inmates, played by Barker and Richard Beckinsale, who are interned at the fictional HMP Slade prison. \"Open All Hours\" was a bona fide television hit that ran as four series in 1976, 1981, 1982, and 1985, . Barker played the series' central character Albert Arkwright, a miserly old man with a hilarious stammer. Both programs have been deemed to be two of the greatest British sitcoms of all time.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Barker's career had spanned over three decades. Some of his subsequent series such as \"The Magnificent Evans\" (BBC1, 1984) and \"Clarence\" (BBC1, 1988) were nowhere near as successful as \"Porridge\" and Open All Hours,\" and Barker wanted to go out on a high note. At the height of his fame, Barker retired from show business so as not to damage his legacy, as well as concerns about his health. However, Barker occasionally made guest appearances on TV after his retirement. His first return to television was when he and Corbett appeared as guests on the popular British cooking show \"Two Fat Ladies\" in 1997, just a little over a decade after his retirement. Despite not being in the television spotlight, he was not forgotten by the industry. In 2004, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded him the Lifetime Achievement Award. In the following year, he and Corbett were one of the first 100 people who were given a star on London's Avenue of the Stars. To commemorate the 18th anniversary of the last episode of \"The Two Ronnies,\" BBC put together a special clip show in 2005 called \"The Two Ronnies Sketchbook\" that featured newly recorded introductions from Barker and Corbett. Unfortunately, it was the last time Barker would appear on television. Due to his failing health, Barker died on October 3, 2005 at the age of 76."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Ronnie-Barker/6000000071857866147", "page_content": "About Ronnie Barker\n\nRonnie Barker\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBorn Ronald William George Barker\n\n25 September 1929\n\nBedford, Bedfordshire, England\n\nDied 3 October 2005 (aged 76)\n\nAdderbury, Oxfordshire, England\n\nCause of death Heart failure\n\nResting place Banbury Crematorium\n\nOther names Bob Ferris\n\nJack Goetz\n\nGerald Wiley\n\nDavid Huggett\n\nJonathan Cobbald\n\nOccupation Actor, comedian, writer\n\nYears active 1946\u20131988, 1999\u20132005\n\nSpouse(s) Joy Tubb (1957\u20132005; his death)\n\nChildren 3, including Charlotte Barker\n\nComedy career\n\nMedium Stand-up comedy, film, television, theatre, books\n\nGenres Observational comedy, insult comedy, shock humour, black comedy, ribaldry, improvisational comedy\n\nRonald William George Barker, OBE (25 September 1929 \u2013 3 October 2005) was an English actor, comedian and writer. He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as Porridge, The Two Ronnies, and Open All Hours.\n\nBarker began acting in repertory theatre and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and starred in ITV shows including a short film.\n\nAfter rejoining the BBC, Barker found fame with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u20131987), with Ronnie Corbett. He starred in the sitcoms Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and Open All Hours. He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including \"Gerald Wiley\") to avoid pre-judgments of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and received an OBE in 1978.\n\nLater television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.\n\nEarly life\n\nBarker was born on 25 September 1929 in Bedford, Bedfordshire, the only son of Leonard (known as \"Tim\") and Edith (known as \"Cis\") Barker Barker's elder sister Vera was born in 1926 and his younger sister Eileen was born in 1933.His father was a clerk for Shell-Mex, and this job saw the family move to Church Cowley Road in Cowley, Oxfordshire when Barker was four. Barker's biographer Bob McCabe described his childhood as \"a happy time, marred by no ructions or family tensions, apart from the occasional wet sock.\" As a child, Barker enjoyed dressing up, particularly in his father's pierrot outfit, as well as films, comics, and animals. He developed a love of the theatre, often attending plays with his family. The first play he saw was Cottage to Let and he once skipped school to see Laurence Olivier in Henry V. He frequently stood outside stage doors to collect autographs, his first being the actress Celia Johnson.\n\nBarker grew up in the Florence Park area of Oxford, and went to Donnington Junior School, and then the City of Oxford High School for Boys. Barker's chemistry textbook at Oxford was previously used by T. E. Lawrence. He found his talent for humour at school and developed his musical ability by singing in the choir at St James's, his local church. He got into the sixth form a year early after gaining the School Certificate[12] but he felt what he was learning would be of no use to him in later life and so left as soon as he could. After leaving school he trained as an architect but gave it up after six months, feeling he was not skilled enough. Barker took his sister Vera's job as a bank clerk at the Westminster Bank after she had left to become a nurse. He harboured dreams of becoming an actor, and took up amateur dramatics, although initially he just saw the pastime as a chance to meet girls. For 18 months, while at the bank, he worked as an actor and stage manager, making his first appearance in A Murder Has Been Arranged as the musical director of the play-within-a-play. Eventually he gave up his job to become a professional actor. His father did not support his acting ambition.\n\nCareer\n\nTheatrical career\n\nBarker failed to get into the Young Vic School, but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was employed as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning \u00a32.10s.0d (\u00a32.50) a week. He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J.M. Barrie's Quality Street.He went on to play the organist in When We Are Married and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in Miranda, Barker realised he wanted to be a comic actor. He was described as \"ha[ving] the talent to be a great straight actor\", but noted: \"I want to make people laugh. Never mind about Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charley's Aunt. My mission in life was now crystal clear.\" He appeared in stage adaptations of Treasure Island and Red Riding Hood before getting his first leading role in The Guinea Pig as a working class boy at a public school.[14] When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after. Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of \"Charlie\" so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance. He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players. There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he \"ever learned about comedy.\"\n\nHe joined the Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked there for three years, appearing in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 1955.[2][5] By the time he had made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays. Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening. Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce for two years from 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Night's Dream as Quince.\n\nEarly media career\n\nBarker's theatrical success enabled him to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name \"Ronald\", was now referred to as the less formal form \"Ronnie\", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggit's. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the lookout Able Seaman 'Fatso' Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton, in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes. He also featured in the show's radio spin-off The TV Lark as Fatso Johnson, a camera operator, and as a trainee chef in Crowther's Crowd in 1963, and had roles on Variety Playhouse. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn's show I'm Not Bothered. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch).[22] This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint and The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover. In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpson's gentle comedy, The Bargee, as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbett's rascally Hemmel Pike. Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).\n\nIn 1966, Barker got his break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report, having been recommended for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, while many of the other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on.[25] Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The Frost Report's best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.\n\nAfter the first series, the special Frost Over England was produced, winning the Golden Rose at the Montreux Television Festival. With a second series of the show announced, Frost, recognising their potential, signed both Barker and Corbett up to his production company David Paradine Productions. As part of the deal Barker was given his own show in 1968, The Ronnie Barker Playhouse, which comprised six separate, thirty-minute plays. Barker starred in each piece as a different character. After two series of The Frost Report on the BBC, totalling 26 half-hour episodes, Frost moved to ITV after helping to set up London Weekend Television. There, Frost hosted Frost on Sunday, with Barker and Corbett following and again performing sketches on the programme. Barker began writing sketches for the programme under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. Barker and Corbett had a greater role on the show than on The Frost Report and Corbett felt \"more aware of what [they] were doing.\"\n\nBarker began using the pseudonym Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces to be accepted on merit and not just because he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, and they were very well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett \"Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there\", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, \"I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?\" One of the first sketches he wrote was called \"Doctor's Waiting Room\", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for \u00a33,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and No\u00ebl Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.\n\nIn 1969 Barker was able to write, produce and star as General Futtock in the film Futtocks End which featured no dialogue and only \"grumble[s] and grunt[s]\". The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode \"Ah, There You Are\" by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen. The character returned for the 1969\u20131970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker. Despite Barker's success on ITV, LWT's programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frost's company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.\n\nMove to the BBC and The Two Ronnies\n\nSoon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson performed a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two also had to keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who were sitting in the audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he \"must have offered them too much money.\"Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work in the same way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.\n\nTheir show together was The Two Ronnies, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success. The show, as described by Anthony Hayward of The Independent, was \"a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries.\"[5] The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbett's monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two in the style of newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase \"It's good night from me \u2013 and it's good night from him.\" This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the show's run. The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker \"was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience.\" Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act. Filming took place over four months of each year. After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.\n\nBarker wrote much of the show's material, roughly three-quarters, again under the name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily involved with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a \"perfectionist\" and \"as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look.\"After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look through all of the potential material for the studio recording of the rest of the show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting \"People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage \u2013 wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune.\" They took turns to play the parts which had the \"good lines\". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: \"You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers.\"\n\nBarker's material included the sketch which came to be known as \"Four Candles\", airing in 1976, although in the original script it was entitled \"Annie Finkhouse\". It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of things in a hardware store. The sketch's humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between \"four candles\" and \"fork handles\". The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes, Hillingdon who wrote in to The Two Ronnies to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store. Barker was never happy with the sketch's final line (a male assistant asking \"What sort of billhooks did you want?\") and changed it (to a female assistant asking \"What sort of knockers were you looking for?\") for the stage version of The Two Ronnies, although he was still not totally satisfied with it. Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the show's most famous one and was voted as the show's best in a TV special, while also placing fifth on Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches. The original script, hand-written by Barker, was sold for \u00a348,500 at auction in 2007 after being featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow the previous year.\n\nThe show was considered a \"national institution\" with audiences of between 15 and 20 million regularly tuning in to its 93 episodes. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1971 and 1977 for the show. The Two Ronnies ended with the 1987 Christmas special. In 1978 the two performed a stage version of the show at the London Palladium; lasting for three months, it followed the same format as the show, with old sketches and some new material, supported by variety acts. Barker's unease with appearing as himself in the stage show led him to create a fictionalised version of himself to play instead. A second stage series took place in 1983.[53] Barker was reportedly offended by a sketch called 'The Two Ninnies' on the BBC's Not the Nine O'Clock News, which mocked their act as being based on dated innuendo-based humour.\n\nAfter a tip-off from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Barker and Corbett opted to move with their families to Sydney, Australia in 1979 for the year to exploit a tax loophole and avoid paying the year's income tax. They performed their stage show for four weeks in Sydney and a further four in Melbourne; because of their existing popularity in Australia and, what Corbett terms, the Australian audiences' \"[comedic] soul that still related to the UK,\" they made no changes to the routine. Barker made no other appearances that year and spent his time writing and engaging in recreational activities.[58] Following the show's success, Kerry Packer commissioned a six episode TV series of The Two Ronnies in Australia for Nine Network. The show comprised material not yet shown in Australia from The Two Ronnies and new content targeted more towards an Australian audience.They returned for a second series in 1986.\n\nBarker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent, films The Picnic (1975) and By the Sea (1982). By the Sea was Barker's tribute to the seaside postcard humour of Donald McGill and his most \"personal\" work. The show was also widely syndicated in North America by PBS and CBC, and in 1980 they appeared in the short-lived NBC variety show The Big Show; the two were glad the show did not last as they objected to the use of canned laughter by the American networks.\n\nPorridge, Open All Hours and other work\n\nFollowing the success of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide what he wanted to do.[2] The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, allowing time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each.[63] Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973's Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge, airing from 1974\u20131977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show \"was about what it took to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane.\" The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge's voice was performed by Barker. The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as \"a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what remains one of the most classic British sitcoms ever produced.\" The Times called Fletcher his \"finest creation\". Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.\n\nIn 1976, Barker played Friar Tuck in the film Robin and Marian, directed by Richard Lester. The same year, determined not to be remembered only as Fletcher, Barker opted to end Porridge after two series and instead focused on the second pilot Open All Hours, alongside David Jason. Barker starred as Arkwright, a money-grabbing, stuttering shopkeeper. Arkwright's stutter was not in the script; Barker was inspired to use it by Melvyn's performance and use of a stutter in a 1955 play the two performed at the Palace Theatre called Hot Water. Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two but was not renewed due to low ratings. As a result, Barker backtracked on his earlier decision and produced a third series of Porridge, as well as a film adaptation. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom Going Straight which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison. While not as popular as Porridge, Barker again won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance. Plans to further the show were ended when Barker's co-star Richard Beckinsale died of a heart attack in 1979 aged 31. With repeats of Open All Hours earning high ratings on BBC One, the BBC commissioned a further series of the show in 1981, with another two made as well as the show continued its ratings success.[2][5] Both shows placed in the top ten of the 2004 poll to determine Britain's Best Sitcom; Porridge finished seventh and\n\nOpen All Hours eighth.\n\nBarker's next sitcom, The Magnificent Evans, which was about a Welsh photographer and aired in 1984, was not successful. His final sitcom, Clarence in which he played Clarence Sale, a removal man with failing sight, aired in 1988. Barker wrote the show himself, again using a pseudonym, this time as \"Bob Ferris\".\n\nRetirement and re-appearances\n\n\"I had completely run out of ideas and it scared and panicked me. I was always able to write scripts but, you know, I couldn't think of a single thing to write about. It was a very weird sensation. I had seen friends of mine start burning out. No one wants to see a 70-year-old on television who can't remember his lines. And also I had lost interest\"\n\n\u2014Barker on his decision to retire\n\nIn 1987, before Clarence aired and after rejecting Hall's offer of the part of Falstaff in a Royal National Theatre production of Henry IV, Part 1 & 2,Barker retired from show business, aged 58, \"at the height of his fame\", citing a decline in his own writing quality, lack of ambition and ideas, and a desire to go out on top so as not to damage his legacy, as well as concerns about the state of his heart. He had decided to retire in 1985 but his decision was kept secret for two years, Corbett being the only one knowing about it. He made his decision public on an appearance on the chat show Wogan. Retired, Barker opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire and resisted all calls to come out of retirement from then onwards. He joked: \"I lose money every week, but it's a hobby. It's cheaper than skiing and safer at my age.\" Because of its unprofitability, the shop was sold after ten years. He wrote his autobiography, Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and released All I Ever Wrote, his complete scripts, in 1999. He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, which was performed at The King's Head Theatre, but garnered a negative response, with Barker stating it got \"the worst notices of any play in the history of the theatre.\"\n\nJust over a decade after retiring, Barker was persuaded to make occasional appearances on television again. In 1997 he appeared with Corbett at the Royal Command Performance, driving on stage in a motorcycle as the Two Fat Ladies, and in 1999 he was reunited with Corbett for Two Ronnies Night on BBC One, and the following year for A Tribute to the Two Ronnies.[5] In 2002, director Richard Loncraine persuaded Barker to appear as Winston Churchill's butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama The Gathering Storm and then cast him in the larger role of the General in the TV film My House in Umbria in 2003, alongside Maggie Smith (whom he had, early in their careers, advised to give up acting as he felt she would not be a success). In the same year, he briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box. Barker received several lifetime achievement awards. He won the Royal Television Society's award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975. Sir Alec Guinness presented him with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards in 1990, while he received another such honour at the BBC Centenary Programme in 1996. In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, a televised celebratory tribute evening. In 2005, he and Corbett were part of the first 100 people given stars on London's Avenue of Stars. Previous awards included the Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981. Following the success of Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, Barker wanted to return The Two Ronnies to television and the BBC commissioned The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, a clip show of their best sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were recorded in one day due to Barker's declining health and aired in 2005. The project, when announced, met with \"some derision among the professional critics\", but after the first episode drew eight million viewers, they had to \"eat their words\". The final special, and Barker's final appearance on television \u2013 The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook \u2013 was recorded in July 2005 as a result of Barker's failing health and aired posthumously in December.\n\nActing and writing style\n\n\"I'll tell you who my favourite performer is. Ronnie Barker. Surprised? You shouldn't be. He's really great.\"\n\nSir Alec Guinness\n\nBarker became a comic actor in his theatre days, noting \"I think it's better to make people laugh than cry.\" He has been described by The Times as \"not a comedian, [but] an actor with a talent for comedy,\" who \"slipped into characters with apparent ease.\" Barker felt he was funny only in character. The BBC wrote of him: \"Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself 'completely boring' without a script.\" Peter Hall spoke of Barker's skills as a dramatic actor, calling him \"the great actor we lost\" and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions. Barker, though, preferred comedy, and felt it was \"as good and as important as serious work\" and he was not \"dumbing down\" by doing it. Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying \"no matter how farcical [his performance] was ... there was always an element of reality to what he did.\" Corbett praised Barker's skill at playing serious authority figures saying absurd things, using Barker's verbal dexterity and energetic performances.\n\nBarker's writing style was, for The Times, \"based on precise scripts and perfect timing.\" It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres.[2] Dennis Baker of The Guardian wrote that Barker \"preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy.\" Corbett said he had \"a mastery of the English language\".\n\nIn private, he annotated a copy of A Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear, penning punch lines of his own for each limerick. On the title page he wrote, \"There was an old fossil named Lear, Whose verses were boring and drear. His last lines were worst \u2013 just the same as the first! So I've tried to improve on them here.\" The annotated copy of Lear's book, signed and dated November 2001, was auctioned in 2012.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBarker met Joy Tubb in Cambridge while she was a stage manager for two plays he was in. They married nine months later in July 1957 and had three children: two sons, Larry (born 1959) and Adam (born 1968), who became an actor, and one daughter, Charlotte (born 1962), who became an actress. Larry was named after Barker's idol Laurence Olivier.The family lived in Pinner for many years, and subsequently in a converted mill in Dean, Oxfordshire. According to Corbett, Barker was \"first and foremost a family man\". Joy died in January 2011, aged 78.\n\nBarker received an OBE in 1978. He was an avid collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards.[88] He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, \"I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have to be someone else to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose.\"\n\nBarker was a heavy smoker until 1972, when he gave up the habit after having a pre-cancerous growth removed from his throat; he took to drinking wine and using placebo cigarettes to maintain his concentration and help him sleep.He underwent a heart bypass in 1996 and survived a pulmonary embolism the following year.\n\nDeath\n\nBarker opted not to have heart valve replacement surgery, and his health rapidly declined after the recording of The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook. He died of heart failure at the Katherine House hospice in Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on 3 October 2005, aged 76, with his wife by his side. News of his death made top billing on television news bulletins, and The Sun ran a front page with just the headline \"It's Goodnight From Him\" and an image of Barker's glasses.\n\nBarker was cremated at a private humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was attended only by family and close friends.[68][97] A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read at the service, while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French and June Whitfield. A recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon from The Two Ronnies was played, and while the cross was in procession in the aisle of the abbey, it was accompanied by four candles instead of the usual two, in reference to the Four Candles sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe sign of the Four Candles, a Wetherspoons pub in Oxford named after Barker's comedy sketch.\n\nFollowing his death, the Writer of the Year Award at the British Comedy Awards was renamed in his honour. In 2005 he was voted as the 16th greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders in a poll to find The Comedian's Comedian.\n\nThe BBC described him as \"one of the leading figures of British television comedy\", and \"much loved and admired\". The Independent called him \"a master of television sitcom\". The Guardian said he was \"much loved ... both as an actor and a writer he was recognised as a master of pyrotechnic puns, surreal behaviour in public and private places, and crackling cross-chat\". It concluded that \"it says much about the decline of the British television industry that Ronnie Barker, one of its most creative comic talents, should have turned his back on it long before he died at the age of 76\". In a eulogy for Barker, the Reverend Robert Wright stated that he was \"undoubtedly one of the very greatest television comedy actors\" and that \"as a performer he made comedy look effortlessly funny\".\n\nIn 2006 Barker's stage play Mum was adapted and directed by Neil Cargill for BBC Radio 4, and broadcast as an Afternoon Play, starring Maxine Peake and Sam Kelly.\n\nIn Barker's home town of Oxford, a Wetherspoons pub on George Street is named after his Four Candles sketch. A bronze statue of Barker sculpted by Martin Jennings, and showing him in character as Norman Stanley Fletcher, was unveiled at the entrance of the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre in September 2010 by his widow Joy, David Jason, and Ronnie Corbett.\n\nIn 2015, the Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture (also referred to as The Ronnie Barker Talk) was commissioned by the BBC at the instigation of the head of comedy commissioning, Shane Allen. The first lecture was given in August 2017 by Ben Elton.[106] Elton's lecture focused on the future of the British sitcom.\n\nFilmography\n\n\"I have to tell you that all through my fifty years in the business, two words have always been in my thoughts \u2013 these two words are 'What luck'. What luck to have met, in the far-off days of weekly rep, a marvellous comedian called Glenn Melvyn, who gave me my first TV job and taught me how to stutter. What luck to have been in Oxford rep when a young Peter Hall arrived as director and brought me to London's West End. What luck that James Gilbert saw me do a radio show and put me in The Frost Report. What luck that the star of that show, David Frost, put me under contract, that resulted in Porridge and Open All Hours, and who paired me with the wonderful Ronnie Corbett. What luck to have had a wife for forty-five years, who throughout my television career, sat in the audience of every show and laughed louder than anyone else. And finally, standing here before you, with this most honoured award bestowed upon me by you, what luck, what wonderful luck, to be flanked on either side by my two best friends, Ronnie Corbett and David Jason. And I might cry, Gwyneth Paltrow, watch out.\"\n\n\u2014Excerpt from Barker's speech at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute Corbett says the speech was \"the first time there truly was no mask. Ronnie Barker spoke as himself, truthfully, simply and from the heart.\"\n\nFilms\n\nYear Film Role Notes\n\n1958 Wonderful Things!

He had two sisters; Vera (his older sister) and Eileen (his younger sister). The family moved to Oxford when his father, a clerk for Shell Oil , was relocated, when Barker was two years old. He took to writing plays for his family and neighbours, and often sat in the audience of The Oxford Playhouse , his local repertory company, dreaming of fame. Barker attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys , in Oxford , and at sixteen he left and took a job as a bank clerk - but the theatre called. He wrote to the Aylesbury Repertory Company in 1948 and his show business career began. Barker then went on to join the Playhouse Theatre, Oxford, at the time under the actor-management of Frank Shelley, as an actor and stagehand, at \u00a32 10s per week. The two appeared together there, in Ben Travers 's \"A Cuckoo in the Nest\" and, subsequently, in a number of other venues and roles. In 1993, Barker dedicated his autobiography to Shelley, whom he called one of the \"three wise men who directed my career; without men like these, there would be no theatre.\"\n\nuccess\n\nEarly career\n\nHe then worked as an actor and assistant stage manager with the Manchester Repertory Company, but was soon spotted by Sir Peter Hall who gave him a West End role. His first radio appearance was in 1956; he went on to play a variety of minor characters in \" The Navy Lark \", a navy based sit-com on the BBC Light Programme (still available on tape and frequently rerun on BBC 7 ). He later returned to radio in the BBC Radio 4 sketch show \" Lines From My Grandfather's Forehead \". He acted in the films Father Came Too! and The Bargee . On television, he wrote and performed many satirical skits in \" The Frost Report \", notably a series of trios which he performed with Ronnie Corbett and John Cleese . From 1961 to 1963, he starred in the three series of \" Faces of Jim \". He starred with David Jason as a bumbling aristocrat Lord Rustless in the sit-com \" Hark at Barker \". Jason appeared in several episodes of \"Porridge\", and co-starred as Granville, the errand boy and nephew of Barker's stuttering shopkeeper Arkwright in the sitcom \" Open All Hours \", written by Roy Clarke (who also wrote \" Last of the Summer Wine \" and \" Keeping Up Appearances \"). Both \"Porridge\" and \"Open All Hours\" originated as part of the \" Seven of One \" series.\n\nThe Two Ronnies\n\nHis BBC television comedy sketch show with Ronnie Corbett , in \" The Two Ronnies \", lasted from 1971 to 1987. This show saw both Barker and Corbett performing various comedy sketches and musical numbers. The programme became one of the most successful and long running television comedy shows ever on British television which at its peak averaged around 17 million viewers.\n\neven of One: Porridge and Open All Hours\n\n\"Porridge\" ran for three series, two Christmas specials and a film, produced in 1979. Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom \"Going Straight\" which, while not as popular as \"Porridge\", did win BAFTA awards. The first came at a time when Barker was grieving the early death of his co-star Richard Beckinsale , and Barker tearfully paid tribute to Beckinsale in his brief acceptance speech. The \" Open All Hours \" pilot episode was broadcast in March 1973, and ran for four series between February 1976 and October 1985.\n\nGerald Wiley\n\nBarker was also an accomplished comedy writer. He provided many of the sketches and songs for \"The Two Ronnies\", and contributed material to many other radio and TV shows\u2014often under a variety of assumed names. A typical example is the sketch Nothing's Too Much Trouble . Most famously, many contributions for The Two Ronnies were submitted by a mystery writer called Gerald Wiley. Wiley had first gained credit for his work on the Frost on Sunday show, but no one had ever met him. His status as a recluse became well known among the comedy writing fraternity, to the extent that it became almost a challenge to discover his identity. Frank Muir and Tom Stoppard were both accused by members of the writing team, including Barry Cryer , before one day, Wiley said that he would reveal himself at a Chinese restaurant. No one believed Barker at first, when he stood up and announced it was him, particularly as he himself had turned away scripts credited to Wiley. Barker admitted that he carried out this deception because he was afraid that his ideas and scripts would not be judged on merit otherwise.\n\nHis other credits include the (almost) silent films \" A Home of Your Own \" (1964), \" Futtock's End \" (1970), \" The Picnic \" (1975) and \" By the Sea \" (1982), the sit-coms \"His Lordship Entertains\", \" The Magnificent Evans \" and \"Clarence\", the plays \"Rub A Dub Dub\" and \"Mum\", and the LP \"A Pint of Old and Filthy\". Straight roles were few and far between, though he did put in a dramatic-comic turn as Cheshire in \"The Hidden Tiger\" episode of the 1960s classic series \"The Avengers\" and as Friar Tuck in \" Robin and Marian \".\n\nRetirement and return\n\nIn January 1988, following the 1987 Christmas Special of \" The Two Ronnies \" and the broadcast of \"Clarence\", Barker made an appearance on the chat show \" Wogan \", where he announced his intention to retire from showbusiness, stating that he had \"no further ambition\" and that he should \"quit while he was ahead\". Following this, he announced that he would open and run an antiques shop at his home in Oxfordshire. He resisted all calls to come out of retirement virtually from that point onwards. Barker sold his antique shop in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1999, he reunited with Ronnie Corbett for a Two Ronnies night on BBC1, where they introduced a selection of their best and most-loved sketches. In 2002, he appeared as Winston Churchill 's butler\u2014a \"straight\" role, but with opportunities for comic asides\u2014in the BBC drama \"The Gathering Storm\". This was followed up by a role in the film \" My House in Umbria \" in 2003. In the same year, he briefly reprised perhaps his most famous role of Fletcher in the spoof documentary \"\". In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA award and announced his return to television; he reunited with Ronnie Corbett to record \" The Two Ronnies Sketchbook \", a clip show of their sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were shown in March and April 2005.\n\nOn 5 July 2005, another, final special - \"The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook\", was recorded with new introductions featuring clips from their previous Christmas special shows. This was to be his last television appearance, and sadly, he knew this, as he mentioned to Corbett. This led to an early recording of the special. The show was aired in December that year.\n\nCorbett appeared before the start of the show paying tribute to \"Ron\", and that Barker informed him of his illness, leading to an early recording of the show. The studio audience weren't informed about Barker's illness or decision, and were therefore confused as to why a Christmas episode was being recorded in August.\n\nHe was voted amongst the top 20 greatest comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders in a 2005 poll to find \" The Comedian's Comedian \".\n\nPersonal life\n\nRonnie Barker married Joy Tubb on 8 July 1957 and they had three children: two sons, the actors Larry (b. 1960) and Adam (b. 1967) and one daughter, the actress Charlotte Barker (b. 1963). He retired to Dean, a hamlet near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire to run an antiques shop in late 1987. He died in a local hospice from heart failure on Monday 3 October 2005, aged 76, with his wife by his side. His catchphrase ending from \" The Two Ronnies \" provided the perfect epitaph : \"Goodnight From Him\".\"\n\nNews of his death made headlines in the United Kingdom and other countries. Ronnie Corbett said that throughout their many years working together there was never a cross word between them. He also commented that Barker was \"pure gold in triplicate - as a comedian, writer and friend\". His family kindly gave permission for his stage play, \"Mum\", written for his daughter Charlotte, to be adapted for radio. Broadcast in 2006 on BBC Radio 4 as an Afternoon Play, adapted and directed by Neil Cargill, it starred Maxine Peake in the main role alongside Barker's old Porridge collaborator, Sam Kelly, and received very favourable reviews as a \"poignant\" and \"moving\" work - a real eye-opener to those who knew only his pure comedy.\n\nHe had a private humanist funeral in Banbury , followed by a public memorial service on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey , at which Richard Briers , David Jason and Ronnie Corbett read, a recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon was played, and the choir processed in behind four candles , a reference to the Two Ronnies' most famous sketch.

He considered Norman Stanley Fletcher to be his finest creation.\n\nBorn in Bedford in 1929, Ronald William George Barker was living in Oxford in 1948 and working in a bank there. He took a trip to Aylesbury to see a play at the Market Theatre, where the Manchester Repertory Company were Performing.\n\nThe Market Theatre was off the Market Square, and behind The Green Man pub. It's gone now.\n\nBack home, he wrote to the company asking for a job and enclosing a photograph, but didn\u2019t receive a reply. He wrote to them again asking for the photo back, and they offered him an audition. At the audition, he was hired on the spot.\n\nHis first role was in J.M. Barrie\u2019s comedy play Quality Street. That was in November 1948; he was nineteen.\n\nOnce Ronnie Barker had performed in two more comedy plays he realised that he wanted to become a comic actor. In 1956 he made his first radio appearance in the sit com The Floggits. Later he played Able Seaman Fatso Johnson, in the excellent long running comedy series The Navy Lark.\n\nThis radio programme ran from 1959 to 1976, and he played a total of 40 different characters.\n\nMany people don\u2019t realise that he played another role in Porridge, too; that of the judge who sentences the \u201chabitual criminal\u201d Norman Stanley Fletcher to five years in the opening credits.

He was known for his roles in various British comedy television series, such as The Frost Report, Porridge, The Two Ronnies and Open All Hours.\n\n\n\nBorn in Bedford, he began his acting career in repertory theatre and decided he was best suited to performing comic roles. Barker gained his first acting successes at the Oxford Playhouse and later in various roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he became a cast member on BBC radio and television comedy programmes such as The Navy Lark. Barker got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966 where he met future collaborator Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and was to star in a number ITV shows including a short film during this period.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was after rejoining the BBC that he found fame with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u20141986) with Ronnie Corbett. After the series of pilots called Seven of One, he gained starring roles in the sitcoms Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and Open All Hours. Apart from being a performer, he was noted as a comedy writer both under his own name and the pseudonym Gerald Wiley, which Barker adopted to avoid pre-judgements of his talent. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times, amongst other awards, and received an OBE in 1978.\n\n\n\nLater television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he decided to retire in 1987. After his retirement, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1997, he appeared in a number of smaller, non-comic roles in films.\n\n\n\nBarker's writing style was \"based on precise scripts and perfect timing.\" It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres. He \"preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy.\" He \"never liked sex or obscenity on television, but there was no shortage of frisky gags in The Two Ronnies\". Corbett said he had \"a mastery of the English language\"."}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/27820337", "page_content": "Ronnie Barker a British actor, comedian, writer, critic, collector, broadcaster and businessman was born in 1929.\n\nHis first role on stage was A Murder has Been Arranged by Emlyn Williams in Oxford, 1946, where he was very active in amateur dramatics. Despite failing to get in to the Young Vic School, he began his career in theatre in the Manchester Repertory Theatre, his first professional role being that of Lieutenant Spicer in Quality Street by Sir J.M. Barrie in 1948. In 1951 he joined the Oxford Playhouse Theatre Players. Peter Hall worked with him in Oxford and brought him to London's West End.\n\nFollowing his first radio appearance in 1956 he went on to feature in The Navy Lark (1959-1977). He soon began working in television and film, from 1962 appearing in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim . He also appeared in A Tale of Two Cities (1965) and the films Kill or Cure (1962), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).\n\nHis break came in the 1966 satirical sketch series The Frost Report which starred David Frost, John Cleese and his future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett. In 1968 he was given his own show The Ronnie Barker Playhouse . David Frost moved to ITV and hosted Frost on Sunday, which featured Barker and Corbett more prominently. It was also during this period that Barker began writing sketches under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. In 1969 Barker produced, wrote and performed in the comedy film Futtock's End which featured no dialogue, only grunts. The series Hark at Barker (1969-1970) featured the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless who originally appeared in The Ronnie Barker Playhouse . Barker wrote for the show under the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker .\n\nBarker and Corbett were signed up to do a show together at the BBC after impressing the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton at the 1971 BAFTAs where they successfully kept the audience entertained for several minutes when the show was stopped due to technical difficulties. That show was The Two Ronnies which was an immediate and long running success, with twelve series running from 1971-1986. They filmed on location in the West Country for much of the series. Barker wrote much of the show's material as Gerald Wiley. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972, written by Barker under the name Jonathon Cobbald.\n\nBarker played Friar Tuck in the 1976 film Robin and Marian . Barker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent films The Picnic (1975) and By the Sea (1982). By the Sea was Barker's tribute to the seaside postcard humour of Donald McGill. Barker had a special interest in collecting postcards and amassed a collection of over 53,000. He produced several compilation books of them including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, Ronnie Barker's Book of Boudoir Beauties, Ooh-La-La: The Ladies Of Paris, Gentleman's Relish: A Saucy Look at the Fairer Sex and Pebbles On The Beach: A Tribute To The Seaside Girl . He was also a collector of antiques, books and posters.\n\nThe great success of The Two Ronnies meant that Barker was given more creative freedom which led to some sitcom pilots shown as part of Seven of One (1973). Two of these pilots became series; Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became Porridge (1974-1997) and Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) became the series of the same name. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 and 1979 for his performance of prisoner Norman Fletcher. Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two, although a second and further series were not commissioned until 1981 when repeats of the show on BBC One gained high ratings. As a result of the initial low ratings for Open All Hours, Barker produced a third series of Porridge (1977) and a 1979 film adaptation. Next came the spin-off sitcom Going Straight (1978-9) which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison.\n\nIn 1978 Harold Fielding's stage version of The Two Ronnies premiered at the Bristol Hippodrome before opening at the London Palladium and touring to Southampton. Barker and Corbett moved with their families to Sydney, Australia for tax reasons in 1979. They toured their stage show in Melbourne and Sydney and went on to produce two series of The Two Ronnies in Australia .\n\nThe next sitcom Barker produced, The Magnificent Evans (1984), was not hugely successful. He wrote his final sitcom, Clarence (1988), using the pseudonym Bob Ferris.\n\nIn 1987, in an interview with Terry Wogan, Barker announced his retirement from show business. Following his retirement he opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire. After ten years the shop was sold, due to its unprofitability, and a few years later Barker began to make occasional television appearances again.\n\nBarker wrote his autobiography Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and published his complete scripts All I Ever Wrote in 1999. He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, that was performed at the King's Head Theatre.\n\nIn 1997 Barker and Corbett drove on stage in a motorcycle as the Two Fat Ladies at the Royal Command Performance. In 1999 they reunited for the Two Ronnies Night on BBC One, and the following year for A Tribute to the Two Ronnies . In 2002 Barker was persuaded by director Richard Loncraine to play Winston Churchill's butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama The Gathering Storm, and in 2003 was also cast in the TV film My House in Umbria . Barker briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box (2003).\n\nBarker received several awards throughout his career, including the Royal Television Society's award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975. He was presented by Sir Alec Guinness with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards (1990) and received the same again at the BBC Centenary Programme (1996). He was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award, at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, a televised celebratory tribute evening in 2003. Alongside Corbett, Barker was one of the first 100 people given stars on London's Avenue of Stars in 2005. Earlier awards include the Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981. In 1978 Barker received an OBE.\n\nBarker's health declined rapidly after the filming of The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook and he died in October 2005.\n\nFrom the guide to the Ronnie Barker Collection, 1929-2005, (V&A Department of Theatre and Performance)"}], "Ronald William George Barker had a minor role in the film The Wrong Arm of the Law.": [{"url": "https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1681/kill-or-cure", "page_content": "Ronnie Barker, the British comic actor whose portly physique and jovial demeanor made him a star on British television and film through five decades, died on October 3 at his home in Oxfordshire, England after enduring a long battle with heart disease.

He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and starred in ITV shows including a short film.\n\nAfter rejoining the BBC, Barker found fame with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u20131987), with Ronnie Corbett. He starred in the sitcoms Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and Open All Hours. He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including \"Gerald Wiley\") to avoid pre-judgments of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and received an OBE in 1978.\n\nLater television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.\n\nEarly life\n\nBarker was born on 25 September 1929 in Bedford, Bedfordshire, the only son of Leonard (known as \"Tim\") and Edith (known as \"Cis\") Barker Barker's elder sister Vera was born in 1926 and his younger sister Eileen was born in 1933.His father was a clerk for Shell-Mex, and this job saw the family move to Church Cowley Road in Cowley, Oxfordshire when Barker was four. Barker's biographer Bob McCabe described his childhood as \"a happy time, marred by no ructions or family tensions, apart from the occasional wet sock.\" As a child, Barker enjoyed dressing up, particularly in his father's pierrot outfit, as well as films, comics, and animals. He developed a love of the theatre, often attending plays with his family. The first play he saw was Cottage to Let and he once skipped school to see Laurence Olivier in Henry V. He frequently stood outside stage doors to collect autographs, his first being the actress Celia Johnson.\n\nBarker grew up in the Florence Park area of Oxford, and went to Donnington Junior School, and then the City of Oxford High School for Boys. Barker's chemistry textbook at Oxford was previously used by T. E. Lawrence. He found his talent for humour at school and developed his musical ability by singing in the choir at St James's, his local church. He got into the sixth form a year early after gaining the School Certificate[12] but he felt what he was learning would be of no use to him in later life and so left as soon as he could. After leaving school he trained as an architect but gave it up after six months, feeling he was not skilled enough. Barker took his sister Vera's job as a bank clerk at the Westminster Bank after she had left to become a nurse. He harboured dreams of becoming an actor, and took up amateur dramatics, although initially he just saw the pastime as a chance to meet girls. For 18 months, while at the bank, he worked as an actor and stage manager, making his first appearance in A Murder Has Been Arranged as the musical director of the play-within-a-play. Eventually he gave up his job to become a professional actor. His father did not support his acting ambition.\n\nCareer\n\nTheatrical career\n\nBarker failed to get into the Young Vic School, but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was employed as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning \u00a32.10s.0d (\u00a32.50) a week. He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J.M. Barrie's Quality Street.He went on to play the organist in When We Are Married and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in Miranda, Barker realised he wanted to be a comic actor. He was described as \"ha[ving] the talent to be a great straight actor\", but noted: \"I want to make people laugh. Never mind about Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charley's Aunt. My mission in life was now crystal clear.\" He appeared in stage adaptations of Treasure Island and Red Riding Hood before getting his first leading role in The Guinea Pig as a working class boy at a public school.[14] When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after. Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of \"Charlie\" so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance. He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players. There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he \"ever learned about comedy.\"\n\nHe joined the Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked there for three years, appearing in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 1955.[2][5] By the time he had made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays. Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening. Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce for two years from 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Night's Dream as Quince.\n\nEarly media career\n\nBarker's theatrical success enabled him to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name \"Ronald\", was now referred to as the less formal form \"Ronnie\", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggit's. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the lookout Able Seaman 'Fatso' Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton, in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes. He also featured in the show's radio spin-off The TV Lark as Fatso Johnson, a camera operator, and as a trainee chef in Crowther's Crowd in 1963, and had roles on Variety Playhouse. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn's show I'm Not Bothered. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch).[22] This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint and The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover. In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpson's gentle comedy, The Bargee, as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbett's rascally Hemmel Pike. Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).\n\nIn 1966, Barker got his break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report, having been recommended for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, while many of the other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on.[25] Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The Frost Report's best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.\n\nAfter the first series, the special Frost Over England was produced, winning the Golden Rose at the Montreux Television Festival. With a second series of the show announced, Frost, recognising their potential, signed both Barker and Corbett up to his production company David Paradine Productions. As part of the deal Barker was given his own show in 1968, The Ronnie Barker Playhouse, which comprised six separate, thirty-minute plays. Barker starred in each piece as a different character. After two series of The Frost Report on the BBC, totalling 26 half-hour episodes, Frost moved to ITV after helping to set up London Weekend Television. There, Frost hosted Frost on Sunday, with Barker and Corbett following and again performing sketches on the programme. Barker began writing sketches for the programme under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. Barker and Corbett had a greater role on the show than on The Frost Report and Corbett felt \"more aware of what [they] were doing.\"\n\nBarker began using the pseudonym Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces to be accepted on merit and not just because he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, and they were very well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett \"Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there\", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, \"I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?\" One of the first sketches he wrote was called \"Doctor's Waiting Room\", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for \u00a33,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and No\u00ebl Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.\n\nIn 1969 Barker was able to write, produce and star as General Futtock in the film Futtocks End which featured no dialogue and only \"grumble[s] and grunt[s]\". The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode \"Ah, There You Are\" by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen. The character returned for the 1969\u20131970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker. Despite Barker's success on ITV, LWT's programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frost's company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.\n\nMove to the BBC and The Two Ronnies\n\nSoon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson performed a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two also had to keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who were sitting in the audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he \"must have offered them too much money.\"Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work in the same way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.\n\nTheir show together was The Two Ronnies, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success. The show, as described by Anthony Hayward of The Independent, was \"a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries.\"[5] The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbett's monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two in the style of newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase \"It's good night from me \u2013 and it's good night from him.\" This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the show's run. The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker \"was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience.\" Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act. Filming took place over four months of each year. After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.\n\nBarker wrote much of the show's material, roughly three-quarters, again under the name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily involved with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a \"perfectionist\" and \"as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look.\"After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look through all of the potential material for the studio recording of the rest of the show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting \"People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage \u2013 wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune.\" They took turns to play the parts which had the \"good lines\". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: \"You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers.\"\n\nBarker's material included the sketch which came to be known as \"Four Candles\", airing in 1976, although in the original script it was entitled \"Annie Finkhouse\". It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of things in a hardware store. The sketch's humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between \"four candles\" and \"fork handles\". The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes, Hillingdon who wrote in to The Two Ronnies to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store. Barker was never happy with the sketch's final line (a male assistant asking \"What sort of billhooks did you want?\") and changed it (to a female assistant asking \"What sort of knockers were you looking for?\") for the stage version of The Two Ronnies, although he was still not totally satisfied with it. Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the show's most famous one and was voted as the show's best in a TV special, while also placing fifth on Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches. The original script, hand-written by Barker, was sold for \u00a348,500 at auction in 2007 after being featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow the previous year.\n\nThe show was considered a \"national institution\" with audiences of between 15 and 20 million regularly tuning in to its 93 episodes. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1971 and 1977 for the show. The Two Ronnies ended with the 1987 Christmas special. In 1978 the two performed a stage version of the show at the London Palladium; lasting for three months, it followed the same format as the show, with old sketches and some new material, supported by variety acts. Barker's unease with appearing as himself in the stage show led him to create a fictionalised version of himself to play instead. A second stage series took place in 1983.[53] Barker was reportedly offended by a sketch called 'The Two Ninnies' on the BBC's Not the Nine O'Clock News, which mocked their act as being based on dated innuendo-based humour.\n\nAfter a tip-off from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Barker and Corbett opted to move with their families to Sydney, Australia in 1979 for the year to exploit a tax loophole and avoid paying the year's income tax. They performed their stage show for four weeks in Sydney and a further four in Melbourne; because of their existing popularity in Australia and, what Corbett terms, the Australian audiences' \"[comedic] soul that still related to the UK,\" they made no changes to the routine. Barker made no other appearances that year and spent his time writing and engaging in recreational activities.[58] Following the show's success, Kerry Packer commissioned a six episode TV series of The Two Ronnies in Australia for Nine Network. The show comprised material not yet shown in Australia from The Two Ronnies and new content targeted more towards an Australian audience.They returned for a second series in 1986.\n\nBarker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent, films The Picnic (1975) and By the Sea (1982). By the Sea was Barker's tribute to the seaside postcard humour of Donald McGill and his most \"personal\" work. The show was also widely syndicated in North America by PBS and CBC, and in 1980 they appeared in the short-lived NBC variety show The Big Show; the two were glad the show did not last as they objected to the use of canned laughter by the American networks.\n\nPorridge, Open All Hours and other work\n\nFollowing the success of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide what he wanted to do.[2] The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, allowing time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each.[63] Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973's Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge, airing from 1974\u20131977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show \"was about what it took to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane.\" The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge's voice was performed by Barker. The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as \"a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what remains one of the most classic British sitcoms ever produced.\" The Times called Fletcher his \"finest creation\". Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.\n\nIn 1976, Barker played Friar Tuck in the film Robin and Marian, directed by Richard Lester. The same year, determined not to be remembered only as Fletcher, Barker opted to end Porridge after two series and instead focused on the second pilot Open All Hours, alongside David Jason. Barker starred as Arkwright, a money-grabbing, stuttering shopkeeper. Arkwright's stutter was not in the script; Barker was inspired to use it by Melvyn's performance and use of a stutter in a 1955 play the two performed at the Palace Theatre called Hot Water. Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two but was not renewed due to low ratings. As a result, Barker backtracked on his earlier decision and produced a third series of Porridge, as well as a film adaptation. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom Going Straight which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison. While not as popular as Porridge, Barker again won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance. Plans to further the show were ended when Barker's co-star Richard Beckinsale died of a heart attack in 1979 aged 31. With repeats of Open All Hours earning high ratings on BBC One, the BBC commissioned a further series of the show in 1981, with another two made as well as the show continued its ratings success.[2][5] Both shows placed in the top ten of the 2004 poll to determine Britain's Best Sitcom; Porridge finished seventh and\n\nOpen All Hours eighth.\n\nBarker's next sitcom, The Magnificent Evans, which was about a Welsh photographer and aired in 1984, was not successful. His final sitcom, Clarence in which he played Clarence Sale, a removal man with failing sight, aired in 1988. Barker wrote the show himself, again using a pseudonym, this time as \"Bob Ferris\".\n\nRetirement and re-appearances\n\n\"I had completely run out of ideas and it scared and panicked me. I was always able to write scripts but, you know, I couldn't think of a single thing to write about. It was a very weird sensation. I had seen friends of mine start burning out. No one wants to see a 70-year-old on television who can't remember his lines. And also I had lost interest\"\n\n\u2014Barker on his decision to retire\n\nIn 1987, before Clarence aired and after rejecting Hall's offer of the part of Falstaff in a Royal National Theatre production of Henry IV, Part 1 & 2,Barker retired from show business, aged 58, \"at the height of his fame\", citing a decline in his own writing quality, lack of ambition and ideas, and a desire to go out on top so as not to damage his legacy, as well as concerns about the state of his heart. He had decided to retire in 1985 but his decision was kept secret for two years, Corbett being the only one knowing about it. He made his decision public on an appearance on the chat show Wogan. Retired, Barker opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire and resisted all calls to come out of retirement from then onwards. He joked: \"I lose money every week, but it's a hobby. It's cheaper than skiing and safer at my age.\" Because of its unprofitability, the shop was sold after ten years. He wrote his autobiography, Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and released All I Ever Wrote, his complete scripts, in 1999. He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, which was performed at The King's Head Theatre, but garnered a negative response, with Barker stating it got \"the worst notices of any play in the history of the theatre.\"\n\nJust over a decade after retiring, Barker was persuaded to make occasional appearances on television again. In 1997 he appeared with Corbett at the Royal Command Performance, driving on stage in a motorcycle as the Two Fat Ladies, and in 1999 he was reunited with Corbett for Two Ronnies Night on BBC One, and the following year for A Tribute to the Two Ronnies.[5] In 2002, director Richard Loncraine persuaded Barker to appear as Winston Churchill's butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama The Gathering Storm and then cast him in the larger role of the General in the TV film My House in Umbria in 2003, alongside Maggie Smith (whom he had, early in their careers, advised to give up acting as he felt she would not be a success). In the same year, he briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box. Barker received several lifetime achievement awards. He won the Royal Television Society's award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975. Sir Alec Guinness presented him with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards in 1990, while he received another such honour at the BBC Centenary Programme in 1996. In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, a televised celebratory tribute evening. In 2005, he and Corbett were part of the first 100 people given stars on London's Avenue of Stars. Previous awards included the Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981. Following the success of Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, Barker wanted to return The Two Ronnies to television and the BBC commissioned The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, a clip show of their best sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were recorded in one day due to Barker's declining health and aired in 2005. The project, when announced, met with \"some derision among the professional critics\", but after the first episode drew eight million viewers, they had to \"eat their words\". The final special, and Barker's final appearance on television \u2013 The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook \u2013 was recorded in July 2005 as a result of Barker's failing health and aired posthumously in December.\n\nActing and writing style\n\n\"I'll tell you who my favourite performer is. Ronnie Barker. Surprised? You shouldn't be. He's really great.\"\n\nSir Alec Guinness\n\nBarker became a comic actor in his theatre days, noting \"I think it's better to make people laugh than cry.\" He has been described by The Times as \"not a comedian, [but] an actor with a talent for comedy,\" who \"slipped into characters with apparent ease.\" Barker felt he was funny only in character. The BBC wrote of him: \"Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself 'completely boring' without a script.\" Peter Hall spoke of Barker's skills as a dramatic actor, calling him \"the great actor we lost\" and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions. Barker, though, preferred comedy, and felt it was \"as good and as important as serious work\" and he was not \"dumbing down\" by doing it. Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying \"no matter how farcical [his performance] was ... there was always an element of reality to what he did.\" Corbett praised Barker's skill at playing serious authority figures saying absurd things, using Barker's verbal dexterity and energetic performances.\n\nBarker's writing style was, for The Times, \"based on precise scripts and perfect timing.\" It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres.[2] Dennis Baker of The Guardian wrote that Barker \"preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy.\" Corbett said he had \"a mastery of the English language\".\n\nIn private, he annotated a copy of A Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear, penning punch lines of his own for each limerick. On the title page he wrote, \"There was an old fossil named Lear, Whose verses were boring and drear. His last lines were worst \u2013 just the same as the first! So I've tried to improve on them here.\" The annotated copy of Lear's book, signed and dated November 2001, was auctioned in 2012.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBarker met Joy Tubb in Cambridge while she was a stage manager for two plays he was in. They married nine months later in July 1957 and had three children: two sons, Larry (born 1959) and Adam (born 1968), who became an actor, and one daughter, Charlotte (born 1962), who became an actress. Larry was named after Barker's idol Laurence Olivier.The family lived in Pinner for many years, and subsequently in a converted mill in Dean, Oxfordshire. According to Corbett, Barker was \"first and foremost a family man\". Joy died in January 2011, aged 78.\n\nBarker received an OBE in 1978. He was an avid collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards.[88] He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, \"I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have to be someone else to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose.\"\n\nBarker was a heavy smoker until 1972, when he gave up the habit after having a pre-cancerous growth removed from his throat; he took to drinking wine and using placebo cigarettes to maintain his concentration and help him sleep.He underwent a heart bypass in 1996 and survived a pulmonary embolism the following year.\n\nDeath\n\nBarker opted not to have heart valve replacement surgery, and his health rapidly declined after the recording of The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook. He died of heart failure at the Katherine House hospice in Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on 3 October 2005, aged 76, with his wife by his side. News of his death made top billing on television news bulletins, and The Sun ran a front page with just the headline \"It's Goodnight From Him\" and an image of Barker's glasses.\n\nBarker was cremated at a private humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was attended only by family and close friends.[68][97] A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read at the service, while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French and June Whitfield. A recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon from The Two Ronnies was played, and while the cross was in procession in the aisle of the abbey, it was accompanied by four candles instead of the usual two, in reference to the Four Candles sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe sign of the Four Candles, a Wetherspoons pub in Oxford named after Barker's comedy sketch.\n\nFollowing his death, the Writer of the Year Award at the British Comedy Awards was renamed in his honour. In 2005 he was voted as the 16th greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders in a poll to find The Comedian's Comedian.\n\nThe BBC described him as \"one of the leading figures of British television comedy\", and \"much loved and admired\". The Independent called him \"a master of television sitcom\". The Guardian said he was \"much loved ... both as an actor and a writer he was recognised as a master of pyrotechnic puns, surreal behaviour in public and private places, and crackling cross-chat\". It concluded that \"it says much about the decline of the British television industry that Ronnie Barker, one of its most creative comic talents, should have turned his back on it long before he died at the age of 76\". In a eulogy for Barker, the Reverend Robert Wright stated that he was \"undoubtedly one of the very greatest television comedy actors\" and that \"as a performer he made comedy look effortlessly funny\".\n\nIn 2006 Barker's stage play Mum was adapted and directed by Neil Cargill for BBC Radio 4, and broadcast as an Afternoon Play, starring Maxine Peake and Sam Kelly.\n\nIn Barker's home town of Oxford, a Wetherspoons pub on George Street is named after his Four Candles sketch. A bronze statue of Barker sculpted by Martin Jennings, and showing him in character as Norman Stanley Fletcher, was unveiled at the entrance of the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre in September 2010 by his widow Joy, David Jason, and Ronnie Corbett.\n\nIn 2015, the Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture (also referred to as The Ronnie Barker Talk) was commissioned by the BBC at the instigation of the head of comedy commissioning, Shane Allen. The first lecture was given in August 2017 by Ben Elton.[106] Elton's lecture focused on the future of the British sitcom.\n\nFilmography\n\n\"I have to tell you that all through my fifty years in the business, two words have always been in my thoughts \u2013 these two words are 'What luck'. What luck to have met, in the far-off days of weekly rep, a marvellous comedian called Glenn Melvyn, who gave me my first TV job and taught me how to stutter. What luck to have been in Oxford rep when a young Peter Hall arrived as director and brought me to London's West End. What luck that James Gilbert saw me do a radio show and put me in The Frost Report. What luck that the star of that show, David Frost, put me under contract, that resulted in Porridge and Open All Hours, and who paired me with the wonderful Ronnie Corbett. What luck to have had a wife for forty-five years, who throughout my television career, sat in the audience of every show and laughed louder than anyone else. And finally, standing here before you, with this most honoured award bestowed upon me by you, what luck, what wonderful luck, to be flanked on either side by my two best friends, Ronnie Corbett and David Jason. And I might cry, Gwyneth Paltrow, watch out.\"\n\n\u2014Excerpt from Barker's speech at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute Corbett says the speech was \"the first time there truly was no mask.

This caricature was made for the Radio Times.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A6359556", "page_content": "Ronnie Barker was probably the foremost British comedian of the 1970s. He created a legacy of programmes such as The Two Ronnies, Porridge and Open All Hours that have stood the twin tests of time and public opinion. His death on 3 October, 2005 led to a string of tributes from other comedians and an outpouring of affection from the public. His partnership with Ronnie Corbett rivalled even the legendary Morecambe and Wise, whilst his richly drawn characters of Fletcher and Arkwright created comedy icons that have amused two generations of viewers.\n\nRonnie Barker - His Early Life\n\nRonald William George Barker was born on 25 September, 1929 in Bedford, England. He went to Oxford High School, where he first gave an indication of his acting talents in various school productions, but at the age of 18 he decided to train as an architect. Having established that this wasn't the career for him, he joined a bank as a managerial trainee. The dream of acting remained however and in 1948, after watching the Manchester Repertory Company in Aylesbury one evening, he sent off an application for a job together with a photograph. When he received no reply he wrote back to the company asking for his photo to be returned. This time Horace Wentworth, the company's director, wrote back asking him to attend an audition. He hired Ronald immediately, but as Assistant Stage Manager in the first instance. This was very common practice at the time, as it was considered to be excellent experience for budding actors. His first stage role was in a play called Quality Street, but it was his comic role as a chauffeur in a play called Miranda that set the direction of Ronald's embryonic career. He was determined to use his talent to make people laugh. However, his father Leonard was extremely unhappy with Ronald's choice of career. He told his son that if he wished to make his money that way he could expect no financial support.\n\nRonald's career was in danger of drifting as the repertory theatres all round the country started to close. Poorly paid work was interspersed with periods of resting and it was looking increasingly likely that he would find himself returning to the banking industry. Later he would describe his experiences in the late 1940s as an 'insecure rut'. However, career salvation was at hand in the form of Peter Hall who employed him at the Oxford Playhouse alongside Maggie Smith . From the very start Peter Hall was convinced that Ronald would become one of Britain's greatest actors, but he saw that greatness being showcased in straight roles. The sheer variety of roles required in repertory, where an actor would often play multiple parts, stood him in great stead in future successes like The Two Ronnies. In 1956, his success in rep brought him to the attention of Alastair Scott-Johnson, the director of a radio show called Meet The Floggits which also featured Anthony Newley and Joan Sims. A regular supporting role followed, together with an unexpected change of name. When sending the cast list to the Radio Times Scott-Johnson decided that Ronnie sounded more friendly than Ronald. Consequently, the first that Barker knew about his new name was when he saw it in the Radio Times that week. His appearances were restricted by the stars Elsie and Doris Waters who were reportedly jealous at the amount of laughs that this unknown comedian was getting. However, the newly named Ronnie Barker had arrived as an actor, and a stellar career awaited.\n\nEarly Successes and Important Meetings\n\nNow that Ronnie was in demand he felt more secure, but, having married actress Joy Tubb in 1957, he was even more driven to achieve long term success and security for his family. The first major role of his career was secured in 1958 when he was offered a supporting role in a new radio comedy show, directed by Alastair Scott-Johnson, called The Navy Lark. The stars were Jon Pertwee, Leslie Phillips and Dennis Price, but within two seasons Ronnie would be second to Pertwee in the public affection and the cast list. His diverse roles included A S Johnson, Lieutenant Commander Stanton, Commander Bell, Lt Parfet and Mr Queeg. He could 'inhabit' any character, no matter how small, and it was this that gave him his incredible range of voices that only Pertwee himself could match.\n\nHe was in huge demand during the early 1960s on stage, screen and radio, but his experience of rep made the constant changes of character and script second nature to him. His television work included occasional guest appearances in Seven Faces of Jim starring Jimmy Edwards. When Terence Alexander was taken ill just before one episode, Ronnie stepped in and did so well that for the second series he appeared in all the shows and was credited as Edwards' co-star. His West End appearances were to lead to a meeting that was to have a long lasting impact on his life.\n\nWhilst Ronnie was appearing at the Haymarket Theatre he became a regular visitor to an 'actors' pub'. He struck up a friendship with the diminutive barman from Edinburgh, himself a resting actor. The barman's name was Ronnie Corbett. In 1966, David Frost was casting actors for a new series called The Frost Report. Most of the actors were contemporaries of Frost's at Cambridge University including John Cleese and writers Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle. However, he had worked with Corbett before and thought that he would bring something different to the programme. The producer James Gilbert had just finished working on Seven More Faces of Jim and suggested Ronnie Barker could be brought in to provide different characters. As the only two non-graduates in the cast Corbett and Barker struck up a close working relationship and it wasn't long before their instinctive comic chemistry was being remarked upon. However, their fully-fledged partnership was still a few years away.\n\nThe Glory Years\n\nHis sheer versatility led to Barker being given a showcase series in 1968 called The Ronnie Barker Playhouse where he played six different characters. Then, a year later he developed the character of Lord Rustless for the series Hark at Barker which featured a young actor named David Jason as a centenarian butler. The friendship that the two developed would rival that of the two Ronnies themselves, both on and off screen. By now, Barker was one of the busiest actors on television. In an 11 year period between The Ronnie Barker Playhouse and Going Straight he was the star of 20 different television programmes.\n\nUnknown to everyone else in the business he was now writing for Frost on Sunday under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. He did this to have his work judged on its merits, because he realised that his own scripts would be judged more leniently than those submitted by anyone else. In the event Gerald Wiley's scripts were lauded by everyone, and David Frost became determined to meet this reclusive genius. Both Frank Muir and Tom Stoppard were suspected of being Gerald Wiley. It wasn't until his second series of The Two Ronnies that the mystery was solved. Barker arranged a party at the end of the series where Gerald Wiley would finally be unmasked. Just before the party he went in to Ronnie Corbett's dressing room to let him in on the secret. Once everyone was gathered together Barker stood up as if to introduce the mystery writer and then admitted that it was in fact his pseudonym. Despite this he continued to write under the name Gerald Wiley for the entire run of The Two Ronnies.\n\nIn 1971 Barker was scheduled to present a BAFTA award with Ronnie Corbett, but there was a technical hitch and the two of them had to fill in until the problem was solved. The ease and brilliance with which they worked together persuaded BBC Entertainment that they should be paired in their own comedy series. It was a momentous decision for both the BBC and the two men themselves.\n\nThe Two Ronnies\n\nIn a packed programme tonight, I shall be having a word with a man who goes in for meditation, because he thinks it's better than sitting around doing nothing.\n\nThen we'll hear from the man who attended the Charles Dickens nudist camp. He had Great Expectations but it was a very Bleak House and everyone laughed at his Little Dorrit!\n\n- Another classic Two Ronnies sketch\n\nIn order to introduce the new partnership to the screen, two one-off programmes were commissioned. First came The Ronnie Barker Yearbook followed a week after by Ronnie Corbett in Bed. Then The Two Ronnies began the first of its twelve seasons as a staple of Saturday night viewing. Unlike Morecambe and Wise this was not an established straight man and funny man partnership. A very shy man, Barker was not comfortable as himself in front of the camera, so the idea of a comedy routine at the start of the show was dropped. Then the concept of the news items was introduced and both he and Corbett agreed that this would be the perfect start. These news items became one of the most popular parts of the show. During the sketches, 75% of which were written by Gerald Wiley, Corbett and Barker took it in turns to deliver punch lines with perfect timing.\n\nThere was a serial that took the form of eight episodes of five to ten minutes each throughout each series. These became famous in their own right. The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town written by Spike Milligan is the best remembered. The Worm That Turned (set in a future where women are the dominant gender and men wear dresses) took every opportunity to make quite provocative comments about the battle of the sexes. There were also three series featuring Detectives Charley Farley and Piggy Malone.\n\nAt the end of each show there were musical numbers that pastiched an incredible range of styles from country to opera. In many of the musical numbers, both Corbett and Barker were dressed as women. Unbeknown to the public, Barker hated dressing in drag, but he did it because he knew it would work for the sketches he had written. Finally, each of them had a chance to shine in solo performances. Barker's solo sketches used his incredible ear for dialogue and amazing ability to deliver huge tongue twisting lists of words without pausing or tripping up over them. Corbett was a superb raconteur who told dreadful jokes that were merely a frame for his masterly digressions that brought in comments about his wife and the supposedly tight-fisted producer that he was fated to work with.\n\nAlthough Ronnie Barker was regarded by most viewers as the star of the show, particularly once he started to enjoy great success away from the programme, it was very much a partnership of equals. Their contrasting comic styles complemented each other perfectly and they kept audiences of up to 19 million viewers entertained for 12 series. However, an indication of Barker's underlying lack of confidence was displayed in his reaction to a sketch on Not the Nine O'Clock News. In a cruel pastiche Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith played an old fashioned comedy partnership called 'The Two Ninnies'. The show opened with the two actors sitting at the news desk with the Corbett lookalike giving the traditional greeting:\n\n- Good evening. It's wonderful to be back with you once again isn't it Ninnie?\n\n- No it's not actually. It's a pain in the arse!\n\nThis was followed by an explanation of all the euphemisms that they would use for parts of the body as it was a family show. Finally Smith and Jones gleefully parodied the end of show song with cruel accuracy. Many of the younger Two Ronnies fans enjoyed the sketch, and appreciated that it was a dig at the old-fashioned double-entendre comedy that was coming to an end. However it was very hard for Barker to accept and he was genuinely hurt and upset. He wondered why his work apparently attracted that level of dislike when all he had ever wanted to do was to entertain the public.\n\nPorridge\n\n[the Medical Officer has finished Fletcher's medical, and points to some specimen containers over on a table]\n\nMO: Now I want you to fill one of those containers for me.\n\nFletcher: What, from 'ere ?\n\n- From 'Old Faces and New Hands'\n\nFletcher: We could ring up those girls on Top of the Pops. Pan's People. There's one special one... beautiful Babs... can't remember her name!\n\n- From 'A Quiet Night In'\n\nIn 1973 Ronnie Barker was given another showcase series, this time called Seven of One. Of the seven episodes, three made it to the screen as fully fledged series. The first episode was Open All Hours co-starring David Jason. The last episode was I'll Fly You for a Quid which became The Magnificent Evans eleven years later despite being the favourite to make the transition to full series at the time. Episode two was Prisoner and Escort co-starring Fulton Mackay and Brian Wilde as prison officers escorting habitual criminal Norman Stanley Fletcher to Slade prison in Cumbria. Writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais decided that the idea of a sitcom set in a prison was too fascinating to resist and Porridge was commissioned.\n\nThe first episode of Porridge aired on 5 September, 1974 and success, both critical and public, was immediate. Barker's co-star was the brilliant young actor Richard Beckinsale playing first-time prisoner Lennie Godber. Much like his relationships with Corbett and David Jason, the on-screen closeness developed into an off-screen friendship. Barker believed that Beckinsale would go on to be one of the great actors of his generation, and was more than happy to mentor him. The script was brilliant, combining broad humour with quite incisive commentary about the rights and wrongs of incarceration. Ronnie Barker's portrayal of Fletcher was, in his own opinion, the high point of his career. It was multi-layered and totally believable, demonstrating the mastery of character that he had developed in all those years in repertory theatre. For three series and two Christmas specials, just 21 episodes in all, Porridge kept up an almost impossibly high standard. Its longevity is amazing, with repeats still getting respectable audiences three decades after it was first shown.\n\nWhen it finished, a sequel called Going Straight was penned by Clement and Le Frenais to follow the exploits of Fletcher and Godber on the outside. It did not meet with the same success as Porridge, but it was still a well crafted comedy with some excellent performances by the two stars and Patricia Brake as Ingrid, Fletcher's daughter and Godber's girlfriend. It also introduced Nicholas Lyndhurst as Fletcher's son Raymond. The first series was nominated for two BAFTA awards, but, three days before the ceremony, tragedy struck when Richard Beckinsale died of a heart attack at the age of just 31. Ronnie Barker was completely devastated by the news and, when accepting the award for best light entertainment performance, told the audience that his friend's death had taken all of the joy out of the award. No one knows for sure if Barker's assessment of Richard Beckinsale would have been borne out, but it seems likely that British acting lost someone who could have gone on to be an all time great. As Barker said in his autobiography:\n\nWhen I was rung up and told, I burst into tears because it was so outrageous that he should have died. He was suddenly not with us anymore. So loved, there was a universal grief that went on. The audience used to love him. We got on so well together that we were always glad to see each other in the morning for rehearsals.\n\nOpen All Hours\n\nArkwright: I can see it now written on the side of the van. Arkwright's F-f-f-f-antastic fe-fe-fe-fruity fe-f-f-fudge.\n\nGranville: You'll never get that on the side of one van!\n\nThe second major success from the Seven of One showcase was this gentle comedy starring Barker as tight-fisted shopkeeper Arkwright. His character was famous for the stutter that provided a lot of the wordplay humour that Barker enjoyed so much. It was while he was with 'The Famous Players' repertory company that the leading man Glynn Melvyn taught him to stutter. This was tremendously important, because the stuttering was believable and kept within bounds to be used to maximum comic effect. David Jason played Arkwright's long-suffering nephew Granville and Lynda Baron played Nurse Gladys Emmanuel, the object of Arkwright's amorous attentions . Other cast members included Kathy Staff and Stephanie Cole . Four series were made between 1976 and 1985 but, although affectionately remembered, it never achieved the same level of regard as Porridge.\n\nA Life-Changing Decision\n\nAfter Richard Beckinsale's untimely death, Ronnie Barker became increasingly worried about his own health. An operation on his vocal chords in the early 1970s had led to him giving up his 40 cigarette a day habit after nearly 25 years of smoking. He had also seen two of his contemporaries, Eric Morecambe and Tommy Cooper, succumb to heart attacks at an early age.\n\nAfter 1984 his comedy star was beginning to wane with lukewarm receptions for his final two series,The Magnificent Evans and Clarence. Roy Clarke was the chief writer for The Magnificent Evans with, as usual, a lot of input from Ronnie. However, when he looked back at the series Clarke thought that the flamboyance of the central character was too big a contrast to the rest of the cast. He said as much in a televised tribute shown on the night after Barker's death. In 1988 Ronnie Barker wrote one more series, Clarence, a character that he had long wanted to build a sitcom around. Barker played the title role opposite Josephine Tewson, a regular partner throughout his career. Clarence was a short-sighted removals man who came across as a live action version of Mr Magoo. Unfortunately, the jokes were largely based around mistaken identity, leaving little room for his usual wordplay. Although it had a loyal and very appreciative audience, the rest of the public did not take to the character and after disappointing viewing figures, a second series did not materialise. It caused Barker to examine the possibility that he no longer had good scripts to write. It also redoubled his determination to enjoy as much time as possible with his family without the pressures of fame which he always found uncomfortable. These factors caused him to make the decision to retire in 1988 at the age of 58.\n\nWhen he announced his decision on the Wogan show, many of his colleagues were convinced that he would be back within a couple of years. Instead he kept out of the public eye almost entirely for the next fourteen years, running an antiques shop in Chipping Norton. An intensely shy man, Barker greatly enjoyed the freedom from the trappings of fame. Despite this more relaxed lifestyle his health problems persisted, and he required a double heart bypass operation in 1996 and suffered a blood clot on his lungs nine months later that nearly killed him.\n\nA Belated Return\n\nAfter occasional appearances at events like the 1999 Royal Variety Performance, Barker returned to the limelight with a role in the film The Gathering Storm in which he played Winston Churchill's butler, Inches. A further appearance followed opposite Dame Maggie Smith in My House in Umbria. His final television appearances were, fittingly, in a show with Ronnie Corbett called The Two Ronnies Sketchbook. They introduced and commented on a selection of their most famous sketches and attracted large audiences for material that was mostly two or three decades old. It was clear that Barker was quite frail, but no-one apart from family and close friends knew how ill he really was. Heart disease had caused him to become largely house-bound over his last few months and his lack of mobility left him very miserable. He was unable to attend the ITV 50th Anniversary celebrations, where Ronnie Corbett accepted a star on the new British Walk of Fame in London on behalf of both of them. This was the last in a succession of awards for the much loved comedian, whose favourite was the OBE that he received, along with Ronnie Corbett, in 1978. He died on 3 October, 2005 with his reputation, as one of the greatest comic actors that Britain had ever produced, assured for generations to come.\n\nLegacy of Laughter\n\nThe sheer range of his abilities as both an actor and a writer would have marked Ronnie Barker out as a genius in any generation. What was clear from the tributes paid to him was that his influence stretched across generations of comic talent. From his own generation, actor Warren Mitchell and comedian Jimmy Tarbuck praised his genius. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 David Jason simply called him 'The Guvnor'. Rik Mayall, whose anarchic style seemed to be the antithesis of Barker's wordplay, described Ronnie Barker as his hero. Ben Elton, from the same generation of alternative comedians who ostensibly replaced The Two Ronnies, said:\n\nHe lives on in an incomparable body of work which will continue to bring joy to millions.\n\nPeter Kay, one of the most popular comedians in the country, admitted that it was Barker who inspired him to become a comedian and spoke of the great hole that his passing had left.\n\nThe other thing that became clear was that the British public could, with amazing clarity, remember the dialogues and monologues that Ronnie Barker wrote and performed. Ronnie Barker wanted to be remembered as a man who made people laugh. His continuing place in the affections of the British television viewers is evidence that he is remembered as that and much more besides.\n\nIts Goodnight from Me.\n\nAnd its Goodnight from him!\n\nGoodnight!"}, {"url": "http://www.filmreference.com/film/0/Ronnie-Barker.html", "page_content": "Ronnie Barker Biography (1929-)\n\nFull name, Ronald William George Barker; born September 25, 1929, in Bedford,Bedfordshire, England; son of Leonard William and Edith Eleanor (maiden name; Carter) Barker; married Joy Tubb, 1959; children: Charlotte, Larry, Adam.

He had two sisters; Vera (his older sister) and Eileen (his younger sister). The family moved to Oxford when his father, a clerk for Shell Oil , was relocated, when Barker was two years old. He took to writing plays for his family and neighbours, and often sat in the audience of The Oxford Playhouse , his local repertory company, dreaming of fame. Barker attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys , in Oxford , and at sixteen he left and took a job as a bank clerk - but the theatre called. He wrote to the Aylesbury Repertory Company in 1948 and his show business career began. Barker then went on to join the Playhouse Theatre, Oxford, at the time under the actor-management of Frank Shelley, as an actor and stagehand, at \u00a32 10s per week. The two appeared together there, in Ben Travers 's \"A Cuckoo in the Nest\" and, subsequently, in a number of other venues and roles. In 1993, Barker dedicated his autobiography to Shelley, whom he called one of the \"three wise men who directed my career; without men like these, there would be no theatre.\"\n\nuccess\n\nEarly career\n\nHe then worked as an actor and assistant stage manager with the Manchester Repertory Company, but was soon spotted by Sir Peter Hall who gave him a West End role. His first radio appearance was in 1956; he went on to play a variety of minor characters in \" The Navy Lark \", a navy based sit-com on the BBC Light Programme (still available on tape and frequently rerun on BBC 7 ). He later returned to radio in the BBC Radio 4 sketch show \" Lines From My Grandfather's Forehead \". He acted in the films Father Came Too! and The Bargee . On television, he wrote and performed many satirical skits in \" The Frost Report \", notably a series of trios which he performed with Ronnie Corbett and John Cleese . From 1961 to 1963, he starred in the three series of \" Faces of Jim \". He starred with David Jason as a bumbling aristocrat Lord Rustless in the sit-com \" Hark at Barker \". Jason appeared in several episodes of \"Porridge\", and co-starred as Granville, the errand boy and nephew of Barker's stuttering shopkeeper Arkwright in the sitcom \" Open All Hours \", written by Roy Clarke (who also wrote \" Last of the Summer Wine \" and \" Keeping Up Appearances \"). Both \"Porridge\" and \"Open All Hours\" originated as part of the \" Seven of One \" series.\n\nThe Two Ronnies\n\nHis BBC television comedy sketch show with Ronnie Corbett , in \" The Two Ronnies \", lasted from 1971 to 1987. This show saw both Barker and Corbett performing various comedy sketches and musical numbers. The programme became one of the most successful and long running television comedy shows ever on British television which at its peak averaged around 17 million viewers.\n\neven of One: Porridge and Open All Hours\n\n\"Porridge\" ran for three series, two Christmas specials and a film, produced in 1979. Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom \"Going Straight\" which, while not as popular as \"Porridge\", did win BAFTA awards. The first came at a time when Barker was grieving the early death of his co-star Richard Beckinsale , and Barker tearfully paid tribute to Beckinsale in his brief acceptance speech. The \" Open All Hours \" pilot episode was broadcast in March 1973, and ran for four series between February 1976 and October 1985.\n\nGerald Wiley\n\nBarker was also an accomplished comedy writer. He provided many of the sketches and songs for \"The Two Ronnies\", and contributed material to many other radio and TV shows\u2014often under a variety of assumed names. A typical example is the sketch Nothing's Too Much Trouble . Most famously, many contributions for The Two Ronnies were submitted by a mystery writer called Gerald Wiley. Wiley had first gained credit for his work on the Frost on Sunday show, but no one had ever met him. His status as a recluse became well known among the comedy writing fraternity, to the extent that it became almost a challenge to discover his identity. Frank Muir and Tom Stoppard were both accused by members of the writing team, including Barry Cryer , before one day, Wiley said that he would reveal himself at a Chinese restaurant. No one believed Barker at first, when he stood up and announced it was him, particularly as he himself had turned away scripts credited to Wiley. Barker admitted that he carried out this deception because he was afraid that his ideas and scripts would not be judged on merit otherwise.\n\nHis other credits include the (almost) silent films \" A Home of Your Own \" (1964), \" Futtock's End \" (1970), \" The Picnic \" (1975) and \" By the Sea \" (1982), the sit-coms \"His Lordship Entertains\", \" The Magnificent Evans \" and \"Clarence\", the plays \"Rub A Dub Dub\" and \"Mum\", and the LP \"A Pint of Old and Filthy\". Straight roles were few and far between, though he did put in a dramatic-comic turn as Cheshire in \"The Hidden Tiger\" episode of the 1960s classic series \"The Avengers\" and as Friar Tuck in \" Robin and Marian \".\n\nRetirement and return\n\nIn January 1988, following the 1987 Christmas Special of \" The Two Ronnies \" and the broadcast of \"Clarence\", Barker made an appearance on the chat show \" Wogan \", where he announced his intention to retire from showbusiness, stating that he had \"no further ambition\" and that he should \"quit while he was ahead\". Following this, he announced that he would open and run an antiques shop at his home in Oxfordshire. He resisted all calls to come out of retirement virtually from that point onwards. Barker sold his antique shop in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1999, he reunited with Ronnie Corbett for a Two Ronnies night on BBC1, where they introduced a selection of their best and most-loved sketches. In 2002, he appeared as Winston Churchill 's butler\u2014a \"straight\" role, but with opportunities for comic asides\u2014in the BBC drama \"The Gathering Storm\". This was followed up by a role in the film \" My House in Umbria \" in 2003. In the same year, he briefly reprised perhaps his most famous role of Fletcher in the spoof documentary \"\". In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA award and announced his return to television; he reunited with Ronnie Corbett to record \" The Two Ronnies Sketchbook \", a clip show of their sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were shown in March and April 2005.\n\nOn 5 July 2005, another, final special - \"The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook\", was recorded with new introductions featuring clips from their previous Christmas special shows. This was to be his last television appearance, and sadly, he knew this, as he mentioned to Corbett. This led to an early recording of the special. The show was aired in December that year.\n\nCorbett appeared before the start of the show paying tribute to \"Ron\", and that Barker informed him of his illness, leading to an early recording of the show. The studio audience weren't informed about Barker's illness or decision, and were therefore confused as to why a Christmas episode was being recorded in August.\n\nHe was voted amongst the top 20 greatest comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders in a 2005 poll to find \" The Comedian's Comedian \".\n\nPersonal life\n\nRonnie Barker married Joy Tubb on 8 July 1957 and they had three children: two sons, the actors Larry (b. 1960) and Adam (b. 1967) and one daughter, the actress Charlotte Barker (b. 1963). He retired to Dean, a hamlet near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire to run an antiques shop in late 1987. He died in a local hospice from heart failure on Monday 3 October 2005, aged 76, with his wife by his side. His catchphrase ending from \" The Two Ronnies \" provided the perfect epitaph : \"Goodnight From Him\".\"\n\nNews of his death made headlines in the United Kingdom and other countries. Ronnie Corbett said that throughout their many years working together there was never a cross word between them. He also commented that Barker was \"pure gold in triplicate - as a comedian, writer and friend\". His family kindly gave permission for his stage play, \"Mum\", written for his daughter Charlotte, to be adapted for radio. Broadcast in 2006 on BBC Radio 4 as an Afternoon Play, adapted and directed by Neil Cargill, it starred Maxine Peake in the main role alongside Barker's old Porridge collaborator, Sam Kelly, and received very favourable reviews as a \"poignant\" and \"moving\" work - a real eye-opener to those who knew only his pure comedy.\n\nHe had a private humanist funeral in Banbury , followed by a public memorial service on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey , at which Richard Briers , David Jason and Ronnie Corbett read, a recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon was played, and the choir processed in behind four candles , a reference to the Two Ronnies' most famous sketch.

My wife was in the audience for that and she said afterwards 'this is going to be a big success' and she was right.\"He continued his success in situation comedy as the lugubrious, stuttering shopkeeper Arkwright in Open All Hours playing opposite David Jason who went onto huge fame as Inspector Frost and Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses.\n\nArkwright was his favourite character. \"We had a whale of a time,\" Barker recalled. \"We did thoroughly enjoy that.\" His successes earned him numerous accolades including three Bafta awards and an OBE in 1978.\n\nHe surprised and disappointed his millions of fans when in 1987 he announced his retirement at the age of 57 to concentrate on his beloved antique shop in the Cotswolds.\n\nHe vowed never to return to the spotlight but was on occasion persuaded to make public appearances at awards ceremonies and TV specials. In 1999 he appeared in a Two Ronnies retrospective and soon after played Winsotn Churchill's long-suffering manservant Inches in the BBC drama The Gathering Storm.\n\nAfterwards, he confessed: \"The feeling of being on the set was very new and strange to me at first. I was a bit nervous about doing it again, but the first day, I fitted in fine once I got there.\"\n\nHe also shot the film My House In Umbria with Dame Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall in Italy.\n\nHe wrote several books, including Book Of Bathing Beauties (1974), Book Of Boudoir Beauties (1975), A Pennyworth Of Art (1986) and his autobiography Dancing In The Moonlight (1993).\n\nBorn Ronald William George Barker on September 25, 1929 in Bedford, he was educated at Oxford High School and began his acting career with the Aylesbury Repertory Company in 1948.\n\nBy 1955, he was appearing in roles in West End productions, including Mourning Becomes Electra, Summertime, Listen To The Wind, Double Image, Casino Road, Lysistrata, Platanov, On and Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\nBarker married Joy Tubb in 1957.

Ronnie Barker\n\nFamilySearch"}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/27820337", "page_content": "Ronnie Barker a British actor, comedian, writer, critic, collector, broadcaster and businessman was born in 1929.\n\nHis first role on stage was A Murder has Been Arranged by Emlyn Williams in Oxford, 1946, where he was very active in amateur dramatics. Despite failing to get in to the Young Vic School, he began his career in theatre in the Manchester Repertory Theatre, his first professional role being that of Lieutenant Spicer in Quality Street by Sir J.M. Barrie in 1948. In 1951 he joined the Oxford Playhouse Theatre Players. Peter Hall worked with him in Oxford and brought him to London's West End.\n\nFollowing his first radio appearance in 1956 he went on to feature in The Navy Lark (1959-1977). He soon began working in television and film, from 1962 appearing in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim . He also appeared in A Tale of Two Cities (1965) and the films Kill or Cure (1962), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).\n\nHis break came in the 1966 satirical sketch series The Frost Report which starred David Frost, John Cleese and his future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett. In 1968 he was given his own show The Ronnie Barker Playhouse . David Frost moved to ITV and hosted Frost on Sunday, which featured Barker and Corbett more prominently. It was also during this period that Barker began writing sketches under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. In 1969 Barker produced, wrote and performed in the comedy film Futtock's End which featured no dialogue, only grunts. The series Hark at Barker (1969-1970) featured the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless who originally appeared in The Ronnie Barker Playhouse . Barker wrote for the show under the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker .\n\nBarker and Corbett were signed up to do a show together at the BBC after impressing the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton at the 1971 BAFTAs where they successfully kept the audience entertained for several minutes when the show was stopped due to technical difficulties. That show was The Two Ronnies which was an immediate and long running success, with twelve series running from 1971-1986. They filmed on location in the West Country for much of the series. Barker wrote much of the show's material as Gerald Wiley. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972, written by Barker under the name Jonathon Cobbald.\n\nBarker played Friar Tuck in the 1976 film Robin and Marian . Barker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent films The Picnic (1975) and By the Sea (1982). By the Sea was Barker's tribute to the seaside postcard humour of Donald McGill. Barker had a special interest in collecting postcards and amassed a collection of over 53,000. He produced several compilation books of them including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, Ronnie Barker's Book of Boudoir Beauties, Ooh-La-La: The Ladies Of Paris, Gentleman's Relish: A Saucy Look at the Fairer Sex and Pebbles On The Beach: A Tribute To The Seaside Girl . He was also a collector of antiques, books and posters.\n\nThe great success of The Two Ronnies meant that Barker was given more creative freedom which led to some sitcom pilots shown as part of Seven of One (1973). Two of these pilots became series; Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became Porridge (1974-1997) and Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) became the series of the same name. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 and 1979 for his performance of prisoner Norman Fletcher. Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two, although a second and further series were not commissioned until 1981 when repeats of the show on BBC One gained high ratings. As a result of the initial low ratings for Open All Hours, Barker produced a third series of Porridge (1977) and a 1979 film adaptation. Next came the spin-off sitcom Going Straight (1978-9) which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison.\n\nIn 1978 Harold Fielding's stage version of The Two Ronnies premiered at the Bristol Hippodrome before opening at the London Palladium and touring to Southampton. Barker and Corbett moved with their families to Sydney, Australia for tax reasons in 1979. They toured their stage show in Melbourne and Sydney and went on to produce two series of The Two Ronnies in Australia .\n\nThe next sitcom Barker produced, The Magnificent Evans (1984), was not hugely successful. He wrote his final sitcom, Clarence (1988), using the pseudonym Bob Ferris.\n\nIn 1987, in an interview with Terry Wogan, Barker announced his retirement from show business. Following his retirement he opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire. After ten years the shop was sold, due to its unprofitability, and a few years later Barker began to make occasional television appearances again.\n\nBarker wrote his autobiography Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and published his complete scripts All I Ever Wrote in 1999. He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, that was performed at the King's Head Theatre.\n\nIn 1997 Barker and Corbett drove on stage in a motorcycle as the Two Fat Ladies at the Royal Command Performance. In 1999 they reunited for the Two Ronnies Night on BBC One, and the following year for A Tribute to the Two Ronnies . In 2002 Barker was persuaded by director Richard Loncraine to play Winston Churchill's butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama The Gathering Storm, and in 2003 was also cast in the TV film My House in Umbria . Barker briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box (2003).\n\nBarker received several awards throughout his career, including the Royal Television Society's award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975. He was presented by Sir Alec Guinness with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards (1990) and received the same again at the BBC Centenary Programme (1996). He was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award, at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, a televised celebratory tribute evening in 2003. Alongside Corbett, Barker was one of the first 100 people given stars on London's Avenue of Stars in 2005. Earlier awards include the Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981. In 1978 Barker received an OBE.\n\nBarker's health declined rapidly after the filming of The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook and he died in October 2005.\n\nFrom the guide to the Ronnie Barker Collection, 1929-2005, (V&A Department of Theatre and Performance)"}]}
