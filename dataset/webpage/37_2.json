She appeared on the show\u2019s first two seasons which lasted up until the mid-1960s and then had memorable stints in a string of other productions, including Route 66, The Man From U.N.C.L, Fever heat, and The Comic.\n\nHowever, she probably stopped enjoying acting as she started to scale back on her appearances in the \u201990s and soon, she left the limelight completely. Her last film role was as Landlady in the 1991 film Timebomb. Since this role, Jeannine has not appeared in any film or does she plan to do so soon. However, her exit from the spotlight without officially announcing her retirement has many people wondering where she is now and what lead to her disappearance.\n\nJeannine Riley\u2019s Biography\n\nJeannine Riley was born in Madera, California USA, on 1st October 1940 and named Jeannine Brooke Riley. From the look of things, the actress must\u2019ve been one of the most enigmatic actresses in her time as there is no information about her. Not even her educational history, or childhood, despite the terrific fame she enjoyed during her active years in the film industry. The much that is known about her is that she began her acting career professionally in 1962 with a role in the Rosalind Russell drama Five Finger Exercise.\n\nShe followed the role up with an appearance in Father of the Bride, My Three Sons and Route 66. At age 23, she appeared in the suspense drama Strike Me Deadly with Gary Clarke and Steve Ihnat. She went on to work with Ihnat in The Fourposter \u2013 a stage play.\n\nAt this point, she had started to gradually climb the prestigious career ladder. Her performances in Wagon Train and The Virginian helped to solidify her position in the limelight and drew the interest of CBS. It also prepared a stage for her star-making role in Petticoat Junction (1963) as one of the daughters of Kate Bradley \u2013 played by Bea Benaderet. The role remains what she is known for to date.\n\nMeanwhile, she was not the first choice for the role. Sharon Tate was chosen for it but the actress lost the slot when she got involved in nude photoshoots, mostly because explicit contents were seen as somewhat a taboo at that time. Luckily, Jeannine was picked to replace Tate when her role was recast.\n\nAfter two seasons of the series, Jeannine Riley left and was replaced by Gunilla Hutton. Even after she left the show, life stayed kind to her acting career as she made more TV appearances including guest-starring on Ozzie and Harriet. She also played a part on the Smothers Brothers Show. In 1967, she secured roles in different films; The Big Mouth, The Wild, Gomer Pyle and a lot more.\n\nThe following year, she worked with Nick Adams in Fever Heat (1968), which is among the last films of the actor before his demise. After a few more acting works in the 1960s, her next appearance was in 1973 \u2013 in Electra Glide in Blue. At this point, Hollywood was beginning to accept nudity and Jeannine was willing to show some skin. Her nude scenes in the movie made her an instant star but Jeannine probably wanted something else as her presence on TV started to reduce following this role. In 1991, she left completely after starring in the film, Timebomb.\n\nHer Family\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Jeannine Riley doesn\u2019t let people into matters concerning her private life. So, nothing is known about her siblings, parents, or any other relative. It is, however, known that she has been married twice and none of her marriages survived the test of time. Her first marriage was to Gary Grom in 1965. It failed in 1972 and in less than two years after their divorce, Jeannine married Irwin Radnitz which ended in a similar manner. None of her marriages or past relationships produced a child and since then, her love life has been blurred from the public.\n\nRead Also: Who Was Ann Sothern?\n\nWhere Is Jeannine Riley Now?\n\nNobody is sure of what Jeannine has been up to since 1991 when she left the spotlight. She probably wants nothing more than people knowing less about her as she is not even active on social media either, making it very difficult to dig out anything about her. But there are rumors that she left the acting scene possibly to focus on her family while others have taken the view that she pursued a different career.

Riley. Her second single, \"Harper Valley P.T.A.,\" was a runaway hit immediately upon release in 1968; it sold over five million copies in the United States and was the first song by a female artist to top the country and pop charts at the same time. The song also set the template for much of Riley's career to follow, singing songs about the harder side of life and small-town scandal, as seen through the eyes of a down-to-earth woman with a proud spirit and a strong voice -- buoyed by the unapologetic Texas twang of her instrument. The accessible but unabashed country sound of Riley's music took on a softer tone after she embraced Christianity in the late '70s and released albums like 1979's Wings to Fly and 1981's From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top. By the '90s, Riley's recording career had faded out and a struggle with depression kept her out of the public eye for most of the decade, but she made a low-key comeback in the early 2000s, hosting a radio show and returning to live performing.\n\nJeannie C. Riley was born Jeanne Carolyn Stephenson on October 19, 1945 in the small Texas town of Stamford. Her father made his living as a mechanic and her mother had a career of her own as a nurse. Growing up in Texas, Riley grew to love music, and dreamed that her talent could be the key to a better way of life. Riley made her public debut as a singer in the early '60s at a performance hosted by her uncle Johnny Moore, a country singer who had scored a few regional hits. Local country fans were impressed with Riley's performance, and she began singing regularly at Moore's monthly jamborees. She had yet to graduate from high school when she married her boyfriend, Mickey Riley, in December 1962, and they welcomed a daughter, Kim Michelle Riley, in January 1966. Meanwhile, Weldon Myrick, a pedal steel guitarist who had played at several of Riley's jamboree shows in Texas, had relocated to Nashville and felt that rising star Connie Smith sounded a great deal like her. Myrick encouraged Riley to come to Nashville and pursue a career as a singer, and in time Riley and Mickey packed their bags and moved to Music City. She worked as a secretary at Passkey Records while cutting demos in her spare time and eventually struck a deal with Little Darlin' Records, a Nashville label co-founded by Johnny Paycheck. In 1967, Little Darlin' issued her debut single, \"You Write the Music\" b/w \"What About Them.\" Riley would cut an album's worth of material for Little Darlin' but after her first 45 flopped, they declined to release a second single.\n\nRiley's career seemed stuck in neutral until Shelby Singleton, a producer and promotions man who had helped make a fistful of records hits, heard a publishing demo she had recorded for a tune called \"The Old Town Drunk.\" Singleton had recently launched his own country label, Plantation Records, and was eager to cut a tune written by Tom T. Hall about a woman standing up to small-town hypocrites on her daughter's behalf. Singleton believed Riley had the right voice for the song, so he bought out her deal with Little Darlin' and brought her to the studio to cut the song. While initially Riley didn't think much of the song, she gave it a go, and in less than an hour she had cut \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" Upon the single's release, both country and pop radio enthusiastically embraced it, even though some C&W stations blanched at the song's depiction of small town sinfulness, and rock stations usually passed on songs that made no concession to the crossover market. In August 1968, \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" hit the top of the pop and country charts; it was the first time a female artist would manage this feat, and it wouldn't happen again until 1980, when Dolly Parton released \"9 to 5.\"\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Riley went from obscurity to stardom as \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" became a cultural phenomenon and Little Darlin' wasted no time releasing their Riley material on a 1968 album called Sock Soul; in 1969 Capitol would repackage the same LP under the title The Songs of Jeannie C. Riley. It was trounced in the marketplace by Riley's first album for Plantation, called Harper Valley U.S.A., which topped the country album chart and rose to number 12 on the pop survey. The song also earned Riley a Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" proved to be Riley's first and last single to cross into the Pop Top 40, but she became a frequent presence on network television in 1969 and 1970, starring in her own TV special (titled, of course, Harper Valley P.T.A.) and appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Johnny Cash Show, The Bob Hope Show, American Bandstand, and The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, as well as touring frequently. Riley continued to enjoy success on the country charts, landing ten more singles in the Country Top 40 between December 1968 and October 1971. (Five of them -- \"The Girl Most Likely,\" \"There Never Was a Time,\" Country Girl,\" \"Oh, Singer,\" and \"Good Enough to Be Your Wife\" -- made the Top Ten.) Riley also knocked out five more albums for Plantation during the same period, but after a dispute between her and Singleton, who she believed was paying her less than her due, she left the label and signed with MGM Records. Her first single for MGM, \"Houston Blues,\" arrived in November 1971, and in 1972 she enjoyed two more Country Top 40 singles, \"Give Myself a Party\" and \"Good Morning Country Rain.\" However, after \"When Love Has Gone Away\" hit number 44 in March 1973, it would mark the last time Riley released a 45 than rose above 50 on the Country Singles charts. Short-lived deals with Mercury and Warner Bros. resulted in singles that made little impression, and while Riley continued to tour, her most successful release of this period was the soundtrack album to a 1978 film adaptation of Harper Valley U.S.A., starring Barbara Eden.\n\nAs Riley struggled with an unhappy marriage, a career on the downturn, and financial woes, she experienced a spiritual rebirth and became a born again Christian. In 1979, she released an album of Christian-themed music, Wings to Fly, and in 1981, she brought out From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top, which appeared at the same time as her memoir of the same name. Throughout the '80s, Riley put her primary focus on spiritual music, though she still recorded secular material on the albums Total Woman (1984) and Jeannie C. Riley (1986), the latter of which found her re-recording \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" The album Here's Jeannie C. arrived in 1991, but a dispute with her manager in the early '90s put Riley back in legal and financial trouble, and she developed a severe case of clinical depression, which prevented her from working for close to six years. By 2000, Riley had recovered her mental and physical health, and became the host of a weekly radio series titled Inside Nashville Country, as well as performing live, speaking to Christian groups, and writing. In 2019, \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame, intended to recognize recordings of lasting merit and significance."}, {"url": "https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/jeannie-c-riley.htm", "page_content": "Jeannie C.

Two others would follow, but not before Riley left a permanent mark on the show and set the stage for seven seasons of Billie Jo greatness. But what about Riley herself? What trajectory did her career follow? In short, one her character would have been proud of.\n\nJeannine Riley was born on October 1, 1940, and grew up in California for much of her upbringing after her father left for the Army and her family planted roots in Madera. She learned acting and the ways of show business in the Pasadena Playhouse while also performing ballet. She started working on television and an uncredited role in the 1962 movie Five Finger Exercise before television work arose in greater succession. Early credits included Father of the Bride, My Three Sons, Route 66, and The Beauty Contest. Indeed, her easy, approachable grace helped pave the way for more and more prominence on TV not long into her career.\n\nWhy did Jeannine Riley leave \u2018Petticoat Junction\u2019?\n\nHer career had just begun in 1962 and still Jeannine Riley managed to turn some important heads. Namely, CBS producers noticed her while she acted in Wagon Train and The Virginian and as rural shows dominated televisions, they wanted Riley for their next big project: Petticoat Junction. With the rural purge still a decade away, the wholesome series joined the ranks of Beverly Hillbillies and The Andy Griffith Show as a recipe for success. Initially, actress and model Sharon Tate was slated to originate the role of Billie Jo, but after a nude photoshoot, she was deemed too risque for a series sponsored by Ivory Soap; Riley ended up winning the role of 300 other hopefuls.\n\nRiley channeled that easy charisma into her role and won hearts on-screen and off. But just like her character possessed endless aspirations, so too did Riley, and after two years she bowed out of the series to pursue a film career, as well as try out some other shows, including Gilligan\u2019s Island and Hee Haw. She did make it into movies as planned, such as The Big Mouth and Fever Heat. One of her most prominent roles came in 1973 as Lulu McQueen in Dusty\u2019s Trail, which saw Riley as a kind of Ginger Grant in a western reimagining of Gilligan\u2019s Island complete with Bob Denver himself and Lori Saunders.\n\nIt\u2019s about time to be a bolder woman\n\nRiley wanted to break away from roles that cast her on the basis of her looks alone but found this a difficult endeavor. New opportunities grew fewer. Her final film came with 1991\u2019s Timebomb, a science-fiction action movie starring Michael Biehn. She retired that same year but stays involved in the industry in other ways; the 2016 book X Child Stars: Where Are They Now? offers a look at her life and career. Her personal life included marriage first to Gary Groom from 1965 to 1972, then Irwin Radnitz in 1974 until they too divorced.\n\nWhile Riley is not reported to have any children, she has still used her life\u2019s experiences to guide the next generation. In typical Billie Jo fashion, she wants to see women be successful, something she herself is familiar with. In 2020, she penned the book The Bolder Woman: It\u2019s About Time, all about encouraging and instructing women on how they can follow their dreams at any age. \u201cCome along with me as I reveal how I overcame my own fear of aging and being labeled an old woman just because I\u2019d reached a certain number of years,\u201d Riley invites readers. \u201cYour many years of living has brought you this far, so why stop now?\u201d\n\nWe certainly hope Riley doesn\u2019t stop for a long time!"}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jeannine_riley", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 69% Electra Glide in Blue (1973)\n\nLowest Rated: 40% The Big Mouth (1967)\n\nBirthday: Oct 1, 1940\n\nBirthplace: Madera, California, USA\n\nJeannine Riley was an actress who graced the silver screen many times throughout her Hollywood career.

As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $4 million, earned through a successful career in acting. She\u2019s also appeared in numerous other television shows and feature films throughout her career, and as she continues her endeavors even well into her \u201870s, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nWhile virtually no information is available about Jeannine\u2019s early life, it is known that she developed an interest in acting at a young age. She started her career in the early 1960s, appearing in small or uncredited roles in projects such as \u201cFive Finger Exercise\u201d. In 1963, she was cast in the sitcom \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d in the role of Billie Jo Bradley, set in the Shady Rest Hotel run by Kate Bradley, her three daughters and her uncle. The series was created after the success of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the success of this show led to the spin-off entitled \u201cGreen Acres\u201d.\n\nShe stayed with the show until 1965, then decided to leave the series to pursue more film work, replaced by Gunila Hutton and later Meredith MacRae during the latter seasons. Jeannine then started to do film work in the late 1960s, appearing in \u201cThe Big Mouth\u201d as Bambi Berman, filmed in San Diego and featuring Frank De Vol as an on-screen narrator.\n\nThe 3 original Bradley Sisters\u2026Betty Jo {Linda Kaye Henning}, Bobbi Jo {Pat Woodell}, and Billie Jo {Jeannine Riley.} Posted by Debbie Spivey on Saturday, January 26, 2019\n\nCareer Prominence\n\nThe following year Riley was cast in \u201cFever Heat\u201d, which was directed by Russell S. Doughten and starring alongside Nick Adams and Norman Alden. In 1969 she was cast in the film \u201cThe Comic\u201d, co-written and co-produced by Carl Reiner and starring Dick Van Dyke, Michele Lee and Mickey Rooney in a film inspired by the end of the silent film era.\n\nAfter that she returned to television, as she was cast in a regular role in the comedy variety series entitled \u201cHee Haw\u201d during the same year, which was set in fictional rural Kornfield Kounty, and inspired by \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d. The show centered on rural culture and country music, with hosts Buck Owens as well as Roy Clark, but would often feature scantily clad women in stereotypical farmer\u2019s daughters attire, who came to be known as the Hee Haw Honeys. She stayed with the show for three years, and then joined another show in \u201cDusty\u2019s Trail\u201d, in which she played Lulu McQueen, a western-theme take-off of Ginger Grant from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, also starring Forrest Tucker and Bob Denver.\n\nLater Career\n\nOver the next few years, Jeannine had small roles in television shows such as \u201cThe Wild Wild West\u201d, \u201cRoute 66\u201d, and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d She then featured in the film \u201cElectra Glide in Blue\u201d, which starred Robert Blake as a motorcycle cop alongside Billy \u201cGreen\u201d Bush, and based on the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle used by traffic police. During the same year, she had an uncredited role in \u201cThe Outfit\u201d, actually appearing as a prostitute in an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Richard Stark under the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake.\n\nAs the years progressed, Jeannine took fewer roles; she was a part of the 1980s project entitled \u201cLone Star Bar & Grill\u201d as Arlene, and one of her last projects was the 1991 film entitled \u201cTimebomb\u201d, which starred Michael Biehn, Richard Jordan and Patsy Kensit.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFor her personal life, it is known that Riley married Gary Groom in 1965 but their marriage ended in divorce in 1972. She married once more in 1974 to Irwin Radnitz but it was also a marriage that ended in divorce. There are no reported children from her marriages.\n\nSince retiring from acting work, very little information has been shared about her. One of the reasons is due to the fact that she does not have any accounts on major social media websites. In 2016, a book was released entitled \u201cX Child Stars: Where Are They Now\u201d, written by Kathy Garver and Fred Ascher, which contained a profile of her along with her career. Many sources speculate that since ending her acting career, she focused more on other endeavors, and likely another marriage and a family, but there is no evidence to confirm these speculations.\n\nFacts # Fact 1 Jeannine Riley and Steve Ihnat co-starred together in the play, \"The Fourposter\", put on by the Sherman Oaks Playhouse for two months, from mid-April to mid-August, 1953.

And while sometimes it was incredibly trying, I have to credit my upbringing for making me the person I am. Generally speaking, being a military brat has a really profound impact on who you become later in life.\n\nI have my mom to thank for being my best friend and a constant pillar of support in my everyday life. But my dad so often taught me the harder, harsher lessons in life \u2014 whether he explicitly told them to me, or showed me by simply being himself.\n\nRegardless of how I gleaned them, I wanted to share the small bits of wisdom I learned from my military dad in honor of Father\u2019s Day.\n\n1. You can\u2019t cry over everything.\n\nThere\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk or anything else really. Growing up, a lot of what I learned from my dad was that being upset, apart from being somewhat intolerable, was a huge waste of time. His attitude helped me realize that instead of crying, you should change what you don\u2019t like, and just let go of things that you can\u2019t fix.\n\nRelated: What it\u2019s really like growing up in a military town \u00bb\n\n2. Never stop working hard.\n\nWhether it was at school, or in a job, one of the best pieces of advice I ever got from my dad was that you have to work hard consistently for things. He was the first in his family to go to college through ROTC, and he reminded me often that any time you stop trying to be better, you start settling. You may be the most powerful person in a room, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to stop working hard. In fact, the takeaway as I understood it was that the more you have, the harder you have to work to maintain it.\n\n3. Life is never fair. Deal with it.\n\nThis was a bit I learned, albeit cruelly, after my sister was born. Not everything in life is even, just, or fair. Sometimes the scales tip in your direction, sometimes they favor other people. My dad was never one to pander to the whims of an outraged preschooler, so I learned the lesson of unfairness very early on. But I appreciate this lesson most of all, because it taught me not to be bitter when things don\u2019t roll my way.\n\n4. Sometimes you have to act older than you are.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t explicit. But I learned, each time my dad deployed, that I had to be older than my age. Being the oldest of three, I couldn\u2019t be so dependent on my mom. Sometimes she needed me too. By the time I was seven, I could braid my own hair, make my own lunch, read chapter books, and countless other things. Sometimes I feel like parts of my childhood were missed, but mostly I am grateful for how independent I was allowed to become.\n\n5.You have to be smart with money.\n\nWhen my dad retired, I was 19. Watching him struggle with the idea of leaving the military for a civilian life, a civilian job, and civilian wages was hard to do. The fear about supporting three kids in college, a mortgage, and still being able to enjoy life rocked our entire family. In it all, the lesson was clear: you damn well better be smart with your money, because you never know how life\u2019s going to turn out.\n\n6. Take advantage of every opportunity afforded to you.\n\nThe caveat here is that the independent streak created by growing up as a military brat contradicted the notion that asking for help is okay. I never wanted anything to be handed to me, I needed to feel like I earned it. More recently, he suggest that if you are presented an opportunity or someone offers help, you should take it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with accepting a little boost every now and again. It\u2019s dumb to let pride prevent you from getting ahead.\n\n7. People suck.\n\nThis may seem pretty pessimistic, but my dad taught me that sometimes, the biggest source of misery in your life will be other people. Sometimes they\u2019re mean, sometimes they\u2019re boring, and sometimes they break your heart. Even the best people sometimes suck. And on that note, I felt sometimes that he sucked too \u2014 though this thought occurred to me mostly when I was 16 and hated him, as teenage girls are wont to do.\n\n8. Only do what makes you happy.\n\nHaving been a career officer, the one thing my dad said when he got out was not to waste time doing things that don\u2019t make you happy. And I think this advice may have come from his regrets in worrying about our house, cars, vacations, school, and financial concerns. There were so many times where he sacrificed his happiness for all the material things you get caught up in when you raise a family. As a result, he\u2019s encouraged us to only seek out endeavors that mean something, that will lead to fulfillment and happiness.\n\nFeature image: Capt.

He joined the Mexican army and founded the St. Patrick's Battalion, a force made up of fellow deserters, primarily Irish and German Catholics. Riley and the others deserted because treatment of foreigners in the US army was very harsh and because they felt that their allegiance was more with Catholic Mexico than Protestant USA. Riley fought with distinction for the Mexican army and survived the war only to die in obscurity.\n\nEarly Life and Military Career\n\nRiley was born in County Galway, Ireland sometime between 1805 and 1818. Ireland was a very poor country at the time and was hit hard even before the great famines began around 1845. Like many Irish, Riley made his way to Canada, where he likely served in a British army regiment. Moving to Michigan, he enlisted in the US army before the Mexican-American War. When sent to Texas, Riley deserted to Mexico on April 12, 1846, before the war officially broke out. Like other deserters, he was welcomed and invited to serve in the Legion of Foreigners which saw action in the bombardment of Fort Texas and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma.\n\nThe Saint Patrick's Battalion\n\nBy April of 1846, Riley had been promoted to Lieutenant and had organized a unit comprised of 48 Irishmen who joined the Mexican army. More and more deserters came over from the American side and by August of 1846, he had over 200 men in his battalion. The unit was named el Batall\u00f3n de San Patricio, or the St. Patrick's Battalion, in honor of Ireland's patron saint. They marched under a green banner with an image of St. Patrick on one side and a harp and emblem of Mexico on the other. As many of them were skilled artillerymen, they were assigned as an elite artillery regiment.\n\nWhy Did the San Patricios Defect?\n\nDuring the Mexican-American War, thousands of men deserted on both sides: conditions were harsh and more men died of illness and exposure than in combat. Life in the US army was particularly tough on Irish Catholics: they were seen as lazy, ignorant and foolish. They were given dirty and dangerous jobs and promotions were virtually non-existent. Those who joined the enemy side most likely did so because of the promises of land and money and out of loyalty to Catholicism: Mexico, like Ireland, is a Catholic nation. The St. Patrick\u2019s Battalion was comprised of foreigners, mainly Irish Catholics. There were some German Catholics as well, and some foreigners who lived in Mexico before the war.\n\nThe Saint Patricks in Action in Northern Mexico\n\nThe St. Patrick's Battalion saw limited action at the siege of Monterrey, as they were stationed in a massive fortress that American General Zachary Taylor decided to avoid entirely. At the Battle of Buena Vista, however, they played a major role. They were stationed alongside the main road on a plateau where the main Mexican assault took place. They won an artillery duel with an American unit and even made off with some American cannons. When Mexican defeat was imminent, they helped cover the retreat. Several San Patricios won a Cross of Honor medal for valor during the battle, including Riley, who was also promoted to captain.\n\nThe San Patricios in Mexico City\n\nAfter the Americans opened another front, the San Patricios accompanied Mexican General Santa Anna to the east of Mexico City. They saw action at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, although their role in that battle has been largely lost to history. It was at the Battle of Chapultepec that \u200bthey made a name for themselves. As the Americans attacked Mexico City, the Battalion was stationed at one end of a key bridge and in a nearby convent. They held the bridge and convent for hours against superior troops and weapons. When Mexicans in the convent tried to surrender, the San Patricios tore down the white flag three times. They were eventually overwhelmed once they ran out of ammunition. Most of the San Patricios were killed or captured at the Battle of Churubusco, ending its effective life as a unit, although it would re-form after the war with the survivors and last for about another year.\n\nCapture and Punishment\n\nRiley was among the 85 San Patricios captured during the battle. They were court-martialed and most of them were found guilty of desertion. Between September 10 and 13, 1847, fifty of them would be hanged in punishment for their defection to the other side. Riley, although he was the highest-profile among them, was not hanged: he had defected before the war had officially been declared, and such defection in peacetime was by definition a far less serious offense.\n\nStill, Riley, by then a major and highest ranking foreign officer of the San Patricios (the Battalion had Mexican commanding officers), was punished harshly. His head was shaved, he was given fifty lashes (witnesses say the count was botched and that Riley actually received 59), and he was branded with a D (for deserter) on his cheek. When the brand was at first put on upside down, he was re-branded on the other cheek. After that, he was thrown in a dungeon for the duration of the war, which lasted several more months. In spite of this harsh punishment, there were those in the American army who felt he should have been hanged with the others.\n\nAfter the war, Riley and the others were released and re-formed the St. Patrick's Battalion. The unit soon became embroiled in the constant infighting among Mexican officials and Riley was briefly jailed for suspicion of participation in an uprising, but he was freed. Records indicating that a \"Juan Riley\" died on August 31, 1850, were once believed to refer to him, but new evidence indicates that this is not the case. Efforts are ongoing to determine Riley's true fate: Dr. Michael Hogan (who has written the definitive texts about the San Patricios) writes \"The search for the burial place of the true John Riley, Mexican major, a decorated hero, and leader of the Irish battalion, must continue.\"\n\nThe Legacy\n\nTo Americans, Riley is a deserter and a traitor: the lowest of the low. To Mexicans, however, Riley is a great hero: a skilled soldier who followed his conscience and joined the enemy because he thought it was the right thing to do. The St. Patrick's Battalion has a place of great honor in Mexican history: there are streets named for it, memorial plaques where they fought, postage stamps, etc. Riley is the name most commonly associated with the Battalion, and he has, therefore, gained extra heroic status for Mexicans, who have erected a statue of him in his birthplace of Clifden, Ireland. The Irish have returned the favor, and there is a bust of Riley now in the San Angel Plaza, courtesy of Ireland.\n\nAmericans of Irish descent, who once disowned Riley and the Battalion, have warmed to them in recent years: perhaps in part due to a couple of good books that have come out recently. Also, there was a major Hollywood production in 1999 entitled \"One Man's Hero\" based (very loosely) on the life of Riley and the Battalion.\n\nSources\n\nHogan, Michael. \"The Irish Soldiers of Mexico.\" Paperback, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, May 25, 2011."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/books/lynn-franklin-dead.html", "page_content": "Lynn C.

He is the fourth generation in his family to enlist in the military on the same date - Sept. 17.\n\n\n\nThe tradition began when Pvt. Riley Virgil Chapman enlisted in the U.S. Army on Sept. 17, 1917, and joined the American Expeditionary Forces. He served for two years.\n\n\n\nHis son, retired Tech. Sgt. Glenn R. Chapman, enlisted in the Air Force on Sept. 17, 1956. Picking the date was completely arbitrary; Glenn didn't realize he had joined the military the same date as his father until after he retired in 1977.\n\n\n\nBut when it came time for Glenn's son, Joseph Michael Chapman, to join the Air Force in 1986, they intentionally picked Sept. 17. Joseph's recruiter, Master Sgt. John Olkonen, thought it was such a unique event he arranged for a story and photograph in the local newspaper.\n\n\n\nAnd so there was no question about the date Joseph's son wanted to join the Air Force, and that is how Riley Joseph Chapman became Trainee Chapman at 9:30 a.m. MST on Sept. 17, 2014.\n\n\n\nIt was definitely a family affair for Riley's send-off at the Phoenix Military Entrance Processing Station Sept. 17. On hand for the historic event were Riley's parents, grandparents, his father's recruiter and of course, his recruiter.\n\n\n\nThe 22-year-old Riley grew up in Tucson, and said there was never any real question of whether or not he was joining the Air Force.\n\n\n\n\"It was just a matter of timing,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhile he'd like to explore a career in the Air Force, Riley said he'll \"take it one day at a time. I'll see how it goes; I don't want to get ahead of myself.\" He'll be getting a job in the electrical aptitude area.\n\n\n\nHaving four generations join the military the same day isn't the only coincidence in this family. Glenn and his son, Joseph, both worked on U-2s. Joseph and his son both graduated from Flowing Wells High School, and the day they visited Riley's recruiter happened to be Joseph's birthday.\n\n\n\nThe recruiter, Staff Sgt. Marvin Contreras, wasn't quite sure how to take the Chapmans' story when they came into his recruiting office in Northwest Tucson.\n\n\n\n\"I was a bit overwhelmed since I was just three weeks into the job,\" Contreras said. I thought, 'Is this for real? Am I being punked?'\"\n\n\n\nContreras is assigned to the 362nd Recruiting Squadron. He spent five years in the services career field at Altus Air Force Base, Okla., before becoming a recruiter. The Sept. 17 date will also hold special significance for him - Riley is the first person he has sent to Basic Military Training.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://georgiahistory.com/education-outreach/online-exhibits/featured-historical-figures/jackie-robinson/military-years/", "page_content": "Military Years\n\nIn April 1942, when Jackie Robinson reported for duty in Los Angeles after being drafted, his name was already well-known for his distinguished athletic career at UCLA. Still, fame did not dismiss one from the draft.\n\nFt. Riley, Kansas & Officer Candidate School\n\nIn April 1942, when Jackie Robinson reported for duty in Los Angeles after being drafted, his name was already well-known for his distinguished athletic career at UCLA. Still, fame did not dismiss one from the draft.\n\nIn the Army, Jackie further developed his courage and know-how in challenging the injustices of racism, for although the military had begun to integrate some of its facilities and programs, plenty of prejudice could be found among its ranks, and formal policy rarely went above \u201cseparate but equal.\u201d Furthermore, official War Department documents labeled black soldiers as undisciplined and inferior in almost every way to their white counterparts. This attitude explains the fact that although Uncle Sam drafted more than 800,000 African-Americans, very few became officers and most were kept out of combat.\n\nFor Corporal Jack Robinson of Ft. Riley, Kansas, this was unacceptable. His education, character, and superior performance, he felt, earned him and many others the right to a commission. The Ft. Riley command, however, believed differently and rejected or delayed Officer Candidate School requests filed by black soldiers. Never one to back down from a fight, Jackie went not to an officer, but a corporal. This corporal, though, brought fame and connections with him when he enlisted. Joe Louis, boxing\u2019s heavyweight champion of the world, just happened to be stationed at Ft. Riley.\n\nRobinson and others asked Louis if he might gain the attention of his friend Truman Gibson, a civilian aide to the secretary of war charged with investigating complaints filed by black soldiers. Gibson, an African-American born in Atlanta, Georgia, came to know Joe Louis while practicing law in Chicago. Louis notified his friend of the issue, and in 1943, Jackie Robinson and several other African-American soldiers at Ft. Riley received their commissions. The command appointed Robinson as a platoon leader and a morale officer. Knowing that Jim Crow policies were at the heart of black soldiers\u2019 low morale, he focused on attacking segregationist rules. He enjoyed some victories, such as obtaining more seats for black soldiers and family members at the post exchange snack area, and he proved that he did not fear officers of higher rank \u2013 or anyone for that matter \u2013 when they were on the side of Jim Crow.\n\nIn addition to the \u201ctypical\u201d inequities, Jackie faced challenges because of his athleticism. Many drafted soldiers of similar talent found themselves playing sports for the duration of the war, as post commanders loaded their teams with the most talented in an effort to beat colleges and competing stations\u2019 teams. When he went to try out for Ft. Riley\u2019s baseball team, an officer told him he had to play for the post\u2019s black team, a team that did not exist. Few knew of Robinson\u2019s baseball ability; more knew him as a football star, so it comes as no surprise that the Ft. Riley command offered him a position on the football team. Jackie learned, however, that some teams would not play a team with a black player on it, and that the command had no intention of standing up to such protests. Exasperated over the baseball brush-off and now this revelation, Lt. Robinson refused. A colonel reminded the young officer that he could be ordered to play, but Jackie held his ground and never donned the Ft. Riley uniform.\n\nCourt Martial\n\nIn 1944, Lt. Robinson changed stations. Assigned to the 761st Tank Battalion at Ft. Hood, Texas, Jackie and other black soldiers found a life much grimmer than they experienced at any other post. The command at Ft. Hood upheld much stricter Jim Crow policies and the neighboring towns offered no safe haven for the locally-stationed black soldiers. Jackie, aware of official Army policy as to what could and could not be segregated, challenged anyone who might go against orders. On July 6, 1944, eleven years before Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus, Lt. Jack Robinson challenged a hard-headed bus driver who thought white meant right. This challenge threatened not only Jackie\u2019s military career, but also could have put him in prison.\n\nEarly that July, Robinson found himself in the hospital hoping to obtain a waiver for an ankle injury. He needed the waiver in order to go overseas with his tank unit. On July 6, he decided to get out and travel by bus the thirty miles back to Ft. Hood\u2019s officer\u2019s club where he might find his friends from the 761st. Upon arrival he learned that the unit was away and engaged in training. Jackie headed back to the bus stop where he happened upon the wife of fellow black officer Gordon Jones. Mrs. Jones lived along the return route to the hospital, so the two boarded the same bus.\n\nMrs. Jones was fair-skinned and could be mistaken for white, and a black man in the company of a white woman often enraged residents of the Jim Crow South. When the two sat in the middle of the bus, people began to stare. Jackie, deep into an explanation of his ankle predicament, did not initially notice the stares or the original comments of the bus driver. The driver, Milton Reneger, angered even more by not being heard, got out of his seat, went to Jackie, and ordered him to get to the back of the bus. Robinson refused; official regulations stated that there was to be no more segregation on military vehicles. Reneger returned to the driver\u2019s seat but not without informing Jackie that there would be trouble at the last stop.\n\nWhen they stopped at the transfer point, where riders went from a military bus to a city one, Reneger jumped off quickly and met with the dispatcher who was undoubtedly waiting for the their arrival. As Jackie stepped off, Milton Reneger, using racially derogatory insults, pointed Robinson out as the troublemaker. The Military Police were called in and Jackie agreed to go to the MP station to straighten the matter out. Although the transporting MP offered the necessary military courtesy, once at the station, Jackie was subjected to additional racist smears, and it became clear that trouble lay ahead.\n\nThe Army formally charged Lt. Jack Robinson with numerous violations of military law including drunkenness, a charge particularly insulting to someone who did not drink alcoholic beverages. Other charges included failing to obey the lawful orders of a superior officer and insubordination. Once charged, protocol requires that an arrested soldier\u2019s commanding officer approve the court martial orders. When Jackie\u2019s commander refused to do so, officials transferred the lieutenant to another unit whose commander signed the order.\n\nRobinson wrote Truman Gibson about the court martial and also contacted the NAACP. The \u201cNegro press,\u201d consisting of African-American newspapers such as the popular Pittsburgh Courier, began publishing the story and contacting the Ft. Hood command asking for details. With all of the attention, Army officials became worried about widespread bad press. Recent incidents of racism directed at Joe Louis and another famous boxer, Sugar Ray Robinson, were also hitting newsstands. The court martial, then, was to be a fair one. Charges were examined more closely and adjusted, and Robinson\u2019s appointed attorney, Captain William Cline, performed expertly. His cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses exposed the many holes in their testimony and proved that Lt. Robinson had acted appropriately when faced with such a palpable racist environment. Jackie was found not guilty on all charges.\n\nAs a result of the court martial, Robinson wanted out of the military and wrote the Adjutant General that because of his bad ankle, he was better suited to civilian life. The Army seemed more than happy to oblige Jackie, and by November 1944, Lieutenant Jack Robinson received an honorable discharge and reentered civilian life.\n\nContinue to Breaking Baseball\u2019s Color Barrier"}]}
