{"Mois\u00e9s Kaufman has written and directed numerous plays, including Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, 33 Variations, and I Am My Own Wife.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moises-Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, (born November 21, 1963, Caracas, Venezuela), Venezuelan-born playwright and director who is best known for perceptive and moving plays often rooted in issues of sexuality. He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein. In 2016 Kaufman received the National Medal of Arts."}, {"url": "https://www.uidaho.edu/class/theatre/productions-and-events/archive/indecency", "page_content": "Oscar Wilde\u2019s Sex and Censorship Trial Still Resonates\n\n\u201cGross Indecency\u2014The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde\u201d by Moises Kaufman is a fast-paced tragic courtroom drama focused on the acclaimed Irish poet and playwright and his relationships with male partners, specifically Lord Alfred Douglas.\n\nSet in the 1890s when homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom, the trials center around the eventual accusations of \u201cgross indecency\u201d given to anyone exhibiting homosexual activity.\n\nPresented by the Department of Theatre Arts and directed by University of Idaho Master of Fine Arts candidate, Ricky Kimball, the story\u2019s relevancy in our current social climate is undeniable. The fight for LGBTQ+ rights has made immense strides in the past decades and has moved the needle towards justice. Wilde\u2019s story compels people to acknowledge that while society has come a long way, we still have \u201cthe impulse to impose prohibitionist judgment on the private lives of individuals,\u201d said Kimball.\n\n\"This is also a strong story about the power of perspectives in our culture. How we can shape and distort facts in a way that can change the very fabric of what is known as truth. This event shows the staining power of Puritanistic attitudes when it comes to trying to determine what is moral and immoral for everyone,\" Kimball said.\n\n\u201cThis story needs to be told to as many people as possible to show that we cannot call ourselves a humane society and treat each other in this way,\u201d Kimball said. He hopes the production creates a conversation about the issues that continue today in our culture.\n\nThe script uses actual trial testimony and excerpts from Wilde\u2019s writing with the words of his contemporaries and introduces more than 40 characters. A cast of students from the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences portray 11 characters including Luke Holt as Oscar Wilde and Angel Kalasz as Lord Alfred Douglas, along with Rachael Fornarotto, Scout Christensen, Eli Baker, Blake Presnell, Lauren Welch, Teresa Daily, Nick Hansen, Shawn Hunt and alumnus Brian Tibayan.\n\nArticle by Princess Kannah, BFA candidate in Performance\n\nDepartment of Theatre Arts\n\nPublished March 2021"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Gross_Indecency.html?id=w5RBDwAAQBAJ", "page_content": ": The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde Moises Kaufman Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group , 27 Jan 1998 - Drama - 160 pages 2 Reviews Reviews aren't verified, but Google checks for and removes fake content when it's identified Winner of the Lambda Literary Award\n\n\n\nIn this stunning work of theater, Moises Kaufman turns the trials of Oscar Wilde into a riveting human and intellectual drama.\n\n\n\nIn April 1895 Oscar Wilde brought a libel suit against the Marquess of Queensberry, the father of his youthful lover, who had publicly maligned him as a sodomite.

The tale has an irresistible emotional pull, as we watch a great man brought low through the cruelty of a repressive social order working in ironic concert with his own fiercely stated ideals. It\u2019s told here in a theatrically audacious style that combines courtroom drama and postmodern pastiche.\n\nKaufman created the play\u2019s text primarily from a mosaic of period documents \u2014 newspapers, the autobiographies of the principals, the trial transcripts \u2014 that are artfully arranged to slowly but inevitably reveal the links between the art and the life that would make Wilde\u2019s downfall seem inevitable, even strangely poetic.\n\nMichael Emerson plays Wilde, in a star-making turn that originated with the play\u2019s Off Off Broadway run, when he stepped into the role after another actor left the production. His performance is now even finer than it was in New York. Strangely, it seems both more mannered and more deeply felt here \u2014 a paradox that Wilde would surely love. Emerson gets almost outrageously big laughs with a mere lowering of the voice on a key syllable, and you feel he has found his way into every nuance of Wilde\u2019s complicated personality.\n\nHe is supported by an able all-male cast of eight, who play various roles \u2014 from Shaw to Queen Victoria to a chorus of prostitutes \u2014 and read from piles of books casually displayed on a table downstage. Sarah Lambert\u2019s stark set, dominated by a vibrant, red velvet curtain, creates a simple but dramatic backdrop.\n\nThe celebrated wit\u2019s misfortune began as the latest in a series of family spats pitting Wilde\u2019s lover Lord Alfred Douglas (Mike Doyle) against his chronically angry and increasingly unbalanced father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Hal Robinson), author of the famed rules of pugilism. When Queensberry left a card at Wilde\u2019s club calling him a \u201cposing Somdomite\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Marquess\u2019 spelling is rather unusual,\u201d Emerson\u2019s Wilde purrs contemptuously \u2014 Douglas urged Wilde to sue for libel, hoping to humiliate his father.\n\nWilde duly brings charges, but it soon becomes clear that it\u2019s not Queensberry but Wilde who is on trial, as Queensberry\u2019s lawyer Edward Carson (Simon Templeman) uses Wilde\u2019s own writings, including \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d and love letters to Douglas, to prove the truth of Queensberry\u2019s accusation. When Queensberry is exonerated, Wilde\u2019s friends urge him to flee the country to avoid prosecution for \u201cgross indecency\u201d under an 1885 law against male homosexuality that shockingly remained on the books until 1967. But Wilde stays put, to face two more trials (the first was inconclusive) that resulted in two years of hard labor in Reading Gaol.\n\nKaufman has cleverly juxtaposed his various texts \u2014 the contrast between American and French newspapers reports is funny and telling, for instance \u2014 but it\u2019s Wilde himself who is the author of the play\u2019s brilliance. The transcripts of his trials need no tinkering to juice up their wit; surely no man has ever parried insults and humiliations with such humor, intelligence and grace. Kaufman does create an apt dramatic turning point at the end of the first trial, when Wilde retorts that he didn\u2019t kiss a certain boy because he was ugly; the clear \u2014 and damning \u2014 implication is that he was in the habit of kissing the pretty ones.\n\nAs is to be expected of a play in which the drama is drawn from historical fact, one\u2019s enjoyment of \u201cGross Indecency\u201d is likely to be in inverse proportion to one\u2019s knowledge of that history. Scholars need not apply and may even be given pause by Kaufman\u2019s textual choices. For although he\u2019s said in interviews that the play\u2019s multiple-source approach allows viewers to weigh various points of view about the principals in the tragedy, the choices Kaufman has made inevitably skew the audience\u2019s perceptions. So while Lord Alfred Douglas doesn\u2019t exactly come out smelling like a rose, the generous excerpts from his self-serving autobiography make him seem rather nobler than the callow, shallow and dissolute figure who emerges from other Wilde biographies. (Kaufman does, however, reveal that Douglas ended up a Nazi sympathizer, which perhaps says enough.)\n\nParallels to l\u2019affaire Lewinsky give the play a surreal charge. As we watch the smallest details of Wilde\u2019s sexual life become the target of relentless government and media interrogations, it\u2019s impossible not to see that less has changed in the course of a century than we might expect. \u201cIn the old days men had the rack. Now they have the press,\u201d Wilde says at one point, an opinion with which President Clinton would undoubtedly concur.\n\nBut Wilde\u2019s life needs no such contemporary glosses to engage us. In an age when gay men and women still face persecution, whether subtle or pronounced, his story is contemporary. Facing that second trial, which all advised him would end in ruin, Wilde stood still. Why? What Kaufman\u2019s play so movingly posits is an answer to that question that resonates to this day. It was Wilde\u2019s transgressing of the social and sexual order that fed his art, which called into question that order and its hypocrisies. Through his trials, Wilde perhaps came to see that life and art were united. To flee the country would be a betrayal of the truth of both, and he couldn\u2019t do it. He had too much integrity.\n\n\u201cTo speak the truth is a painful thing,\u201d Wilde says toward the play\u2019s close. Ironically, since he pledged his life to art, the courage with which he faced the hard truths of his life turned out to be a thing more beautiful than any of his aesthetic achievements."}, {"url": "https://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/2016/9/22/10-things-know-about-moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Moises Kaufman, known for writing and/or directing such plays as The Laramie Project, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, and I Am My Own Wife, today will receive the National Medal of Arts from President Obama at the White House. The medal recognizes outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States. Kaufman is in good company; among this year's other recipients are film director Mel Brooks, author Sandra Cisneros, actor Morgan Freeman, composer Philip Glass, and actress-singer Audra McDonald. (See the full list here.) Kaufman has had a long and varied career, and some facts about his life and work may surprise even devoted fans. Read on for 10 things you should know about Moises Kaufman.\n\nHe is the son of a Holocaust survivor.\n\nKaufman's father, Jose, was a Romanian Jew who survived the Holocaust. As a boy, Jose earned money by making and selling the yellow Stars of David that the Nazi regime forced Jews to wear. \"He spent most of the war alternately hiding in a small room and selling Stars of David,\" Moises Kaufman recalled in the book A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer, edited by Eve Ensler. After World War II was over, Jose made his way to Caracas, Venezuela. There he worked in a grocery store and eventually bought one, and he married Dora Akerman, a Venezuelan-born woman of Ukrainian descent. Moises was born in Caracas in 1963. His parents brought him up in the Orthodox branch of Judaism, and he attended a yeshiva -- a Jewish religious school -- which made Moises quite the outsider in the heavily Catholic nation, as did his realization at age 11 that he was gay. Moises moved to New York City in 1987 to pursue his theatrical career, in which many of his projects have dealt with outsiders, and some have touched directly on the Holocaust. In 2015 he directed a revival of Bent, Martin Sherman's play about gay men in a concentration camp, at Los Angeles's Mark Taper Forum.\n\nThe Laramie Project was a massive undertaking.\n\nFor The Laramie Project, which deals with the brutal murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard and the reactions of the townspeople in Laramie, Wyo., Kaufman and his colleagues at the Tectonic Theater Project compiled 400 hours of interviews from over 200 people. Kaufman was in New York City when he heard about the attack on Shepard in October 1998. \"I started getting phone calls -- 'Did you hear what happened?' -- and then I read it in the newspaper and I saw it on television,\" he recalled to The Advocate in 2008. \"People have spoken about how we as gay people feel attacked, injured, constantly in our culture. And that image of that boy tied to the fence spoke to so many of us about our pain and about our sense of how we fit into the landscape of this country. The impact of seeing what this was doing to the country--that's when I decided to go to Laramie and do The Laramie Project.\" The Laramie Project premiered in 2000, has been performed widely, and was adapted into an HBO movie, directed by Kaufman, in 2002.

It received numerous critics' awards and a GLAAD Media Award. It has been produced in dozens of cities in the U.S. and abroad, but a planned production in Moscow was abruptly canceled in 2015. The production was to be funded in part by the U.S. State Department, but the Russian government stepped in and said the Moscow theater company that was to stage it could not accept foreign funds. The real reason for the cancellation, Kaufman believes, was that this depiction of the great gay author and wit ran afoul of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" law, which bans any positive discussion of LGBT people or issues in forums accessible to minors. The play did receive a a star-studded benefit reading in New York City in the fall of 2015 to support the Tectonic Theater Project and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\n\nPictured: Kaufman (left) and Ben Foster clown around at the premiere of the HBO film of The Laramie Project.\n\nThe Laramie Project has run into trouble a few places too.\n\nThe Laramie Project's gay subject matter has led high school administrators to cancel performances of the play in places as varied as Spokane, Wash.;Ottumwa, Iowa; and Burbank, Calif. The students in Burbank eventually were able to stage their production, although not at their high school -- it went on at the Los Angeles suburb's Colony Theatre, which donated the space, and with help from Tectonic. But the play also has had well-received, school-supported productions in many places in the U.S., including Xavier High School, a Roman Catholic institution in New York City.\n\nHis play 33 Variations gave Jane Fonda her first Broadway role in 46 years.\n\nKaufman wrote and directed 33 Variations, about a music scholar studying one of Beethoven's most enigmatic works, and when it premiered on Broadway in 2009, Jane Fonda played the lead role. This was Fonda's first Broadway appearance since 1963, and she received positive reviews. \"Whatever discomfort the actress may feel melds into her portrayal of Dr. Katherine Brandt, whose naturally assertive nature is humbled by the progressive, atrophying illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease,\" Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, adding, \"For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\"\n\nHe discovered a different side of Robin Williams during Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.\n\nFonda isn't the only major movie star who has appeared in a Kaufman play. In 2011, Robin Williams starred in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, a meditation on the Iraq war written and directed by Kaufman. Williams portrayed a tiger who is killed in the first scene and then haunts the rest of the characters for the remainder of the play. Williams initially started rehearsals with what Kaufman called \"the 10 a.m. stand-up.\" \"He would start talking about whatever crossed his mind and would riff on it for the next 20 or 30 minutes, keeping all of us -- actors, designers, stage management -- roaring with laughter,\" Kaufman wrote in Salon in 2014, after Williams's suicide. \"Like everyone, I was dazzled by the speed of his brain and the quickness of his wit, but I also noticed something else: an actor's natural trepidation about tackling a demanding role. As he developed his character ... the 10 a.m. monologues became shorter and shorter. He was feeling more at home in the rehearsal room, finding his groove in the role. Until, finally, the monologues were gone.\" Williams also developed \"a real camaraderie\" with his castmates -- and he occasionally showed signs of depression, the playwright noted. \"For me, it isn't his brilliant sense of humor, or his wit, or his chameleon abilities that I'll miss,\" Kaufman concluded. \"I'll miss the guy who came to rehearsal every day with humility and kindness, who sat around at lunch and shot the breeze. I'll miss the man who loved what he did every day. And who loved this community. I will miss my friend.\"\n\nHe's even directed operas, including one based on Puss in Boots.\n\nKaufman has proved his versatility time and again. In 2010 he took on the direction of Spanish composer Xavier Montsalvatge's chamber opera adaptation of the popular fairy tale. The production incorporated both puppets and human actors. Staging a show aimed at children was intimidating and also rewarding, Kaufman told the New York Daily News. \"I've never been more scared in my life, because children don't lie,\" he said. On the other hand, he noted, \"There's nothing better than hearing children laugh.\"\n\nHis most recent project is a reimagining of Bizet's Carmen.\n\nNothing if not adventurous, Kaufman and cowriter Eduardo Machado adapted Georges Bizet's 19th-century opera into Carmen: An Afro-Cuban Jazz Musical, set in 1958, changing the locale from Spain to Cuba, and making the sensuous factory worker Carmen a black woman who supports Fidel Castro's revolution. Composer Arturo O'Farrill adapted Bizet's melodies into jazzy tunes with lyrics by Kaufman and others. The play had its world premiere, directed by Kaufman, in February of this year at the Olney Theatre Center in Montgomery County, Md., near Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite all his success, Kaufman describes himself as shy and socially awkward.\n\n\"I'm incredibly shy, I am socially awkward, and I don't have many other interests other than my work,\" he told Los Angeles's Jewish Journal in 2011. \"When I'm in the rehearsal room, I'm my best self. I've always known how to live in my work. I am not so good at living my life.\"\n\nBut he has managed to have a long-term relationship. He is married to Jeffrey LaHoste, with whom he founded the Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman and LaHoste founded Tectonic in 1991, with the goal of \"developing innovative works that explore theatrical language and form, fostering an artistic dialogue with audiences on the social, political, and human issues that affect us all,\" according to the New York-based company's website. Kaufman is its artistic director, and LaHoste, a writer and producer, is a member of the board of directors. LaHoste has produced many of Kaufman's plays and several other projects, such as Kirby Dick's 2009 documentary film Outrage, about closeted politicians who support anti-LGBT legislation. He is also the author of author of Elysian Fields, a television series in development that was chosen as a participating project in the Producers' Guild of America's Diversity Workshop. Kaufman and LaHoste have been together for more than 20 years, and they were married in 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44949.Mois_s_Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman\n\nBorn\n\nNovember 21, 1963\n\nGenre\n\nMois\u00e9s Kaufman (born November 21, 1963) is a playwright, director and founder of Tectonic Theater Project.
