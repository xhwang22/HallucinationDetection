She was born in Trier, Germany, where her father was stationed.\n\nYvonne de Gaulle was struck by an automobile shortly before Anne's birth. She was born with Down syndrome and lived with her family until her death. De Gaulle's relatives all testified that the General, who was normally undemonstrative in his affections for his family, was more open and extroverted with Anne. He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes.\n\nIn October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur at Milon-la-Chapelle, where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the Fondation Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne died of pneumonia on 6 February 1948, aged 20, at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises.

Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection.

De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening.

That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. No one, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story.

They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petite Anne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love.\n\n________________________________\n\nDr. Samuel Gregg is Research Director at the Acton Institute.

She spent much of her life in poor health.\n\nKnow about Queen Anne, monarch of Great Britain and Ireland See all videos for this article\n\nAnne, (born February 6, 1665, London, England\u2014died August 1, 1714, London), queen of Great Britain and Ireland from 1702 to 1714 who was the last Stuart monarch. She wished to rule independently, but her intellectual limitations and chronic ill health caused her to rely heavily on her ministers, who directed England\u2019s efforts against France and Spain in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u201314). The bitter rivalries between Whigs and Tories that characterized her reign were intensified by uncertainty over the succession to her throne.\n\nAnne was the second daughter of James, duke of York (King James II, 1685\u201388), and Anne Hyde. Although her father was a Roman Catholic, she was reared a Protestant at the insistence of her uncle, King Charles II. In 1683 Anne was married to the handsome, if uninspiring, Prince George of Denmark (1653\u20131708), who became her devoted companion. Of greater political consequence was Anne\u2019s intimate relationship with her childhood friend Sarah Jennings Churchill, wife of John Churchill (later 1st duke of Marlborough). The beautiful, intelligent Sarah became Anne\u2019s lady of the bedchamber and soon had the princess in her power.\n\nBritannica Quiz Fit for a King (or Queen): the British Royalty Quiz\n\nIt was Sarah who persuaded Anne to side with the Protestant ruler William III of Orange, stadtholder of the Netherlands, when William overthrew James II in 1688. By the Bill of Rights (1689), William and his wife, Mary, Anne\u2019s elder sister, were made king and queen of England, and Anne was placed in line for the succession to the throne. Anne and Mary had a bitter falling-out, and after Mary\u2019s death in 1694 William cultivated Anne\u2019s goodwill, but he refused to appoint her regent during his absences from England.\n\nAlthough Anne was pregnant 18 times between 1683 and 1700, only five children were born alive, and, of these, only one, a son, survived infancy. His death in 1700 ended Anne\u2019s hopes of providing herself and the three kingdoms (England, Scotland, and Ireland) with a successor. Hence, she acquiesced to the Act of Settlement of 1701, which designated as her successors the Hanoverian descendants of King James I of England, through his daughter Elizabeth.\n\nAnne became queen upon William\u2019s death in March 1702. From the first she was motivated largely by an intense devotion to the Anglican church. She detested Roman Catholics and Dissenters and sympathized with High Church Tories. At the same time, she sought to be free from the domination of the political parties. Her first ministry, though predominantly Tory, was headed by two neutrals, Sidney Godolphin and the duke of Marlborough. The influence of Sarah Churchill (now duchess of Marlborough) over Anne was slight after 1703, though the duke remained commander of the British forces.\n\nAnne soon discovered that she disagreed with the Tories on strategy for the war. The queen, Marlborough, and the Whigs wanted to commit English troops to Continental campaigns, while the Tories believed England should engage the enemy principally at sea. Consequently, as Marlborough accumulated impressive victories on the Continent, pressure was exerted on Anne to admit Whigs to the ministry. She resisted obstinately and even grew cold toward the duchess, who adopted the cause of the Whig politicians. By 1707 the duchess had been supplanted in the queen\u2019s affections by Abigail Masham, the tool of the leading Tory, Robert Harley (later 1st earl of Oxford). Nevertheless, the schemes of Harley and Masham caused Anne so much embarrassment that in 1708 she was forced to dismiss Harley and admit the most prominent Whigs into her administration. As the war dragged on, the nation turned against the Whigs. In 1710 Anne was able to expel them and appoint a Tory ministry. She dismissed both Marlboroughs from her service in 1711.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Under the Asiento de negros, Britain was entitled to supply those colonies with 4,800 African slaves per year for 30 years. The contract for this supply was assigned to the South Sea Company, of which Anne held some 22.5 percent of the stock.\n\nThe queen\u2019s advancing age and her infirmities made the succession a crucial issue. Leading Tories were in constant communication with Anne\u2019s exiled Roman Catholic half brother, James, the Old Pretender, who had been excluded by law from the succession. Nevertheless, the suddenness of Anne\u2019s final illness and death frustrated any plans the Tories might have had for capturing the throne for the Pretender. Her last act was to secure the Protestant succession by placing the lord treasurer\u2019s staff in the hands of a capable moderate, Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, who presided over the peaceful accession of the Hanoverian prince George Louis (King George I, 1714\u201327)."}, {"url": "https://catholicstand.com/anne-de-gaulle/", "page_content": "Charles de Gaulle could be a very frustrating man. Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces.\n\nArrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne de Gaulle Had Down Syndrome\n\nCharles and Yvonne de Gaulle were both devout Catholics, so when their youngest daughter Anne was born on New Years Day in 1928, they had a strong faith to fall back on when they learned that Anne had Down Syndrome. She also had birth injuries that meant that she would never walk unaided. There was never any question about Anne being institutionalized. She was a member of their family, and she stayed with the family in all their travels. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was noted for his reserve and even with family members he was usually not very demonstrative. Not so with his daughter Anne, who received a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. \u201cPapa\u201d was the one word that Anne could say clearly. He would sing to her, read her stories and play with her. She was, he said simply, \u201cMy joy\u201d. As de Gaulle said, \u201cShe helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them.\u201d\n\nThe De Gaulles Were Heartbroken\n\nYvonne de Gaulle, a formidable woman in her own right, as she demonstrated after the collapse of France in 1940 when by herself she traveled across the war-torn country and made sure her family, including Anne, was on the last transport from Brest to England, in October 1945 bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur and established a hospital for handicapped girls, the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. The de Gaulles were heartbroken when their beloved daughter died on February 6, 1948, in her father\u2019s arms. After they had buried her, Charles gently told his weeping wife, \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nOf course , the de Gaulles did not forget their daughter. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s\u2019 life was saved by his love for Anne on August 22, 1962, when an assassin\u2019s bullet was deflected in the car he was riding by the frame of the picture of his daughter which he carried with him at all times. When he died in 1970 he was buried beside his daughter at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises as he requested. Love gives us no guarantees against the tragedies of life, but it does give us the strength to surmount them."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/de-gaulle-yvonne-1900-1979", "page_content": "de Gaulle, Yvonne (1900\u20131979)\n\nFrench first lady who went into exile with her husband Charles de Gaulle when he headed the Free French resistance during WWII and was, in her later years, affectionately known in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne). Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

McClarey \u2022 April 21, AD2016 5\n\nCharles de Gaulle could be a very frustrating man. Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces.\n\nArrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne de Gaulle Had Down Syndrome\n\nCharles and Yvonne de Gaulle were both devout Catholics, so when their youngest daughter Anne was born on New Years Day in 1928, they had a strong faith to fall back on when they learned that Anne had Down Syndrome. She also had birth injuries that meant that she would never walk unaided. There was never any question about Anne being institutionalized. She was a member of their family, and she stayed with the family in all their travels. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was noted for his reserve and even with family members he was usually not very demonstrative. Not so with his daughter Anne, who received a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. \u201cPapa\u201d was the one word that Anne could say clearly. He would sing to her, read her stories and play with her. She was, he said simply, \u201cMy joy\u201d. As de Gaulle said, \u201cShe helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them.\u201d\n\nThe De Gaulles Were Heartbroken\n\nYvonne de Gaulle, a formidable woman in her own right, as she demonstrated after the collapse of France in 1940 when by herself she traveled across the war-torn country and made sure her family, including Anne, was on the last transport from Brest to England, in October 1945 bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur and established a hospital for handicapped girls, the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. The de Gaulles were heartbroken when their beloved daughter died on February 6, 1948, in her father\u2019s arms. After they had buried her, Charles gently told his weeping wife, \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nOf course , the de Gaulles did not forget their daughter. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s\u2019 life was saved by his love for Anne on August 22, 1962, when an assassin\u2019s bullet was deflected in the car he was riding by the frame of the picture of his daughter which he carried with him at all times. When he died in 1970 he was buried beside his daughter at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises as he requested. Love gives us no guarantees against the tragedies of life, but it does give us the strength to surmount them.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis article appeared on Catholic Stand and is reprinted with permission of the author.\n\nAbout the Author: Donald R.

After the Nazis came to power in 1933, her family emigrated to the Netherlands and settled in Amsterdam.\n\nAnne adored her adoptive country, but following the German invasion of the Netherlands in the spring of 1940 (on the day Churchill became prime minister), Anne\u2019s father Otto began to make arrangements to hide his family from the inevitable Nazi roundup of Jews.\n\nOn 6 July 1942 the Franks and another family went into hiding together in a specially prepared \u201csecret annex\u201d at the back of a warehouse on the Prinsengracht Canal, now home to the Anne Frank Museum. Altogether there were eight people in seclusion: Anne, her sister Margot, their parents Otto and Edith, Hermann and Auguste Van Pels (known as the Van Daans in the book), their sixteen-year-old son Peter, and, starting in November 1942, Fritz Pfeffer (an elderly dentist known in the book as Mr. Dussel).\n\n\n\nAnne was thirteen when she went into hiding. Unbeknownst to her family, she had already started a diary. She continued to keep it up as soon as the Franks were settled in the annex. Her first entry from that point was made on 8 July 1942. Every few days she wrote new entries documenting her perilous existence for the next two years. The final entry was made on 1 August 1944. Three days later the annex was raided by the Nazis, and all were arrested. Anne and Margot were sent to Bergen-Belsen in Germany, and in that disease-ridden camp they perished in the early months of 1945. Anne was fifteen.\n\nOf the others, only Anne\u2019s father survived. After the war he returned to Amsterdam, where his friends, who had been assisting the family while in hiding, presented him with the writings and drawings of Anne that had been found left behind. After some urging, Otto Frank resolved to publish the diary, and the first edition appeared in 1947.\n\n2023 International Churchill Conference Join us for the 40th International Churchill Conference. Edinburgh Scotland, 5-7 October 2023 More\n\nNo evidence has emerged that Winston Churchill ever read the English translation, although it was published in 1952 when he was once again prime minister. If he ever had read the book, he no doubt would have been moved to learn that one of his greatest admirers during the war was Anne Frank. She made several references in her diary to Churchill, whose activities and speeches she carefully followed via the radio.\n\nThe first entry mentioning Churchill is for 10 November 1942 and describes the Allied landings made in North Africa, Operation TORCH:\n\nThe biggest surprise came from Mr. Van Daan when, at one o\u2019clock, he announced that the British had landed in Tunis, Algiers, Casablanca, and Oran. \u201cThis is the beginning of the end,\u201d everyone one was saying, but Churchill, the British Prime Minister, who had probably heard the same thing in England, said: \u201cThis is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u201d Do you see the difference?1\n\nPerceptive indeed for a thirteen-year-old, and the diary reveals a keen observer of events, wise beyond her years. On Saturday, 27 February 1943, she wrote: \u201cChurchill has had pneumonia but is improving slowly. The freedom-loving Gandhi of India is holding his umpteenth fast.\u201d2\n\nLikely this pithy observation would have raised a chuckle from Churchill, who was indeed recuperating from a serious case of pneumonia, and had just written that he was \u201cfeeling definitely better. So is Gandhi. Once he saw that his antics would have no effect he took a marked turn for the better.\u201d3 Gandhi was living in comfortable arrest in Poona after calling for all India to withdraw support for the war effort. To make his point he vowed a three-week fast. Meanwhile, the Franks were living in daily fear for their lives on a strictly rationed diet as the German army occupied their country, enslaved civilians, and murderously hunted down Jews.\n\nOver one year later and twenty months into hiding, Anne wrote on Monday, 27 March 1944 that the adults in the annex were obsessively following news on the radio:\n\nJust as if the German Wehrmacht news bulletins and the English BBC were not enough, they have now introduced Special Air-Raid Announcements.\u2026The British are making non-stop business of their air attacks, with the same zest as the Germans make a business of lying. The radio therefore goes on early in the morning and is listened to at all hours of the day, until nine, ten, and often eleven o\u2019clock in the evening.\n\nAnne began to show her exasperation with this:\n\nArbeiter-Programm, Radio \u201cOranje,\u201d Frank Phillips or Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina, they each get their turn, and an ever attentive ear\u2026. Ugh! It gets so boring, and it\u2019s quite a job not to become a dull old stick oneself. Politics can\u2019t do much more harm to the parents!\n\nHowever, she went on to add: \u201cI must mention one shining exception\u2014a speech by our beloved Winston Churchill is quite perfect.\u201d4\n\nTen weeks later came the biggest news of all: Tuesday, 6 June 1944. After recording that she had listened to various radio announcements about the D-Day landings in different languages, starting at eight in the morning, Anne wrote:\n\nEnglish news in English at one o\u2019clock: 11,000 planes stand ready, and are flying to and fro\n\nnon-stop, landing troops and attacking behind the lines; 4,000 landing boats, plus small craft are landing troops and material between Cherbourg and Le Havre incessantly. English and American troops are already engaged in hard fighting. Speeches by [Dutch Prime Minister] Gerbrandy, by the Prime Minister of Belgium, King Haakon of Norway, De Gaulle of France, the King of England, and last, but not least, Churchill.5\n\nThe numbers of planes and aircraft that she recorded were the same figures given by Churchill that day in his speech to the House of Commons, although Anne confused \u201clanding boats\u201d for ships, as the landing boats were counted among what Churchill described as \u201cseveral thousand smaller craft.\u201d6 Three days later Anne wrote:\n\nWe heard over the BBC that Churchill wanted to land with the troops on D-Day; however, Eisenhower and the other generals managed to get him out of the idea. Just think of it, what pluck he has for such an old man\u2014he must be seventy at least.7\n\nChurchill was in fact sixty-nine, and famously did have to be dissuaded by King George VI himself from personally participating in the D-Day landings. Anne\u2019s admiration helps to explain the passion she continued to express in what became her final entry about Churchill made on Tuesday, 13 June 1944:\n\nYesterday Churchill, Smuts, Eisenhower, and Arnold visited French villages, which have been conquered and liberated. The torpedo boat that Churchill was in shelled the coast. He appears, like so many men, not to know what fear is\u2014 makes me envious!8\n\nChurchill\u2019s first visit to the Normandy beachhead did take place on 12 June, but it was a destroyer, HMS Kelvin, not a torpedo boat, that Churchill\u2019s party boarded for return to Portsmouth. Still Anne no doubt would have been thrilled to learn that it was Churchill\u2019s personal suggestion that the Kelvin \u201chave a plug\u201d at the Germans before going home.9\n\nAnne was quite right to believe that Churchill was without fear. While he was still on shore meeting with General Montgomery, air alarms occasionally sounded. At least one was a real threat. Viewing a photograph that captured the moment, Montgomery later recalled: \u201cA German came over. There was an air battle. Everyone was rather alarmed. Winston was rather pleased. There was shelling. Everything was happening.\u201d10 Pluck indeed.\n\nThere was, of course, no happy ending for Anne Frank. Following capture that August, she died bald, emaciated, and shivering, not in a gas chamber but of malnutrition and disease, probably some time the following February. Her body was interred with thousands of others in an unmarked grave.\n\nThe diary of Anne Frank has inspired millions with its poignancy, insights, and sense of foreboding. Near the end she wrote, \u201cA quiet conscience makes one strong!\u201d11 During her ordeal Anne was sustained primarily by her faith and the love of her family, but her testimonial reveals that she also drew strength from the leadership of Winston Churchill.\n\nDavid Freeman is editor of Finest Hour.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1.

Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference In London de Gaulle\u2019s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle\u2019s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering."}, {"url": "https://catholicism.org/39522.html", "page_content": "\u201cThese two saints of France were, as we are told in the Roman Martyrology, twin brothers.

It recounts the couple\u2019s devotion to their severely retarded and handicapped daughter Anne. Anne was Charles\u2019 pride and joy. She loved her father and he loved her. When he died in 1970, he was buried, as he requested, beside his beloved daughter. She had passed away in 1948 when she was only twenty. When she died Charles said these simple words to his grieving wife: \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nThe American Catholic: Charles de Gaulle could be a very frustrating man. Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces. Arrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.
