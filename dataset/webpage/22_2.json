Founded: 1973.\n\nKansas, the state's most commercially successful rock group, was formed in Topeka in 1973.\n\nKansas was one of the most skillful creators of what is known as \"progressive rock;\" melodic, often thematic songs and albums with high levels of musicianship and relatively (for rock) complex orchestration.\n\nThe band is best known for its three \"platinum\" albums of the 1970s: \"Leftoverture,\" \"Point of Know Return\" and \"Monolith.\" \"Leftoverture\" featured Kansas' breakout hit, \"Carry On Wayward Son,\" which has sold over 4 million copies worldwide. \"Point of Know Return\" equaled those sales totals and produced two hit singles in the album's up-tempo title track and the contemplative \"Dust in the Wind.\" All three of these singles remain as staples of the classic rock radio format, as does the biggest single from \"Monolith,\" \"People of the South Wind,\" taken, of course, from the meaning of \"Kansas.\"\n\nA reconstituted Kansas still tours worldwide, featuring classic Kansas lineup members Phil Ehart (percussion), Steve Walsh (vocals, keyboard), and Rich Williams (guitar). Robby Steinhart (vocals, strings) has retired from touring. Dave Hope (bass) is a minister in Florida. The writer of \"Carry On Wayward Son\" and \"Dust in the Wind,\" Kerry Livgren (guitar) moved to a career in Contemporary Christian music, and currently composes music, farms, and teaches a Sunday school class at Topeka Bible Church, among other activities.\n\nIn terms of spreading the state's \"brand name,\" as well as being a positive demonstration of pride in the Sunflower State, Kansas has had perhaps no more visible proponent than, well, Kansas."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/kansas", "page_content": "Kansas, situated on the American Great Plains, became the 34th state on January 29, 1861.

This quickly led to violence, and the territory became known as \u201cBleeding Kansas.\u201d Kansas has long been known as part of America\u2019s agricultural heartland and is home to the major U.S. military installation Fort Leavenworth. In 1954, it became a battleground of the civil rights movement when the landmark Brown v.

It is the 15th largest US state and the 40th largest by population, with 2018 estimates exceeding 2.9 million people. The capital of the state is Topeka while Wichita is the most populous city in the state with over 600,000 residents. Johnson County is the most populated county in the state with a population exceeding half a million residents. Kansas joined the Union in 1861 as the 34th state.\n\nHistory\n\nThe area that Kansas now occupies was inhabited by various Native American tribes for a millennium before the arrival of Europeans in North America. A Spanish explorer was the first European to make contact and explore the area in 1541.\n\nSettlement\n\nThe majority of Kansas was bought by the United States in 1803 being part of the Louisiana Purchase. Kansas was a constituent of the Missouri Territory between 1812 and 1821. Americans first settled in Kansas in 1827 and established Fort Leavenworth as the first white settlement. The southwest part of Kansas was acquired in 1848 after the end of the Mexican-American War as it was previously part of Mexico. The rate of settlement increased in the 1850s when the political debate over slavery had peaked. In 1854, the area was officially set for settlement through the famous Kansas-Nebraska Act by the United States Congress which established the territory of Kansas and the Territory Nebraska.\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nThe incoming settlers from Missouri and Arkansas were pro-slavery while those from Massachusetts and other free states took a stand against slavery and the spread of slavery from neighboring states. The disagreement in Kansas led to a string of violence and civil altercations on whether slavery should be legalized or not. These confrontations became the precursor of the American Civil War, which was later became known as Bleeding Kansas. In the end, the abolitionists won and Kansas eventually as a free state was admitted to the US on January 29, 1861, becoming the 34th state.\n\nModern Kansas\n\nKansas is part of the Bible Belt with about 76% of the population adheres to Christianity. The state is known for its agricultural produce with over 90% of its land dedicated to agriculture. Kansas is located in the Wheat Belt and Corn Belt. The most significant crop product is wheat, whereby an estimated 40% of all winter wheat grown in the US originates from Kansas. The aerospace industry is also a big contributor to the Kansas economy with several national and international aircraft companies having manufacturing facilities in Wichita."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/Kansas/Statehood", "page_content": "Statehood of Kansas\n\nKansas entered the Union as a free state in 1861. During the American Civil War, two-thirds of Kansas men of military age enlisted in the Union Army, and, with nearly 8,500 dead or wounded, Kansas suffered the highest rate of casualties (in proportion to its population) of any state in the Union. Before and after the Civil War, sporadic fighting occurred between the settlers and the Indians. In 1867 a peace treaty was signed in which the Indians agreed to sell their land; in return, the United States agreed to build homes for them in what is now Oklahoma and to provide money, food, and clothing. The U.S. Congress did not honour the treaty, and when the Indians returned they found their land occupied by white settlers. Further sporadic battles continued until the last Indian raid, in 1878.\n\nEarly settlers in wooded eastern Kansas lived in log cabins, but in the west they had only dugouts or sod houses. Unpredictable weather, recurring Indian raids, droughts and dust storms, and periodic grasshopper invasions discouraged many early settlers. One of the heroes of that era was William Mathewson, known as the original \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d (a nickname also used later to greater fame by William F. Cody), who hunted buffalo for starving settlers for an entire winter without pay, providing meat by the wagonload. The coming of the railroads in the late 1860s and the \u201970s made first one village and then another into boisterous cow towns. Texas cattlemen drove herds northward to Caldwell, Wichita, Dodge City, Ellsworth, Newton, and Abilene to reach the railhead. Although this development brought prosperity to Kansas and created a persistent image, the cow-town era lasted less than a decade.\n\nVolga Germans (Germans who had settled in Russia in the 18th century), many of them Mennonites, arrived in 1874, bringing trunks full of hand-selected grains of Turkey Red wheat. This excellent strain was the basis of the abundant winter wheat crops that became an important part of the Kansas economy. Many of the Mennonites\u2019 descendants remain as prosperous farmers.\n\nBy about 1890, most of the land was occupied, and Kansans settled into a life dominated by agriculture. World War I produced a great demand for food, and more and more prairie was plowed and put into production, which led to temporary prosperity, but such practices contributed directly to the dust storms that devastated the state in the 1930s. World War II stimulated Kansas\u2019s growing eminence in aircraft production and brought many people from Oklahoma and Arkansas to work in Wichita\u2019s aircraft plants.\n\nThe decades of the 1970s and \u201980s were characterized by a slow but steady growth in population, one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, and a steady increase in the number of Kansans employed in mining and in health care and other service activities. This general trend continued in the 1990s, although Kansas was less prosperous than its neighbours, especially the rapidly growing state of Colorado to the west.\n\nKansas remains a Republican stronghold, with several of its conservative politicians attaining national prominence, but Democrats have been increasingly influential in state-level politics. Part of the political shift can be attributed to the growing number of Hispanic voters, with newly arrived Mexicans and Central Americans repopulating almost-abandoned small towns in the west and forming distinctive enclaves in larger towns and cities throughout the state."}, {"url": "https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/kansas/history-of-ks-towns/", "page_content": "by Annie\n\nYou know the towns\u2026 but do you know how they got their start or why they were given their name? If you don\u2019t, you are not alone\u2026 Fortunately, we will be learning the abridged history of 13 Kansas towns, including:\n\n1. Baxter Springs Wikimedia Commons Baxter Springs was originally settled in the mid-17th century by the native Osage who relied on the springs' healing waters. A few centuries later, European settlers (including the town's namesake, A. Baxter) settled the town, which eventually became an important hub during the Civil War because of its many military and trading posts.\n\n2. Neosho Falls Get Neosho Falls Facebook The small but beautiful town, which sits along the Neosho River, was founded in 1857 and was gradually built upon and improved by brothers Benjamin and N.S. Goss. Interestingly enough, the brothers would eventually go on to organize a company of cavalry to fight for the Union during the Civil War.\n\n3. Sharon Springs Flickr/frank thompson photos Founded in 1868 as Eagle Tail Station, Sharon Springs was later renamed (after Sharon Springs, New York) and was finally incorporated as a city in 1890.\n\n4. Phillipsburg Flickr/J. Stephen Conn Named for politician and journalist William A. Phillips, Phillipsburg was organized in 1872. The historic Fort Bissel (pictured) was also built in 1872 as a way to protect the town from supposedly hostile Native Americans. It closed in 1878 and was later reconstructed in the town's city park, where it can still be seen today.\n\n5. Arkansas City Wikimedia Commons Originally settled by Native Americans sometime in the early 16th century, Arkansas City was later founded by white settlers, who named the town after the nearby river. During the late 19th/early 20th centuries, the town was a bustling metropolis for the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company.\n\n6. Hutchinson Flickr/Loco Steve Much like Arkansas City, Hutchinson was an important railroad town during the late 19th/20th century, serving as a stop along the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway. The city was founded in 1871 by Indian Agent Clinton \"C.C.\" Hutchinson, who contracted with the Santa Fe Railway to created a town over the Arkansas River.\n\n7. Pratt Wikimedia Commons Another prominent stop along the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was Pratt, which was named for a Kansas Infantry Civil War officer who was killed during the Battle of Wilson's Creek (Caleb S. Pratt).\n\n8. Hiawatha Flickr/frank thompson photos One of the oldest towns in Kansas is that of Hiawatha, which was founded in 1857. The name Hiawatha comes from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, The Song of Hiawatha, which tells the tale of Onondaga and Mohawk Indian leader Hiawatha.\n\n9. La Crosse Wikimedia Commons The famous \"Barbed Wire Capital of the World\" was founded in 1876 and named after La Crosse, Wisconsin. When the town was incorporated, the intention was for it to become the Rush County seat; however, a full-out war ensued between La Crosse and nearby Rush Center, who had served as the temporary seat. In 1888, it was decided that La Crosse would in fact be the county seat, which it has proudly served ever since.\n\n10. Medicine Lodge Flickr/frank thompson photos Medicine Lodge was named for... you guessed it; a Native American medicine lodge constructed within the trees by the native Kiowa people. The area would go on to become the home of the famous Medicine Lodge Treaty, in which the USA and Kiowa, Comanche, Plains Apache, Southern Cheyenne, and Southern Arapaho tribes agreed to bring peace to the area by moving Native Americans to reservations in Indian Territory.\n\n11. Garden City Wikimedia Commons It may have taken some time to get the tree-less, tumbleweed covered Garden City established, but once the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad put a switch station in the town (in 1879), people came flocking to the area to homestead.\n\n12. Abilene Wikimedia Commons Originally called Mud Creek, the town was founded in 1857 and was later named Abilene after a passage in Luke 3:1. In the next few years, Abilene would go on to become an important switch for the Kansas Pacific Railway, as well as the final stop along the famed Chisholm Trail."}, {"url": "https://www.fbi.gov/history/field-office-histories/kansascity", "page_content": "1980s and 1990s\n\nDuring this time, FBI Kansas City saw increases in energy-related crimes (the territory has many oil and gas wells) and illegal drug cases. The office also assisted other field offices in several major cases. One involved the murder of federal judge Howland Wood, Jr. in San Antonio, Texas\u2014code-named WOODMUR. Kansas City agents gathered critical evidence in the investigation, including information passed at Leavenworth Penitentiary about the murder-for-hire plot. In 1995, after Timothy McVeigh blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City, the axle of his explosives-laden Ryder truck was found in the rubble and linked a Kansas body shop. Within hours of the bombing, Kansas City agents were interviewing body shop employees, who helped develop a composite picture that led to the identification of McVeigh as the one who rented the truck.\n\nThe field office also played an integral role in the STRAWMAN case, a Las Vegas Division investigation that probed Mafia control in the Nevada gaming industry. Wiretaps contributed significant evidence of a large-scale conspiracy by mob families in Kansas City and three other major cities, and the investigation uncovered several murder plots. Eleven individuals, including members of the Civella family, were indicted in 1981. This mob family was also investigated in RAQNET, a large stolen property ring case. At its conclusion, 22 criminals were identified, and $250,000 in stolen property was recovered.\n\nIn the 1980s, Kansas City and five other divisions launched teams to investigate white-collar crime nationwide. (Kansas had the highest rate of bank failures of any state in 1980.) In one case, agents discovered that an out-of-state brokerage firm\u2014First United Fund (FUF)\u2014was obtaining money from insurance agencies on a bid basis. In a \u201clinked financing\u201d scheme, FUF placed certificates of deposit into financial institutions that made loans to FUF friends and associates. The associates filed fraudulent financial statements to secure the loans and then defaulted on them. Insurance agencies conned in this scam had to pay off the loans and other financial instruments involved. Several Kansas banks using FUF failed, and losses reached $24 million. The case was complicated because of the widespread distribution and complexity of the financial records, but Kansas City\u2019s investigation ended with many indictments and guilty pleas.\n\nVehicle theft was another issue for the division. In the early 1990s, for example, truck and tractor theft tripled in Kansas City\u2019s territory. The division responded with two undercover operations. In SOKIT, agents determined that criminals were salvaging vehicle identification numbers, retagging stolen autos, and then selling the cars out of state. In HAMMERJACK, agents dismantled chop shops and gangs stealing trucks and tractors. Kansas City agents faced significant danger in this undercover work; for instance, while they infiltrated these criminal enterprises, one of its members was violently murdered and others began suspecting the true identities of the agents.\n\nIn 1985, the Hostage Rescue and SWAT teams of the Kansas City and Little Rock Divisions helped negotiate the peaceful surrender of a heavily-armed, white supremacist group known as the Covenant Sword and Arm of the Lord (CSA). The FBI began to close in on the group\u2014which was founded in southern Missouri and had set up camp there and in northern Arkansas\u2014after it started targeting law enforcement and killed a Missouri state trooper. The FBI\u2019s teams set up roadblocks and contacted CSA leader James Ellison. After two days of negotiation, Ellison surrendered with two dangerous fugitives. FBI and other federal agents searched the camp, not knowing if other dangerous persons were hiding out there. They located 150 guns, 40 hand grenades, land mines, a live anti-tank rocket, and other explosives. Stolen vehicles used in a 1984 robbery of a Brinks armored car in Ukiah, California were recovered as well.\n\nFBI Kansas City also began building partnerships through training and task forces. Working with the Kansas City Police Department, the office launched the first teleconference to train law enforcement in 1986, with some 1,500 officers in 50 locations taking part. During the 1990s, it formed the multi-agency Wichita/Sedgewick County and Topeka/Shawnee County Violent Crime/Gang Task Forces in Kansas, resulting in a number of investigative accomplishments."}, {"url": "https://www.saintlukeskc.org/history", "page_content": "In 1882, Saint Luke\u2019s was a small hospital serving a frontier trading town. Today, we are an integrated system of 14 hospitals and campuses with more than 12,000 employees caring for a metropolitan area of two million people, and our service area spans 67 counties in Missouri and Kansas.\n\nAs Kansas City\u2019s only locally-owned, not-for-profit health system, we\u2019re proud of our faith-based heritage, which we believe sets us apart. We are honored to be continually recognized for our commitment to quality, compassionate care.\n\nThe first 100 years\n\nThe predecessor to today\u2019s Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital of Kansas City was founded by an Episcopal priest, the Rev. Henry David Jardine. He convened a meeting of Kansas City businessmen in a small wooden church on July 7, 1882, to discuss a citywide need for better hospital care.\n\nThis new hospital operated for about 11 years. It closed for a year and then reopened as Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital of Kansas City. One of the three incorporators of the revived hospital was the first bishop of the new Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri , the Right Rev. Edward Atwill, who assumed sponsorship of Saint Luke\u2019s. Today, the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri maintains that oversight, with the bishop serving as chairman of Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nEven in Saint Luke\u2019s early days, the provision of charity care and mission-driven care were important, as was a commitment to providing medical education.\n\nFrom the beginning, Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital was designated as a teaching hospital, instructing medical students how to diagnose and treat disease. Saint Luke\u2019s College of Health Sciences, founded in 1903 to provide nursing education, has taught more than 3,500 nurses.\n\nIn 1990, Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital officially became a primary teaching hospital of the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City School of Medicine.\n\nInnovative care\n\nIn the early 1970s, Saint Luke\u2019s leaders were among the first in the country to recognize the importance of disease-specific care in which resources, people, and technology are aligned to diagnose and treat complex organ system dysfunction. As a result, they established the nation\u2019s first heart hospital, Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute.\n\nToday, the Heart Institute is nationally recognized for its work in the non-surgical treatment of heart disease, its outcomes research, and its organ transplantation program. Following this model, Saint Luke\u2019s created additional specialty medical facilities, including Saint Luke\u2019s Marion Bloch Neuroscience Institute , a national leader in the reversal of ischemic strokes; Saint Luke\u2019s Cancer Institute; and centers that cater to women\u2019s and children\u2019s specific medical needs.\n\nGrowing with the Kansas City region\n\nFor its first 107 years, Saint Luke\u2019s comprised just one health care facility. That changed in 1989 with the construction of Saint Luke\u2019s North Hospital\u2014Barry Road and our acquisition of Spelman Memorial Hospital, now Saint Luke's North Hospital\u2014Smithville, in the northern part of Kansas City.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s metropolitan presence continued to expand with the opening of Saint Luke\u2019s South Hospital in 1998 and Saint Luke\u2019s East Hospital in 2006.\n\nSaint Luke\u2019s Hospital of Kansas City\u2019s Crittenton Children\u2019s Center, which cares for the emotional health of children and families, officially joined the health system in 1992.\n\nSaint Luke\u2019s Health System expanded outside the Kansas City area with the addition of Wright Memorial Hospital in Trenton, Missouri, in 1994 and Anderson County Hospital in Garnett, Kansas, in 1995. Hedrick Medical Center in Chillicothe, Missouri, joined Saint Luke's in 2003.\n\nIn 2016, Bishop Spencer Place, a life plan senior living community in the heart of Kansas City, became part of the Saint Luke\u2019s family. In 2020, Allen County Regional Hospital in Iola, Kansas, was added.\n\nSaint Luke\u2019s Health System today\n\nThe health system\u2019s outstanding clinical outcomes, reputation for exceptional customer service, dedication to research and innovation, and state-of-the-art facilities and technology reflect our vision of being \u201cthe best place to get care, the best place to give care.\u201d\n\nSaint Luke\u2019s commitment to education is more robust than ever. We support accredited training programs in all major physician specialties and in chaplaincy, nursing, laboratory, radiology, and respiratory. Saint Luke\u2019s also supports numerous graduate, post-graduate, and continuing medical education programs; endowed teaching positions; and clinical research programs.\n\nDespite major medical advances, incredible growth, and international acclaim for its clinical outcomes, a few things remain the same today: Saint Luke\u2019s is proud to continue its tradition of providing high-quality, leading-edge, compassionate care, and its faith-based heritage.\n\nFind a Saint Luke's location near you."}, {"url": "https://fsg.com/history-of-kansas-city-heart-of-america/", "page_content": "This month\u2019s FSG branch focus takes us to Kansas City.

So we\u2019re not picking Super Bowl winners this week.\n\nKansas City lies very near the geographic center of the United States, at the confluence of the nation\u2019s longest river, the Missouri River, and the Kansas River.\n\nIn 1915, the city adopted the official slogan \u201cHeart of America\u201d. While that might still be true, it should be noted that at various other times Kansas City has also been known as \u201cThe City of Fountains\u201d. Residents have been known to make the claim that Kansas City boasts more fountains than even Rome in Italy, although Rome city officials have not yet officially replied to requests for comment.\n\nLooking Back at the History of Kansas City\n\nIn the early 1800s, the frontier outpost that would later grow to become the metropolitan area known today as Kansas City was valued for its strategic location more than for any particular industry or offering.\n\nAt that time, fur trappers from St. Louis took advantage of the junction of the Kansas and Missouri rivers to set up shop, trading with Native Americans in a location that offered several options for easy ingress and speedy egress.\n\nIn 1838, \u201cTown of Kansas\u201d Missouri was officially founded on the east shore of the Kansas River, just south of where it flows into the Missouri River, and quickly became the most important and established city west of St. Louis.\n\nUnknown author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nWith the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Santa Fe Trail all beginning just on the outskirts of town, the city\u2019s role in the ongoing westward expansion of the United States was firmly established, and the Town of Kansas was growing fast.\n\nOn June 3, 1850, Jackson County Missouri officially incorporated the Town of Kansas, giving the 1,500 residents there a solid dose of civic pride. That civic pride was goosed again on March 28, 1853, when the state of Missouri officially incorporated the city with a slightly grander name, \u201cCity of Kansas\u201d.\n\nThe Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854\n\nThe next ten years would prove to be very difficult for the City of Kansas residents. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 would officially name the land across the river \u201cKansas\u201d, and the American Civil War would find Missouri and Kansas involved in early and tragic fighting that would shade life in the region for generations.\n\nJohn Barber, and Henry Howe, Public domain, via Wikimedia Common\n\nIn 1865, the Missouri Pacific railroad was extended to the City of Kansas. Two years later, in 1867, work began on the Hannibal Bridge, the first permanent rail crossing of the Missouri River. With the opening of the bridge in 1869, the City of Kansas was off and running, and its population would quadruple over the next 50 years.\n\nAnother significant growth factor for the City of Kansas involved the world-famous Kansas City Stockyards.\n\nWith the city\u2019s thriving stockyards and its ever-expanding importance to the nation\u2019s rail system, the local economy boomed. The explosive growth of both the cattle industry and the national rail system saw the city grow to be the #2 busiest rail hub in the country, right behind Chicago.\n\nBy 1889, the residents of the City of Kansas had had enough. They officially changed the city name to Kansas City.\n\nLife was good, the city was growing, Kansas City steaks were a treat folks traveled long distances to enjoy, and all around town beautiful fountains were being installed.\n\nThe 1900s saw more growth, more industry, more fountains, and a long stream of colorful characters and important industries that would leave their mark on the city.\n\nFor a time, a young cartoonist named Walt Disney set up shop in Kansas City, as did a young shop owner named Harry Truman. Aviation giants Charles Lindbergh and Howard Hughes helped bring TWA to Kansas City, where it quickly became the most important hub of air travel in the country.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the Kansas City metropolitan area was still growing, with a population that would exceed 2 million by 2010.\n\nUnknown photographer, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nOver the past several years, the list of the city\u2019s important milestones and achievements has continued to grow, as Kansas City has worked to build upon the lessons of the past, to maintain its impressive network of fountains, and to lay the groundwork for brighter days to come.\n\nOh, and the Chiefs drafted Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBuilding, Expanding, Renovating, and Growing\n\nRecent years have seen a construction boom taking place in Kansas City. In 2018, the online publication Electrical Wholesaling released a ranking of the busiest commercial construction markets in the U.S. that showed Kansas City ranked #14.\n\nMore importantly, the percentage of change in the commercial construction market between 2017 and 2018 was a whopping 52%, with only Boston reporting higher numbers for that important trend indicator.\n\nThe Kansas City Area Development Council provides even more good news in a 2020 report that points to strong industrial growth across the metropolitan area.\n\nThe same factors that made Kansas City an attractive location back in the 1830s are still a strong selling point for developers in 2021.

Kansas was established in 1838, and a trail connecting the river landing to the Santa Fe Trail was established in Westport. Several years later, commercial structures began to spring up along the river\u2019s cliffs. Because Missouri was a slave state and Kansas was a free state, the years leading up to the Civil War were volatile and deadly in Kansas City.\n\nThe Battle of Westport took place in what is now Loose Park and Forest Hill Cemetery, and was one of the bloodiest fights west of the Mississippi. The city remained split as the Union won. Northerners tended to dwell on Main Street\u2019s west side on streets like Pennsylvania, Broadway, and Washington, while Southerners chose to live on the east side on streets like Oak, Walnut, and Locust. A downtown street grid had been created by 1870.\n\nCow Town and the Early Years:\n\nAfter the Civil War, the city\u2019s population grew dramatically as a result of the completion of several railways and the first bridge across the Missouri River. As the population grew, so did downtown development, and the wealthy constructed their mansions atop Quality Hill. The City Market at 4th and Walnut was the hub of commerce and where people met to purchase and sell products, whereas the West Bottoms was the epicenter of the booming cattle business, complete with stockyards, warehouses, and packing houses.\n\nProsperity and Building Boom:\n\nAfter the Civil War, a number of railways and the first bridge across the Missouri River were erected, and the city\u2019s population grew dramatically. With greater population came downtown development, and the affluent constructed their mansions on Quality Hill. The City Market at 4th and Walnut was the hub of trade and where people met to buy and sell products, whereas the West Bottoms was the center of the booming cattle business, with stockyards, warehouses, and packing houses.\n\nSeveral modern skyscrapers were built in 1906, including the R.A. Long Building at 10th and Grand, the Scarritt Building at 8th and Grand, and the Commerce Bank at 10th and Walnut. Electricity was honored in 1907 with the opening of Electric Park, a huge amusement park at 47th and Paseo. The city grew south of 77th Street in 1909, resulting in a slew of new houses, businesses, roadways, and boulevards.\n\nThe Kansas City Zoo opened in Swope Park the same year, and the Boley Building, designed by Louis Curtiss, had the first \u201ccurtain wall\u201d design. With more space to spread out, many working-class residents relocated to residential districts mostly consisting of bungalows and modest four-square houses accessible by cable car. J.C. Nichols created the County Club District south of Brush Creek for more affluent residents and was constructing shopping malls to serve these midtown residential subdivisions."}], "Rich Williams is the only original member still with Kansas.": [{"url": "https://vintagerock.com/the-rich-williams-interview-2023/", "page_content": "By Ralph Greco, Jr.\n\nPhotos by Ron Lyon\n\nRich Williams has been the long-standing guitarist in Kansas since the band\u2019s formation in 1973. Along with drummer Phil Ehart, the only other original member still onboard, he is about to hit the road for the Kansas 50th Anniversary Tour \u2013 Another Fork In The Road.\n\nReleasing both studio and live albums across the past few years, the band has resumed touring in earnest post-COVID-19. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any stopping the affable Mr. Williams and his band, no matter if he\u2019s wearing overalls or a tux on stage.\n\n~\n\nI wanted to start right there: Is there ever going to be another Native Window album? I love that record.\n\nI really doubt it. That album was born out of the frustration of not recording. Steve (Walsh, original Kansas vocalist and keyboardist)didn\u2019t want to record any new material. And we were frustrated, the rest of us. So, we said, well, let\u2019s just do something else, right? And, of course, we can\u2019t. We can\u2019t be us. So, we took a left turn just to scratch an itch. Get the creative edge going. That was its purpose. It wasn\u2019t to be a departure, a Plan B., another touring entity. It was just simply being creative for a change because we hadn\u2019t been, in that way, for a while.\n\nSo, can one extrapolate from that presently, touring, and making music with Kansas, you\u2019re scratching this itch?\n\nOh absolutely. We\u2019re talking about doing a new album, but we\u2019ve got so many things going on at the moment. We put out the last two studio albums (2016\u2019s The Prelude Implicit and the 2020\u2019s The Absence Of Presence, and we\u2019d like to do another one. The Another Fork In The Road \u2013 50 Years of Kansas set has just come out, and we are touring that which will go into next year, and I\u2019m sure we will more than likely extend beyond the fifty dates. We\u2019re just; we\u2019re busy, you know? The live album came out recently (2017\u2019s Leftoverture Live & Beyond), so there\u2019s been a lot of creativity going on. So yeah, we were scratching the itch constantly.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to think about how long you guys have been doing this and how well.\n\nIt\u2019s so fun. It\u2019s not like, \u201cOh crap, we\u2019ve got to do a record. What are we gonna do? I don\u2019t wanna do that.\u201d No, it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, here\u2019s the next tour, the next record, what are we gonna do?\u201d Plans change, things move constantly; it\u2019s an ongoing process. We rehearse in the dressing room every night for at least an hour before we go on. And a lot of times, you know, we come up with something brand new. Somebody will play something, and it\u2019s like, \u201cTell me, what was that? Play that again,\u201d and we\u2019ll record it, a spark of an idea for a song in the future. Getting ready for sound check, Tom (Brislin, Kansas keyboardist) will play something. I\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat? What did you play?\u201d And so that process of creating is ongoing, and it\u2019s easy when you know the whole team is into it.\n\nI\u2019m always interested when a band has a big catalog like you guys, and you\u2019re on the road a lot. Beyond featuring an entire album like you sometimes do, how do you pick what songs to play?\n\nWell, there\u2019s, you know, half the set list has already chiseled itself; we know the songs we really need to be playing. So, then it\u2019s just a matter of, you know, maybe we\u2019ve kind of beaten this one to death, let\u2019s put it on the shelf for a while. Or, we haven\u2019t played this in a while. Of course, it\u2019s still in flux, but I think as of yesterday, we\u2019ve finalized the setlist. Of course, as soon as I say that, it\u2019s going to change, right? (laughs) And then the Another Fork in the Road \u2013 50 Years of Kansas kind of dictates a direction as well.\n\nI figured that is what you would be led by.\n\nYeah, we represent each album in the live set as we are, but we noticed yesterday we completely left an album off. So, we take one out because we got too many of those and add in another. So, it\u2019s an ongoing process, making the decisions for us that make sense on a 50th anniversary tour.\n\nSo, any surprises this time around when you went back to a song that you hadn\u2019t played in a long time, and you went, \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m really having a good time playing that tune!\u201d\n\nWell, we haven\u2019t played these live yet, only in rehearsal. Everybody\u2019s doing homework and relearning songs. And I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag, what some of these songs are, but there was one. My wife and I just had a deck put on our house. We got some speakers out there, so we just put Kansas on randomly, and this song came on, and it\u2019s like, I haven\u2019t heard that in a long time. \u2018Oh man, that\u2019s one of my favorite songs. I love the lead I am playing there.\u2019 So that\u2019s one that was added to the list, and I\u2019m really looking forward to performing that song that hasn\u2019t been done in twenty years, and we have two songs we haven\u2019t played for forty-five years. So, it\u2019s been that kind of a thing, and that is very exciting. It\u2019s kind of like opening Christmas presents that you forgot to open a long time ago.\n\nCertainly, as Kansas has changed and morphed over the years, the onus of you as a guitar player shifts as you are sometimes a single player, then there are other guys playing guitar as well with you. How is it different from years ago when you approach playing these days?\n\nWell, yes, there are some spots, yeah, where it is just me. But then, David Ragsdale (Kansas violinist) is a very good guitarist, and we often are playing together. In a song like \u201cIcarus\u201d for instance, he has to go back and forth from guitar to violin, so that song keeps him busy because he is on off on, off on. But often these days, when I want the sound of two guitars, the technology allows me to create it on stage by just stepping on the right button.\n\nYou mention David Ragsdale, and that makes me think of Robbie Steinhardt and his last solo album and the fact that he passed in 2021. Had you spoken to him in a long time? Were you still friends?\n\nWe\u2019re still friends with everybody, all the previous members. Robbie, bless him, always marched to the beat of his own drummer, and even though he was out of the band for a while, when we\u2019d play close to his hometown, he\u2019d come up and do a few numbers with us. I\u2019m not sure who the company or the guys were that got him involved with the solo album. They do a lot of projects like this where they put a lot of material together, and then they bring someone in to do it. They did a great job.\n\nOh yeah, definitely, Not In Kansas Anymore is a very good album.\n\nYeah, I think so. And I had heard that he had plans to go out and tour it. The project wasn\u2019t put together as a band, so he would have had to assemble one. But, of course, that never came to fruition. But Robbie was a dreamer, always had lots of big dreams. And he loved being a rock star, had the old problem with not always showing up on time; he was always the one we\u2019d have to find. That\u2019s the way it was with him from day one. There\u2019s an old band picture; we\u2019re walking down a country road back in Kansas. Five of us are on one side, and Robbie\u2019s on the other, and we\u2019re all walking toward the camera. That really tells the story of Robbie; he was a part of it, but yeah, a step or two away.\n\nDo you find that the other members who come and go defer to you because you and Phil are the long-standing original members?\n\nSomewhere, within the whole process of being in a band, between original members and the newer guys, there is a difference. But that\u2019s not something we project, and it\u2019s not one we demand. It just simply is. It makes a little bit of difference somewhere, I\u2019m sure, but we do our best\u2026I mean, everybody has an equal voice. Like when Tom Brislin joined the band. He\u2019s always been a side man, but we were very direct with him, saying we\u2019re not looking for a side man. You\u2019re not going to be a sideman with us; we want a band member. And he was like, \u201cCan I submit material I\u2019ve written, you know, is that allowable?\u201d And we were like, of course, we wanted him to do that. So, everybody knows they have an equal voice and, you know, rehearsals and working on material, etcetera, ideas. It\u2019s never a situation where it\u2019s don\u2019t say that to the boss. That\u2019s not a healthy dynamic. By method or just by default, Phil and I are the original guys, but that\u2019s no fault of the other guys.\n\nCan you pick a period or an album that you\u2019d say, \u201cMan, that was when we were firing on all pistons?\u201d A time or album when you really felt Kansas had come into its own?\n\nIt happens kind of along the way with a lot of things beyond the original band, even. Something that is always kind of shocking to me is to go back to watch us playing Don Kirshner\u2019s rock concert. We had basically just finished the first album, and suddenly we\u2019re thrust from where we hadn\u2019t really started touring at all yet, and Don Kirshner\u2019s Rock Concert is new. We\u2019re thrust upon the stage, right? And they fill the house with all these people and there\u2019s cameras on stage, there\u2019s cameras everywhere. And they have us just start! I mean, we flew in, it\u2019s like we\u2019re gonna be using a backline, but I said, I\u2019m bringing my guitar, bringing my Marshall head. I didn\u2019t even have a case for it. I can still see it rolling down the conveyor belt; it just had a luggage tag on it. And although you\u2019d never know it, we were scared shitless.\n\nAnd it\u2019s live. That\u2019s the thing lots of people don\u2019t understand. Acts people played live on that show.\n\nYeah, well, and of course, you know, when I watch it that now it\u2019s like, \u201cMy God, what a great band.\u201d\n\nOh, yeah, you guys were smoking. Really great.\n\nYeah, but I remember what it felt like and how terrified we all were. I remember there was a camera two feet from Kerry\u2019s hands as he is soling. We were all so terrified, but it doesn\u2019t come off that way. We had been playing in bars, night after night after night. We were tight. We knew the material, played it inside out right so we could play through our fear. And I see that performance, and I think we really never knew what we had.\n\nI know you are aware of how Kansas is one of a rare breed of American progressive bands growing into its own at a time where most of the progressive sound was coming from the U.K. You are even a rarer breed in the unprecedented success you had.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s always a lot of luck involved, right? And a lot of tenacity involved. And as in anything in the music business, it really required all those elements. The first album did well, the second a little better, the third better than that. But you know Don Kirshner\u2019s (Kansas was signed to Kirshner\u2019s label) coffers were bleeding pretty heavily from supporting three records. I mean, he was a great benefactor, but at that time, the question was, how long can he keep it going? Keep taking it the shorts before he says, \u2018Guys, \u2018m. I\u2019m done.\u2019 So Leftoverture was a crucial album, and the last song to arrive as we\u2019re working material was \u201cWayward Son.\u201d And that song just exploded; I mean, it changed everything.\n\nExploding to this day where it had a crazy second life on the show Supernatural.\n\nOh yeah, the biggest thing that that\u2019s done is give our career a second explosion. We were starting to notice all these young kids are in the front row. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I\u2019d say all the time, \u201cWhy are you here? How do you know about us?\u201d\n\nYou knew they had used the song, right?\n\nSure, but I wasn\u2019t familiar with the show. I don\u2019t really watch a lot of just whatever\u2019s on television. And we were not that aware of what it was because it wasn\u2019t the official theme song; it\u2019s the unofficial one. And probably, I don\u2019t know, about maybe ten years ago, we started becoming aware of this. And that show had a 15-year run. International, too. Now those fifteen-year-old kids are in their thirties, and along the way, they have discovered our entire catalog. We added a whole generation or two. And we\u2019re still getting younger kids that are watching Supernatural in reruns for the first time. So that\u2019s been tremendous.\n\nAnd then there was the famous Comic-Con performance around the show.\n\nIt was so cool and yes, from the enormous popularity of that show that they had us play there. They spent a fortune on this, on their presentation, and it started with us. They roll the scene in the show of the guys sitting in their car talking to this room of a couple thousand people. There\u2019s screams all the way around. The excitement is building, the room was insane, and we\u2019re watching from 360 degrees right there on stage, and they play the scene, then there\u2019s this big explosion, and we start \u201cWayward Son.\u201d The crowd went insane. And meeting the guys from the show, hanging out. They were two of the most humbled, centered human beings I\u2019ve ever met. Such great guys; you would never guess they were some of the biggest stars.\n\nAnd the Kansas relationship with Supernatural was to have a coda.\n\nYes, we had such a good relationship with them that they wrote us into the final episode. It was going to be some kind of coming together of all the characters, and I\u2019m not sure what the storyline was, but we were supposed to be playing in a bar on the show. And we were headed to the airport to fly up to film, had just finished that leg of our tour of the whole West Coast, and we were told to turn around because Canada had just closed its borders because of COVID. So, we went home and then Oregon, Washington, and California all that day and the next day closed. Then more in a couple of weeks. So, after a while, when they got back to filming, they did a rewrite, and we weren\u2019t in it, unfortunately.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s more; it doesn\u2019t end there, right?\n\nRight. The show was still something we wanted to do; it felt incomplete that we never got the chance to film. So, then there\u2019s this show Walker, a take-off of Walker, Texas Ranger (starring Jared Padalecki, who also starred in Supernatural), and we were playing in Austin, and word came down if we\u2019d like to do a Walker. We had maintained a good relationship with the people involved, so since we were performing in Austin that night, the next afternoon, we shot a Walker, where we were the entertainment for what was supposed to be a Texas Rangers\u2019 convention. So, we got to be with the guys again.\n\nBeing in it as long as you guys have, and then COVID and all that stuff, you still seem to be surfing the business rather well, a business that has drastically changed so much in the last few years.\n\nWell, as far as 2022 was concerned, last year was a pretty normal year. And this year will be, knock on wood barns, barring some new strain or something. I\u2019m not gonna worry about the what-ifs. The way things are right now, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a fantastic year. And I\u2019m just gonna go with that. But the music business, um, from a business standpoint, sucks.\n\nGoing back to Native Window, the reason to make an album for us now is to scratch that itch. Back in the late seventies and eighties, to put out a record and go gold was extremely common; now, it\u2019s an extreme rarity. Only a certain small, thin portion of the pop people of the day really achieve the big goals now. And that has nothing to do with us and hasn\u2019t since the mid-80s. We\u2019ve been out of that market forever. And so, we really don\u2019t concern ourselves with that part of it. But there is still that need to create, to be relevant, to be still creative, even if it\u2019s only for us. And we also have many fans out there who would like to hear new stuff from us.\n\nAbsolutely, me personally.\n\nSo, it\u2019s also to satisfy them, to bring, to provide them with something new, to fulfill their curiosity of where we go next. And since there\u2019s no pressure in it, we can continue that process when we want.\n\nWe covered a lot of ground, and when I told your PR person I was a big fan and knew if left to my own devices, I could talk your ear off. I have one last one a buddy of mine dared me to ask. It\u2019s a sartorial question that has to do with stage costumes.\n\nOK, go ahead (laughs).\n\nLet\u2019s go back a bit if you could remember\u2026\n\nYeah?\n\nTell me about wearing a tux on stage.\n\nI don\u2019t really know exactly what my thought was at the time. When we started out, you know, I\u2019m wearing overalls.\n\nYes. I remember those. That\u2019s why it always struck me \u2014 from overalls to a tux?\n\nPeople misinterpreted the overalls. Thinking, \u201cOh, he must have been a farmer. He\u2019s from Kansas. He rolled the tractor to band practice.\u201d I grew up in an upper middle-class family and a very nice home. The only time I was on a farm was when I visited the farm in England where my mother was born, OK? There\u2019s not a farmer bone in my body.\n\nBut you know, in the late 60s and stuff, the hippie movement, people were wearing overalls, and that was just what I was wearing. They were comfortable. I wasn\u2019t planning to pick peas. I\u2019d tie them with rubber bands, dunk them in bleach, make some tie-dye on them. Whatever, it was just a fashion statement, nonconformity. But then I thought, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll wear a tux, just go the other way, right?\u201d So, I did that for a while, but then suddenly everybody, you know, suddenly Kerry\u2019s wearing a karate kimono. Steve is jumping around in a little Adidas outfit. Then Robbie was in his T-shirts, a real non-conformist in all respects. I think he had, like, a thousand T-shirts in his closet.\n\nI cringe when I look back at some of that stuff. Remember, we were from the middle of Kansas; there was no fashion people, you know, the record company didn\u2019t bring somebody in and tell us we had to work on what we wore. We were left to our own devices. And it\u2019s funny now, but we, I mean, we thought we looked cool at the time, but now I look at it and think, we really did look like freaking dorks.\n\nNever dorks to me and always fantastic musicians and a great band. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\n\nYou too. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/features/richard-williams-not-to-sound-pompous-but-kansas-pretty-much-gave-birth-to-american-prog-bands", "page_content": "Mention the band Kansas to the average listener, and he or she will instantly name two classic rock staples: Carry On Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind.\n\n\u201cOh, sure, those are the big ones,\u201d says guitarist Richard Williams, who co-founded the progressive rock outfit back in 1970. \u201cI could let it get to me and go, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a whole body of work,\u2019 but that would be a waste of time. Those are the songs that brought us to the table. Without Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind, we wouldn\u2019t be around today.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls how in 1976, with the band deep in debt to their record label and facing an uncertain future after their first three albums (Kansas, Song for America and Masque) stiffed, they approached the recording of their fourth album, Leftoverture, with a sense of impending doom.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty dark time. We were bleeding money pretty seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were signed to Kirshner Records, and our benefactor, Don Kirshner, could have easily said, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s been fun, but you need to find another record company.\u2019 We needed a hit, and thank goodness we came up with Carry On Wayward Son. It saved us so we could go on. And then we had Dust in the Wind. Those songs exploded and our worlds changed forever.\u201d\n\nKansas were in a unique position in the mid Seventies. Not only did they represent the last trace of progressive rock on AM playlists that were suddenly ruled by disco, but they were also one of the very few purveyors of American prog, period.\n\n\u201cNot to sound pompous, but we pretty much gave birth to American prog bands,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is, we did it pretty sneakily. We were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d slip in one of our own tunes and tell the crowd that we were playing the B-side of Smoke on the Water. We\u2019d stretch songs out and go crazy, and the people loved it. It became our thing.\u201d\n\nWe were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material\n\nOf the seven current members of Kansas, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original crew. Singer Steve Walsh, who ended his on-and-off association with the band in 2014, has been replaced by two co-lead vocalists, Billy Greer and Ronnie Platt, who double on bass and keyboards, respectively.\n\nWilliams\u2019 longtime guitar foil Kerry Livgren, who also served as Kansas\u2019 chief songwriter, split in 2000, and in his place is New Jersey picker Zak Rizvi.\n\n(Image credit: Paul Natkin/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like a different band sometimes because we\u2019ve got a bunch of newer faces,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut at the same time, it feels like the original band because we\u2019ve got seven guys who really love to perform and create. Back in the day, we let money and business get in the way. This bunch of guys just wants to make music.\u201d\n\nThe band has a new album out, 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence, and all told, it sounds like quintessential Kansas: there\u2019s muscular, epic prog-rockers like Throwing Mountains and the eight-minute-plus title track, symphonic power ballads such as Jets Overhead and Memories Down the Line, and there\u2019s even a \u201chow-over-the-top-can-we-go?\u201d instrumental in the form of Propulsion 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of always in a state of having to prove ourselves,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe had to do it on our last album, [2016\u2019s] The Prelude Implicit, because it was our first new music in 16 years, and I think this time we had to prove that we still mean it.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a laugh, then adds, \u201cI imagine on the next one, we\u2019ll have to do the same thing. That\u2019s OK \u2013 I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\nBefore the band got started, who were the guitar players that you were really listening to and emulating?\n\n\u201cI was copying anybody who was there. The Yardbirds were pretty big to me. My introduction to blues wasn\u2019t through the Americans; I dug the British guys. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton \u2013 Clapton\u2019s first solo album was like Guitar 101 to me.\n\n\u201cInstead of this twangy rhythmic instrument, suddenly here\u2019s this ballsy guitar with a guttural saxophone lead voice. Suddenly, I was hearing blues in a different way. Of course, I also loved Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck \u2013 those guys made a big impression on me. That stuff really formed the basis of my sound and style.\u201c\n\nGrowing up in Topeka, was it easy for you to get good guitars living where you were?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I had Marshall amps and Les Pauls. I had a Gibson ES-335, which I still have to this day. Everything that you could buy in Los Angeles you could buy in Topeka. When I was 15, I had a charge account at the local music store. If I wanted something, I\u2019d charge it and make weekly payments on it.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty cool time. When The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, Topeka exploded, just like every other town in the country. Everybody had to be in a band. There was a garage band on every block.\u201c\n\nKansas played covers in clubs for a few years. Do you remember when you first heard prog from England and when it started to influence the band?\n\n\u201cIt took a while. For a time it seemed as if only the two coasts were hearing the prog stuff. Gradually the stations in Kansas started playing it \u2013 I guess somebody\u2019s ears were tuned to it. We\u2019d be like, 'Wow, have you heard this band called ELP?' Or 'Have you heard Genesis\u2019 Selling England by the Pound?'\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to find all these new, creative ways of addressing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t even know if 'rock \u2018n\u2019 roll' was the correct term for that music.\u201c\n\nSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it... We cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different\n\nEven so, it didn\u2019t seem as if American bands were jumping on the prog bandwagon. You guys were outliers.\n\n\u201cSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it. I mean, we played Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels-type stuff; we cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different. I remember playing cover songs during our club days. You\u2019d get to a part and be like, 'Man, this song sucks. I hate the middle part.'\n\n\u201cSo we started thinking that we could do some sort of interlude at the beginning, or maybe we could play the song at half-time. We did anything to change it up and put some balls to the music. In hindsight, we were doing something very important: We were learning how to be us.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns)\n\nDid it seem as if playing throughout your home state was a dead end? Did the band consider relocating to one of the two coasts to get noticed?\n\n\u201cWell, what happened was, we made a demo tape, and that\u2019s what we sent out to the coasts. One of them wound up on Don Kirshner\u2019s desk. The people at Don\u2019s company loved it \u2013 they really dug the violin \u2013 and they sent a guy named Wally Gold to check us out.\n\n\u201cWe put together a show and did that old free-beer trick: 'Come to the show and the drinks are free.' So Wally showed up and the place was packed; everybody was drunk and partying. So Wally called Don and said, 'Man, there\u2019s something going on here. People are crawling through the windows to get in the place.' That sealed the deal. Next thing you know, we signed a deal with Don Kirshner and were making records.\u201c\n\nLeftoverture [1976] and Point of Know Return [1977] hit one after the other. After being hitless for several years, that must have felt remarkable.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still here today doing this because of that explosion. We didn\u2019t really know how huge it was at the time. We were just blue-collar guys from the Midwest. I remember arriving at Madison Square Garden in a limo with our manager, and he was going, 'Madison Square Garden! This is so big!'\n\n\u201dWe were like, 'Yeah, yeah, whatever.' We\u2019d been on the road for so long, so to us this was just a natural progression of more and more shows. Today I realize how big it was, but back then we didn\u2019t really see it.\u201d\n\nHow much of Carry On Wayward Son had Kerry written before the band got to dive into it? And how long did it take to work out that intricate guitar and keyboard solo section?\n\n\u201cThat was the last song we did for the album, on the final day or recording. Kerry came in and said he had a new song. We learned the structure of it and got to it. The version you hear on the record is probably the first time we ever played it correctly.\n\n\u201cThe solo thing didn\u2019t take long. My approach to guitar is just wing it. I didn\u2019t really have a planned solo. I just responded to what everybody else was doing and threw stuff out there. I was kind of like, 'I\u2019ll just play stuff. Let me know if it sounds right.'\u201c\n\nFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression\n\nThe acoustic guitar figure of Dust in the Wind is so recognizable. I understand that Kerry wrote it as a fingerpicking exercise.\n\n\u201cYeah, Kerry didn\u2019t write the song to write a song; he wrote this chord pattern to teach himself fingerstyle guitar. His wife thought it was a song, and he was like, 'No, this isn\u2019t Kansas. The band would never play this.' But he brought it in and we thought it was really nice.\n\n\u201cThe figure was there; it didn\u2019t have the middle section or the violin solo. But it came together fast. I remember when we were listening back to it, somebody said, 'That\u2019s the next single.' Kerry didn\u2019t think so, but the rest of us knew. And sure enough \u2013 boom. The track exploded on the radio.\u201c\n\nThe way you approached the solo section of Wayward Son \u2013 is that still the way you compose leads in the studio? I\u2019m thinking of the title track of the new album, which has a similar solo structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same. What happens is, somebody lays something down and everybody else plays off of it. It\u2019s very collaborative, but not as instant as it was back in the day. Somebody else\u2019s solo will dictate what you\u2019re going to do, and you take inspiration from what they\u2019ve done to go somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to do it that way. I\u2019ll lay down the foundation, and then Zak will play something; Tom will do a smoking keyboard part. Sometimes we redo our parts based on what somebody does.\u201c\n\nThe riff in the song Throwing Mountains sounds as tough and mean as early grunge. Did any of that stuff ever make an impression on you?\n\n\u201dNot really at first. I could appreciate the honesty of grunge. It\u2019s like, I loved The Beatles for their polish, but I loved The Rolling Stones for their rawness. You listen to Bob Dylan \u2013 his recordings are very elementary, but they\u2019re honest.\n\n\u201dFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression. So you mention grunge and that song, sure, I\u2019ll take that. It reminds me of how punk obliterated disco back in the day. Let\u2019s get back to being raw.\u201d\n\nHow are you enjoying playing live with Zak Rizvi?\n\n\u201dOh, I\u2019m loving it. Zak has a deep love and knowledge of the band. He\u2019s a tremendous engineer and guitarist \u2013 just brilliant musically. He\u2019s a real scholar of music. Playing with him and having him in the band is great. There isn\u2019t much he can\u2019t play. I mean, he played trombone in a symphony. I have a blast working with him.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Steve Morse during his time in the band?\n\n\u201dWhat an interesting guy! When he came in, he had just won every guitar award imaginable; they had to invent awards to give him. I\u2019ll be honest: I was a little intimidated at first, but I was pleased to find out that he\u2019s the least intimidating man around. He\u2019s fascinated by everything.\n\n\u201dWe would be on tour, and we would see some crappy band playing at a Holiday Inn or wherever. We would be like, 'Let\u2019s go. This band sucks.' But Steve would say, 'Did you see what that guitar player just did with his on/off switch?' The guitarist wasn\u2019t even that good, but Steve was learning from him anyway.\u201d\n\n\ufeffFor a while you played PRS guitars, but I understand you\u2019ve moved back to Les Pauls now.\n\n\u201dI still play PRS guitars occasionally, but I got my hands on a Les Paul that blew me away. It\u2019s one of the Lee Roy Parnell signature models \u2013 a reissue of the \u201957 Goldtop \u2013 and it\u2019s fabulous.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s got a support in the back of the headstock, so if it falls over it won\u2019t break, and the heel has a cutaway so you can get up the neck a lot easier. I run that through a Fractal Axe-Fx III and I\u2019m good to go. I used to have to spend hours getting tones. Now I can just dial in the sound, and boom \u2013 let\u2019s play.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://100percentrock.com/2023/05/interview-rich-williams-from-kansas-april-2023/", "page_content": "According to a recent press release: America\u2019s preeminent progressive rock band, KANSAS, will be touring 50 select North American cities to celebrate the band\u2019s 50th Anniversary. KANSAS 50th Anniversary Tour\u2013Another Fork in the Road will showcase music spanning all 50 years of the band\u2019s illustrious history. The tour will showcase two hours of hits, fan favorites, and deep cuts rarely performed live. In 1973, the \u201cgarage band\u201d from Topeka was discovered by Wally Gold, signed by Don Kirshner, and released their debut album in 1974. KANSAS has gone on to compile a catalogue that includes sixteen studio albums and five live albums. KANSAS has produced eight gold albums, three sextuple-Platinum albums (Leftoverture, Point of Know Return, Best of KANSAS), one platinum live album (Two for the Show), one quadruple-Platinum single \u201cCarry On Wayward Son,\u201d and another triple-Platinum single \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d Most recently, KANSAS has released two Billboard charting albums with 2016\u2019s The Prelude Implicit and 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence. KANSAS is currently comprised of original drummer Phil Ehart, bassist/vocalist Billy Greer, vocalist/keyboardist Ronnie Platt, violinist/guitarist David Ragsdale, keyboardist/vocalist Tom Brislin, and original guitarist Richard Williams. With no signs of slowing down, KANSAS continues to perform in front of large and enthusiastic audiences.\u201d We get original guitarist Rich Williams to discuss new music, old music, touring, and much more\u2026\n\nToddstar: Rich, thank you for taking time out. This is a very cool interview for me. Kansas is just one of those bands\u2026 you guys have been around 50 years and legends at this point, and I have original member Rich Williams on the line. So again, I appreciate your time.\n\nRich: Absolutely.\n\nToddstar: Let\u2019s talk about the exciting stuff that\u2019s going on right now. Kansas is about to kick off its 50th Anniversary Tour that has been dubbed Another Fork In The Road tour as well as a collection recently released of the same name. What can you tell us about this fork in the road for you 50 years in?\n\nRich: Well, it\u2019s familiar, I can say that. Today I\u2019m somewhere in Minnesota at a casino having lunch. Play here tonight, then go somewhere to North Dakota tomorrow to play another casino. The road doesn\u2019t change much, and it goes on forever. There\u2019s a lyric in there. It\u2019s still rental cars, airplanes, and hotel rooms. I guess the sameness of it makes time fly by. You start hitting mile markers like 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. All of a sudden, it does give you a chance to reflect, \u201cDamn, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time.\u201d You start talking about it and I get tired. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat else would I do? This is what I\u2019ve done my entire life.\u201d We hadn\u2019t seen each other, the band, since last week. We all jump in a van together and we had a pretty good ride to get to where we are. It\u2019s always a lot of fun, a lot of laughing, catching up, even if it\u2019s just been a week or two, just enjoy each other\u2019s company. Before the show, we practice a lot, kind of horse around, and by time we go on stage, everybody\u2019s loose and relaxed, gone through the material for the umpteenth time. It\u2019s just a routine that has become so normalized. I guess for a civilian it would seem different, but for me that is a normal day. It\u2019s very comforting and reassuring as we just go about the next Kansas day.\n\nToddstar: That makes sense. You\u2019ve been at this so long that there\u2019s not a ton of new experiences out there. There\u2019s just refreshing experiences.\n\nRich: What really lasts the most is the camaraderie of being with everyone. Everybody, band and crew, we\u2019re family. It\u2019s really running around the country with your friends and family playing music. It\u2019s a lifestyle that everyone is not cut out to do, but fortunately I was. This is my norm, is what we do. Whereas to someone else it would be very unusual. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do. It\u2019s another day in Kansasland really.\n\nToddstar: When you guys dropped Another Fork In The Road, a three-disc collection, you put out a new recorded version of \u201cCan I Tell You,\u201d keeping the spirit and the feel of the original but updating it for the vibe and sound of the new members of the latest incarnation of the band. What was it about that song that made that the right song to do for that instead of one of your bigger hits or something that you all might have deemed more of a gem?\n\nRich: When we first started writing material together, this was before Kansas, we were a band called White Clover. We were writing material and that was one of the first songs we wrote and recorded. Sending off the demo to some different companies, \u201cCan I Tell You\u201d was the song that Don Kirshner heard and liked and that\u2019s how we got our record deal. Without that song, we probably would never have gotten a record deal and there would be no Kansas. What a great full circle of 50 years is the song that brought us to the table to redo it for the end of a 50-year period, and that\u2019s why we did it. To present it with the band members today, it just made sense. It was pretty quick conversation with Phil and I, \u201cWe ought to do something, do a rerecord or something. Let\u2019s do \u201cCan I Tell You.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d That was how long that conversation took. We did it with modern technology. Tom Brislin, our keyboard player, who was the music director on it, coordinated it all. We did it all from home. I vetted all my guitar parts at home. Ronnie did all his vocals in Chicago. Billy did his vocals and stuff in Savannah. Ragsdale did his violin parts in Atlanta. The only thing we had to do live was the drum tracks. Phil went over to the studio that we use in Atlanta and laid down the drum tracks and laid them down to a click track from the original track so we could have the same tempo and same everything. That was an experiment. We had never approached a recording in that fashion before to see if we could do it remotely instead of actually in a studio together. It was a fun project. We did that and Tom put it all together and then we shipped that off to Chad Singer, who is our front house sound man, has been forever. He\u2019s engineered the last several live projects we\u2019ve done. There\u2019s nobody that knows better what we sound like than Chad does. We had him mix it and the album. There was a synchronicity to the whole thing that made perfect sense.\n\nToddstar: It doesn\u2019t sound sonically that much different from the original as far as the purpose and intention of the track. It sounds like classic Kansas, which you all have all been together long enough with Tom the newest member at 5 years. The core of you has been together a long time and gelling.\n\nRich: That was also intent. There were different ways we could go about it. We went about it from a classic or vintage classic or something mode that didn\u2019t make it sound super modern. We wanted to capture the time as well as possible, and we had three or four different versions of it to listen through and then make a choice, \u201cLet\u2019s take this one.\u201d\n\nToddstar: You are out on the road and playing to fans who have been there since day one and to fans who are children and grandchildren of those fans. What is it like to look out at the crowd and know that you\u2019ve created a legacy that will far surpass all of us in longevity?\n\nRich: The first feeling is gratitude that I get to do this, and I still get to do this. It\u2019s hard to explain. I am not, nor ever have I been, in awe of myself or my achievements in any way. When I stand back and look at what the band has done, I\u2019m very amazed, very pleased, and very proud of what the band and the legacy of what we have done is. For some reason I can separate the two. I\u2019m just glad to be here.\n\nToddstar: Looking at the last 50 years, if you could look back, Rich, and talk to yourself back in 1973 when you started this adventure not knowing what was going to happen, what piece of advice would you give yourself then?\n\nRich: More important than anything I would say what I would change, would be, \u201cLeave the booze alone.\u201d Stay away from that. I became an alcoholic. I was drinking a half gallon of vodka a day and I quit about 14 years ago. It grew to that. Nobody ever starts out with that as an end goal, but that\u2019s where I wound up. It was brutal, it about killed me. I about lost my position in the band with it all. What\u2019s funny is that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve missed a single thing by not being in a bar every night and all the nights I spent in bars, I can\u2019t think of anything of any worth that really ever happened. It was just a waste of time and money. I\u2019m a very grateful recovering alcoholic today, have been for a long time. That\u2019s what my main advice is. The rest of it I handled pretty well.\n\nToddstar: When you hit the stage like you\u2019re going to do tonight \u2013 I\u2019m extremely excited to know that I\u2019m going to get to witness the tour when it hits Detroit in the middle of June \u2013 what\u2019s the song that when you know it\u2019s coming in the set list still gets you excited?\n\nRich: It\u2019s usually something, either a new song or it\u2019s a song that we haven\u2019t played in a long time. There\u2019s going to be a few of those. In June when we begin the 50th anniversary tour, there are some old classics in there that people haven\u2019t heard in a long time and we haven\u2019t played in 40 years. We\u2019re having a lot of fun in the dressing room working on them, working them up, relearning them, and songs that fans have wanted to hear for a long time too. So, we\u2019re looking forward to that. That\u2019s the latest version. There have been times where there\u2019s songs I just got so tired of, I couldn\u2019t stand them anymore. I had to change my attitude because there\u2019s nothing wrong with the song, it was all about me. Rather than piss and moan about, \u201cOh God, we got to play that again tonight,\u201d I decided I\u2019m going to learn how to play it better. I\u2019m going to work on my sound while I\u2019m playing it and I\u2019m going fine tune it. I\u2019m going to play it cleaner, whatever I can to devote myself back to the song that I once loved, and it works. So, songs I was tired of, now I\u2019ve conditioned myself to actually like them again.\n\nToddstar: What\u2019s the one song that blew up that you just never thought stood a chance from the word go?\n\nRich: We\u2019ve never been really a hit machine, but we did find a few along the way. \u201cWayward Son,\u201d we knew right out of the box. We knew that. Sitting back, listening to the album mixed in the studio and listening to that song, we were convinced that we struck gold with that record. We just knew it. Then here comes the next album with Point of Know Return. When Kerry Livgren brought \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d in just a very rough form to rehearsals, on first listen, it was like, \u201cThat\u2019s our next single.\u201d He goes, \u201cWhat? You guys like this?\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s our next single.\u201d We knew on the first listen that we were going to be able to repeat what we had done with Leftoverture and Point of Know Return, and those two songs made our career.\n\nToddstar: Is that how you look back at it? That those are the songs that were the turning point and positioned you to be on the road 50 years later?\n\nRich: No. It was never a plan. Your perspective changes as the years go by. I was just remembering the other day, I was writing a story for a friend, or a family member, and in 1970 we played at The Warehouse in New Orleans, and this was me, Phil Ehart, Dave Hope, original Kansas members. We were playing in New Orleans for six months and a new place called The Warehouse opened up. After the show one night, a girl that was living with us brought Jerry Garcia over to the band house and we met him. I was 19 and suddenly sitting in the kitchen talking with us is Jerry Garcia. I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this guy is still doing this, man. He seems really, really into it. He\u2019s like the grandfather of rock and roll.\u201d He was 27 years old. It\u2019s all perspective. I\u2019m 73 now and there are no plans to stop. As the years go by, yeah, I guess the angle at which you look at things, that perspective changes slightly, but the desire to do it is really exactly the same thing. You\u2019re getting together with friends, writing and recording, and playing music together and traveling the world, having fun, and making a living at it. Of course, it\u2019s a surprise to make 50 years, but it\u2019s just been a day by day, hour by hour, step by step process that after extremely long walk, here we are.\n\nToddstar: That\u2019s a great perspective, Rich. I know you\u2019re busy and I want to let you get back to your lunch so you can wind down and get to what you need to do before tonight\u2019s show. I\u2019m looking forward to Detroit. I\u2019ve been dusting off some of my old albums and one that has always stayed in constant rotation for me is Vinyl Confessions. I was a teenager when that came out, but it\u2019s one that has stuck with me forever. I\u2019m very excited for this tour and everything else. Looking back, if you had to pick one album that you thought the minute it dropped, Rich, you knew it would stand the test of time among the Kansas catalog, what\u2019s the one release from top to bottom? Not a single, not a song, but what album do you think was so cohesive that it made Kansas what it is, and it represents you all?\n\nRich: Leftoverture, without a doubt. We were fortunate. Kirshner, he was our benefactor. He kept pouring money into us and while the first album got us out there, second album was well received. Song for America was again well received, but none of them had recouped yet. We\u2019ve always been varied. We do fast songs, slow songs, heavy songs, prog songs, life songs like \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d We do a bit of everything, so kind of all over the map.

Photo courtesy of Cindy Jacobs - Longfellow\n\nRichard Williams talks life with KANSAS\n\nBy Debbie Gardner\n\ndebbieg@thereminder.com\n\nIf you\u2019re a member of the band called KANSAS, there\u2019s one thing you can count on.\n\nYou tour.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not an effort. This is my chosen profession, something I chose to do,\u201d founding KANSAS\u2019s guitarist Richard Williams, explained when PRIME reached him on a stop in Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ve got 60 dates this year before I start recording. It\u2019s a dream.\u201d\n\nThe iconic rock group, Williams explained, is crisscrossing the country as it has nearly every year since the 1974 release of its self-titled first album, KANSAS. That initial road trip \u2013 and the countless ones that have followed \u2013 was and is about keeping the band name, and its music, connected with fans.\n\nThe songs have evolved, band members have come and gone, but one thing about KANSAS has never changed. These guys live to play for an audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve done for 41 years. We\u2019re a live band and the best part of it is going out and doing it,\u201d Williams said.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the music\n\nThis year\u2019s tour includes a stop in Springfield, Massachusetts on May 29 at the MassMutual Center Exhall stage with fellow \u201870s rock legend, Blue Oyster Cult.\n\nAsked for details about the stop, Williams was cagey about what songs fans might hear at the upcoming Springfield show.\n\n\u201c[KANSAS\u2019 original singer/songwriter] Steve Walsh retired last August, and with that we\u2019ve gone back into the vault and added five or six songs we haven\u2018t played in a long time,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun to go back, some of these songs we haven\u2019t played in 30 years.\u201d\n\nWilliams said this trip back into the band\u2019s archives is about more than bringing back some early cuts. It\u2019s a chance for the band to return to its musical roots.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done this time is go back to as close to the original arrangements as possible, they have mutated over the years, \u201c Williams explained. Yet though today\u2019s technology may make it easier to recreate the sounds of certain instruments \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ve come a million miles in 40 years,\u201d Williams noted \u2013 it hasn\u2019t changed the experience of performing for him or his band mates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still putting your heart in and playing the same notes\u201d when you get onstage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSomething like \u2018Dust in the Wind,\u2019 people say, \u2018how can you keep playing it [concert after concert]?\u2019\u2019 Williams continued. \u201cThe stage is dark, and I count the song out, and from the first note everybody in earshot knows the song and has a personal story [connected with it].\n\n\u201cI\u2019m caught up in that, not directing it \u2026 I\u2019m in that experience with [everyone]. That song is so much bigger than the band. It\u2019s a living, breathing experience in the room \u2026 I don\u2019t know too many people who get to do that,\u201d Williams explained.\n\n\u201cI hope that I never become so jaded that I wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. That would be awful,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2026 and the road\n\nStill, it\u2019s not every musician that can handle touring for so many years.\n\n\u201cYou have to make peace with the travel,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s late hours and early mornings and cancelled flights. I just somehow learned to make the best of it.\u201d\n\nPlaying with KANSAS, after all, has given him the chance to travel the world several times.\n\n\u201cI love to travel; my wife travels with me quite a bit now. It\u2019s a constant free vacation with a great bunch of guys,\u201d Williams said. \u201c[But] I get it, why someone might leave a band. He might not enjoy it. If I were miserable, it would be hell, this touring life.\u201d\n\nDespite cutting eight gold albums, three sextuplet platinum albums, one platinum live album, a million-selling gold single with \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d and spending 200 weeks on the billboard charts in the 1970s and 80s, the 1974 \u201cgarage band from Topeka\u201d inevitably fell apart, disbanding in 1984. One year later the band reformed without all of its original members.\n\nThose members have regrouped and drifted apart over the years; the last time four of the five original members performed together was at a special 2013 fan appreciation concert in Pennsylvania.\n\nToday, Williams and his high-school buddy, drummer Phil Ehart, are the only founding members of KANSAS who still play \u2013 and tour \u2013 with the band.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of changes along the way and Phil and I have become very adept at \u2018here comes the change\u2019 and taking the next thing and moving forward,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cChange is hard for anyone, but after awhile you get good at seeing the back side of it and you see the good. We move forward in a positive manner and it works for us,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s a great life\n\nWith KANSAS, Williams said, it\u2019s been about the music right from the beginning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d all played in different bands and played contemporary music [and] wanted to do our own thing, original stuff in our own manner,\u201d he said of the original founding five.\n\nEverything influenced them back then, he said, from the eclectic mix of music on the radio in the 1960s \u2013 \u201cBack in the day of old radio they played Wilson Pickett and the Supremes and the Rolling Stones followed by Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard, and dance music in the evenings\u201d \u2013 to the progressive rock sound of British bands like Yes, King Crimson and Jethro Tull played a hand in creating KANSAS\u2019 unique style.\n\n\u201c[We wanted] to do something a little bit outside the box, different time signatures, completely different chord structures, a different lyrical style,\u201d Williams said.\n\nTheir signature violin sound, he added, was the band\u2019s way of adding a \u201cvoice\u201d to their music, in much the same way Jethro Tull used a flute.\n\n\u201cWe decided on a particular structure for [the violin] and played those parts together, giving it more of a symphonic feel that the country approach or the string parts behind the Righteous Brothers,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a ride for a kid who, Williams said, saw The Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show and thought, \u201cGee, that\u2019s great, I want to do that \u201d and decided to make music his life.\n\nWho knew back then what a few guitar lessons and that first high school garage band with buddy Phil Ehart would lead to.\n\n\u201cYou start writing songs and you keep doing it and then you look back 41 years and think \u2018Wow, this is what happens when you are persistent and keep going,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cTo me this is great,\u201d he continued. \u201cI can\u2019t think of doing anything else.\u201d\n\nAnd Williams had one last comment about the band\u2019s stop in Springfield.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t disappoint,\u201d he said.\n\nTickets to the May 29 Kansas with Blue Oyster Cult concert at the Mass Mutual Center, Springfield, start at $27 and are on sale at all Ticketmaster outlets, charge by phone at 800.745.3000, at Ticketmaster.com or at the MassMutual Center Box Office.

He\u2019s one of the few among his bandmates to stick around since the early days, ensuring he crossed paths with dozens of incredible musicians over the decades. As it turns out, a particular music legend stuck out more than others.\n\nRich Williams called working with Steve Morse \u2018terrifying\u2019\n\nRich Williams | Scott Dudelson/Getty Images\n\nRenowned guitarist Steve Morse joined Kansas in the mid-\u201980s, which Williams recently admitted intimidated him. In an interview with Guitar World, he recalled what it was like working with the Morse on Power, the band\u2019s first album to feature them both.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started rehearsing in Phil [Ehart] \u2018s basement, I was sitting down with Steve, and he had just been awarded the best guitar player ever for the third year in a row and was now in the Hall of Fame. And here I am, in a room with him, and we\u2019re creating material together. For me, that was a terrifying experience until I got to know what Steve was like. He\u2019s the least threatening and intimidating guy you could ever meet. He\u2019s a guitar wizard.\u201d\n\nEven though Morse only played with the band for three years, his influence was profound.\n\nSteve Morse was always learning\n\nDespite being labeled the best guitarist in the world, Morse never stopped looking out for new techniques or strategies. In the same interview, Williams shared a story from when he toured with Morse and learned a valuable lesson from his bandmate.\n\n\u201cWe were on the road somewhere, had just done a show, and walked into the hotel lobby, and there was this crappy band playing in the lounge. I was about to make a joke about it when Steve turned to me and said, \u2018Did you see what the guitar player just did there?\u2019 It was something that the player did with his toggle switch. Steve said he had never seen anybody do it that way before. I thought, \u2018He is the best guitar player in the world, and he is still always learning.\u2019 He was looking for something that was different, like this kid did in that band. And I thought that, as a guitar player, it was such a great mindset to have.\u201d\n\nHappy Birthday Richard Williams!!\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit \u2013 Mark Schierholz pic.twitter.com/nse25DaAih \u2014 KANSAS (@KansasBand) February 1, 2023\n\nMusicians rotated in and out of Kansas\n\nOther than Williams and Ehart, the members of Kansas frequently changed since it first formed in the \u201970s. According to Musician Guide, most of the original members knew each other from high school. Don Montre, Kerry Livgren, Lynn Meredith, Dan Wright, Scott Kessler, and Zeke Lowe first performed as Saratoga before merging with White Clover.\n\nThey changed the band\u2019s name to Kansas when White Clover members Dave Hope and Phil Ehart joined. Unfortunately, the band\u2019s initial attempt wasn\u2019t successful. By 1971, Ehart, Hope, and others left to reform White Clover.\n\nThis pattern repeated several more times before Kansas maintained a consistent roster and released its self-titled debut album in 1974. The band had a cult following in the early days and reached true stardom after they released their fourth album Leftoverture in 1976. Fifty years later, they still tour regularly.\n\nRich Williams never imaged Kansas would still tour 50 years later\n\nEven though it\u2019s common for young people to dream big, Williams admitted he didn\u2019t think Kansas would still tour so many years later. In fact, he thought he would have bought a bar by now for him and his friends to jam at!\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of perpetually toured, but we never would have imagined we\u2019d get 50 years,\u201d he told Guitar World. \u201cWe thought we might get four or five good years, and then I would go back to Kansas and maybe buy a bar, have a little stage there, and play with my friends. But it just kept going.\u201d\n\nWhile owning a bar is a respectable backup plan, music lovers are grateful Kansas is still performing live!"}, {"url": "https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/entertainment/local/2020/02/23/theyre-not-kansas-anymore-think-again/1653728007/", "page_content": "Alan Sculley Correspondent\n\nKansas, on its face, is a very different band now than the group people knew in the 1970s, when the group rose to the top of the rock scene behind the multi-platinum albums \u201cLeftoverture\u201d and \u201cPoint of Know Return.\u201d\n\nBack then, the band\u2019s original lineup was still intact, with guitarist/keyboardist Kerry Livgren and singer/keyboardist Steve Walsh leading the way as the band\u2019s songwriters.\n\nBut to guitarist Rich Williams, Kansas today has in a very tangible way come full circle despite obvious differences between the current edition and the original.\n\nFor one thing, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original lineup that also featured Livgren, Walsh, bassist Dave Hope and violinist Robby Steinhardt. Now they are joined by Ronnie Platt (vocals) Billy Greer (bass), David Ragsdale (violin), Zak Rizvi (guitar) and Tom Brislin (keyboards).\n\nBut Williams sees an important parallel between where today\u2019s Kansas is and where the group was back in the early 1970s.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s similar to the early days of the original,\u201d he said in a recent phone interview. \u201cThe record business has changed now to where there is no money in it. So it gets us back to the original (thought of) we\u2019re not going to make any money making this record.\u201d\n\nInstead, the group, which formed in 1973 in Topeka, Kansas, is motivated by making albums, just as the original lineup was in the beginning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for fans and it makes us valid in what we\u2019re doing, not has-beens,\u201d Williams said of making new music. \u201cWe are still very creative. So since money is not really the object in it, and it wasn\u2019t when we first started either, it\u2019s the love of doing it (that\u2019s similar to the early years).\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Kansas is connecting to the original group in another way this year. To start out 2020, Kansas is resuming its tour celebrating the 1977 album \u201cPoint of Know Return,\u201d which with the help of the hit single \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d became a multi-platinum hit and was a satisfying follow-up to \u201cLeftoverture,\u201d the 1975 album that featured the hit \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d and gave Kansas its commercial breakthrough.\n\nTheir Point of Know Return Tour stops at Augusta\u2019s Miller Theater at 8 p.m. Friday, Feb. 28. Tickets are $44-$95 by calling (706) 842-4080, online at millertheateraugusta.com or at the box office from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays and two hours before the show.\n\nWhile the \u201cPoint of Know Return\u201d period was obviously a career highlight for Kansas, it also marked a turning point for the original group.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden we actually started seeing money,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe songwriters were seeing money from record one. And so the songwriters were doing extremely well, and we started to make money on the road. Money started coming in, but disproportionately, not in a negative way. But some people were making a lot of money and some people were starting to do really well. So where (before \u201cLeftoverture\u201d) we were just all for all, one for one, a pirate ship out on the mighty sea, now some people are buying cars and houses and boats, and some people are hoping to soon be doing that \u2026 None of these are necessarily bad things, but they change the internal workings of six guys pulling together.\n\n\u201cWe made a few more records, but the end was coming,\u201d he said. \u201cIn hindsight, you can see that the original six wasn\u2019t going to work in that form much longer.\u201d\n\nBy the early 1980s, the lineup was starting to fall apart, as Walsh, Steinhardt, Livgren and Hope all moved on to other projects.\n\nWilliams and Ehart pushed forward with Kansas, and the lineup went through a number of further changes (including the temporary returns of Livgren and Steinhardt and a reunion with Walsh that lasted from 1985 until 2014).\n\nBut where losing a popular singer has doomed many bands, Walsh\u2019s 2014 retirement reinvigorated Kansas.\n\nPlatt came aboard as the new singer, joining Williams, Ehart, longtime members Greer and Ragsdale and keyboardist David Manion. Walsh had for years resisted making new music, but now Kansas was ready to return to the studio.\n\nRizvi was hired to produce what became \u201cThe Prelude Implicit,\u201d the first Kansas album since 2000s \u201cSomewhere to Elsewhere.\u201d As work began on the project, Rizvi presented a group of songs he had written that he felt worked well with the classic Kansas sound. These songs became the backbone of \u201cThe Prelude Implicit,\u201d and Rizvi was brought on as a full member of Kansas.\n\nKansas has remained on a creative roll since. The band (with keyboardist Brislin replacing Manion) is well along in making a new studio album that\u2019s targeted for release this August. Williams reported that Rizvi has once again been writing lots of material, and Brislin is adding to the pile of new songs.\n\n\u201cThe Prelude Implicit\u201d earned considerable praise for recapturing the violin-laced blend of melodic classic rock and progressive rock that was the signature of the original Kansas. Williams said the new album builds on that goal of creating quintessential Kansas music.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in line with continuing to be Kansas. But I think the new Kansas has matured a lot in who we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are more that than we were on the last record. It\u2019s more progressive. I mean, everything about it is just better.\u201d\n\nWho: Kansas - Point of Know Return Tour When: 8 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 28 Where: Miller Theater Tickets: $44-$95; (706) 842-4080, millertheateraugusta.com or at the box office, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays and two hours before the show\n\nIN CONCERT"}, {"url": "https://www.palmspringslife.com/richard-williams-kansas/", "page_content": "When did you hook up with drummer Phil Erhart? I\u2019m sure you never thought the two of you would turn out to be the only remaining original members of Kansas.\n\nHe was a skinny kid with long bangs, drumsticks in his back pocket. I had never seen this guy before, but then I heard \u201cthat's Phil Ehart, he plays drums for The Chase and man, he's really good.\u201d So hearing this stuff, we met there. And even at that time, it was not just a novelty. We really wanted to be in a band. I'd been working with a friend of mine who was almost a concert trombonist. But he could read music and he was a really good bass player. So I was learning more from him because he also could play acoustic guitar and he lived right over the music store. So we needed a singer. We found this other guy had a Lowrey organ in his living room. We just needed a drummer. And that's when I ran into Phil.\n\nDespite the changes that Kansas has gone through \u2014 people coming and going over the years \u2014 has the band stayed true to its sound?\n\nYes, especially the last two studio albums, The Prelude Implicit (2016) and The Absence of Presence (2020). It really wasn't until Kerry Livgren and Steve Walsh, our main writers, both left. We had begun turning into a jukebox version of ourselves, and that was frustrating for all of us because we really enjoyed the creative process.\n\nBut when Steve retired, we thought, you know what? We can make a record. We don't know who's going to write it, how it's going to happen. But suddenly the only thing in our way is ourselves. We can't blame anybody because now there are no restrictions, nobody's saying no. And so we went about it and we went down to Florida, a little resort area, for two weeks. And just locked the doors and got in one of the rooms there and just started writing material.\n\nAnd started finding that maybe we can do this without those guys. And it kept going and going. Then meanwhile, we started to work with an engineer that we knew, Zak Rizvi, and we knew he was very musical. We wanted him involved at the beginning of the process. We had no idea what a songwriter he was. He wasn't a lyricist, but all of a sudden we said this guy is very Livgren-esque in his writing styles and his solo projects and stuff.\n\nIt's like my God with us playing underneath this, this is Kansas stuff. That's what we did with those two projects. They just took on a life of their own and those are as Kansas of albums as anything we've ever done, and better than a lot of them. And so, we know how to be us. Now we're 50 years in, and if there's one thing that we know how to do is to hear a song and say yes or no, or wow, there're possibilities here."}, {"url": "https://rockcellarmagazine.com/kansas-band-interview-rich-williams-point-of-know-return-live/", "page_content": "Facebook Twitter Email Reddit\n\nIt is sad to report that Kansas founder and violinist Robby Steinhardt has passed away. Steinhardt was the original violinist and vocalist on \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d and \u201cCarry on Wayward Son.\u201d Steinhardt, who was working on a solo album, was 71. The following interview with guitarist Rich Williams was conducted May 14, 2021.\n\nClassic rock bands have always experienced a revolving door of musicians. Kansas has seen its share of upheaval, but guitarist Rich Williams and drummer Phil Ehart have been with the band since its debut album. \u201cWe have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThings get tough, you stick with it.\u201d\n\nAfter years of false starts, the band signed with producer Don Kirshner\u2019s label and released Kansas in 1974. Its mix of progressive rock and symphonic arrangements with the work of violinist Robby Steinhardt produced the band\u2019s signature sound \u2014 a sound that has allowed the group to still maintain a steady presence today.\n\nThe band\u2019s breakout LP was 1976\u2019s Leftoverture, which featured the hit single \u201cCarry On Wayward Son.\u201d Point of Know Return followed in 1977. The success of the title track and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d secured the band\u2019s spot as a major arena headliner.\n\nIn July 2020, Kansas released its 16th studio album, The Absence of Presence. The album introduced the band\u2019s newest member, Tom Breslin, a vocalist who contributed music and lyrics.\n\nKansas in concert delivers performances that remain true to the original studio cuts. In 2016\u20132017 Kansas launched the Leftoverture 40th Anniversary Tour, which became the 2017 live album Leftoverture Live & Beyond. Kansas followed with its Point of Know Return Anniversary Tour. The band recorded every show and on May 28, 2021, released Point of Know Return Live & Beyond.\n\nClick here to pick up Point Of Know Return Live & Beyond on 2-CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pick up Point Of Know Return Live & Beyond on 3-LP/2-CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\n\u201cWe thought maybe one day we would release this,\u201d says Williams. \u201cAnd then with the pandemic, we figured, \u2018we have the time, let\u2019s put this together.\u2019\u201d\n\nRock Cellar talked with the guitarist shortly before the live album\u2019s release, and it was made evident that decades of success have not changed his intensity and work ethic.\n\nWilliams explains how the band\u2019s music \u2014 and members \u2014 evolved over more than four decades. It\u2019s an object lesson that every musician should read before putting pen to contract.\n\nRock Cellar: Why was Point of No Return the focus of the new live album?\n\nRich Williams: We had previously released the Leftoverture Live & Beyond album. To have a recording done in its entirety, in its original running order, it had never been done. Until this tour, we\u2019d never played all these songs ever. It also gave us the opportunity to go deeper into a lot of other albums. Like \u201cLonely Wind,\u201d we hadn\u2019t played it forever. If we played it, we didn\u2019t play it for long. To bring certain songs back from the dead was just smart to do.\n\nWe recorded every night from out front, so we probably had 100 shows taped. That process becomes a lot easier, it\u2019s almost like a studio at that point. You\u2019ve got everything mic\u2019d just right.\n\nRock Cellar: Kansas recently played its first live show in 14 months. What went into preparing for the show after such a long layoff?\n\nRich Williams: As far as the group, we showed up, we did the show. But fortunately we have the live album. And almost everything we\u2019re playing at the moment comes off of that album. So we just compiled the setlist and then a playlist and everybody just did their homework.\n\nFor the last two months I\u2019ve played that set twice a day. At home, I have the same setup as my live setup. So I can just stand there and go through all the motions of what I have to do and play along with the same guys, just through my studio speakers.\n\nThat\u2019s really what everybody did. We just continued doing the show. We had a real brief hotel room rehearsal the night before. And then we jumped on stage and did it. The weirdest part was walking out on stage. It\u2019s like another day. It didn\u2019t seem like that much time had passed. The lights went on and we did the show.\n\nWe were just glad to see each other. That part was exciting, but everybody was very prepared. There was a bit of adrenaline, some nerves, it\u2019s like, \u201chow\u2019s this going to go?\u201d Normally, if we\u2019re on the road, and we go three weeks without shows, one of us will put together a rehearsal. We probably won\u2019t do that anymore now because we know we can do it without that. It\u2019s six responsible guys that kept up on it.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you approach improvisation when performing live, especially on the best-known songs?\n\nRich Williams: For me, there are certain things I want to play not quite note-for-note, but I stick to the theme at least. There are other things I just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, \u201chere comes a part, what are you going to play?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Then I just start playing.\n\nI\u2019m just going to play in the moment, kind of the way I do it in the studio. I hate to over-rehearse. What moves me at the moment is what I usually tend to go for. There\u2019s been so many times where, in the studio, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to play here. Just roll the tape.\u201d\n\nFor example, in the song \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen\u201d on The Prelude Implicit, I had no idea what I was going to play in the solo. I just knew I wanted to get this big, out of control-kind of a sound. Usually, I record in the control room but for this I went out and had the amp right next to me, just crankin\u2019. I said, \u201cjust run it by, let me get a feel for this.\u201d\n\nSo it went by, I was just kind of holding on, I didn\u2019t know what I was gonna do exactly. And they said, \u201cyou\u2019re done.\u201d I said, \u201cwhat?\u201d That was great.\n\nI had no idea what I was doing whatsoever. I was just trying to get a feel for where the feedback points were and just get a general feel of it all. And it\u2019s one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever done. That\u2019s my approach to a lot of solos. \u201cI have no idea, here it comes.\u201d It\u2019s the shotgun approach. I just aim it in the general direction and pull the trigger and see what happens.\n\nKANSAS will be extending the popular Point of Know Return Tour starting with new shows starting November 13, 2021.

It\u2019s one thing to sit down and practice it but then you\u2019ve got the lights and the crowd and so many distractions. To keep a constant focus on what you\u2019re doing [can be tough], because if your mind wanders, you\u2019re in the weeds really quickly. It\u2019s mentally exhausting staying focused. But then on the other hand, there are some simpler songs that my mind will tend to wander and I will get lost. It\u2019s like, pay attention! It\u2019s funny how that works.\n\nMany bands of our era sit around and party before they go out and get half drunk and go out. We just have too much to do. There\u2019s no way to do that and go out there and play. It\u2019s too hard.\n\nRock Cellar: You\u2019ve said that the success of Leftoverture and Point of Know Return changed the internal workings of the band. What did you mean?\n\nRich Williams: When we first started, we were young men. It\u2019s not like we were from poor families, but leaving home, we all played in different bar bands, some together, some with other people, you\u2019re not successful in any way. People living in band houses, you have kind of an all-for-one, one-for-all, you\u2019re like pirates out on the open sea. It\u2019s teamwork. And it goes like that. And time goes on.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a complaint, it\u2019s an observation. It\u2019s just the way things go.\n\nThe way the money works with records, etc. is we did not sign a good deal with Don Kirshner. He was our benefactor, it was the only offer we got. Without him, nothing would have ever happened. But the first thing he did was say, \u201cI am a publisher. I want to publish or go somewhere else.\u201d So right away, we threw a third of the pie away. Another third of the pie is writer\u2019s royalties. And the last part of it is the royalties that the band would bank.\n\nThat part has to pay for every possible recording cost of everything. It takes a long time to pay off recording debts. So no money comes to the band. But the songwriters, and rightfully so, they get paid from the first record sold. They get money from that. So after Leftoverture went gold, we paid off all of our previous debt. The songwriters had already made a small fortune. That starts to change the dynamic.\n\nAt that point in the band, we\u2019re getting a little older, we\u2019ve been together for a while, people are buying houses, cars, getting married. So that all-for-one, one-for-all mentality has taken its natural course and starts to change the dynamic within the band.\n\nThen Point of Know Return, some people have made a lot of money and they don\u2019t want to work as much. Others are, \u201cI\u2019d like to get mine now.\u201d So things just changed. People were going from young, dumb guys to maturing a bit.\n\nAnd money does change people. So people will wander in all sorts of directions.\n\nThings just take their natural course. People naturally drifted apart because it wasn\u2019t really working anymore. But we\u2019re all good friends to this day. No animosity towards anybody through all of that.\n\nThat\u2019s just the dynamic of what happens within a band that\u2019s been around for a little while.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you maintain the classic Kansas sound despite so many personnel changes?\n\nRich Williams: For the first album, everyone was involved in arranging things, in editing things, saying this works, this doesn\u2019t work. Identifying what we\u2019re comfortable with, what parts we like, which parts we don\u2019t. My input is recognizing what fits within a quintessential Kansas part. Or what can we do to this to make it more Kansas-esque? I just have an ear for that.\n\nWe\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with people who have done it for quite a while with us, people who came in very familiar.\n\nWe know who we are and we know who we were and what we want to continue to be, so it\u2019s really not that difficult. Tom Breslin, the newest addition, brought in a lot of material and it wasn\u2019t difficult for us to turn this into what sounds like Kansas.\n\nRock Cellar: The title, The Absence of Presence, is a reference of modern technology?\n\nRich Williams: Yes, but it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. It tends to mean different things to different people. I like things that are ambiguous. The original concept of it was people are so out of touch with what\u2019s around because of the technology in their hand or what they\u2019re watching or computers, whatever.\n\nRock Cellar: The album continues the use of the band\u2019s trademark violin. Explain the violin\u2019s importance in the Kansas sound.\n\nRich Williams: We did a couple of albums, Steve Morse on guitar [Power and In the Spirit of Things], good albums but they sound like a different band. They just do. It is a signature sound, it does set us apart. I think it made us do something. What that is is the violinist needs something to do besides stand around and play fiddle parts. It changes my parts, it changes keyboard parts, because suddenly you find yourself in more of an orchestral sense.\n\nIt creates a more symphonic sound. If you take the violin away, all of a sudden the guitarist is just flashing, the keyboards are just playing away. You add that other dimension and suddenly you become more artistic in your approach.\n\nRock Cellar: You and Phil have been together since the first album. What\u2019s the secret of your longevity together?\n\nRich Williams: The top of the list would be tenacity. We grew up in the Midwest, family life. My dad met my mother in England during World War II. They married and remained married until their death. He had a job at a place called Baker Truck Rental before the war. He came back, Baker Truck Rental became Ryder Truck Rental. He remained with them until he retired. Phil\u2019s dad, he was a colonel in the Air Force. They travelled all over the world. His family life was very similar. He had one job, married until their death.\n\nWhat I learned was that sticking to a commitment is in my nature by birth and by example. We have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it. Things get tough, you stick with it. Things get good, you stick with it. I started at a certain age to take the next step: when something shitty happens, OK, fine, fuck it. Next step. I\u2019ve never quit anything. So that part isn\u2019t an effort. It\u2019s my nature.\n\nPeople ask, when are you going to retire, Rich? I go, what would you have me do? Play more golf? Stamp collecting? I\u2019ve got the best job on earth. And someone says, what do you do in your spare time? I practice. I\u2019ve got a guitar room with 30 guitars in it, a wall of amplifiers and my computer is all set up so I can prepare for the next show. That\u2019s what I do. And that\u2019s true for both of us.\n\nWe talked about it recently. It comes up once in awhile, after the pandemic especially. It\u2019s like, what do you think? Hey, I\u2019m in. Good, I\u2019m glad to hear that \u2019cause I am too. We will do this until we can\u2019t. Because we love to do it.\n\nRock Cellar: Let\u2019s do a Lightning Round. A Kansas song more people should have listened to.\n\nRich Williams: \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen.\u201d\n\nRock Cellar: What would be a great song for Kansas to cover?\n\nRich Williams: We have done some in the past. We did \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d with the London Symphony Orchestra. We did \u201cBringing It Back\u201d by J. J. Cale on the first album. A song that I always thought we\u2019d do great is \u201cSolsbury Hill\u201d by Peter Gabriel.\n\nRock Cellar: Favorite guitarist.\n\nRich Williams: Jeff Beck.\n\nRock Cellar: If you weren\u2019t in Kansas, what band, past or present, do you think you would have been a good fit for?\n\nRich Williams: AC/DC."}, {"url": "https://www.theaquarian.com/2016/11/16/an-interview-with-kansas-guitarist-rich-williams-on-why-theres-no-place-like-home-on-the-range-and-no-style-like-your-own/", "page_content": "Kansas\u2019 latest album, The Prelude Implicit, treats fans to 10 new tracks and two exciting bonus songs. The album, coproduced by the band\u2019s new member, Zac Rizvi, alongside two of the original members, Phil Ehart and Rich Williams, brilliantly celebrates the vocal talents of Ronnie Platt and the musical prowess of David Ragsdale (violin), David Manion (keyboards), Phil Ehart (drums), Billy Greer (bass guitar), and both Rich Williams and Zac Rizvi on guitar.\n\nThe band boasts an extensive catalog of 20 albums, eight of which have gone gold, three have achieved sextuple-platinum and one has reached platinum status. After a 16-year recording hiatus, the legendary band is back and better than ever, with fans proclaiming The Prelude Implicit to be the band\u2019s hottest album in decades.\n\nOn Sept. 30 the band kicked off their Leftoverture 40th Anniversary Tour where in a special two-hour concert Kansas is performing the sextuple-platinum Leftoverture album in its entirety while simultaneously playing fan favorites from their enormous repertoire.\n\nDespite a hectic tour schedule, guitarist, co-producer, and original band member Rich Williams found time to speak with me about the last four decades of Kansas and what we can expect next from the rock band.\n\nCongratulations on the new album. I\u2019ve been listening to it for days.\n\nI appreciate that. Thanks for getting it.\n\nThe Prelude Implicit has received tremendously positive feedback with some calling it the band\u2019s best work in over 35 years. That is a true testament to your producing.\n\nBefore we made the record there were some sour grapes. Old farts going, \u201cIt\u2019s not the same without Kerry [Livgren].\u201d Kerry hasn\u2019t been with the band in 33 years. Things have quieted down since the album came out. Reviews have been stellar.\n\nWhat does it feel like to be touring and performing the four-decade-old Leftoverture album while also promoting The Prelude Implicit?\n\nAt least half of the Leftoverture album was always in the set, but we\u2019ve never done the album in its entirety before, especially in its original sequence. I can\u2019t tell you the last time I put the album on and listened to it in its entirety. I don\u2019t sit around listening to Kansas records all day. Doing a tour of an album is something we\u2019ve talked about doing in the past. Other bands have done it. It was always an interesting prospect, but we just didn\u2019t always have a team willing to do it. This new lineup is happy to do anything. The Leftoverture Tour gives people that haven\u2019t bought the record an opportunity to hear it live and for those that have the record they get to hear live the stuff they\u2019ve been listening to for the last few months.\n\nKansas has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and last year the band was inducted into both the Kansas Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Can you talk about those experiences and how it feels to be recognized by the band\u2019s home and adopted states for a lifetime of rocking?\n\nI\u2019m very proud of the band and to be a part of that. Personally I don\u2019t know what to make of it. I would love for us to get into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland not for me but for the band, the legacy, and the fans and for my family. For that it is important. For me it\u2019s a bit overwhelming. I\u2019m not so ego driven that I need the accolades. I appreciate them. I\u2019m very humbled by them, but I\u2019m not comfortable standing on the pedestal taking a bow. I\u2019m just fortunate to be here.\n\nThe Prelude Implicit opens with \u201cHome on The Range,\u201d which is a sweet way to tip your hat and pay tribute to your home state.\n\nDoing an instrumental of \u201cOh Shenandoah\u201d was always something I wanted to do, but in the past there was reluctance. It\u2019s a beautiful melody and I wanted to do it in a Kansas style. There\u2019s an independent movie about \u201cHome on The Range\u201d premiering shortly in Wichita, Kansas. We were involved in that project in a small way. We\u2019ve played that song as a closing take at the end of shows because it is the state song and it is such a departure from what we do. As a concept I liked it but I didn\u2019t want to sound like a bunch of cowboys sitting around the campfire so I messed with it and took a lot of liberty with it. I made it from this happy sing-a-long cowboy song from a C major, turned it into an A minor song and altered the melody around that. It had a bluesy groove to it with a very baroque middle section. I wanted to put a Kansas signature on it from beginning to end. It\u2019s been rerecorded thousands of times the same way. I didn\u2019t want us to sing, \u201cHome on The Range.\u201d I wanted us to sing our version of it.\n\nWith 40 years of music industry trends and a roster of bandmates who have come and gone, how has Kansas stayed true to the complex American Boogie Rock sound you guys are famous for?\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to follow your nature. We have never been a pop-hit machine; laying down groovy, monstrous hit tracks. We\u2019ve stumbled on some by complete accident very fortunately like \u201cDust In The Wind\u201d; what a fortunate accident. \u201cWayward Son,\u201d the same thing. Being ourselves is what we do best. Be true to who you are and the honesty of it will come through. The shallowness of trying to be something else would never work for us.\n\nSomewhere to Elsewhere was released in 2000. After a 16-year recording hiatus what reignited the band\u2019s fire and sparked the desire to record The Prelude Implicit?\n\nThere was always a desire to record an album in those 16 years. When we did Somewhere to Elsewhere classic rock hadn\u2019t come back to life yet. We were still slugging it out performing, but we weren\u2019t making any waves. Kerry has been retired from Kansas for over 30 years, but he called and said, \u201cI\u2019m not really doing anything. You guys aren\u2019t doing much but I\u2019ve got a lot of material sitting here. It would be fun to get together and make another Kansas record.\u201d He had a studio in his barn so Phil and I went there, picked some material and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like making a Kansas album in the days previous or since. There was no band rehearsal where we sat down and worked stuff out. I like the album. I\u2019m not knocking the album, but it was not done as a group. Kerry had the songs written. Steve Walsh was not there for any of it. He was working on a solo project so he did his stuff in Atlanta and mailed it in. Phil, Kerry, and I sat in the studio. Dave Hope came up and played bass on a song. Robby came in. I was around for most of it. Billy played. It was great to record again. That\u2019s always fun.\n\nSince then the door has always been open, but Kerry has always said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d Steve got so discouraged by the business he finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to write anymore,\u201d and sold all his recording equipment. For the rest of us who wanted to record the finality of the two main songwriters saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to write,\u201d was tough to deal with.\n\nIn that frustration four of us got together and did a side project called Native Window where we wrote a lot of material. The goal was to have fun and the rule was it couldn\u2019t be Kansas. When Steve retired two years ago all restrictions left with him. With this new lineup the answer to everything is, \u201cYes. Let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s play 100 shows this year. Let\u2019s record another album this year. Let\u2019s record again in 2018. Let\u2019s do the Leftoverture Tour in its entirety. Let\u2019s play two and a half hours. Yes.\u201d \u201cYes\u201d is the answer to everything. Everybody wants to play music, have fun, travel, see the world, and be creative in our way. We have not been able to do that for so long.\n\nIt must be refreshing to be having fun again. Energy is contagious.\n\nThese are personally the best times I\u2019ve ever had. With the original six in our greatest times I didn\u2019t have the perspective I have now. I grew up slowly. I was a pretty dense, typical Midwestern male for a long time who floated through life without thinking about it that much. When you travel enough and experience enough you start gaining wisdom. I didn\u2019t appreciate what was going on at that time. I was sucking it all in and gobbling up more. Now I can look back and be proud of what we\u2019ve done. I can actually appreciate the moment, which I was never capable of before. It was always, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d I am living with the success of the band in the present. For me personally, this is the best time in my 43 years with the band.\n\nIs this the first album that you produced?\n\nWe\u2019ve had \u201cProduced by Kansas\u201d instead of our names on it. The band had more to do with production than anyone else on virtually every album, except when we worked with Bob Ezrin doing In the Spirit of Things. That was the first time we ever worked with an upper echelon, big time, star-in-his-own-right producer. He was great to work with and we learned a lot from him. There were disagreements; some lost and some won. We interviewed Roy Thomas Baker to do the album. He came in and said, \u201cI love it. Let\u2019s go record. What are the good places to eat around here?\u201d We said, \u201cNope. That\u2019s not our guy.\u201d Bob Ezrin came in and said, \u201cGuys, this is a lot of shit here. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d He got the best out of us. The album was unheard because all of MCA was fired and a whole new team came on when the album was about to be released. The album got lost in the shuffle, but we made a great record with Bob.\n\nOf the 15 studio albums Kansas has recorded and toured does one stand out as more memorable?\n\nThe most disappointing was In the Spirit of Things, because the table was set, but it didn\u2019t get the support it needed to get off the ground. On the other side of the coin it\u2019s hard to be objective. The thing you just poured your guts into is always your favorite. My favorite album is the one we just made. Three years from now I might have a different perspective. Before that my favorite was the live thing we recorded at Washburn University. The No Place Like Home DVD was the band doing Kansas material with a symphony. To sit in front of a big screen TV with surround sound Dolby is the closest to being at a Kansas symphonic concert you can be without being there. I like us live. I think we captured a live spirit on this new album. What you hear on the record and the way we\u2019re performing it is extremely similar.\n\nThe record sounds fat. You can hear every instrument simultaneously.\n\nThat\u2019s Zac. Zac was going to coproduce with us. He is a tremendous engineer that we have a long history with. He engineered No Place Like Home. From the first day of writing we wanted Zac involved. He brought so much to the table. I knew he was a good guitar player and I knew he was a creative guy, but I had no idea he was such a phenomenal songwriter with so much musical depth to him. He completely understood who we are and where we want to go. Phil and I recognized he needed to be in the band. We said, \u201cZac, how would you feel about being in the band?\u201d and he did not hesitate for a split second. It\u2019s great to have him on board. With this creative team I don\u2019t know what the limits are. We don\u2019t know where the ceiling is yet.\n\nYou have not one, but two one-million-selling gold singles to your name. Do you ever tire of playing \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d or \u201cDust in The Wind\u201d or is it just as magical to perform these favorites to live audiences years later?\n\nSitting around the house playing \u201cDust in The Wind\u201d doesn\u2019t give me goose bumps. We don\u2019t go through it a lot in rehearsals, but to play those songs in front of a live crowd is completely different. To be a part of that event; there\u2019s nothing like it. I did the guitar work on \u201cDust in The Wind.\u201d I am the guy that counts it off. I am the guy that starts that live. There\u2019s not a person in the room that goes, \u201cHuh? I\u2019ve never heard this.\u201d They all know it from the first note. They know every lyric and sing along. They identify what it means to them in their own way. They have personal stories about the song. I would hope I would never get so jaded I couldn\u2019t appreciate that moment.\n\nYou can catch Kansas on the Leftoverture 40th Anniversary Tour at The Paramount in Huntington, NY on Nov. 19.
