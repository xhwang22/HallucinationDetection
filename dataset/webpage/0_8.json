{"John Russell Reynolds wrote a biography of the poet John Keats (1848).": [{"url": "https://poets.org/poet/john-keats", "page_content": "1795 \u2013\n\n1821\n\nread this poet\u2019s poems\n\nEnglish Romantic poet John Keats was born on October 31, 1795, in London. The oldest of four children, he lost both his parents at a young age. His father, a livery-stable keeper, died when Keats was eight; his mother died of tuberculosis six years later. After his mother\u2019s death, Keats\u2019s maternal grandmother appointed two London merchants, Richard Abbey and John Rowland Sandell, as guardians. Abbey, a prosperous tea broker, assumed the bulk of this responsibility, while Sandell played only a minor role. When Keats was fifteen, Abbey withdrew him from the Clarke School, Enfield, to apprentice with an apothecary-surgeon and study medicine in a London hospital. In 1816 Keats became a licensed apothecary, but he never practiced his profession, deciding instead to write poetry.\n\nAround this time, Keats met Leigh Hunt, an influential editor of the Examiner, who published his sonnets \u201cOn First Looking into Chapman\u2019s Homer\u201d and \u201cO Solitude.\u201d Hunt also introduced Keats to a circle of literary men, including the poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and William Wordsworth. The group\u2019s influence enabled Keats to see his first volume, Poems by John Keats, published in 1817. Shelley, who was fond of Keats, had advised him to develop a more substantial body of work before publishing it. Keats, who was not as fond of Shelley, did not follow his advice. Endymion, a four-thousand-line erotic/allegorical romance based on the Greek myth of the same name, appeared the following year. Two of the most influential critical magazines of the time, the Quarterly Review and Blackwood\u2019s Magazine, attacked the collection. Calling the romantic verse of Hunt\u2019s literary circle \u201cthe Cockney school of poetry,\u201d Blackwood\u2019s declared Endymion to be nonsense and recommended that Keats give up poetry. Shelley, who privately disliked Endymion but recognized Keats\u2019s genius, wrote a more favorable review, but it was never published. Shelley also exaggerated the effect that the criticism had on Keats, attributing his declining health over the following years to a spirit broken by the negative reviews.\n\nKeats spent the summer of 1818 on a walking tour in Northern England and Scotland, returning home to care for his brother, Tom, who suffered from tuberculosis. While nursing his brother, Keats met and fell in love with a woman named Fanny Brawne. Writing some of his finest poetry between 1818 and 1819, Keats mainly worked on \u201cHyperion,\u201d a Miltonic blank-verse epic of the Greek creation myth. He stopped writing \u201cHyperion\u201d upon the death of his brother, after completing only a small portion, but in late 1819 he returned to the piece and rewrote it as \u201cThe Fall of Hyperion\u201d (unpublished until 1856). That same autumn Keats contracted tuberculosis, and by the following February he felt that death was already upon him, referring to the present as his \u201cposthumous existence.\u201d\n\nIn July 1820, he published his third and best volume of poetry, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. The three title poems, dealing with mythical and legendary themes of ancient, medieval, and Renaissance times, are rich in imagery and phrasing. The volume also contains the unfinished \u201cHyperion,\u201d and three poems considered among the finest in the English language, \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn,\u201d \u201cOde on Melancholy,\u201d and \u201cOde to a Nightingale.\u201d The book received enthusiastic praise from Hunt, Shelley, Charles Lamb, and others, and in August, Frances Jeffrey, influential editor of the Edinburgh Review, wrote a review praising both the new book and Endymion.\n\nThe fragment \u201cHyperion\u201d was considered by Keats\u2019s contemporaries to be his greatest achievement, but by that time he had reached an advanced stage of his disease and was too ill to be encouraged. He continued a correspondence with Fanny Brawne and\u2014when he could no longer bear to write to her directly\u2014her mother, but his failing health and his literary ambitions prevented their getting married. Under his doctor\u2019s orders to seek a warm climate for the winter, Keats went to Rome with his friend, the painter Joseph Severn. He died there on February 23, 1821, at the age of twenty-five, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Keats", "page_content": "Top Questions Why is John Keats important? John Keats was an English Romantic lyric poet whose verse is known for its vivid imagery and great sensuous appeal. His reputation grew after his early death, and he was greatly admired in the Victorian Age. His influence can be seen in the poetry of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the Pre-Raphaelites, among others. What was John Keats\u2019s childhood like? John Keats\u2019s father, a livery-stable manager, died when he was eight, and his mother remarried almost immediately. Throughout his life, Keats was close to his sister, Fanny, and his two brothers, George and Tom. After the breakup of their mother\u2019s second marriage, the Keats children lived with their widowed grandmother at Edmonton, Middlesex. What was John Keats\u2019s occupation? John Keats was apprenticed to a surgeon in 1811. He broke off the apprenticeship in 1814 and went to London, where he worked as a dresser, or junior house surgeon, at Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 hospitals. His literary interests had crystallized by this time, and after 1817 he devoted himself entirely to poetry. What did John Keats write? John Keats wrote sonnets, odes, and epics. All his greatest poetry was written in a single year, 1819: \u201cLamia,\u201d \u201cThe Eve of St. Agnes,\u201d the great odes (\u201cOn Indolence,\u201d \u201cOn a Grecian Urn,\u201d \u201cTo Psyche,\u201d \u201cTo a Nightingale,\u201d \u201cOn Melancholy,\u201d and \u201cTo Autumn\u201d), and the two unfinished versions of an epic on Hyperion. How did John Keats die? John Keats died of tuberculosis in Rome in 1821 at the age of 25.\n\nJohn Keats, (born October 31, 1795, London, England\u2014died February 23, 1821, Rome, Papal States [Italy]), English Romantic lyric poet who devoted his short life to the perfection of a poetry marked by vivid imagery, great sensuous appeal, and an attempt to express a philosophy through classical legend.\n\nYouth Explore John Keats's life through a dramatization penned by Archibald MacLeish and narrated by James Mason See all videos for this article The son of a livery-stable manager, John Keats received relatively little formal education.

After the breakup of their mother\u2019s second marriage, the Keats children lived with their widowed grandmother at Edmonton, Middlesex. John attended a school at Enfield, two miles away, that was run by John Clarke, whose son Charles Cowden Clarke did much to encourage Keats\u2019s literary aspirations. At school Keats was noted as a pugnacious lad and was decidedly \u201cnot literary,\u201d but in 1809 he began to read voraciously. After the death of the Keats children\u2019s mother in 1810, their grandmother put the children\u2019s affairs into the hands of a guardian, Richard Abbey. At Abbey\u2019s instigation John Keats was apprenticed to a surgeon at Edmonton in 1811.

He is one of those poets whose genius makes itself felt in prose-writing almost as decisively as in verse, and at their best these letters are among the most beautiful in our language. Portions of them lent an especial charm to a book charming at any rate\u2014the biography of the poet first published more than forty years ago by Lord Houghton. But the correspondence as given by Lord Houghton is neither accurate nor complete. He had in few cases the originals before him, but made use of copies, some of them quite fragmentary, especially those supplied him from America; and moreover, working while many of the poet\u2019s friends were still alive, he thought it right to exercise a degree of editorial freedom for which there would now be neither occasion nor excuse. While I was engaged in preparing the life of Keats for Mr. Morley\u2019s series some years since, the following materials for an improved edition of his letters came into my hands:\u2014\n\n(1) The copies made by Richard Woodhouse, a few years after Keats\u2019s death, of the poet\u2019s correspondence with his principal friends, viz. the publishers, Messrs. Taylor and Hessey; the transcriber, Woodhouse himself, who was a young barrister of literary tastes in the confidence of those gentlemen; John Hamilton Reynolds, solicitor, poet, humourist, and critic (born 1796, died[Pg xii] 1852); Jane and Mariane Reynolds, sisters of the last-named, the former afterwards Mrs. Tom Hood; James Rice, the bosom friend of Reynolds, and like him a young solicitor; Benjamin Bailey, undergraduate of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, afterwards Archdeacon of Colombo (1794?-1852), and one or two more.\n\n(2) The imperfect copies of the poet\u2019s letters to his brother and sister-in-law in America, which were made by the sister-in-law\u2019s second husband, Mr. Jeffrey of Louisville, and sent by him to Lord Houghton, who published them with further omissions and alterations of his own.\n\n(3) Somewhat later, after the publication of my book, the autograph originals of some of these same letters to America were put into my hands, including almost the entire text of Nos. lxiii. lxxiii. lxxx. and xcii. in the present edition. The three last are the long and famous journal-letters written in the autumn of 1818 and spring of 1819, and between them occupy nearly a quarter of the whole volume. I have shown elsewhere [1] how much of their value and interest was sacrificed by Mr. Jeffrey\u2019s omissions.\n\nBesides these manuscript sources, I have drawn largely on Mr. Buxton Forman\u2019s elaborate edition of Keats\u2019s works in four volumes (1883), [2] and to a much less extent on the[Pg xiii] edition published by the poet\u2019s American grand nephew, Mr. Speed (1884) [3] . Even thus, the correspondence is still probably not quite complete. In some of the voluminous journal-letters there may still be gaps, where a sheet of the autograph has gone astray; and since the following pages have been in print, I have heard of the existence in private collections of one or two letters which I have not been able to include. But it is not a case in which absolute completeness is of much importance.\n\nIn matters of the date and sequence of the letters, I have taken pains to be more exact than previous editors, especially in tracing the daily progress and different halting-places of the poet on his Scotch tour (which it takes some knowledge of the ground to do), and in dating the successive parts, written at intervals sometimes during two or three months, of the long journal-letters to America. On these particulars Keats himself is very vague, and his manuscript sometimes runs on without a break at points where the sense shows that he has dropped and taken it up again after a pause of days or weeks. [4] Again, I have in all cases given in full the verse and other quotations contained in the correspondence, where other editors have only indicated them by their first lines. It is indeed from these that the letters derive a great part of their character. Writing to his nearest relatives or most intimate friends, he is always quoting for their pleasure poems of his own now classical, then warm from his brain, sent forth uncertain whether to live or die, or snatches of doggrel nonsense as the humour of the moment takes him. The former, familiar as we may be with them, gain a new interest and freshness from the context: the latter are nothing apart from it, and to[Pg xiv] print them gravely, as has been done, among the Poetical Works, is to punish the levities of genius too hard.\n\nAs to the text, I have followed the autograph wherever it was possible, and in other cases the manuscript or printed version which I judged nearest the autograph; with this exception, that I have not thought it worth while to preserve mere slips of the pen or tricks of spelling. The curious in such matters will find them religiously reproduced by Mr. Buxton Forman wherever he has had the opportunity. The poet\u2019s punctuation, on the other hand, and his use of capitals, which is odd and full of character, I have preserved. As is well known, his handwriting is as a rule clear and beautiful, quite free from unsteadiness or sign of fatigue; and as mere specimens for the collector, few autographs can compare with these close-written quarto (or sometimes extra folio) sheets, in which the young poet has poured out to those he loved his whole self indiscriminately, generosity and fretfulness, ardour and despondency, boyish petulance side by side with manful good sense, the tattle of suburban parlours with the speculations of a spirit unsurpassed for native poetic gift and insight.\n\nThe editor of familiar correspondence has at all times a difficult task before him in the choice what to give and what to withhold. In the case of Keats the difficulty is greater than in most, from the ferment of opposing elements and impulses in his nature, and from the extreme unreserve with which he lays himself open alike in his weakness and his strength. The other great letter-writers in English are men to some degree on their guard: men, if not of the world, at least of some worldly training and experience, and of characters in some degree formed and set. The phase of unlimited youthful expansiveness, of enthusiastic or fretful outcry, they have either escaped or left behind, and never give themselves away completely. Gray is of course an extreme case in point. With a masterly breadth of mind he unites an even finicking degree of academic fastidiousness[Pg xv] and personal reserve, and his correspondence charms, not by impulse or openness, but by urbanity and irony, by ripeness of judgment and knowledge, by his playful kindliness towards the few intimates he has, and the sober wistfulness with which he looks out, from his Pisgah-height of universal culture, over regions of imaginative delight into which it was not given to him nor his contemporaries to enter fully. To take others differing most widely both as men and poets: Cowper, whether affectionately \u201cchatting and chirping\u201d to his cousin Lady Hesketh, or confiding his spiritual terrors to the Rev. John Newton, that unwise monitor who would not let them sleep,\u2014Cowper is a letter-writer the most unaffected and sincere, but has nevertheless the degree of reticence natural to his breeding, as well as a touch of staidness and formality proper to his age. Byron offers an extreme contrast; unrestrained he is, but far indeed from being unaffected; the greatest attitudinist in literature as in life, and the most brilliant of all letter-writers after his fashion, with his wit, his wilfulness, his flash, his extraordinary unscrupulousness and resource, his vulgar pride of caste, his everlasting restlessness and egotism, his occasional true irradiations of the divine fire. Shelley, again\u2014but he, as has been justly said, must have his singing robes about him to be quite truly Shelley, and in his correspondence is little more than any other amiable and enthusiastic gentleman and scholar on his travels. To the case of Keats, at any rate, none of these other distinguished letter-writers affords any close parallel. That admirable genius was from the social point of view an unformed lad in the flush and rawness of youth. His passion for beauty, his instinctive insight into the vital sources of imaginative delight in nature, in romance, and in antiquity, went along with perceptions painfully acute in matters of daily life, and nerves high-strung in the extreme. He was moreover almost incapable of artifice or disguise. Writing to his brothers and sister or to friends as dear,[Pg xvi] he is secret with them on one thing only, and that is his unlucky love-passion after he became a prey to it: for the rest he is open as the day, and keeps back nothing of what crosses his mind, nothing that vexes or jars on him or tries his patience. His character, as thus laid bare, contains elements of rare nobility and attraction\u2014modesty, humour, sweetness, courage, impulsive disinterestedness, strong and tender family affection, the gift of righteous indignation, the gift of sober and strict self-knowledge. But it is only a character in the making. A strain of hereditary disease, lurking in his constitution from the first, was developed by over-exertion and aggravated by mischance, so that he never lived to be himself; and from about his twenty-fourth birthday his utterances are those of one struggling in vain against a hopeless distemper both of body and mind.\n\nIf a selection could be made from those parts only of Keats\u2019s correspondence which show him at his best, we should have an anthology full of intuitions of beauty, even of wisdom, and breathing the very spirit of generous youth; one unrivalled for zest, whim, fancy, and amiability, and written in an English which by its peculiar alert and varied movement sometimes recalls, perhaps more closely than that of any other writer (for the young Cockney has Shakspeare in his blood), the prose passages of Hamlet and Much Ado about Nothing. Had the correspondence never been printed before, were it there to be dealt with for the first time, this method of selection would no doubt be the tempting one to apply to it. But such a treatment is now hardly possible, and in any case would hardly be quite fair; since the object, or at all events the effect, of publishing a man\u2019s correspondence is not merely to give literary pleasure\u2014it is to make the man himself known; and the revelation, though it need not be wholly without reserve, is bound to be just and proportionate as far as it goes. Even as an artist, in the work which he himself published to the world, Keats was not one of those of whom it[Pg xvii] could be said, \u201chis worst he kept, his best he gave.\u201d Rather he gave promiscuously, in the just confidence that among the failures and half-successes of his inexperienced youth would be found enough of the best to establish his place among the poets after his death. Considering all things, the nature of the man, the difficulty of separating the exquisite from the common, the healthful from the diseased, in his mind and work, considering also the use that has already been made of the materials, I have decided in this edition to give the correspondence almost unpruned; omitting a few passages of mere crudity, hardly more than two pages in all, but not attempting to suppress those which betray the weak places in the writer\u2019s nature, his flaws of taste and training, his movements of waywardness, irritability, and morbid suspicion. Only the biographer without tact, the critic without balance, will insist on these. A truer as well as more charitable judgment will recognise that what was best in Keats was also what was most real, and will be fortified by remembering that to those who knew him his faults were almost unapparent, and that no man was ever held by his friends in more devoted or more unanimous affection while he lived and afterwards.\n\nThere is one thing, however, which I have not chosen to do, and that is to include in this collection the poet\u2019s love-letters to Fanny Brawne. As it is, the intimate nature of the correspondence must sometimes give the reader a sense of eavesdropping, of being admitted into petty private matters with which he has no concern. If this is to some extent inevitable, it is by no means inevitable that the public should be farther asked to look over the shoulder of the sick and presently dying youth while he declares the impatience and torment of his passion to the object, careless and unresponsive as she seems to have been, who inspired it. These letters too have been printed. As a matter of feeling I cannot put myself in the place of the reader who desires to possess[Pg xviii] them; while as a matter of literature they are in a different key from the rest,\u2014not lacking passages of beauty, but constrained and painful in the main, and quite without the genial ease and play of mind which make the letters to his family and friends so attractive. Therefore in this, which I hope may become the standard edition of his correspondence, they shall find no place.\n\nAs to the persons, other than those already mentioned, to whom the letters here given are addressed:\u2014Shelley of course needs no words; nor should any be needed for the painter Haydon (1786-1846), or the poet and critic Leigh Hunt (1784-1859). Theirs were the chief inspiring influences which determined the young medical student, about his twentieth year, at the time when this correspondence opens, to give up his intended profession for poetry. Both were men of remarkable gifts and strong intellectual enthusiasm, hampered in either case by foibles of character which their young friend and follower, who has left so far more illustrious a name, was only too quick to detect. Charles Cowden Clarke (1787-1877), the son of Keats\u2019s schoolmaster at Enfield, had exercised a still earlier influence on the lad\u2019s opening mind, and was himself afterwards long and justly distinguished as a Shakspearean student and lecturer and essayist on English literature. Charles Wentworth Dilke (1789-1864), having begun life in the Civil Service, early abandoned that calling for letters, and lived to be one of the most influential of English critics and journalists; he is chiefly known from his connection with the Athen\u00e6um, and through the memoir published by his grandson. Charles Brown, afterwards styling himself Charles Armitage Brown (1786-1842), who became known to Keats through Dilke in the summer of 1817, and was his most intimate companion during the two years June 1818 to June 1820, had begun life as a merchant in St. Petersburg, and failing, came home, and took, he also, to literature, chiefly as a contributor to the various periodicals edited by Leigh Hunt. He lived[Pg xix] mostly in Italy from 1822 to 1834, then for six years at Plymouth, and in 1841 emigrated to New Zealand, where he died the following year. Joseph Severn (1793-1879) was the son of a musician, himself beginning to practise as a painter when Keats knew him. His devoted tendance of the poet during the last sad months in Italy was the determining event of Severn\u2019s career, earning him the permanent regard and gratitude of all lovers of genius. He established himself for good in Rome, where he continued to practise his art, and was for many years English consul, and one of the most familiar figures in the society of the city.\n\nLastly, of the poet\u2019s own relations, George Keats (1799-1842) after his brother\u2019s death continued to live at Louisville in America, where he made and lost a fortune in business before he died. His widow (born Georgiana Augusta Wylie), so often and affectionately addressed in these letters, by and by took a second husband, a Mr. Jeffrey, already mentioned as the correspondent of Lord Houghton. Frances Mary Keats (1803-1889), always called Fanny in the delightful series of letters which her brother addressed to her as a young girl, [5] in course of time married a Spanish gentleman, Se\u00f1or Llanos, and lived in Madrid to a great old age. Several other members of the poet\u2019s circle enjoyed unusual length of days\u2014Mr. William Dilke, for instance, dying a few years ago at ninety, and Mr. Gleig, long Chaplain-General of the Forces, at ninety-two. But with the death of his sister a year and a half ago, passed away probably the last survivor of those who could bear in memory the voice and features of Adonais.\n\n\n\nS.

So I will send my excuses to them and Mrs. Dilke by my brothers.\n\nYour sincere friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nVII.\u2014TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.\n\n[Southampton,] Tuesday Morn [April 15, 1817].\n\nMy dear Brothers\u2014I am safe at Southampton\u2014after having ridden three stages outside and the rest in for it began to be very cold. I did not know the Names of any of the Towns I passed through\u2014all I can tell you is that sometimes I saw dusty Hedges\u2014sometimes Ponds\u2014then nothing\u2014then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce\u2019s Sister \u201cas white as a Lily and as small as a Wand\u201d\u2014then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns\u2014then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered\u2014\u201clong heath broom furze\u201d\u2014Hurdles here and there half a Mile\u2014Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by[Pg 5] reflection\u2014One Nymph of Fountain\u2014N.B. Stone\u2014lopped Trees\u2014Cow ruminating\u2014ditto Donkey\u2014Man and Woman going gingerly along\u2014William seeing his Sisters over the Heath\u2014John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress\u2014Barber\u2019s Pole\u2014Doctor\u2019s Shop\u2014However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn\u2014N.B. this Tuesday Morn saw the Sun rise\u2014of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox\u2019d a Shakspeare\u2014\u201cThere\u2019s my Comfort.\u201d [11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle\u2014it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long\u2014tolerably broad\u2014has bye streets\u2014two or three Churches\u2014a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six I went through a most delightful Country\u2014some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the road cutting a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations\u2014it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon\u2019s Picture\u2014you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday\u2014tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away\u2014you need only[Pg 6] aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all\u2014when you have said Rum-ti-ti\u2014you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends\u2014give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all\u2014and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson\u2019s plan. What could I have done without my Plaid? I don\u2019t feel inclined to write any more at present for I feel rather muzzy\u2014you must be content with this fac simile of the rough plan of Aunt Dinah\u2019s Counterpane.\n\nYour most affectionate Brother\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nReynolds shall hear from me soon.\n\nVIII.\u2014TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.\n\nCarisbrooke, April 17th [1817].\n\nMy dear Reynolds\u2014Ever since I wrote to my Brothers from Southampton I have been in a taking\u2014and at this moment I am about to become settled\u2014for I have unpacked my books, put them into a snug corner, pinned up Haydon, Mary Queen of Scots, and Milton with his daughters in a row. In the passage I found a head of Shakspeare which I had not before seen. It is most likely the same that George spoke so well of, for I like it extremely. Well\u2014this head I have hung over my Books, just above the three in a row, having first discarded a French Ambassador\u2014now this alone is a good morning\u2019s work. Yesterday I went to Shanklin, which occasioned a great debate in my mind whether I should live there or at Carisbrooke. Shanklin is a most beautiful place\u2014Sloping wood and meadow ground reach round the Chine, which is a cleft between the Cliffs of the depth of nearly 300 feet at least. This cleft is filled with trees and[Pg 7] bushes in the narrow part, and as it widens becomes bare, if it were not for primroses on one side, which spread to the very verge of the Sea, and some fishermen\u2019s huts on the other, perched midway in the Balustrades of beautiful green Hedges along their steps down to the sands. But the sea, Jack, the sea\u2014the little waterfall\u2014then the white cliff\u2014then St. Catherine\u2019s Hill\u2014\u201cthe sheep in the meadows, the cows in the corn.\u201d Then, why are you at Carisbrooke? say you. Because, in the first place, I should be at twice the Expense, and three times the inconvenience\u2014next that from here I can see your continent\u2014from a little hill close by the whole north Angle of the Isle of Wight, with the water between us. In the 3rd place, I see Carisbrooke Castle from my window, and have found several delightful wood-alleys, and copses, and quick freshes. [12] As for primroses\u2014the Island ought to be called Primrose Island\u2014that is, if the nation of Cowslips agree thereto, of which there are divers Clans just beginning to lift up their heads. Another reason of my fixing is, that I am more in reach of the places around me. I intend to walk over the Island east\u2014West\u2014North\u2014South. I have not seen many specimens of Ruins\u2014I don\u2019t think however I shall ever see one to surpass Carisbrooke Castle. The trench is overgrown with the smoothest turf, and the Walls with ivy. The Keep within side is one Bower of ivy\u2014a colony of Jackdaws have been there for many years. I dare say I have seen many a descendant of some old cawer who peeped through the Bars at Charles the first, when he was there in Confinement. On the road from Cowes to Newport I saw some extensive Barracks, which disgusted me extremely with the Government for placing such a Nest of Debauchery in so beautiful a place. I asked a man on the Coach about this\u2014and he said that the people had been spoiled. In the room where I slept[Pg 8] at Newport, I found this on the Window\u2014\u201cO Isle spoilt by the milatary!...\u201d\n\nThe wind is in a sulky fit, and I feel that it would be no bad thing to be the favourite of some Fairy, who would give one the power of seeing how our Friends got on at a Distance. I should like, of all Loves, a sketch of you and Tom and George in ink which Haydon will do if you tell him how I want them. From want of regular rest I have been rather narvus\u2014and the passage in Lear\u2014\u201cDo you not hear the sea?\u201d\u2014has haunted me intensely.\n\nON THE SEA It keeps eternal whisperings around\n\nDesolate shores, and with its mighty swell\n\nGluts twice ten thousand Caverns, till the spell\n\nOf Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound.\n\nOften \u2019tis in such gentle temper found,\n\nThat scarcely will the very smallest shell\n\nBe mov\u2019d for days from where it sometime fell,\n\nWhen last the winds of Heaven were unbound.\n\nO ye! who have your eye-balls vex\u2019d and tir\u2019d,\n\nFeast them upon the wideness of the Sea;\n\nO ye! whose Ears are dinn\u2019d with uproar rude,\n\nOr fed too much with cloying melody\u2014\n\nSit ye near some old Cavern\u2019s Mouth, and brood\n\nUntil ye start as if the sea Nymphs quired\u2014 [13]\n\n\n\nApril 18th.\n\nWill you have the goodness to do this? Borrow a Botanical Dictionary\u2014turn to the words Laurel and Prunus, show the explanations to your sisters and Mrs. Dilke and without more ado let them send me the Cups Basket and Books they trifled and put off and off while I was in town. Ask them what they can say for themselves\u2014ask Mrs. Dilke wherefore she does so distress me\u2014let me know how Jane has her health\u2014the Weather is unfavourable for her. Tell George and Tom to write. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014on the 23d was Shakspeare born.[Pg 9] Now if I should receive a letter from you and another from my Brothers on that day \u2019twould be a parlous good thing. Whenever you write say a word or two on some Passage in Shakspeare that may have come rather new to you, which must be continually happening, notwithstanding that we read the same Play forty times\u2014for instance, the following from the Tempest never struck me so forcibly as at present,\n\n\u201cUrchins\n\nShall, for the vast of night that they may work,\n\nAll exercise on thee\u2014\u201d\n\nHow can I help bringing to your mind the line\u2014\n\nIn the dark backward and abysm of time\u2014\n\nI find I cannot exist without Poetry\u2014without eternal Poetry\u2014half the day will not do\u2014the whole of it\u2014I began with a little, but habit has made me a Leviathan. I had become all in a Tremble from not having written anything of late\u2014the Sonnet overleaf did me good. I slept the better last night for it\u2014this Morning, however, I am nearly as bad again. Just now I opened Spenser, and the first Lines I saw were these\u2014\n\n\u201cThe noble heart that harbours virtuous thought,\n\nAnd is with child of glorious great intent,\n\nCan never rest until it forth have brought\n\nTh\u2019 eternal brood of glory excellent\u2014\u201d\n\nLet me know particularly about Haydon, ask him to write to me about Hunt, if it be only ten lines\u2014I hope all is well\u2014I shall forthwith begin my Endymion, which I hope I shall have got some way with by the time you come, when we will read our verses in a delightful place I have set my heart upon, near the Castle. Give my Love to your Sisters severally\u2014to George and Tom. Remember me to Rice, Mr. and Mrs. Dilke and all we know.\n\nYour sincere Friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nDirect J. Keats, Mrs. Cook\u2019s, New Village, Carisbrooke.\n\n[Pg 10]\n\nIX.\u2014TO LEIGH HUNT.\n\nMargate, May 10, 1817.\n\nMy dear Hunt\u2014The little gentleman that sometimes lurks in a gossip\u2019s bowl, ought to have come in the very likeness of a roasted crab, and choaked me outright for not answering your letter ere this: however, you must not suppose that I was in town to receive it: no, it followed me to the Isle of Wight, and I got it just as I was going to pack up for Margate, for reasons which you anon shall hear. On arriving at this treeless affair, I wrote to my brother George to request C. C. C. [14] to do the thing you wot of respecting Rimini; and George tells me he has undertaken it with great pleasure; so I hope there has been an understanding between you for many proofs: C. C. C. is well acquainted with Bensley. Now why did you not send the key of your cupboard, which, I know, was full of papers? We would have locked them all in a trunk, together with those you told me to destroy, which indeed I did not do, for fear of demolishing receipts, there not being a more unpleasant thing in the world (saving a thousand and one others) than to pay a bill twice. Mind you, old Wood\u2019s a \u201cvery varmint,\u201d shrouded in covetousness:\u2014and now I am upon a horrid subject\u2014what a horrid one you were upon last Sunday, and well you handled it. The last Examiner [15] was a battering-ram against Christianity, blasphemy, Tertullian, Erasmus, Sir Philip Sidney; and then the dreadful Petzelians and their expiation by blood; and do Christians shudder at the same thing in a newspaper which they attribute to their God in its most aggravated form? What is to be the end of this? I must mention Hazlitt\u2019s Southey. [16] O that he had left[Pg 11] out the grey hairs; or that they had been in any other paper not concluding with such a thunderclap! That sentence about making a page of the feeling of a whole life, appears to me like a whale\u2019s back in the sea of prose. I ought to have said a word on Shakspeare\u2019s Christianity. There are two which I have not looked over with you, touching the thing: the one for, the other against: that in favour is in Measure for Measure, Act II. Scene ii.\u2014\n\nIsab. Alas, alas!\n\nWhy, all the souls that were, were forfeit once;\n\nAnd He that might the \u2019vantage best have took,\n\nFound out the remedy.\n\nThat against is in Twelfth Night, Act III. Scene ii.\u2014\n\nMaria. For there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.\n\nBefore I come to the Nymphs, [17] I must get through all disagreeables. I went to the Isle of Wight, thought so much about poetry, so long together, that I could not get to sleep at night; and, moreover, I know not how it was, I could not get wholesome food. By this means, in a week or so, I became not over capable in my upper stories, and set off pell-mell for Margate, at least a hundred and fifty miles, because, forsooth, I fancied that I should like my old lodging here, and could contrive to do without trees. Another thing, I was too much in solitude, and consequently was obliged to be in continual burning of thought, as an only resource. However, Tom is with me at present, and we are very comfortable. We intend, though, to get among some trees. How have you got on among them? How are the Nymphs? I suppose they have led you a fine dance. Where are you now?\u2014in Judea, Cappadocia, or the parts of Libya about Cyrene? Stranger from \u201cHeaven, Hues, and Prototypes,\u201d I wager you have given several new turns to the old saying, \u201cNow the maid was fair and pleasant to look on,\u201d as[Pg 12] well as made a little variation in \u201cOnce upon a time.\u201d Perhaps, too, you have rather varied, \u201cHere endeth the first lesson.\u201d Thus I hope you have made a horseshoe business of \u201cunsuperfluous life,\u201d \u201cfaint bowers,\u201d and fibrous roots. I vow that I have been down in the mouth lately at this work. These last two days, however, I have felt more confident\u2014I have asked myself so often why I should be a poet more than other men, seeing how great a thing it is,\u2014how great things are to be gained by it, what a thing to be in the mouth of Fame,\u2014that at last the idea has grown so monstrously beyond my seeming power of attainment, that the other day I nearly consented with myself to drop into a Phaethon. Yet \u2019tis a disgrace to fail, even in a huge attempt; and at this moment I drive the thought from me. I began my poem about a fortnight since, and have done some every day, except travelling ones. Perhaps I may have done a good deal for the time, but it appears such a pin\u2019s point to me, that I will not copy any out. When I consider that so many of these pin-points go to form a bodkin-point (God send I end not my life with a bare bodkin, in its modern sense!), and that it requires a thousand bodkins to make a spear bright enough to throw any light to posterity, I see nothing but continual uphill journeying. Now is there anything more unpleasant (it may come among the thousand and one) than to be so journeying and to miss the goal at last? But I intend to whistle all these cogitations into the sea, where I hope they will breed storms violent enough to block up all exit from Russia. Does Shelley go on telling strange stories of the deaths of kings? [18] Tell him, there are strange stories of the deaths of poets. Some have died before they were conceived. \u201cHow do you make that out, Master Vellum?\u201d Does Mrs. S. cut bread and butter as neatly[Pg 13] as ever? Tell her to procure some fatal scissors, and cut the thread of life of all to-be-disappointed poets. Does Mrs. Hunt tear linen as straight as ever? Tell her to tear from the book of life all blank leaves. Remember me to them all; to Miss Kent and the little ones all.\n\nYour sincere Friend\n\nJohn Keats alias Junkets.\n\nYou shall hear where we move.\n\nX.\u2014TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.\n\nMargate, Saturday Eve [May 10, 1817].\n\nMy dear Haydon,\n\n\u201cLet Fame, that all pant after in their lives,\n\nLive register\u2019d upon our brazen tombs,\n\nAnd so grace us in the disgrace of death:\n\nWhen spite of cormorant devouring Time\n\nThe endeavour of this present breath may buy\n\nThat Honour which shall bate his Scythe\u2019s keen edge\n\nAnd make us heirs of all eternity.\u201d [19]\n\nTo think that I have no right to couple myself with you in this speech would be death to me, so I have e\u2019en written it, and I pray God that our \u201cbrazen tombs\u201d be nigh neighbours. It cannot be long first; the \u201cendeavour of this present breath\u201d will soon be over, and yet it is as well to breathe freely during our sojourn\u2014it is as well as if you have not been teased with that Money affair, that bill-pestilence. However, I must think that difficulties nerve the Spirit of a Man\u2014they make our Prime Objects a Refuge as well as a Passion. The Trumpet of Fame is as a tower of Strength, the ambitious bloweth it and is safe. I suppose, by your telling me not to give way to forebodings, George has mentioned to you what I have lately said in my Letters to him\u2014truth is I have been in such a state of Mind as to read over my Lines and hate them. I am one that \u201cgathers Samphire, dreadful trade\u201d\u2014the Cliff of Poesy towers above me\u2014yet when Tom who meets with some of Pope\u2019s[Pg 14] Homer in Plutarch\u2019s Lives reads some of those to me they seem like Mice to mine. I read and write about eight hours a day. There is an old saying \u201cwell begun is half done\u201d\u2014\u2019tis a bad one. I would use instead, \u201cNot begun at all till half done;\u201d so according to that I have not begun my Poem and consequently (\u00e0 priori) can say nothing about it. Thank God! I do begin arduously where I leave off, notwithstanding occasional depressions; and I hope for the support of a High Power while I climb this little eminence, and especially in my Years of more momentous Labour. I remember your saying that you had notions of a good Genius presiding over you. I have of late had the same thought, for things which I do half at Random are afterwards confirmed by my judgment in a dozen features of Propriety. Is it too daring to fancy Shakspeare this Presider? When in the Isle of Wight I met with a Shakspeare in the Passage of the House at which I lodged\u2014it comes nearer to my idea of him than any I have seen\u2014I was but there a Week, yet the old woman made me take it with me though I went off in a hurry. Do you not think this is ominous of good? I am glad you say every man of great views is at times tormented as I am.\n\n\n\nSunday after [May 11].\n\nThis Morning I received a letter from George by which it appears that Money Troubles are to follow us up for some time to come\u2014perhaps for always\u2014these vexations are a great hindrance to one\u2014they are not like Envy and detraction stimulants to further exertion as being immediately relative and reflected on at the same time with the prime object\u2014but rather like a nettle leaf or two in your bed. So now I revoke my Promise of finishing my Poem by the Autumn which I should have done had I gone on as I have done\u2014but I cannot write while my spirit is fevered in a contrary direction and I am now sure of having plenty of it this Summer. At this moment I am in no enviable Situation\u2014I feel that[Pg 15] I am not in a Mood to write any to-day; and it appears that the loss of it is the beginning of all sorts of irregularities. I am extremely glad that a time must come when everything will leave not a wrack behind. You tell me never to despair\u2014I wish it was as easy for me to observe the saying\u2014truth is I have a horrid Morbidity of Temperament which has shown itself at intervals\u2014it is I have no doubt the greatest Enemy and stumbling-block I have to fear\u2014I may even say that it is likely to be the cause of my disappointment. However every ill has its share of good\u2014this very bane would at any time enable me to look with an obstinate eye on the Devil Himself\u2014aye to be as proud of being the lowest of the human race as Alfred could be in being of the highest. I feel confident I should have been a rebel angel had the opportunity been mine. I am very sure that you do love me as your very Brother\u2014I have seen it in your continual anxiety for me\u2014and I assure you that your welfare and fame is and will be a chief pleasure to me all my Life. I know no one but you who can be fully sensible of the turmoil and anxiety, the sacrifice of all what is called comfort, the readiness to measure time by what is done and to die in six hours could plans be brought to conclusions\u2014the looking upon the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth and its contents, as materials to form greater things\u2014that is to say ethereal things\u2014but here I am talking like a Madman,\u2014greater things than our Creator himself made!!\n\nI wrote to Hunt yesterday\u2014scarcely know what I said in it. I could not talk about Poetry in the way I should have liked for I was not in humor with either his or mine. His self-delusions are very lamentable\u2014they have enticed him into a Situation which I should be less eager after than that of a galley Slave\u2014what you observe thereon is very true must be in time.\n\nPerhaps it is a self-delusion to say so\u2014but I think I could not be deceived in the manner that Hunt is\u2014may I die to-morrow if I am to be. There is no greater[Pg 16] Sin after the seven deadly than to flatter oneself into an idea of being a great Poet\u2014or one of those beings who are privileged to wear out their Lives in the pursuit of Honor\u2014how comfortable a feel it is to feel that such a Crime must bring its heavy Penalty? That if one be a Self-deluder accounts must be balanced? I am glad you are hard at Work\u2014\u2019t will now soon be done\u2014I long to see Wordsworth\u2019s as well as to have mine in: [20] but I would rather not show my face in Town till the end of the Year\u2014if that will be time enough\u2014if not I shall be disappointed if you do not write for me even when you think best. I never quite despair and I read Shakspeare\u2014indeed I shall I think never read any other Book much. Now this might lead me into a long Confab but I desist. I am very near agreeing with Hazlitt that Shakspeare is enough for us. By the by what a tremendous Southean article his last was\u2014I wish he had left out \u201cgrey hairs.\u201d It was very gratifying to meet your remarks on the manuscript\u2014I was reading Anthony and Cleopatra when I got the Paper and there are several Passages applicable to the events you commentate. You say that he arrived by degrees and not by any single struggle to the height of his ambition\u2014and that his Life had been as common in particulars as other Men\u2019s. Shakspeare makes Enobarb say\u2014\n\nWhere\u2019s Antony?\n\nEros.\u2014He\u2019s walking in the garden, and spurns\n\nThe rush that lies before him; cries, Fool, Lepidus!\n\nIn the same scene we find\u2014\n\nLet determined things\n\nTo destiny hold unbewailed their way.\n\nDolabella says of Anthony\u2019s Messenger,\n\nAn argument that he is pluck\u2019d when hither\n\nHe sends so poor a pinion of his wing.\n\nThen again\u2014\n\n[Pg 17] Eno.\u2014I see Men\u2019s Judgments are\n\nA parcel of their fortunes; and things outward\n\nDo draw the inward quality after them,\n\nTo suffer all alike.\n\nThe following applies well to Bertrand [21] \u2014\n\nYet he that can endure\n\nTo follow with allegiance a fallen Lord,\n\nDoes conquer him that did his Master conquer,\n\nAnd earns a place i\u2019 the story.\n\nBut how differently does Buonaparte bear his fate from Anthony!\n\n\u2019Tis good, too, that the Duke of Wellington has a good Word or so in the Examiner. A Man ought to have the Fame he deserves\u2014and I begin to think that detracting from him as well as from Wordsworth is the same thing. I wish he had a little more taste\u2014and did not in that respect \u201cdeal in Lieutenantry.\u201d You should have heard from me before this\u2014but in the first place I did not like to do so before I had got a little way in the First Book, and in the next as G. told me you were going to write I delayed till I had heard from you. Give my Respects the next time you write to the North and also to John Hunt. Remember me to Reynolds and tell him to write. Ay, and when you send Westward tell your Sister that I mentioned her in this. So now in the name of Shakspeare, Raphael and all our Saints, I commend you to the care of heaven!\n\nYour everlasting Friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nXI.\u2014TO MESSRS. TAYLOR AND HESSEY.\n\nMargate, May 16, 1817.\n\nMy dear Sirs\u2014I am extremely indebted to you for your liberality in the shape of manufactured rag, value \u00a320, and shall immediately proceed to destroy some of the minor heads of that hydra the dun; to conquer which the knight need have no Sword Shield Cuirass, Cuisses Herbadgeon Spear Casque Greaves Paldrons spurs Chevron[Pg 18] or any other scaly commodity, but he need only take the Bank-note of Faith and Cash of Salvation, and set out against the monster, invoking the aid of no Archimago or Urganda, but finger me the paper, light as the Sibyl\u2019s leaves in Virgil, whereat the fiend skulks off with his tail between his legs. Touch him with this enchanted paper, and he whips you his head away as fast as a snail\u2019s horn\u2014but then the horrid propensity he has to put it up again has discouraged many very valiant Knights. He is such a never-ending still-beginning sort of a body\u2014like my landlady of the Bell. I should conjecture that the very spright that \u201cthe green sour ringlets makes Whereof the ewe not bites\u201d had manufactured it of the dew fallen on said sour ringlets. I think I could make a nice little allegorical poem, called \u201cThe Dun,\u201d where we would have the Castle of Carelessness, the drawbridge of credit, Sir Novelty Fashion\u2019s expedition against the City of Tailors, etc. etc. I went day by day at my poem for a Month\u2014at the end of which time the other day I found my Brain so over-wrought that I had neither rhyme nor reason in it\u2014so was obliged to give up for a few days. I hope soon to be able to resume my work\u2014I have endeavoured to do so once or twice; but to no purpose. Instead of Poetry, I have a swimming in my head and feel all the effects of a Mental debauch, lowness of Spirits, anxiety to go on without the power to do so, which does not at all tend to my ultimate progression. However to-morrow I will begin my next month. This evening I go to Canterbury, having got tired of Margate. I was not right in my head when I came\u2014At Canterbury I hope the remembrance of Chaucer will set me forward like a Billiard Ball. I am glad to hear of Mr. T.\u2019s health, and of the welfare of the \u201cIn-town-stayers.\u201d And think Reynolds will like his Trip\u2014I have some idea of seeing the Continent some time this summer. In repeating how sensible I am of your kindness, I remain\n\nYr obedt servt and friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\n[Pg 19]I shall be happy to hear any little intelligence in the literary or friendly way when you have time to scribble.\n\nXII.\u2014TO MESSRS. TAYLOR AND HESSEY.\n\n[London] Tuesday Morn [July 8, 1817].\n\nMy dear Sirs\u2014I must endeavour to lose my maidenhead with respect to money Matters as soon as possible\u2014And I will too\u2014So, here goes! A couple of Duns that I thought would be silent till the beginning, at least, of next month (when I am certain to be on my legs, for certain sure), have opened upon me with a cry most \u201cuntuneable\u201d; never did you hear such un-\u201cgallant chiding.\u201d Now you must know, I am not desolate, but have, thank God, 25 good notes in my fob. But then, you know, I laid them by to write with and would stand at bay a fortnight ere they should grab me. In a month\u2019s time I must pay, but it would relieve my mind if I owed you, instead of these Pelican duns.\n\nI am afraid you will say I have \u201cwound about with circumstance,\u201d when I should have asked plainly\u2014however as I said I am a little maidenish or so, and I feel my virginity come strong upon me, the while I request the loan of a \u00a320 and a \u00a310, which, if you would enclose to me, I would acknowledge and save myself a hot forehead. I am sure you are confident of my responsibility, and in the sense of squareness that is always in me.\n\nYour obliged friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nXIII.\u2014TO MARIANE AND JANE REYNOLDS.\n\n[Oxford, [22] September 5, 1817].\n\nMy dear Friends\u2014You are I am glad to hear comfortable at Hampton, [23] where I hope you will receive the Biscuits we ate the other night at Little Britain. [24] I hope you found them good. There you are among sands,[Pg 20] stones, Pebbles, Beeches, Cliffs, Rocks, Deeps, Shallows, weeds, ships, Boats (at a distance), Carrots, Turnips, sun, moon, and stars and all those sort of things\u2014here am I among Colleges, halls, Stalls, Plenty of Trees, thank God\u2014Plenty of water, thank heaven\u2014Plenty of Books, thank the Muses\u2014Plenty of Snuff, thank Sir Walter Raleigh\u2014Plenty of segars,\u2014Ditto\u2014Plenty of flat country, thank Tellus\u2019s rolling-pin. I\u2019m on the sofa\u2014Buonaparte is on the snuff-box\u2014But you are by the seaside\u2014argal, you bathe\u2014you walk\u2014you say \u201chow beautiful\u201d\u2014find out resemblances between waves and camels\u2014rocks and dancing-masters\u2014fireshovels and telescopes\u2014Dolphins and Madonas\u2014which word, by the way, I must acquaint you was derived from the Syriac, and came down in a way which neither of you I am sorry to say are at all capable of comprehending. But as a time may come when by your occasional converse with me you may arrive at \u201csomething like prophetic strain,\u201d I will unbar the gates of my pride and let my condescension stalk forth like a ghost at the Circus.\u2014The word Ma-don-a, my dear Ladies\u2014or\u2014the word Mad\u2014Ona\u2014so I say! I am not mad\u2014Howsumever when that aged Tamer Kewthon sold a certain camel called Peter to the overseer of the Babel Sky-works, he thus spake, adjusting his cravat round the tip of his chin\u2014\u201cMy dear Ten-story-up-in-air! this here Beast, though I say it as shouldn\u2019t say\u2019t, not only has the power of subsisting 40 days and 40 nights without fire and candle but he can sing.\u2014Here I have in my Pocket a Certificate from Signor Nicolini of the King\u2019s Theatre; a Certificate to this effect\u2014\u2014\u201d I have had dinner since I left that effect upon you, and feel too heavy in mentibus to display all the Profundity of the Polygon\u2014so you had better each of you take a glass of cherry Brandy and drink to the health of Archimedes, who was of so benign a disposition that he never would leave Syracuse in his life\u2014So kept himself out of all Knight-Errantry.\u2014This I know to be a fact; for it is written in the 45th book of Winkine\u2019s[Pg 21] treatise on garden-rollers, that he trod on a fishwoman\u2019s toe in Liverpool, and never begged her pardon. Now the long and short is this\u2014that is by comparison\u2014for a long day may be a short year\u2014A long Pole may be a very stupid fellow as a man. But let us refresh ourself from this depth of thinking, and turn to some innocent jocularity\u2014the Bow cannot always be bent\u2014nor the gun always loaded, if you ever let it off\u2014and the life of man is like a great Mountain\u2014his breath is like a Shrewsbury cake\u2014he comes into the world like a shoeblack, and goes out of it like a cobbler\u2014he eats like a chimney-sweeper, drinks like a gingerbread baker\u2014and breathes like Achilles\u2014so it being that we are such sublunary creatures, let us endeavour to correct all our bad spelling\u2014all our most delightful abominations, and let us wish health to Marian and Jane, whoever they be and wherever.\n\nYours truly\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nXIV\u2014TO FANNY KEATS.\n\nOxford, September 10 [1817].\n\nMy dear Fanny\u2014Let us now begin a regular question and answer\u2014a little pro and con; letting it interfere as a pleasant method of my coming at your favorite little wants and enjoyments, that I may meet them in a way befitting a brother.\n\nWe have been so little together since you have been able to reflect on things that I know not whether you prefer the History of King Pepin to Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u2014or Cinderella and her glass slipper to Moore\u2019s Almanack. However in a few Letters I hope I shall be able to come at that and adapt my scribblings to your Pleasure. You must tell me about all you read if it be only six Pages in a Week and this transmitted to me every now and then will procure you full sheets of Writing from me pretty frequently.\u2014This I feel as a necessity for we ought to become intimately acquainted, in order that I may not only, as you grow up love you as[Pg 22] my only Sister, but confide in you as my dearest friend. When I saw you last I told you of my intention of going to Oxford and \u2019tis now a Week since I disembark\u2019d from his Whipship\u2019s Coach the Defiance in this place. I am living in Magdalen Hall on a visit to a young Man with whom I have not been long acquainted, but whom I like very much\u2014we lead very industrious lives\u2014he in general Studies and I in proceeding at a pretty good rate with a Poem which I hope you will see early in the next year.\u2014Perhaps you might like to know what I am writing about. I will tell you. Many Years ago there was a young handsome Shepherd who fed his flocks on a Mountain\u2019s Side called Latmus\u2014he was a very contemplative sort of a Person and lived solitary among the trees and Plains little thinking that such a beautiful Creature as the Moon was growing mad in Love with him.\u2014However so it was; and when he was asleep on the Grass she used to come down from heaven and admire him excessively for a long time; and at last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of that high Mountain Latmus while he was a dreaming\u2014but I daresay you have read this and all the other beautiful Tales which have come down from the ancient times of that beautiful Greece. If you have not let me know and I will tell you more at large of others quite as delightful. This Oxford I have no doubt is the finest City in the world\u2014it is full of old Gothic buildings\u2014Spires\u2014towers\u2014Quadrangles\u2014Cloisters\u2014Groves, etc., and is surrounded with more clear streams than ever I saw together. I take a Walk by the Side of one of them every Evening and, thank God, we have not had a drop of rain these many days. I had a long and interesting Letter from George, cross lines by a short one from Tom yesterday dated Paris. They both send their loves to you. Like most Englishmen they feel a mighty preference for everything English\u2014the French Meadows, the trees, the People, the Towns, the Churches, the Books, the everything\u2014although they may be in themselves[Pg 23] good: yet when put in comparison with our green Island they all vanish like Swallows in October. They have seen Cathedrals, Manuscripts, Fountains, Pictures, Tragedy, Comedy,\u2014with other things you may by chance meet with in this Country such as Washerwomen, Lamplighters, Turnpikemen, Fishkettles, Dancing Masters, Kettle drums, Sentry Boxes, Rocking Horses, etc.\u2014and, now they have taken them over a set of boxing-gloves.\n\nI have written to George and requested him, as you wish I should, to write to you. I have been writing very hard lately, even till an utter incapacity came on, and I feel it now about my head: so you must not mind a little out-of-the-way sayings\u2014though by the bye were my brain as clear as a bell I think I should have a little propensity thereto. I shall stop here till I have finished the 3d Book of my Story; which I hope will be accomplish\u2019d in at most three Weeks from to-day\u2014about which time you shall see me. How do you like Miss Taylor\u2019s essays in Rhyme\u2014I just look\u2019d into the Book and it appeared to me suitable to you\u2014especially since I remember your liking for those pleasant little things the Original Poems\u2014the essays are the more mature production of the same hand. While I was speaking about France it occurred to me to speak a few Words on their Language\u2014it is perhaps the poorest one ever spoken since the jabbering in the Tower of Babel, and when you come to know that the real use and greatness of a Tongue is to be referred to its Literature\u2014you will be astonished to find how very inferior it is to our native Speech.\u2014I wish the Italian would supersede French in every school throughout the Country, for that is full of real Poetry and Romance of a kind more fitted for the Pleasure of Ladies than perhaps our own.\u2014It seems that the only end to be gained in acquiring French is the immense accomplishment of speaking it\u2014it is none at all\u2014a most lamentable mistake indeed. Italian indeed would sound most musically from Lips which had began to pronounce it as early as French is crammed down our Mouths, as if we were young Jackdaws[Pg 24] at the mercy of an overfeeding Schoolboy. Now Fanny you must write soon\u2014and write all you think about, never mind what\u2014only let me have a good deal of your writing\u2014You need not do it all at once\u2014be two or three or four days about it, and let it be a diary of your little Life. You will preserve all my Letters and I will secure yours\u2014and thus in the course of time we shall each of us have a good Bundle\u2014which, hereafter, when things may have strangely altered and God knows what happened, we may read over together and look with pleasure on times past\u2014that now are to come. Give my Respects to the Ladies\u2014and so my dear Fanny I am ever\n\nYour most affectionate Brother\n\nJohn.\n\nIf you direct\u2014Post Office, Oxford\u2014your Letter will be brought to me.\n\nXV.\u2014TO JANE REYNOLDS.\n\nOxford, Sunday Evg. [September 14, 1817].\n\nMy dear Jane\u2014You are such a literal translator, that I shall some day amuse myself with looking over some foreign sentences, and imagining how you would render them into English. This is an age for typical Curiosities; and I would advise you, as a good speculation, to study Hebrew, and astonish the world with a figurative version in our native tongue. The Mountains skipping like rams, and the little hills like lambs, you will leave as far behind as the hare did the tortoise. It must be so or you would never have thought that I really meant you would like to pro and con about those Honeycombs\u2014no, I had no such idea, or, if I had, \u2019twould be only to tease you a little for love. So now let me put down in black and white briefly my sentiments thereon.\u2014Imprimis\u2014I sincerely believe that Imogen is the finest creature, and that I should have been disappointed at hearing you prefer Juliet\u2014Item\u2014Yet I feel such a yearning towards[Pg 25] Juliet that I would rather follow her into Pandemonium than Imogen into Paradise\u2014heartily wishing myself a Romeo to be worthy of her, and to hear the Devils quote the old proverb, \u201cBirds of a feather flock together\u201d\u2014Amen.\u2014\n\nNow let us turn to the Seashore. Believe me, my dear Jane, it is a great happiness to see that you are in this finest part of the year winning a little enjoyment from the hard world. In truth, the great Elements we know of, are no mean comforters: the open sky sits upon our senses like a sapphire crown\u2014the Air is our robe of state\u2014the Earth is our throne, and the Sea a mighty minstrel playing before it\u2014able, like David\u2019s harp, to make such a one as you forget almost the tempest cares of life. I have found in the ocean\u2019s music,\u2014varying (tho self-same) more than the passion of Timotheus, an enjoyment not to be put into words; and, \u201cthough inland far I be,\u201d I now hear the voice most audibly while pleasing myself in the idea of your sensations.\n\n\u2014\u2014 is getting well apace, and if you have a few trees, and a little harvesting about you, I\u2019ll snap my fingers in Lucifer\u2019s eye. I hope you bathe too\u2014if you do not, I earnestly recommend it. Bathe thrice a week, and let us have no more sitting up next winter. Which is the best of Shakspeare\u2019s plays? I mean in what mood and with what accompaniment do you like the sea best? It is very fine in the morning, when the sun,\n\n\u201cOpening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,\n\nTurns into yellow gold his salt sea streams,\u201d\n\nand superb when\n\n\u201cThe sun from meridian height\n\nIllumines the depth of the sea,\n\nAnd the fishes, beginning to sweat,\n\nCry d\u2014\u2014 it! how hot we shall be,\u201d\n\nand gorgeous, when the fair planet hastens\n\n\u201cTo his home\n\nWithin the Western foam.\u201d\n\n[Pg 26]But don\u2019t you think there is something extremely fine after sunset, when there are a few white clouds about and a few stars blinking\u2014when the waters are ebbing, and the horizon a mystery? This state of things has been so fulfilling to me that I am anxious to hear whether it is a favourite with you. So when you and Marianne club your letter to me put in a word or two about it. Tell Dilke that it would be perhaps as well if he left a Pheasant or Partridge alive here and there to keep up a supply of game for next season\u2014tell him to rein in if Possible all the Nimrod of his disposition, he being a mighty hunter before the Lord\u2014of the Manor. Tell him to shoot fair, and not to have at the Poor devils in a furrow\u2014when they are flying, he may fire, and nobody will be the wiser.\n\nGive my sincerest respects to Mrs. Dilke, saying that I have not forgiven myself for not having got her the little box of medicine I promised, and that, had I remained at Hampstead I would have made precious havoc with her house and furniture\u2014drawn a great harrow over her garden\u2014poisoned Boxer\u2014eaten her clothes-pegs\u2014fried her cabbages\u2014fricaseed (how is it spelt?) her radishes\u2014ragout\u2019d her Onions\u2014belaboured her beat-root\u2014outstripped her scarlet-runners\u2014parlez-vous\u2019d with her french-beans\u2014devoured her mignon or mignionette\u2014metamorphosed her bell-handles\u2014splintered her looking-glasses\u2014bullocked at her cups and saucers\u2014agonised her decanters\u2014put old Phillips to pickle in the brine-tub\u2014disorganised her piano\u2014dislocated her candlesticks\u2014emptied her wine-bins in a fit of despair\u2014turned out her maid to grass\u2014and astonished Brown; whose letter to her on these events I would rather see than the original Copy of the Book of Genesis. Should you see Mr. W. D. [25] remember me to him, and to little Robinson Crusoe, and to Mr. Snook. Poor Bailey, scarcely ever well,[Pg 27] has gone to bed, pleased that I am writing to you. To your brother John (whom henceforth I shall consider as mine) and to you, my dear friends, Marianne and Jane, I shall ever feel grateful for having made known to me so real a fellow as Bailey. He delights me in the selfish and (please God) the disinterested part of my disposition. If the old Poets have any pleasure in looking down at the enjoyers of their works, their eyes must bend with a double satisfaction upon him. I sit as at a feast when he is over them, and pray that if, after my death, any of my labours should be worth saving, they may have so \u201chonest a chronicler\u201d as Bailey. Out of this, his enthusiasm in his own pursuit and for all good things is of an exalted kind\u2014worthy a more healthful frame and an untorn spirit. He must have happy years to come\u2014\u201che shall not die by God.\u201d\n\nA letter from John the other day was a chief happiness to me. I made a little mistake when, just now, I talked of being far inland. How can that be when Endymion and I are at the bottom of the sea? whence I hope to bring him in safety before you leave the seaside; and, if I can so contrive it, you shall be greeted by him upon the sea-sands, and he shall tell you all his adventures, which having finished, he shall thus proceed\u2014\u201cMy dear Ladies, favourites of my gentle mistress, however my friend Keats may have teased and vexed you, believe me he loves you not the less\u2014for instance, I am deep in his favour, and yet he has been hauling me through the earth and sea with unrelenting perseverance. I know for all this that he is mighty fond of me, by his contriving me all sorts of pleasures. Nor is this the least, fair ladies, this one of meeting you on the desert shore, and greeting you in his name. He sends you moreover this little scroll\u2014\u201d My dear Girls, I send you, per favour of Endymion, the assurance of my esteem for you, and my utmost wishes for your health and pleasure, being ever,\n\nYour affectionate Brother\n\nJohn Keats.\n\n[Pg 28]\n\nXVI.\u2014TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.\n\nOxford, Sunday Morn [September 21, 1817].\n\nMy dear Reynolds\u2014So you are determined to be my mortal foe\u2014draw a Sword at me, and I will forgive\u2014Put a Bullet in my Brain, and I will shake it out as a dew-drop from the Lion\u2019s Mane\u2014put me on a Gridiron, and I will fry with great complacency\u2014but\u2014oh, horror! to come upon me in the shape of a Dun! Send me bills! as I say to my Tailor, send me Bills and I\u2019ll never employ you more. However, needs must, when the devil drives: and for fear of \u201cbefore and behind Mr. Honeycomb\u201d I\u2019ll proceed. I have not time to elucidate the forms and shapes of the grass and trees; for, rot it! I forgot to bring my mathematical case with me, which unfortunately contained my triangular Prism so that the hues of the grass cannot be dissected for you\u2014\n\nFor these last five or six days, we have had regularly a Boat on the Isis, and explored all the streams about, which are more in number than your eye-lashes. We sometimes skim into a Bed of rushes, and there become naturalised river-folks,\u2014there is one particularly nice nest, which we have christened \u201cReynolds\u2019s Cove,\u201d in which we have read Wordsworth and talked as may be. I think I see you and Hunt meeting in the Pit.\u2014What a very pleasant fellow he is, if he would give up the sovereignty of a Room pro bono. What Evenings we might pass with him, could we have him from Mrs. H. Failings I am always rather rejoiced to find in a man than sorry for; they bring us to a Level. He has them, but then his makes-up are very good. He agrees with the Northern Poet in this, \u201cHe is not one of those who much delight to season their fireside with personal talk\u201d\u2014I must confess however having a little itch that way, and at this present moment I have a few neighbourly remarks to make. The world, and especially our England, has, within the last thirty years, been vexed and teased[Pg 29] by a set of Devils, whom I detest so much that I almost hunger after an Acherontic promotion to a Torturer, purposely for their accommodation. These devils are a set of women, who having taken a snack or Luncheon of Literary scraps, set themselves up for towers of Babel in languages, Sapphos in Poetry, Euclids in Geometry, and everything in nothing. Among such the name of Montague has been pre-eminent. The thing has made a very uncomfortable impression on me. I had longed for some real feminine Modesty in these things, and was therefore gladdened in the extreme on opening the other day, one of Bailey\u2019s Books\u2014a book of poetry written by one beautiful Mrs. Philips, a friend of Jeremy Taylor\u2019s, and called \u201cThe Matchless Orinda\u2014\u201d You must have heard of her, and most likely read her Poetry\u2014I wish you have not, that I may have the pleasure of treating you with a few stanzas\u2014I do it at a venture\u2014You will not regret reading them once more. The following, to her friend Mrs. M. A. at parting, you will judge of.\n\n1 I have examin\u2019d and do find,\n\nOf all that favour me\n\nThere\u2019s none I grieve to leave behind\n\nBut only, only thee.\n\nTo part with thee I needs must die,\n\nCould parting sep\u2019rate thee and I.\n\n2 But neither Chance nor Complement\n\nDid element our Love;\n\n\u2019Twas sacred sympathy was lent\n\nUs from the Quire above.\n\nThat Friendship Fortune did create,\n\nStill fears a wound from Time or Fate.\n\n3 Our chang\u2019d and mingled Souls are grown\n\nTo such acquaintance now,\n\nThat if each would resume their own,\n\nAlas! we know not how.\n\nWe have each other so engrost,\n\nThat each is in the Union lost. [Pg 30]\n\n4 And thus we can no Absence know,\n\nNor shall we be confin\u2019d;\n\nOur active Souls will daily go\n\nTo learn each others mind.\n\nNay, should we never meet to Sense,\n\nOur Souls would hold Intelligence.\n\n5 Inspired with a Flame Divine\n\nI scorn to court a stay;\n\nFor from that noble Soul of thine\n\nI ne\u2019re can be away.\n\nBut I shall weep when thou dost grieve;\n\nNor can I die whil\u2019st thou dost live.\n\n6 By my own temper I shall guess\n\nAt thy felicity,\n\nAnd only like my happiness\n\nBecause it pleaseth thee.\n\nOur hearts at any time will tell\n\nIf thou, or I, be sick, or well.\n\n7 All Honour sure I must pretend,\n\nAll that is good or great;\n\nShe that would be Rosania\u2019s Friend,\n\nMust be at least compleat. [A]\n\nIf I have any bravery,\n\n\u2019Tis cause I have so much of thee.\n\n8 Thy Leiger Soul in me shall lie,\n\nAnd all thy thoughts reveal;\n\nThen back again with mine shall flie,\n\nAnd thence to me shall steal.\n\nThus still to one another tend;\n\nSuch is the sacred name of Friend.\n\n9 Thus our twin-Souls in one shall grow,\n\nAnd teach the World new Love,\n\nRedeem the Age and Sex, and show\n\nA Flame Fate dares not move:\n\nAnd courting Death to be our friend,\n\nOur Lives together too shall end. [Pg 31]\n\n10 A Dew shall dwell upon our Tomb\n\nOf such a quality,\n\nThat fighting Armies, thither come,\n\nShall reconciled be.\n\nWe\u2019ll ask no Epitaph, but say\n\nOrinda and Rosania.\n\nIn other of her poems there is a most delicate fancy of the Fletcher kind\u2014which we will con over together. So Haydon is in Town. I had a letter from him yesterday. We will contrive as the winter comes on\u2014but that is neither here nor there. Have you heard from Rice? Has Martin met with the Cumberland Beggar, or been wondering at the old Leech-gatherer? Has he a turn for fossils? that is, is he capable of sinking up to his Middle in a Morass? How is Hazlitt? We were reading his Table [26] last night. I know he thinks him self not estimated by ten people in the world\u2014I wish he knew he is. I am getting on famous with my third Book\u2014have written 800 lines thereof, and hope to finish it next Week. Bailey likes what I have done very much. Believe me, my dear Reynolds, one of my chief layings-up is the pleasure I shall have in showing it to you, I may now say, in a few days. I have heard twice from my Brothers, they are going on very well, and send their Remembrances to you. We expected to have had notices from little-Hampton this morning\u2014we must wait till Tuesday. I am glad of their Days with the Dilkes. You are, I know, very much teased in that precious London, and want all the rest possible; so I shall be contented with as brief a scrawl\u2014a Word or two, till there comes a pat hour.\n\nSend us a few of your stanzas to read in \u201cReynolds\u2019s Cove.\u201d Give my Love and respects to your Mother, and remember me kindly to all at home.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nI have left the doublings for Bailey, who is going to say that he will write to you to-morrow.\n\n[Pg 32]\n\nXVII.\u2014TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.\n\nOxford, September 28 [1817].\n\nMy dear Haydon\u2014I read your letter to the young Man, whose Name is Cripps. He seemed more than ever anxious to avail himself of your offer. I think I told you we asked him to ascertain his Means. He does not possess the Philosopher\u2019s stone\u2014nor Fortunatus\u2019s purse, nor Gyges\u2019s ring\u2014but at Bailey\u2019s suggestion, whom I assure you is a very capital fellow, we have stummed up a kind of contrivance whereby he will be enabled to do himself the benefits you will lay in his Path. I have a great Idea that he will be a tolerable neat brush. \u2019Tis perhaps the finest thing that will befal him this many a year: for he is just of an age to get grounded in bad habits from which you will pluck him. He brought a copy of Mary Queen of Scots: it appears to me that he has copied the bad style of the painting, as well as coloured the eyeballs yellow like the original. He has also the fault that you pointed out to me in Hazlitt on the constringing and diffusing of substance. However I really believe that he will take fire at the sight of your Picture\u2014and set about things. If he can get ready in time to return to town with me, which will be in a few days\u2014I will bring him to you. You will be glad to hear that within these last three weeks I have written 1000 lines\u2014which are the third Book of my Poem. My Ideas with respect to it I assure you are very low\u2014and I would write the subject thoroughly again\u2014but I am tired of it and think the time would be better spent in writing a new Romance which I have in my eye for next summer\u2014Rome was not built in a Day\u2014and all the good I expect from my employment this summer is the fruit of Experience which I hope to gather in my next Poem. Bailey\u2019s kindest wishes, and my vow of being\n\nYours eternally\n\nJohn Keats.\n\n[Pg 33]\n\nXVIII.\u2014TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.\n\nHampstead, Wednesday [October 8, 1817].\n\nMy dear Bailey\u2014After a tolerable journey, I went from Coach to Coach as far as Hampstead where I found my Brothers\u2014the next Morning finding myself tolerably well I went to Lamb\u2019s Conduit Street and delivered your parcel. Jane and Marianne were greatly improved. Marianne especially, she has no unhealthy plumpness in the face, but she comes me healthy and angular to the chin\u2014I did not see John\u2014I was extremely sorry to hear that poor Rice, after having had capital health during his tour, was very ill. I daresay you have heard from him. From No. 19 I went to Hunt\u2019s and Haydon\u2019s who live now neighbours.\u2014Shelley was there\u2014I know nothing about anything in this part of the world\u2014every Body seems at Loggerheads. There\u2019s Hunt infatuated\u2014there\u2019s Haydon\u2019s picture in statu quo\u2014There\u2019s Hunt walks up and down his painting room criticising every head most unmercifully. There\u2019s Horace Smith tired of Hunt. \u201cThe web of our life is of mingled yarn.\u201d [27] Haydon having removed entirely from Marlborough Street, Cripps must direct his letter to Lisson Grove, North Paddington. Yesterday Morning while I was at Brown\u2019s, in came Reynolds, he was pretty bobbish, we had a pleasant day\u2014he would walk home at night that cursed cold distance. Mrs. Bentley\u2019s children are making a horrid row [28] \u2014whereby I regret I cannot be transported to your Room to write to you. I am quite disgusted with literary men and will never know another except Wordsworth\u2014no not even Byron. Here is an instance of the friendship of such. Haydon and Hunt[Pg 34] have known each other many years\u2014now they live, pour ainsi dire, jealous neighbours\u2014Haydon says to me, Keats, don\u2019t show your lines to Hunt on any Account, or he will have done half for you\u2014so it appears Hunt wishes it to be thought. When he met Reynolds in the Theatre, John told him that I was getting on to the completion of 4000 lines\u2014Ah! says Hunt, had it not been for me they would have been 7000! If he will say this to Reynolds, what would he to other people? Haydon received a Letter a little while back on this subject from some Lady\u2014which contains a caution to me, through him, on the subject\u2014now is not all this a most paltry thing to think about? You may see the whole of the case by the following Extract from a Letter I wrote to George in the Spring\u2014\u201cAs to what you say about my being a Poet, I can return no Answer but by saying that the high Idea I have of poetical fame makes me think I see it towering too high above me. At any rate, I have no right to talk until Endymion is finished\u2014it will be a test, a trial of my Powers of Imagination, and chiefly of my invention, which is a rare thing indeed\u2014by which I must make 4000 lines of one bare circumstance, and fill them with poetry: and when I consider that this is a great task, and that when done it will take me but a dozen paces towards the temple of fame\u2014it makes me say\u2014God forbid that I should be without such a task! I have heard Hunt say, and I may be asked\u2014why endeavour after a long Poem? To which I should answer, Do not the Lovers of Poetry like to have a little Region to wander in, where they may pick and choose, and in which the images are so numerous that many are forgotten and found new in a second Reading: which may be food for a Week\u2019s stroll in the Summer? Do not they like this better than what they can read through before Mrs. Williams comes down stairs? a Morning work at most.\n\n\u201cBesides, a long poem is a test of invention, which I take to be the Polar star of Poetry, as Fancy is the Sails\u2014and Imagination the rudder. Did our great Poets[Pg 35] ever write short Pieces? I mean in the shape of Tales\u2014this same invention seems indeed of late years to have been forgotten as a Poetical excellence\u2014But enough of this, I put on no Laurels till I shall have finished Endymion, and I hope Apollo is not angered at my having made a Mockery at him at Hunt\u2019s\u201d\u2014\u2014\n\nYou see, Bailey, how independent my Writing has been. Hunt\u2019s dissuasion was of no avail\u2014I refused to visit Shelley that I might have my own unfettered scope;\u2014and after all, I shall have the Reputation of Hunt\u2019s \u00e9l\u00e8ve. His corrections and amputations will by the knowing ones be traced in the Poem. This is, to be sure, the vexation of a day, nor would I say so many words about it to any but those whom I know to have my welfare and reputation at heart. Haydon promised to give directions for those Casts, and you may expect to see them soon, with as many Letters\u2014You will soon hear the dinning of Bells\u2014never mind! you and Gleig [29] will defy the foul fiend\u2014But do not sacrifice your health to Books: do take it kindly and not so voraciously. I am certain if you are your own Physician, your Stomach will resume its proper strength and then what great benefits will follow.\u2014My sister wrote a Letter to me, which I think must be at the post-office\u2014Ax Will to see. My Brother\u2019s kindest remembrances to you\u2014we are going to dine at Brown\u2019s where I have some hopes of meeting Reynolds. The little Mercury I have taken has corrected the poison and improved my health\u2014though I feel from my employment that I shall never be again secure in Robustness. Would that you were as well as\n\nYour Sincere friend and brother\n\nJohn Keats.\n\n[Pg 36]\n\nXIX.\u2014TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.\n\n[Hampstead: about November 1, 1817.]\n\nMy dear Bailey\u2014So you have got a Curacy\u2014good, but I suppose you will be obliged to stop among your Oxford favourites during Term time. Never mind. When do you preach your first sermon?\u2014tell me, for I shall propose to the two R.\u2019s [30] to hear it,\u2014so don\u2019t look into any of the old corner oaken pews, for fear of being put out by us. Poor Johnny Moultrie can\u2019t be there. He is ill, I expect\u2014but that\u2019s neither here nor there. All I can say, I wish him as well through it as I am like to be. For this fortnight I have been confined at Hampstead. Saturday evening was my first day in town, when I went to Rice\u2019s\u2014as we intend to do every Saturday till we know not when. We hit upon an old gent we had known some few years ago, and had a veiry pleasante daye. In this world there is no quiet,\u2014nothing but teasing and snubbing and vexation. My brother Tom looked very unwell yesterday, and I am for shipping him off to Lisbon. Perhaps I ship there with him. I have not seen Mrs. Reynolds since I left you, wherefore my conscience smites me. I think of seeing her to-morrow; have you any message? I hope Gleig came soon after I left. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ve written as many lines as you have read volumes, or at least chapters, since I saw you. However, I am in a fair way now to come to a conclusion in at least three weeks, when I assure you I shall be glad to dismount for a month or two; although I\u2019ll keep as tight a rein as possible till then, nor suffer myself to sleep. I will copy for you the opening of the Fourth Book, in which you will see from the manner I had not an opportunity of mentioning any poets, for fear of spoiling the effect of the passage by particularising them.\n\nThus far had I written when I received your last, which made me at the sight of the direction caper for[Pg 37] despair; but for one thing I am glad that I have been neglectful, and that is, therefrom I have received a proof of your utmost kindness, which at this present I feel very much, and I wish I had a heart always open to such sensations; but there is no altering a man\u2019s nature, and mine must be radically wrong, for it will lie dormant a whole month. This leads me to suppose that there are no men thoroughly wicked, so as never to be self-spiritualised into a kind of sublime misery; but, alas! \u2019tis but for an hour. He is the only Man \u201cwho has kept watch on man\u2019s mortality,\u201d who has philanthropy enough to overcome the disposition to an indolent enjoyment of intellect, who is brave enough to volunteer for uncomfortable hours. You remember in Hazlitt\u2019s essay on commonplace people he says, \u201cthey read the Edinburgh and Quarterly, and think as they do.\u201d Now, with respect to Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cGipsy,\u201d I think he is right, and yet I think Hazlitt is right, and yet I think Wordsworth is rightest. If Wordsworth had not been idle, he had not been without his task; nor had the \u201cGipsies\u201d\u2014they in the visible world had been as picturesque an object as he in the invisible. The smoke of their fire, their attitudes, their voices, were all in harmony with the evenings. It is a bold thing to say\u2014and I would not say it in print\u2014but it seems to me that if Wordsworth had thought a little deeper at that moment, he would not have written the poem at all. I should judge it to have been written in one of the most comfortable moods of his life\u2014it is a kind of sketchy intellectual landscape, not a search after truth, nor is it fair to attack him on such a subject; for it is with the critic as with the poet; had Hazlitt thought a little deeper, and been in a good temper, he would never have spied out imaginary faults there. The Sunday before last I asked Haydon to dine with me, when I thought of settling all matters with him in regard to Cripps, and let you know about it. Now, although I engaged him a fortnight before, he sent illness as an excuse. He never will come. I have not[Pg 38] been well enough to stand the chance of a wet night, and so have not seen him, nor been able to expurgatorise more masks for you; but I will not speak\u2014your speakers are never doers. Then Reynolds,\u2014every time I see him and mention you, he puts his hand to his head and looks like a son of Niobe\u2019s; but he\u2019ll write soon.\n\nRome, you know, was not built in a day. I shall be able, by a little perseverance, to read your letters off-hand. I am afraid your health will suffer from over study before your examination. I think you might regulate the thing according to your own pleasure,\u2014and I would too. They were talking of your being up at Christmas. Will it be before you have passed? There is nothing, my dear Bailey, I should rejoice at more than to see you comfortable with a little Peona wife; an affectionate wife, I have a sort of confidence, would do you a great happiness. May that be one of the many blessings I wish you. Let me be but the one-tenth of one to you, and I shall think it great. My brother George\u2019s kindest wishes to you. My dear Bailey, I am,\n\nYour affectionate friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nI should not like to be pages in your way; when in a tolerable hungry mood you have no mercy. Your teeth are the Rock Tarpeian down which you capsize epic poems like mad. I would not for forty shillings be Coleridge\u2019s Lays in your way. I hope you will soon get through this abominable writing in the schools, and be able to keep the terms with more comfort in the hope of retiring to a comfortable and quiet home out of the way of all Hopkinses and black beetles. When you are settled, I will come and take a peep at your church, your house; try whether I shall have grown too lusty for my chair by the fireside, and take a peep at my earliest bower. A question is the best beacon towards a little speculation. Then ask me after my health and spirits. This question ratifies in my mind what I have said above. Health and spirits can only belong unalloyed to the selfish [Pg 39]man\u2014the man who thinks much of his fellows can never be in spirits. You must forgive, although I have only written three hundred lines; they would have been five, but I have been obliged to go to town. Yesterday I called at Lamb\u2019s. St. Jane looked very flush when I first looked in, but was much better before I left.\n\nXX.\u2014TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.\n\n[Fragment from an outside sheet:\n\npostmark London, November 5, 1817.]\n\n... I will speak of something else, or my spleen will get higher and higher\u2014and I am a bearer of the two-edged sword.\u2014I hope you will receive an answer from Haydon soon\u2014if not, Pride! Pride! Pride! I have received no more subscription\u2014but shall soon have a full health, Liberty and leisure to give a good part of my time to him. I will certainly be in time for him. We have promised him one year: let that have elapsed, then do as we think proper. If I did not know how impossible it is, I should say\u2014\u201cdo not at this time of disappointments, disturb yourself about others.\u201d\n\nThere has been a flaming attack upon Hunt in the Endinburgh Magazine. I never read anything so virulent\u2014accusing him of the greatest Crimes, depreciating his Wife, his Poetry, his Habits, his Company, his Conversation. These Philippics are to come out in numbers\u2014called \u201cthe Cockney School of Poetry.\u201d There has been but one number published\u2014that on Hunt\u2014to which they have prefixed a motto from one Cornelius Webb Poetaster\u2014who unfortunately was of our party occasionally at Hampstead and took it into his head to write the following,\u2014something about \u201cwe\u2019ll talk on Wordsworth, Byron, a theme we never tire on;\u201d and so forth till he comes to Hunt and Keats. In the Motto they have put Hunt and Keats in large letters\u2014I have no doubt that the second number was intended for me: but have hopes of its non-appearance, from the[Pg 40] following Advertisement in last Sunday\u2019s Examiner:\u2014\u201cTo Z.\u2014The Writer of the Article signed Z., in Blackwood\u2019s Edinburgh Magazine for October 1817 is invited to send his address to the printer of the Examiner, in order that Justice may be Executed on the proper person.\u201d I don\u2019t mind the thing much\u2014but if he should go to such lengths with me as he has done with Hunt, I must infallibly call him to an Account if he be a human being, and appears in Squares and Theatres, where we might possibly meet\u2014I don\u2019t relish his abuse....\n\nXXI.\u2014TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.\n\n[Hampstead, November 1817.]\n\nMy dear Dilke\u2014Mrs. Dilke or Mr. Wm. Dilke, whoever of you shall receive this present, have the kindness to send pr. bearer Sibylline Leaves, and your petitioner shall ever pray as in duty bound.\n\nGiven under my hand this Wednesday morning of Novr. 1817.\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nVivant Rex et Regina\u2014amen.\n\nXXII.\u2014TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.\n\n[Burford Bridge, November 22, 1817.]\n\nMy dear Bailey\u2014I will get over the first part of this (unsaid [31] ) Letter as soon as possible, for it relates to the affairs of poor Cripps.\u2014To a Man of your nature such a Letter as Haydon\u2019s must have been extremely cutting\u2014What occasions the greater part of the World\u2019s Quarrels?\u2014simply this\u2014two Minds meet, and do not understand each other time enough to prevent any shock or surprise at the conduct of either party\u2014As soon as I had known Haydon three days, I had got enough of his Character not to have been surprised at such a Letter as he has hurt you[Pg 41] with. Nor, when I knew it, was it a principle with me to drop his acquaintance; although with you it would have been an imperious feeling. I wish you knew all that I think about Genius and the Heart\u2014and yet I think that you are thoroughly acquainted with my innermost breast in that respect, or you could not have known me even thus long, and still hold me worthy to be your dear Friend. In passing, however, I must say one thing that has pressed upon me lately, and increased my Humility and capability of submission\u2014and that is this truth\u2014Men of Genius are great as certain ethereal Chemicals operating on the Mass of neutral intellect\u2014but they have not any individuality, any determined Character\u2014I would call the top and head of those who have a proper self Men of Power.\n\nBut I am running my head into a subject which I am certain I could not do justice to under five Years\u2019 study, and 3 vols. octavo\u2014and, moreover, I long to be talking about the Imagination\u2014so my dear Bailey, do not think of this unpleasant affair, if possible do not\u2014I defy any harm to come of it\u2014I defy. I shall write to Cripps this week, and request him to tell me all his goings-on from time to time by Letter wherever I may be. It will go on well\u2014so don\u2019t because you have suddenly discovered a Coldness in Haydon suffer yourself to be teased\u2014Do not my dear fellow\u2014O! I wish I was as certain of the end of all your troubles as that of your momentary start about the authenticity of the Imagination. I am certain of nothing but of the holiness of the Heart\u2019s affections, and the truth of Imagination. What the Imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth\u2014whether it existed before or not,\u2014for I have the same idea of all our passions as of Love: they are all, in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty. In a Word, you may know my favourite speculation by my first Book, and the little Song I sent in my last, which is a representation from the fancy of the probable mode of operating in these Matters. The Imagination may be compared to Adam\u2019s dream,\u2014he[Pg 42] awoke and found it truth: [32] \u2014I am more zealous in this affair, because I have never yet been able to perceive how anything can be known for truth by consecutive reasoning\u2014and yet it must be. Can it be that even the greatest Philosopher ever arrived at his Goal without putting aside numerous objections? However it may be, O for a life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts! It is \u201ca Vision in the form of Youth,\u201d a shadow of reality to come\u2014And this consideration has further convinced me,\u2014for it has come as auxiliary to another favourite speculation of mine,\u2014that we shall enjoy ourselves hereafter by having what we called happiness on Earth repeated in a finer tone\u2014And yet such a fate can only befall those who delight in Sensation, rather than hunger as you do after Truth. Adam\u2019s dream will do here, and seems to be a Conviction that Imagination and its empyreal reflection, is the same as human life and its spiritual repetition. But, as I was saying, the Simple imaginative Mind may have its rewards in the repetition of its own silent Working coming continually on the Spirit with a fine Suddenness\u2014to compare great things with small, have you never by being surprised with an old Melody, in a delicious place by a delicious voice, felt over again your very speculations and surmises at the time it first operated on your soul?\u2014do you not remember forming to yourself the Singer\u2019s face\u2014more beautiful than it was possible, and yet with the elevation of the Moment you did not think so? Even then you were mounted on the Wings of Imagination, so high that the prototype must be hereafter\u2014that delicious face you will see. What a time! I am continually running away from the subject. Sure this cannot[Pg 43] be exactly the Case with a complex mind\u2014one that is imaginative, and at the same time careful of its fruits,\u2014who would exist partly on Sensation, partly on thought\u2014to whom it is necessary that years should bring the philosophic Mind? Such a one I consider yours, and therefore it is necessary to your eternal happiness that you not only drink this old Wine of Heaven, which I shall call the redigestion of our most ethereal Musings upon Earth, but also increase in knowledge and know all things. I am glad to hear that you are in a fair way for Easter. You will soon get through your unpleasant reading, and then!\u2014but the world is full of troubles, and I have not much reason to think myself pestered with many.\n\nI think Jane or Marianne has a better opinion of me than I deserve: for, really and truly, I do not think my Brother\u2019s illness connected with mine\u2014you know more of the real Cause than they do; nor have I any chance of being rack\u2019d as you have been. You perhaps at one time thought there was such a thing as worldly happiness to be arrived at, at certain periods of time marked out,\u2014you have of necessity from your disposition been thus led away\u2014I scarcely remember counting upon any Happiness\u2014I look not for it if it be not in the present hour,\u2014nothing startles me beyond the moment. The Setting Sun will always set me to rights, or if a Sparrow come before my Window, I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel. The first thing that strikes me on hearing a Misfortune having befallen another is this\u2014\u201cWell, it cannot be helped: he will have the pleasure of trying the resources of his Spirit\u201d\u2014and I beg now, my dear Bailey, that hereafter should you observe anything cold in me not to put it to the account of heartlessness, but abstraction\u2014for I assure you I sometimes feel not the influence of a passion or affection during a whole Week\u2014and so long this sometimes continues, I begin to suspect myself, and the genuineness of my feelings at other times\u2014thinking them a few barren Tragedy Tears.\n\nMy brother Tom is much improved\u2014he is going to[Pg 44] Devonshire\u2014whither I shall follow him. At present, I am just arrived at Dorking\u2014to change the Scene\u2014change the Air, and give me a spur to wind up my Poem, of which there are wanting 500 lines. I should have been here a day sooner, but the Reynoldses persuaded me to stop in Town to meet your friend Christie. There were Rice and Martin\u2014we talked about Ghosts. I will have some Talk with Taylor and let you know,\u2014when please God I come down at Christmas. I will find that Examiner if possible. My best regards to Gleig, my Brothers\u2019 to you and Mrs. Bentley.\n\nYour affectionate Friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nI want to say much more to you\u2014a few hints will set me going. Direct Burford Bridge near Dorking.\n\nXXIII.\u2014TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.\n\n[Burford Bridge,] November 22, 1817.\n\nMy dear Reynolds\u2014There are two things which tease me here\u2014one of them Cripps, and the other that I cannot go with Tom into Devonshire. However, I hope to do my duty to myself in a week or so; and then I\u2019ll try what I can do for my neighbour\u2014now, is not this virtuous? On returning to Town I\u2019ll damm all Idleness\u2014indeed, in superabundance of employment, I must not be content to run here and there on little two-penny errands, but turn Rakehell, i.e. go a masking, or Bailey will think me just as great a Promise Keeper as he thinks you; for myself I do not, and do not remember above one complaint against you for matter o\u2019 that. Bailey writes so abominable a hand, to give his Letter a fair reading requires a little time: so I had not seen, when I saw you last, his invitation to Oxford at Christmas. I\u2019ll go with you. You know how poorly Rice was. I do not think it was all corporeal,\u2014bodily pain was not used to keep him silent. I\u2019ll tell you what; he was hurt at what your Sisters said about his joking with your Mother, he was,[Pg 45] soothly to sain. It will all blow over. God knows, my dear Reynolds, I should not talk any sorrow to you\u2014you must have enough vexations\u2014so I won\u2019t any more. If I ever start a rueful subject in a letter to you\u2014blow me! Why don\u2019t you?\u2014now I am going to ask you a very silly Question neither you nor anybody else could answer, under a folio, or at least a Pamphlet\u2014you shall judge\u2014why don\u2019t you, as I do, look unconcerned at what may be called more particularly Heart-vexations? They never surprise me\u2014lord! a man should have the fine point of his soul taken off to become fit for this world.\n\nI like this place very much. There is Hill and Dale and a little River. I went up Box hill this Evening after the Moon\u2014\u201cyou a\u2019 seen the Moon\u201d\u2014came down, and wrote some lines. Whenever I am separated from you, and not engaged in a continued Poem, every letter shall bring you a lyric\u2014but I am too anxious for you to enjoy the whole to send you a particle. One of the three books I have with me is Shakspeare\u2019s Poems: I never found so many beauties in the sonnets\u2014they seem to be full of fine things said unintentionally\u2014in the intensity of working out conceits. Is this to be borne? Hark ye!\n\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\n\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the head,\n\nAnd Summer\u2019s green all girded up in sheaves,\n\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly head.\n\nHe has left nothing to say about nothing or anything: for look at snails\u2014you know what he says about Snails\u2014you know when he talks about \u201ccockled Snails\u201d\u2014well, in one of these sonnets, he says\u2014the chap slips into\u2014no! I lie! this is in the Venus and Adonis: the simile brought it to my Mind.\n\nAs the snail, whose tender horns being hit,\n\nShrinks back into his shelly cave with pain,\n\nAnd there all smothered up in shade doth sit,\n\nLong after fearing to put forth again;\n\nSo at his bloody view her eyes are fled,\n\nInto the deep dark Cabins of her head.\n\n[Pg 46]He overwhelms a genuine Lover of poesy with all manner of abuse, talking about\u2014\n\n\u201ca poet\u2019s rage\n\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song.\u201d\n\nWhich, by the bye, will be a capital motto for my poem, won\u2019t it? He speaks too of \u201cTime\u2019s antique pen\u201d\u2014and \u201cApril\u2019s first-born flowers\u201d\u2014and \u201cDeath\u2019s eternal cold.\u201d\u2014By the Whim-King! I\u2019ll give you a stanza, because it is not material in connection, and when I wrote it I wanted you\u2014to give your vote, pro or con.\u2014\n\nCrystalline Brother of the belt of Heaven,\n\nAquarius! to whom King Jove hath given\n\nTwo liquid pulse-streams, \u2019stead of feather\u2019d wings\u2014\n\nTwo fan-like fountains\u2014thine illuminings\n\nFor Dian play:\n\nDissolve the frozen purity of air;\n\nLet thy white shoulders, silvery and bare,\n\nShow cold through wat\u2019ry pinions: make more bright\n\nThe Star-Queen\u2019s Crescent on her marriage night:\n\nHaste, haste away!\n\n... I see there is an advertisement in the Chronicle to Poets\u2014he is so over-loaded with poems on the \u201clate Princess.\u201d I suppose you do not lack\u2014send me a few\u2014lend me thy hand to laugh a little\u2014send me a little pullet-sperm, a few finch-eggs\u2014and remember me to each of our card-playing Club. When you die you will all be turned into Dice, and be put in pawn with the devil: for cards, they crumple up like anything....\n\nI rest Your affectionate friend\n\nJohn Keats.\n\nGive my love to both houses\u2014hinc atque illinc.\n\nXXIV.\u2014TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.\n\nHampstead, December 22, 1817.\n\nMy dear Brothers\u2014I must crave your pardon for not having written ere this....

His parents were Thomas Keats, a hostler at the stables at the Swan and Hoop Inn, which he would later manage, and Frances Jennings. He had three younger siblings: George, Thomas, and Frances Mary, known as Fanny. His father died in April 1804 in a horse riding accident, without leaving a will.\n\nIn 1803, Keats was sent to John Clarke's school in Enfield, which was close to his grandparents\u2019 house and had a curriculum that was more progressive and modern than what was found in similar institutions. John Clarke fostered his interest in classical studies and history. Charles Cowden Clarke, who was the headmaster\u2019s son, became a mentor figure for Keats, and introduced him to Renaissance writers Torquato Tasso, Spenser, and the works of George Chapman. A temperamental boy, young Keats was both indolent and belligerent, but starting at age 13, he channeled his energies into the pursuit of academic excellence, to the point that, in midsummer 1809, he won his first academic prize.\n\nJohn Keats, English Romantic poet. Culture Club / Getty Images\n\nWhen Keats was 14, his mother died of tuberculosis, and Richard Abbey and Jon Sandell were appointed as the children's guardians. That same year, Keats left John Clarke to become an apprentice to surgeon and apothecary Thomas Hammond, who was the doctor of his mother\u2019s side of the family. He lived in the attic above Hammond\u2019s practice until 1813.\n\nEarly Work\n\nKeats wrote his first poem, \u201cAn Imitation of Spenser,\u201d in 1814, aged 19. After finishing his apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats enrolled as a medical student at Guy\u2019s Hospital in October 1815. While there, he started assisting senior surgeons at the hospital during surgeries, which was a job of significant responsibility. His job was time consuming and it hindered his creative output, which caused significant distress. He had ambition as a poet, and he admired the likes of Leigh Hunt and Lord Byron.\n\nHe received his apothecary license in 1816, which allowed him to be a professional apothecary, physician, and surgeon, but instead, he announced to his guardian that he would pursue poetry. His first printed poem was the sonnet \u201cO Solitude,\u201d which appeared in Leigh Hunt\u2019s magazine The Examiner. In the summer of 1816, while vacationing with Charles Cowden Clarke in the town of Margate, he started working on \u201cCaligate.\u201d Once that summer was over, he resumed his studies to become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nKeats House, Hampstead, London, 1912.

He published his first collection, Poems, which includes \u201cSleep and poetry\u201d and \u201cI stood Tiptoe,\u201d but it was panned by the critics. Charles and James Ollier, the publishers, felt ashamed of it, and the collection aroused little interest. Keats promptly went to other publishers, Taylor and Hessey, who strongly supported his work and, one month after the publication of Poems, he already had an advance and a contract for a new book. Hessey also became a close friend of Keats. Through him and his partner, Keats met the Eton-educated lawyer Richard Woodhouse, a fervent admirer of Keats who would serve as his legal advisor. Woodhouse became an avid collector of Keats-related materials, known as Keatsiana, and his collection is, to this day, one of the most important sources of informations on Keats' work. The young poet also became part of William Hazlitt\u2019s circle, which cemented his reputation as an exponent of a new school of poetry.\n\nUpon formally leaving his hospital training in December 1816, Keats' health took a major hit. He left the damp rooms of London in favor of the village of Hampstead in April 1817 to live with his brothers, but both he and his brother George ended up taking care of their brother Tom, who had contracted tuberculosis. This new living situation brought him close to Samuel T. Coleridge, an elder poet of the first generation of Romantics, who lived in Highgate. On April 11, 1818, the two took a walk together on Hampstead Heath, where they talked about \u201cnightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, and metaphysics.\u201d\n\nVintage engraving from 1874 showing Lord Byron, Robert Southey, Walter Scott, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats and Robert Montgomery. duncan1890 / Getty Images\n\nIn the Summer of 1818, Keats started touring Scotland, Ireland, and the Lake District, but by July of 1818, while on the Isle of Mull, he caught a terrible cold that debilitated him to the point that he had to return South. Keats' brother, Tom, died of Tuberculosis on December 1st, 1818.\n\nA Great Year (1818-19)\n\nOde on a Grecian Urn Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,\n\nThou foster-child of silence and slow time,\n\nSylvan historian, who canst thus express\n\nA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\n\nWhat leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape\n\nOf deities or mortals, or of both,\n\nIn Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\n\nWhat men or gods are these?

What wild ecstasy? \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn,\u201d lines 1\u201410\n\nKeats moved to Wentworth place, on the edge of Hampstead Heath, the property of his friend Charles Armitage Brown. This is the period when he wrote his most mature work: five out of his six great odes were composed in the Spring of 1819: \"Ode to Psyche,\" \"Ode to a Nightingale,\" \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Ode on Melancholy,\" \"Ode on Indolence.\" In 1818, he also published Endymion, which, much like Poems, was not appreciated by critics. Harsh assessments include \u201cimperturbable drivelling idiocy\u201d by John Gibson Lockhart for The Quarterly Review, who also thought that Keats would have been better off resuming his career as an apothecary, deeming \u201cto be a starved apothecary\u201d a wiser thing than a starved poet. Lockhart was also the one who lumped together Hunt, Hazlitt, and Keats as member as \u201cthe Cockney School,\u201d which was spiteful of both their poetic style and their lack of a traditional elite education that also signified belonging to the aristocracy or upper class.\n\nAt some point in 1819, Keats was so short on money that he considered becoming a journalist or a surgeon on a ship. In 1819, he also wrote \"The Eve of St. Agnes,\" \"La Belle Dame sans Merci,\" \"Hyperion,\" \"Lamia,\" and the play Otho the Great. He presented these poems to his publishers for consideration for a new book project, but they were unimpressed by them. They criticized \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" for its \"sense of pettish disgust,\" while they considered \"Don Juan\" unfit for ladies.\n\nRome (1820-21)\n\nOver the course of the year 1820, Keats\u2019 symptoms of tuberculosis got more and more serious. He coughed up blood twice in February of 1820 and then was bled by the attending physician. Leigh Hunt took care of him, but after the summer, Keats had to agree to move to Rome with his friend Joseph Severn. The voyage, via the ship Maria Crowther, was not smooth, as dead calm alternated with storms and, upon docking, they were quarantined due to a cholera outbreak in Britain. He arrived in Rome on November 14, even though by that time, he could no longer find the warmer climate that was recommended to him for his health. Upon getting to Rome, Keats also started having stomach problems on top of respiratory problems, and he was denied opium for pain relief, as it was thought he might use it as a quick way to commit suicide. Despite Severn\u2019s nursing, Keats was in a constant state of agony to the point that upon waking up, he would cry because he was still alive.\n\nDeath\n\nJohn Keats' etter to his sister Fanny Keats at the beginning of his last illness, with mention of his poems 'Hyperion'; 'Lamia' etc which had just been published. 14 August 1820.

His tombstone bears the inscription \u201cHere lies One whose Name was writ in Water.\u201d Seven weeks after the funeral, Shelley wrote the elegy Adonais, which memorialized Keats. It contains 495 lines and 55 Spenserian stanzas.\n\nBright Stars: Female Acquaintances\n\nBright Star Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art\u2014\n\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night\n\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\n\nLike nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,\n\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\n\nOf pure ablution round earth's human shores,\n\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\n\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors\u2014\n\nNo\u2014yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,\n\nPillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,\n\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\n\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\n\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\n\nAnd so live ever\u2014or else swoon to death.\n\nThere were two important women in John Keats\u2019 life. The first one was Isabella Jones, whom he met in 1817. Keats was both intellectually and sexually attracted to her, and wrote about frequenting \u201cher rooms\u201d in the winter of 1818-19 and about their physical relationship, saying that he \u201cwarmed with her\u201d and \u201ckissed her\u201d in letters to his brother George. He then met Fanny Brawne in the fall of 1818. She had talent for dressmaking, languages, and a theatrical bent. By late fall 1818, their relationship had deepened, and, throughout the following year, Keats lent her books such as Dante\u2019s Inferno. By the summer of 1819, they had an informal engagement, mainly due to Keats\u2019 dire straits, and their relationship remained unconsummated. In the last months of their relationship, Keats\u2019 love took a darker and melancholic turn, and in poems such as \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" and \"The Eve of St. Agnes,\" love is closely associated with death. They parted in September 1820 when Keats, due to his deteriorating health, was advised to move to warmer climates. He left for Rome knowing that death was near: he died five months later.\n\nThe famed sonnet \"Bright Star\" was first composed for Isabella Jones, but he gave it to Fanny Brawne after revising it.\n\nThemes and Literary Style\n\nKeats often juxtaposed the comic and the serious in poems that are not primarily funny. Much like his fellow Romantics, Keats struggled with the legacy of prominent poets before him. They retained an oppressive power that hindered the liberation of the imagination. Milton is the most notable case: Romantics both worshipped him and tried to distance themselves from him, and the same happened to Keats. His first Hyperion displayed Miltonic influences, which led him to discard it, and critics saw it as a poem \u201cthat might have been written by John Milton, but one that was unmistakably by no other than John Keats.\u201d\n\nThe gravestone of poet John Keats, (1795-1821), stands in Rome's 'Non Catholic Cemetery' on March 26, 2013 in Rome, Italy. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images\n\nPoet William Butler Yeats, in the eloquent simplicities of Per Amica Silentia Lunae, saw Keats as having \u201cbeen born with that thirst for luxury common to many at the outsetting of the Romantic Movement,\u201d and thought therefore that the poet of To Autumn \u201cbut gave us his dream of luxury.\u201d\n\nLegacy\n\nKeats died young, aged 25, with only a three-year-long writing career. Nonetheless, he left a substantial body of work that makes him more than a \u201cpoet of promise.\u201d His mystique was also heightened by his alleged humble origins, as he was presented as a lowlife and someone who received a sparse education.\n\nShelley, in his preface to Adonais (1821), described Keats as \"delicate,\" \"fragile,\" and \"blighted in the bud\": \"a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished ... The bloom, whose petals nipt before they blew / Died on the promise of the fruit,\" wrote Shelley.\n\nKeats himself underestimated his writerly ability. \"I have left no immortal work behind me\u2014nothing to make my friends proud of my memory\u2014but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember\u2019d,\" he wrote to Fanny Brawne.\n\nRichard Monckton Milnes published the first biography of Keats in 1848, which fully inserted him into the canon. The Encyclopaedia Britannica extolled the virtues of Keats in numerous instances: in 1880, Swinburne wrote in his entry on John Keats that \"the Ode to a Nightingale, [is] one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages,\" while the 1888 edition stated that, \"Of these [odes] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that of to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn.\" In the 20th century, Wilfred Owen, W.B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot were all inspired by Keats.\n\nAs far as other arts are concerned, given how sensual his writing was, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood admired him, and painters depicted scenes of Keats poems, such as \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci,\" \"The Eve of St. Agnes,\" and \"Isabella.\"\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://litpriest.com/authors/john-keats/", "page_content": "John Keats was an English poet who belonged to the period of Romanticism in English literature- dedicated himself to the perfection of poetry. His poetry is marked by the intense use of imagery of classical legend articulated by philosophy. John Keats was born on 31st October 1795. Along with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron, he was one of the prominent figures of the Romantic poets of the second generation. However, his works were published four years before his death. He died of tuberculosis on 23rd February 1821 at the age of 25.\n\nThough the critics of his time did not receive his work very well, his reputation as the greatest Romantic grew after his death. At the end of the 19th century, he was regarded as one of the most beloved English poets, of all poets. He influenced a significant number of poets and writers significantly. For instance, Jorge Luis Borges, an Argentine short-story writer, poet, essayist, and translator, commented that the most significant literary experience he had in his life was his first encounter with the work of Keats.\n\nA Short Biography of John Keats\n\nJohn Keats was born in Morefield. He was the son of a hostler and stable keeper, thus born in the stable of the swan and Hoop Inn, London. His father, Thomas Keats, died when he was just eight years old. Adding to the misfortune of John Keats, his mother, Frances Jennings Keats, was also diagnosed with tuberculosis when he was fourteen years old. His life and metal health was greatly influenced by these tragic events and brought him closer to his siblings. He has two brothers Tom and George, and one sister, Fanny.\n\nKeats tried to find ease and escape in art and literature when his parents died. He was an insatiable reader at the Enfield Academy. Keats was closely associated with the headmaster, John Clark, of the academy as he proved to be a fatherly figure to Keats. Clark encouraged him to develop his interest in the young orphan in literature and art.\n\nIn 1810, John Keats withdrew from the Enfield Academy and started pursuing the career of a surgeon. In 1816, he completed his medical education and was appointed as the certified apothecary in the hospital in London. Despite pursuing the medical career, Keats\u2019 devotion to literature and art never ended. In the meantime, through a close friend Cowden Clarke, he became familiar with the editor Leigh Hunt of The Examiner. In 1817, he shifted back to London. However, his friendship with Hunt still continued.\n\nThe year 1819 is marked with the ups and downs for John Keats. He received very harsh criticism from the critics on his long poem \u201cEndymion,\u201d which discouraged him a lot. When he moved to Hampstead, he met with the Brawne family. Fanny Brawne, the daughter of the Browne family, was a beautiful girl. Though she was five years younger than Keats, he fell in deep love with her. Soon after, Keats and Fanny Brawne got engaged. It was during this period that Keats wrote his famous poem \u201cOde to a Nightingale\u201d and Ode to Grecian Urn.\u201d\n\nIn 1820, Keats was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was very well nursed by Fanny Brawne. Though he was severely ill, he tried his best to finish the last poem, and ultimately it received the admiration of a lot of people. However, he gave up writing poetry due to his ailing condition and shifted to Italy for treatment with friend Joseph Severn. He could not survive the disease and died. He was buried in Rome.\n\nJohn Keats\u2019 Writing style\n\nThe writing style of John Keats is overwhelmed by poetic devices such as personification, alliteration, metaphors, assonance, and consonance. These devices are put together, which creates the music and rhythm in the poems. For example, his poem \u201cOde to the Nightingale\u201d is full of literary devices. Similarly, his poetry is also characterized by sensual imagery. His poems \u201cLamia,\u201d \u201cHyperion,\u201d \u201cOde to the Nightingale,\u201d and \u201cEndymion\u201d are the best examples of sensual imagery.\n\nMoreover, the diction used by Keats is also connotative. For example, in the poem, \u201cOde to the Grecian Urn,\u201d Keats implied formal diction:\n\n\u201cHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\n\nAre sweeter: therefore, ye soft pipes, play on \u2026\u201d\n\nThe uses of formal diction \u201cye\u201d in the above lines.\n\nThe odes written by Keats are a unique achievement in poetry. Keats\u2019s odes are usually a lyrical reflection on something that stimulates the poet to encounter his own inner desires, to think about his own longings and their relationship with the harsh reality of the outer world.\n\nBeing the last romantic poet, he shows the typical aspects of Romanticism in his poetry. Though Keats wrote for only three years, the poems he wrote in these three years become the hallmark of the literary canon and make him one of the greatest and most celebrated poets in English Literature. Though the themes of his poems are not concerned with nature, he implied the poetic devices to make his poetry gentle and romantic. Misery, death, love, and nature are the main aspects of Romantic poetry, and the readers also find these aspects in the poetry of Keats\u2019 as well.\n\nSimilarly, in Romanticism, we also find the appreciation of past writers, mythology, and Latin. We observe that Keats\u2019s poetry also observes these rules.\n\nThough Keats\u2019 style of writing poetry is unique, his manner of poetry is immensely suggestive of Edmund Spenser. Keats and other traditional Romantics would likely focus on the remote past, ancient myth, and fairy tales to escape from the harsh realities of life and the unwelcoming modern 19th century. The material of Keats\u2019 poem \u201cEndymion\u201d is found in remote antiquity instead of the Middle Ages. In essence, he used the manner of Middle Ages poetry in his poems \u201cEve of St. Agnes\u201d and \u201cLa Belle Dame sans Merci.\u201d\n\nKeats writes his poetry in rhymed iambic pentameter; however, it is not exactly like the simple heroic couplet used by the poet of the previous century. We seldom find end-stops at the end of the poetry. He uses enjambment normally as his verses flow into one another, particularly in a narrative poem. For example, in the poem \u201cOde to the Nightingale\u201d has the poetic device enjambment as follows:\n\n\u201cMy sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\n\nOr emptied some dull opiate to the drains.\u201d\n\nTo present the individual characters in the poem, Keats never coupled the narrative and the dramatic power. He would display the characters with expressive moods as he had mastered the lyrical powers. The moods were often romantic, pensive, lethargic, sadness, or ecstatic delight. These moods can greatly be observed in his odes.\n\nThe following are the characteristics of Keats\u2019 poetry.\n\nQuest for Beauty\n\nLike other Romantic poets, Keats also focused on understanding and exploring the beauty of nature in his poems. According to Keats, there is beauty in every object of the universe, and as a poet, it is his job to look for it and incarcerate it in his poetry. According to Keats, a person becomes aware of the truth when he identifies and understands the concept of beauty. In his poem \u201cOde to Grecian Urn,\u201d he writes in the final lines that\n\n\u201cBeauty is truth, truth beauty \u2014 that is all\n\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.\u201d\n\nEmphasis on Ordinary Things\n\nKeats, unlike the Romantic poets, emphasizes on the ordinary and common things in his poetry, particularly in efforts to understand beauty. Though famous Romantic poet, P.B. Shelley wrote about imperceptible things in his poetry, Keats emphasizes the identifiable and close object such as the dew of the season in autumn. Once Keats wrote, in his letter that \u201cIf a sparrow comes before my window, I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel.\u201d This proposes that Keats always look for beauty in the ordinary things like sunset, sunrise, mountain, and valleys, etc.\n\nExclusion of Self\n\nWhile exploring and identifying the beauty of ordinary things in his poetry, Keats disposed of his personality that would dictate his exploration. In doing so, he aligned himself to the father of English Drama, William Shakespeare. Keats found Shakespeare to be able to write about ordinary things as he refrained from expressing fondness to anything.\n\nOdal Hymns\n\nThe six odes that Keats wrote to the physical objects is one of the most famous sets of Keats poetry. These odes are to the urn, autumn, a nightingale, indolence, psyche, and melancholy. These odes are lyrical and are devoted to praising something, thus fall in the Literary and poetic tradition of English odes. The odes are the representatives of the obsession of Keats with exploration and understating the notion of beauty in ordinary things. These odes are the extended imageries, blended with illusory tales about the thing on which they are focusing on. Keats divulges each object and the notion of beauty through the interchange of narration and description."}, {"url": "https://history.rcplondon.ac.uk/inspiring-physicians/sir-john-russell-reynolds", "page_content": "Russell Reynolds was born at Romsey in Hampshire, the son of John Reynolds, a nonconformist minister, and grandson of Henry Revell Reynolds, F.R.C.P, physician to the Middlesex and St. Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician-in-Ordinary to George III. His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859.

Leigh Hunt, as an old Christ's Hospital boy, was probably already acquainted with Reynolds's father, and it must have been through Hunt that in 1816 Reynolds formed the friendship with Keats which has contributed more to the preservation of his name than his own literary efforts. \u2018The Naiad,\u2019 published with other pieces in 1816, is still in the manner of Byron and Scott, but \u2018Fairies,\u2019 one of the minor poems printed along with it, is in the style of Hunt, and much better than the more ambitious effort. All Reynolds's serious poetry is henceforward in a higher key, and Keats's numerous letters to him, beginning in March 1817, and contributed by Reynolds himself to Lord Houghton's memoir of Keats, show that he was regarded as on a footing of full intellectual equality. Reynolds addressed a fine sonnet to Keats, and Keats's own lines on Robin Hood were prompted by Reynolds's sonnets to this popular hero, and the last and best of Keats's poetical epistles was addressed to him. There is indeed hardly another correspondent to whom Keats expresses himself so unreservedly, or who has called forth so many of his best and deepest thoughts. Upon the completion of his \u2018Endymion,\u2019 Keats projected a series of metrical versions of Boccaccio's tales in conjunction with Reynolds, his own contribution to which was his \u2018Isabella, or the Pot of Basil,\u2019 while Reynolds wrote \u2018The Garden of Florence\u2019 and \u2018The Ladye of Provence,\u2019 which he published later. Hunt, in an article in the \u2018Examiner,\u2019 bracketed Reynolds's name with Keats and Shelley, but in 1818 he was in great measure diverted from poetry by receiving an advantageous offer to enter the office of Mr. Fladgate, a solicitor, and expressed his feelings in a sonnet which Mr. Buxton Forman justly calls charming, and which, with two or three other slight compositions of the same nature, stands at the head of his poetry. He produced, nevertheless, a highly successful farce, \u2018One, Two, Three, Four, Five,\u2019 in 1819, and in the same year published an anonymous travesty of Wordsworth, under the title of \u2018Peter Bell,\u2019 before the actual appearance of Wordsworth's poem of that name, and hence termed by Shelley \u2018the ante-natal Peter.\u2019 Some of Wordsworth's more obvious peculiarities are taken off with fair success, but the piece cannot be compared with the parody in the \u2018Rejected Addresses,\u2019 or with the Ettrick Shepherd's \u2018Flying Tailor.\u2019 It is said, however, to have been the work of a single day, and Coleridge attributed it positively to Charles Lamb. In 1820 Reynolds produced another humorous volume, \u2018The Fancy, a Selection from the Poetical Remains of the late Peter Corcoran,\u2019 including a burlesque tragedy and \u2018The Fields of Tothill,\u2019 a poem in the manner of \u2018Don Juan.\u2019 He also wrote in Thomas Jonathan Wooler's \u2018Black Dwarf.\u2019\n\nEarly in 1820 Reynolds went to the continent, which probably occasioned the discontinuance of his correspondence with Keats. There was no estrangement, for in a letter dated from Rome in November 1820 Keats expresses his regret at not having been able to write to him. His versions from Boccaccio appeared in 1821, shortly after the death of Keats, under the title of \u2018The Garden of Florence, and other Poems,\u2019 and with the pseudonym of \u2018John Hamilton.\u2019 The preface contains a brief and affecting tribute to Keats. After the sonnets, the best poem is \u2018The Romance of Youth,\u2019 the first canto of an unfinished poem in the Spenserian stanza, intended to depict the disillusionment of genius by contact with the world, and an intimation that such had been the destiny of the author. Reynolds was by this time fully committed to the law, and, according to the elder Dilke, had a prospect of making a fortune through the generosity of James Rice, Keats's friend, who not only defrayed the expenses of his certificate, but took him into partnership, and subsequently gave up a lucrative practice in his favour. \u2018Reynolds unhappily threw away this certain fortune,\u2019 how is not explained. He had married about 1821, and, though forsaking poetry, had by no means relinquished literature, writing in the \u2018London Magazine\u2019 under the signature \u2018Edward Herbert\u2019 until the end of 1824, and afterwards contributing to the \u2018Edinburgh,\u2019 \u2018Westminster,\u2019 and \u2018Retrospective\u2019 reviews. His connection with the \u2018London Magazine\u2019 made him acquainted with Thomas Hood, who in 1824 married his sister Jane. Hood and he were for a time intimate friends; they combined in writing \u2018Odes and Addresses to Celebrated Persons,\u2019 1825; and \u2018Lycus the Centaur\u2019 was dedicated to Reynolds; but their friendship was succeeded by a bitter estrangement, the cause of which is not told. Reynolds was one of the proprietors of the \u2018Athen\u00e6um,\u2019 and a curious letter from him protesting against Dilke's reduction of its price is printed in Sir Charles Dilke's preface \u200bto his grandfather's \u2018Papers of a Critic.\u2019 He disposed of his share in 1831, but contributed for several years afterwards. His last independent work was a not very brilliant farce, entitled \u2018Confounded Foreigners\u2019 (1838, printed in Webster's \u2018Acting National Drama,\u2019 vol. iii.). Somewhere near this time Reynolds withdrew from London to the Isle of Wight, where he became clerk to the county court, and where he spent the remainder of his days, dying at Node Hill, Newport, 15 Nov. 1852. He was survived by his sister, Charlotte, who was born on 12 May 1802. Keats's song, \u2018Hush, hush, tread softly,\u2019 was composed to a Spanish air played by her on one of many occasions when Keats listened (as he would for hours) to her piano; and she was the heroine of Hood's \u2018Number One.\u2019 Charlotte Reynolds died at Hampstead in November 1884 (Athen\u00e6um, 1884, ii. 770).\n\nReynolds had always been distinguished by sarcastic wit, and is represented as becoming cynical and discontented in his latter years. \u2018The law,\u2019 says a writer in the \u2018Athen\u00e6um,\u2019 \u2018spoiled his literature, and his love of literature and society interfered with the drudging duties of the lawyer.\u2019 \u2018Reynolds,\u2019 says \u2018T. M. T.\u2019 in \u2018Notes and Queries\u2019 (2nd ser. vol. ii. 4 Oct. 1856), \u2018was a man of genius who wanted the devoted purpose and the sustaining power which are requisite to its development. He wrote fitfully. He was one of the most brilliant men I have ever known, though in late years failing health and failing fortune somewhat soured his temper and sharpened his tongue.\u2019 This is no doubt a just judgment. Reynolds's powers as a narrator, though not contemptible, were unequal to the tragic themes he selected from Boccaccio; but it is difficult to think that the author of the fanciful and graceful \u2018Romance of Youth,\u2019 which reveals evident traces of the influence of Shelley, of the finely felt lines on Devon, and of so many excellent songs and sonnets, might not, with something more of Keats's loftiness of aim and unsparing labour, have obtained a highly honourable place among English poets.\n\nA fine photogravure of a portrait of Reynolds by Severn is prefixed to the supplementary volume of Forman's edition of Keats's \u2018Works.\u2019\n\n[Keats's Letters, with Forman's notes; Broderip's Memorials of Thomas Hood; Dilke's Papers of a Critic.; Gent.

In 1818 he went on a walking tour in the Lake District. His exposure and overexertion on that trip brought on the first symptoms of the tuberculosis, which ended his life.\n\nEarly Years\n\nA revered English poet whose short life spanned just 25 years, John Keats was born October 31, 1795, in London, England. He was the oldest of Thomas and Frances Keats\u2019 four children. Keats lost his parents at an early age. He was eight years old when his father, a livery stable-keeper, was killed after being trampled by a horse.\n\nHis father's death had a profound effect on the young boy's life. In a more abstract sense, it shaped Keats' understanding for the human condition, both its suffering and its loss. This tragedy and others helped ground Keats' later poetry\u2014one that found its beauty and grandeur from the human experience.\n\nIn a more mundane sense, Keats' father's death greatly disrupted the family's financial security. His mother, Frances, seemed to have launched a series of missteps and mistakes after her husband\u2019s death; she quickly remarried and just as quickly lost a good portion of the family's wealth. After her second marriage fell apart, Frances left the family, leaving her children in the care of her mother.\n\nShe eventually returned to her children's life, but her life was in tatters. In early 1810, she died of tuberculosis.\n\nDuring this period, Keats found solace and comfort in art and literature. At Enfield Academy, where he started shortly before his father's passing, Keats proved to be a voracious reader. He also became close to the school's headmaster, John Clarke, who served as a sort of a father figure to the orphaned student and encouraged Keats' interest in literature.\n\nBack home, Keats' maternal grandmother turned over control of the family's finances, which was considerable at the time, to a London merchant named Richard Abbey. Overzealous in protecting the family's money, Abbey showed himself to be reluctant to let the Keats children spend much of it. He refused to be forthcoming about how much money the family actually had and in some cases was downright deceitful.\n\nThere is some debate as to whose decision it was to pull Keats out of Enfield, but in the fall of 1810, Keats left the school for studies to become a surgeon. He eventually studied medicine at a London hospital and became a licensed apothecary in 1816.\n\nEarly Poetry\n\nBut Keats' career in medicine never truly took off. Even as he studied medicine, Keats\u2019 devotion to literature and the arts never ceased. Through his friend, Cowden Clarke, whose father was the headmaster at Enfield, Keats met publisher, Leigh Hunt of The Examiner.\n\nHunt's radicalism and biting pen had landed him in prison in 1813 for libeling Prince Regent. Hunt, though, had an eye for talent and was an early supporter of Keats poetry and became his first publisher. Through Hunt, Keats was introduced to a world of politics that was new to him and had greatly influenced what he put on the page. In honor of Hunt, Keats wrote the sonnet, \"Written on the Day that Mr. Leigh Hunt Left Prison.\"\n\nIn addition to affirming Keats' standing as a poet, Hunt also introduced the young poet to a group of other English poets, including Percy Bysshe Shelley and Williams Wordsworth.\n\nIn 1817 Keats leveraged his new friendships to publish his first volume of poetry, Poems by John Keats. The following year, Keats' published \"Endymion,\" a mammoth four-thousand line poem based on the Greek myth of the same name.\n\nKeats had written the poem in the summer and fall of 1817, committing himself to at least 40 lines a day. He completed the work in November of that year and it was published in April 1818.\n\nKeats' daring and bold style earned him nothing but criticism from two of England's more revered publications, Blackwood's Magazine and the Quarterly Review. The attacks were an extension of heavy criticism lobbed at Hunt and his cadre of young poets. The most damning of those pieces had come from Blackwood's, whose piece, \"On the Cockney School of Poetry,\" shook Keats and made him nervous to publish \"Endymion.\"\n\nKeats' hesitation was warranted. Upon its publication the lengthy poem received a lashing from the more conventional poetry community. One critic called the work, the \"imperturbable driveling idiocy of Endymion.\" Others found the four-book structure and its general flow hard to follow and confusing.\n\nRecovering Poet\n\nHow much of an effect this criticism had on Keats is uncertain, but it is clear that he did take notice of it. But Shelley's later accounts of how the criticism destroyed the young poet and led to his declining health, however, have been refuted.\n\nKeats in fact, had already moved beyond \"Endymion\" even before it was published. By the end of 1817, he was reexamining poetry's role in society. In lengthy letters to friends, Keats outlined his vision of a kind of poetry that drew its beauty from real world human experience rather than some mythical grandeur.\n\nKeats was also formulating the thinking behind his most famous doctrine, Negative Capability, which is the idea that humans are capable of transcending intellectual or social constraints and far exceed, creatively or intellectually, what human nature is thought to allow.\n\nIn effect Keats was responding to his critics, and conventional thinking in general, which sought to squeeze the human experience into a closed system with tidy labels and rational relationships. Keats saw a world more chaotic, more creative than what others he felt, would permit.\n\nThe Mature Poet\n\nIn the summer of 1818, Keats took a walking tour in Northern England and Scotland. He returned home later that year to care for his brother, Tom, who'd fallen deeply ill with tuberculosis.\n\nKeats, who around this time fell in love with a woman named Fanny Brawne, continued to write. He'd proven prolific for much of the past year. His work included his first Shakespearean sonnet, \"When I have fears that I may cease to be,\" which was published in January 1818.\n\nTwo months later, Keats published \"Isabella,\" a poem that tells the story of a woman who falls in love with a man beneath her social standing, instead of the man her family has chosen her to marry. The work was based on a story from Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio, and it's one Keats himself would grow to dislike.\n\nHis work also included the beautiful \"To Autumn,\" a sensuous work published in 1820 that describes ripening fruit, sleepy workers, and a maturing sun. The poem, and others, demonstrated a style Keats himself had crafted all his own, one that was filled with more sensualities than any contemporary Romantic poetry.\n\nKeats' writing also revolved around a poem he called \"Hyperion,\" an ambitious Romantic piece inspired by Greek myth that told the story of the Titans' despondency after their losses to the Olympians.\n\nBut the death of Keats' brother halted his writing. He finally returned to the work in late 1819, rewriting his unfinished poem with a new title, \"The Fall of Hyperion,\" which would go unpublished until more than three decades after Keats' death.\n\nThis, of course, speaks to the small audience for Keats' poetry during his lifetime. In all, the poet published three volumes of poetry during his life but managed to sell just a combined 200 copies of his work by the time of his death in 1821. His third and final volume of poetry, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems, was published in July 1820.\n\nOnly with the help of his friends, who pushed hard to secure Keats' legacy, and the work and style of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during the latter half of the 19th century, did Keats' stock rise considerably.\n\nFinal Years and Death\n\nIn 1819 Keats contracted tuberculosis. His health deteriorated quickly. Soon after his last volume of poetry was published, he ventured off to Italy with his close friend, the painter Joseph Severn, on the advice of his doctor, who had told him he needed to be in a warmer climate for the winter.\n\nThe trip marked the end of his romance with Brawne. His health issues and his own dreams of becoming a successful writer had stifled their chances of ever getting married.\n\nKeats arrived in Rome in November of that year and for a brief time started to feel better. But within a month, he was back in bed, suffering from a high temperature. The last few months of his life proved particularly painful for the poet.\n\nHis doctor in Rome placed Keats on a strict diet that consisted of a single anchovy and a piece of bread per day in order to limit the flow of blood to the stomach. He also induced heavy bleeding, resulting in Keats suffering from both a lack of oxygen and a lack of food.\n\nKeats' agony was so severe that at one point he pressed his doctor and asked him, \"How long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on?\"\n\nKeats' death came on February 23, 1821. It's believed he was clutching the hand of his friend, Severn, at the time of his passing.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: John Keats\n\nBirth Year: 1795\n\nBirth date: October 31, 1795\n\nBirth City: London\n\nBirth Country: England\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: English Romantic lyric poet John Keats was dedicated to the perfection of poetry marked by vivid imagery that expressed a philosophy through classical legend.\n\nIndustries\n\nFiction and Poetry\n\nAstrological Sign: Scorpio\n\nDeath Year: 1821\n\nDeath date: February 23, 1821\n\nDeath City: Rome\n\nDeath Country: Italy\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: John Keats Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/john-keats\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: November 12, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://www.theartstory.org/critic/russell-john/", "page_content": "Summary of John Russell\n\nKey Ideas / Information\n\nRussell did not believe that genius was an innate quality; rather it was a quality that was nurtured and educated. All great works of art may only come about once the artist has studied and evolved over time.\n\nWhen new art forms arrive, many consider them replacements for the old, but for Russell, this simply was not the case. Any new worthwhile artwork is directly influenced by its predecessors, and it was new art, more than anything else, that kept the Old Masters alive and relevant.\n\nWhen it came to art criticism, Russell believed that every artist, no matter what their medium or technique, is worthy of receiving the same degree of attention and diligence in a review.

Although seldom cited in the annals of Abstract Expressionist history, Russell's work as a critic was crucial to the continued enthusiasm for modern art well into the 1970s and 80s. Known paradoxically as a tough-minded critic who was nevertheless, perhaps a little too lenient when it came to newer movements in art, Russell wore two masks as an art critic: He was a champion of newer, younger artists like David Hockney and Howard Hodgkin, and was also an accomplished scholar of the Impressionists and subsequent modern movements.Raised by his grandparents in London, Russell attended St. Paul's School and then moved on to study philosophy and economics at Magdalen College at Oxford, where he earned his B.A. in 1940.Russell was interning at the Tate Gallery when the Germans bombed London during the Blitzkrieg of 1940. He was then evacuated to the country town of Worcestershire.Between 1942 and 1945, Russell served in the British Admiralty for the Naval Division. While serving, Russell met the author and journalist Ian Fleming (famous for creating the James Bond novels), who recommended Russell to theas a book reviewer. Now with the, Russell began his career as a professional critic, covering not only books but also art, theater and music.In 1950, the art critic for thewas fired for writing a negative review of an exhibition at the British Royal Academy, and Russell was subsequently promoted to chief art critic. That same year, he also became a corresponding art critic for theDuring the 1950s, Russell took on a diverse and vast amount of writing assignments, and published several books, including a travel book on Switzerland in '50, a biography of the classical Austrian conductor Erich Kleiber in '56, and a history of the city of Paris in 1960.Between 1958 and 1968, Russell sat on the art panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. During this time, the critic played an integral role in curating several exhibitions, including three at the Tate in London (Modigliani, Rouault, and Balthus), and one at the Hayward Gallery in London ().In 1965, Russell wrote a book on Seurat, which many consider to be his best work. A few years later, in 1971, Russell oversaw a traveling exhibition devoted to Vuillard that went from Toronto to Chicago and ended in San Francisco.In 1974, Russell was recruited by thechief art critic Hilton Kramer (who had replaced John Canaday) to move to the U.S. and become a resident art critic. Russell would later become the chief art critic in 1982, a position he held until 1990.In 1975, Russell got married (for a third time) to Rosamond Bernier, an art critic and editor for the Paris magazine, who had recruited Russell to write for the magazine back in the mid-50s. They were married in Philip Johnson's famous Glass House in New Canaan, CT. Pierre Matisse (Henri's son) was the best man, and Leonard Bernstein wrote the wedding march.Russell may have left his chief critic post at thein 1990, but this was no retirement. He continued writing for the, as well as several guest reviews for theBetween 1981 and 2006 Russell edited theon behalf of The Century Association, a New York organization of some two-thousand authors and artists.He died in a Bronx nursing home in 2008 at the age of 89.Russell was not well-known for his prowess as an art historian or scholar, but his work as a critic and author suggest a vast catalogue of knowledge, not to mention an undying appreciation for art in all its forms. He had the unique ability to look at something and instantly know who and what inspired the artist. As a writer, he was quick-witted, elegant and extremely learned, and above all, he communicated the message that all great art is connected by its ability to give generation after generation a sense of who they are.Russell was remembered by artists and other art writers as someone who paid very close attention to the smallest of details and the grandest of visions and, according to the artist Howard Hodgkin, he \"was very determined to make his own criticism as valuable as possible, which meant never selling an artist short by conferring easy or less than deserved praise on his work.\"Much like Baudelaire in 1840, Russell recognized that in his time, new art was being produced at an ever-accelerating rate. As the modern world continued racing ahead, people discovered new needs, and many turned to art to meet those needs. Russell wrote: \"In art, equally, we had needs which could not be satisfied by the Old Masters, because those needs did not exist when the Old Masters were around.\" While there are critics who inevitably reach an end-point where all new art ceases to appear relevant or even good, as was the case with Harold Rosenberg and arguably Robert Hughes, Russell was quite different. For all the greatness of the Old Masters, he felt obliged to appreciate new art because, as history had taught him, when there's a need that can only be satisfied by the beauty of a Munch or Kandinsky, looking at a Manet simply will not do.Like the rest of the art world, Russell clearly saw that no uniquely American art movement had been able to sustain itself prior to 1945. But what fascinated the critic was justAmerica redefined itself in terms of the arts and modernism after World War II. Russell looked deep into American cultural and literary lore to find the roots of modern art, citing Thoreau's, Whitman's, Eliot's, and the various writings of Poe, all as chief precursors to the modern visual revolution that came about in the mid-20th century.In the section of his bookentitled, Russell wrote: \"It would have been difficult, in any case, for American painters to rival the epical assurance with which both Whitman and Melville addressed themselves to an expanding America.\" What changed all of this, in Russell's view, was New York City's arrival as the capital of modern art production, for both native-born Americans and people like himself; emigrants who flocked to New York to become part of the burgeoning art world. \"There are,\" wrote Russell, \"as many New Yorks as there are New Yorkers. New York is a self-devouring, self-renewing city, with which we come to terms as best we can. It is one of the supreme subjects of our century: one for which we would wish Balzac, Dickens and Proust to have been born again.\"Russell didn't believe that Action Painting's arrival as a leading American art form was merely a coincidence, nor did he completely share Harold Rosenberg's view that it was the product of improvised action from the artist's unconscious (a belief that led many to conclude Action Painting was melodramatic and self-indulgent). Russell looked further back in time to pinpoint Action Painting's relevance. \"It arose from an intelligent examination,\" wrote Russell, \"on the part of people who had been serious artists for nearly half a lifetime, as to just why so much of European painting had run itself into the ground. And it stood for an idea current in public life also: that human nature had not said its last word.\"In the paintings of de Kooning, Rauschenberg, Still, and others, Russell shared Rosenberg's view of Action Painting's evolution. These images were \"generated by the very act of applying the paint, without conscious reference to anything in the world outside the studio and with concessions to the divide which once separated painting from drawing, foreground from background and light from shadow.\" But Russell firmly believed there was something learned and psychologically profound in these images; an expressive force that had sprung out of years and years of studying Kandinsky, Klee and L\u00e9ger.Russell wrote of the Abstract Expressionists: \"To speak of them as 'a school' is a matter more of convenience than of historical truth. Yet one thing was common to all of them, and common to most thinking people in the late 1940s: a feeling of 'either/or.' In art, as in so many other departments of life, humanity was being given a fresh start. It was time to stand up and be counted; the question at issue was (or seemed to be)a decisive shift in sensibilitya genteel continuance.\"Russell was not content to group artists like Johns and Rauschenberg with others like Pollock and de Kooning. He saw greatness in all their works, but believed it inaccurate to place them in the same movement or \"school.\" Whereas the so-called Action Painters (Pollock and de Kooning) had supposedly blocked out the world outside the studio in order to work their canvases, there were others who welcomed the world into their work. In writing about Rauschenberg, Russell said: \"He saw it as the function of the artist to work with what is given; and in paintings .. he sieved the dredged filth of New York City as a prospector sieves the sand of the riverbed: for gold.\"As Pop art made its way onto the scene in the late 1950s, Russell saw yet another new occasion for optimism in American modern art. In his writings on Warhol, Lichtenstein and Rosenquist, Russell said, \"There was in Pop art an element of exorcism. It was made to banish evil memories, or to hoist them to a level on which they would lose their power to degrade.\"But Russell's optimism stretched far beyond the boundaries of Pop or Op art. He was always excited by how modern art constantly reinvented itself, and found new ways to draw from historical influences, yet avoided becoming tired and repetitive. New experiments in the application of space and color (found in the works of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland), and the use of new instruments in art (installation, landscapes, found objects, etc.) were all things that motivated the critic to keep writing and praising art as modernism faded and postmodernism arose, long after the writings of critics like Greenberg and Rosenberg had ceased being relevant.In particular, Russell was a huge champion of David Smith, who the critic claimed \"may have been the last major artist to have an absolutely explicit, constructive and sanguine conception of the future of art.\" While it's true that Russell appeared to have loved just about everyone (in reality this is an overstatement), he reserved his greatest praise for those select few who represented the complete artist; one who embodied the past, present and future of Modern art.Russell was revered for his talent as a natural writer. He wrote in a very persuasive, witty tone that his readers found comforting and relatable. Unlike hispredecessor, John Canaday, Russell was not a controversial writer. In fact, some have criticized Russell for being too accepting of most forms of Modern art, and not being critical enough. (There are moments while reading Russell when one may get the impression that he liked just about every work of art he came in contact with.) But the supposed mystery behind Russell's ubiquitous praise was his very keen eye, and a mind that seemed to be its own reference library. Whenever he looked at something, it seemed as though he accessed a dozen or so other works of art. He saw influences right away; nothing was without precedent.Writing in a rhythmic and elegant style that is reminiscent of Gertrude Stein or his fellow countryman Roger Fry, Russell's primary objective in his writing wasn't to promote the arts that were already popular, but to draw well-deserved attention to some of the lesser-known artists in whose work he saw great potential.\"Art in New York was one of the driving, generative forces in the city's cultural life.\"\"It is the highest function of art to tell us who we are.\"\"Modernism is not something that can be learned step by step, like bookkeeping.\"\"I think that art should be allowed to go private. It should be a matter of one-on-one. In the last few years, the public has only heard of art when it makes record prices at auction, or is stolen, or allegedly withheld from its rightful owners. We need to concentrate more on art that sits still some place and minds its own business.\"\"It is difficult in the United States of America to make a mystique of something that has neither social status nor academic status and doesn't make any money.\""}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Ruskin", "page_content": "Ruskin discovered the work of Turner through the illustrations to an edition of Samuel Rogers \u2019s poem Italy given him by a business partner of his father in 1833. By the mid-1830s he was publishing short pieces in both prose and verse in magazines, and in 1836 he was provoked into drafting a reply (unpublished) to an attack on Turner\u2019s painting by the art critic of Blackwood\u2019s Magazine. After five years at the University of Oxford , during which he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry but was prevented by ill health from sitting for an honours degree, Ruskin returned, in 1842, to his abandoned project of defending and explaining the late work of Turner.\n\nThis combination of the religious intensity of the Evangelical Revival and the artistic excitement of English Romantic painting laid the foundations of Ruskin\u2019s later views. In his formative years, painters such as J.M.W. Turner , John Constable , and John Sell Cotman were at the peak of their careers. At the same time religious writers and preachers such as Charles Simeon , John Keble , Thomas Arnold , and John Henry Newman were establishing the spiritual and ethical preoccupations that would characterize the reign of Queen Victoria. Ruskin\u2019s family background in the world of business was significant, too: it not only provided the means for his extensive travels to see paintings, buildings, and landscapes in Britain and continental Europe but also gave him an understanding of the newly rich, middle-class audience for which his books would be written.\n\nRuskin was born into the commercial classes of the prosperous and powerful Britain of the years immediately following the Napoleonic Wars . His father, John James Ruskin, was a Scots wine merchant who had moved to London and made a fortune in the sherry trade. John Ruskin, an only child, was largely educated at home, where he was given a taste for art by his father\u2019s collecting of contemporary watercolours and a minute and comprehensive knowledge of the Bible by his piously Protestant mother.\n\nArt criticism\n\nIn 1843 Ruskin published the first volume of Modern Painters, a book that would eventually consist of five volumes and occupy him for the next 17 years. His first purpose was to insist on the \u201ctruth\u201d of the depiction of Nature in Turner\u2019s landscape paintings. Neoclassical critics had attacked the later work of Turner, with its proto-Impressionist concern for effects of light and atmosphere, for mimetic inaccuracy, and for a failure to represent the \u201cgeneral truth\u201d that had been an essential criterion of painting in the age of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Drawing on his serious amateur interests in geology, botany, and meteorology, Ruskin made it his business to demonstrate in detail that Turner\u2019s work was everywhere based on a profound knowledge of the local and particular truths of natural form. One after another, Turner\u2019s \u201ctruth of tone,\u201d \u201ctruth of colour,\u201d \u201ctruth of space,\u201d \u201ctruth of skies,\u201d \u201ctruth of earth,\u201d \u201ctruth of water,\u201d and \u201ctruth of vegetation\u201d were minutely considered, in a laborious project that would not be completed until the appearance of the fifth and final volume of Modern Painters in 1860.\n\nThis shift of concern from general to particular conceptions of truth was a key feature of Romantic thought, and Ruskin\u2019s first major achievement was thus to bring the assumptions of Romanticism to the practice of art criticism. By 1843 avant-garde painters had been working in this new spirit for several decades, but criticism and public understanding had lagged behind. More decisively than any previous writer, Ruskin brought 19th-century English painting and 19th-century English art criticism into sympathetic alignment. As he did so, he alerted readers to the fact that they had, in Turner, one of the greatest painters in the history of Western art alive and working among them in contemporary London, and, in the broader school of English landscape painting, a major modern art movement.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In these circumstances the critic was obliged to create in words an effective sensory and emotional substitute for visual experience. Working in the tradition of the Romantic poetic prose of Charles Lamb and Thomas De Quincey, though more immediately influenced by the descriptive writing of Sir Walter Scott, the rhetoric of the Bible, and the blank verse of William Wordsworth, Ruskin vividly evoked the effect on the human eye and sensibility both of Turner\u2019s paintings and of the actual landscapes that Turner and other artists had sought to represent.\n\nIn the process Ruskin introduced the newly wealthy commercial and professional classes of the English-speaking world to the possibility of enjoying and collecting art. Since most of them had been shaped by an austerely puritanical religious tradition, Ruskin knew that they would be suspicious of claims for painting that stressed its sensual or hedonic qualities. Instead, he defined painting as \u201ca noble and expressive language, invaluable as the vehicle of thought, but by itself nothing.\u201d What that language expressed, in Romantic landscape painting, was a Wordsworthian sense of a divine presence in Nature: a morally instructive natural theology in which God spoke through physical \u201ctypes.\u201d Conscious of the spiritual significance of the natural world, young painters should \u201cgo to Nature in all singleness of heart\u2026having no other thoughts but how best to penetrate her meaning, and remember her instruction; rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, and scorning nothing.\u201d\n\nThree years later, in the second volume of Modern Painters (1846), Ruskin would specifically distinguish this strenuously ethical or Theoretic conception of art from the Aesthetic, undidactic, or art-for-art\u2019s-sake definition that would be its great rival in the second half of the 19th century. Despite his friendships with individual Aesthetes, Ruskin would remain the dominant spokesman for a morally and socially committed conception of art throughout his lifetime."}]}
