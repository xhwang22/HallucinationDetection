{"Pino Palladino is widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players of the modern era.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/06/pino-palladino-pop-greatest-bassist-adele-elton-the-who", "page_content": "By his own admission, Pino Palladino is not a man much accustomed to giving interviews. \u201cVery reticent,\u201d he nods during a Zoom call, his accent speaking noticeably louder of his childhood in Cardiff than his current home in LA. \u201cYou know, there was a time when I was featured in all sorts of musicians\u2019 magazines, and then I just thought to myself, \u2018Move over, there\u2019s people out there that actually need the publicity.\u2019 Not to blow smoke up my own arse,\u201d he adds hurriedly, \u201cbut really I just didn\u2019t want to see or hear from myself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a remark in keeping with the astonishing career of one of the most celebrated bass players in the world. It\u2019s hard not to blanche when you consider the sheer number of records that have been sold featuring his work. He played on not one but two of the biggest selling albums of the 21st century: Adele\u2019s 21 and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide, as well as with Rod Stewart, Elton John, Bryan Ferry, Simon and Garfunkel and Keith Richards. They\u2019re the biggest names in a startlingly diverse back catalogue of collaborations: Palladino\u2019s playing is the thread that links Perfume Genius with Phil Collins, Harry Styles with Chris de Burgh, and Nine Inch Nails with De La Soul. Indeed, his versatility and omnipresence is a running joke within the music industry. When another fabled bass player, Pink Floyd\u2019s Guy Pratt, got married, he opened his groom\u2019s speech with the words: \u201cI\u2019m only here today because Pino couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nFor a musician who seems to have turned up everywhere over the last 40 years, Palladino has remained a remarkably anonymous figure outside of musicians\u2019 circles. Indeed, he somehow contrived to spend 14 years as a member of the Who without really losing what he calls an \u201cinvisible stance\u201d. He certainly stands out in photographs of the Soulquarians, the experimental collective assembled by D\u2019Angelo for his legendary album Voodoo, the solitary lanky Welshman among a crowd of African-American musicians including Questlove and the late J Dilla \u2013 but you would still struggle to recognise him in the street.\n\nCardiff\u2019s finest \u2026 Palladino in 1985. Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nThis is presumably how Palladino likes it. He\u2019s drily funny and self-deprecating \u2013 he says his default setting when working with a new artist is \u201cdo not fucking spoil it\u201d \u2013 but doesn\u2019t seem terribly frustrated by life in the background. Which makes it all the more surprising that he\u2019s releasing an album on which he shares billing with Blake Mills: Notes With Attachments, a fascinating, head-turning collection of experimental instrumentals that sits somewhere between jazz, global music and ambient. He and Mills, who has produced for Fiona Apple and Laura Marling, met while working on a John Legend album. \u201cWe hit it off and the next thing you know, he\u2019s saying to me \u2018Have you thought about a solo album?\u2019 Well, I\u2019ve thought about it, obviously,\u201d he laughs. \u201cFor 40 years I\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019ve never really had an idea how I could do it.\u201d\n\nStudded with guest appearances \u2013 from avant-garde saxophonist Sam Gendel and jazz drummer Chris Dave, among others \u2013 Notes With Attachments foregrounds the sound that made Palladino\u2019s name: the none-more-80s sprrroing of the fretless bass put through a chorus pedal. He first used it while working with Gary Numan, but it was Paul Young\u2019s 1983 hit Wherever I Lay My Hat that introduced it to a mass audience: pushed up in the mix, the bass effectively became a lead instrument. It was so striking that Palladino suddenly found himself playing with everyone from Go West and Don Henley to Tears for Fears: he turned up on Top of the Pops with alarming regularity, the musical equivalent of a hip item of designer clothing. \u201cThere was a lot of it around in those days,\u201d he says of the sound. \u201cI was so lucky \u2013 it resonated with people, captured their imagination and it took on a life of its own. It did get to the point where I was getting booked for sessions and feeling like a performing monkey: \u2018Yeah, bring your fretless, make that funny sound and maybe we\u2019ll get a hit out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also found himself becoming the sideman of choice for the rock aristocracy. \u201cThe first call I got like that was from David Gilmour. I could not believe it: am I going to the studio with this guy and pretend I actually belong there? I was nervous as fuck, but the drummer on the session was Jeff Porcaro [famed for playing with Toto and on Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller album], and he was really sweet: \u2018Come on, man, chill out, have a smoke on this.\u2019 So I did, and that seemed to work for me. I just had to keep that attitude through all of that period: phone calls from Elton John and Phil Collins \u2013 you have to keep that headspace that you belong, even if you think you\u2019re going to be found out any minute.\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll have to play louder!\u2019 \u2026 performing with the Who at the 2016 Desert Trip festival in California. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nHe says another phone call, this time from D\u2019Angelo \u2013 who had heard his playing on a BB King album \u2013 changed his life. \u201cMy roots are in Motown, reggae, R&B. I didn\u2019t get much of an opportunity to express that side of music and then I met the don \u2013 how lucky was that? D\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone. When I was in the studio with D and Questlove, James Poyser, all those guys, I don\u2019t even have to think about what I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played. From a personal satisfaction point of view, it was as good as it ever got, probably will get.\n\n\u201cIt took people 10 years, 20, to really get the first album we made, Voodoo, but I absolutely knew it was unique and really special \u2013 I was probably more aware of it than the rest of them, because I\u2019d been working for a long time. I knew this kind of thing didn\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nThe Soulquarians went on to record with Erykah Badu, Mos Def and Talib Kweli; the influence of their loose approach can be heard on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s epochal 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly. They had just wrapped up a session with Common when Palladino learned that the Who\u2019s bassist, John Entwistle, had died \u2013 and that the band had declined to cancel their forthcoming tour and wanted Palladino to replace him \u2026 on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, in two days.\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs. Pete Townshend was waiting for me at the hotel, with a big stack of CDs. \u2018You don\u2019t know much of the catalogue? Fair enough. You\u2019re going to know it tonight, then, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 At the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino says he\u2019s \u201cnot exactly crazy about touring any more\u201d \u2013 he stopped playing live with the Who in 2016 \u2013 but is considering doing some gigs around Notes With Attachments, pandemic permitting. Until then, there are still sessions to attend to in LA, with Covid tests in the car park for anyone taking part. \u201cFilm and music studios are considered essential to the economy here \u2013 you\u2019ve got to love that, right?\u201d he laughs. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s better than Britain telling you if you\u2019re a musician or an artist you might have to look for a new job.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/pino-palladino-interview/", "page_content": "Photo: Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAll musicians are the same, we all think we\u2019re rubbish,\u201d Pino Palladino told a British television interviewer in 2013, adding a gentle laugh. It was a typically massive understatement from the quietly affable Welsh bassist, among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry. In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it. That\u2019s really nice to hear.\n\nListen to Pino Palladino and Blake Mills\u2019 Notes with Attachments here."}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/pino-palladino-blake-mills-tiny-desk/", "page_content": "Photo: Cedric Ribiero/Getty Images\n\nPino Palladino & Blake Mills are the latest stars to play an exclusive concert for Bob Boilen\u2019s Tiny Desk series.

It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nThe studio backdrop of this Tiny Desk (home) concert is the perfect setting for the dynamic duo headlining this project. Pino Palladino is a prolific bassist whose sound you\u2019re already intimately acquainted with (even if you don\u2019t know it). Blake Mills, a guitarist and two-time Grammy nominee for producer of the year, has an impressive catalog of his own. Together, in the studio, the top shelf sidemen are in their element, distilling the sonic creativity that is the first release under Palladino\u2019s name, Notes With Attachments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEight pulsing calls from saxophonist Sam Gendel usher us into \u201cJust Wrong\u201d a melodic meditation that unfolds like a blossom in time lapse. Guitar, bass, sax and Abe Rounds\u2019 colorful dustings of percussion in this song are magical; we soar with the musicians through varied repetitions of the melody before they gently set us back on our feet.\n\nThe afterimage of our flight is still fading away when Palladino greets the viewers with a short and sweet introduction before opening \u201cEkut\u00e9,\u201d a tune that explores traditional West African music, jazz and rock influences with a few modern touches of technology. \u201cDjurkel,\u201d the final offering in this set, is also experimental in nature. Palladino\u2019s trademark bass sound lies in the cut, the fertile ground on which Mills, Gendel and Rounds dance dreamily around each other. This is session musicianship at its best. Each watch reveals new depths to the mastery.\n\nPino Palladino is regarded among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry.

But in an interview published today in The Guardian, he has spoken of the moment in 2002 when Pete Townshend called. John Entwistle had passed away: would Palladino fill in on the tour?\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs,\u201c said Palladino.

That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino also speaks about his career through the 80s, when he was on speed dial for any pop star who needed some four-string flair in the low end. But in a career that saw him play on some of the top-selling albums of all time, Palladino considers his collaboration with neo soul pioneer D'Angelo, as bassist of the Soulquarians, the personal highlight.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone,\u201c said Palladino. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played.\u201c\n\nPalladino has just released Notes With Attachments with the Californian guitarist and composer Blake Mills, available now through New Deal Records.

Having worked with everyone from Adele to Elton John, Nine Inch Nails to Harry Styles, the Who to D\u2019Angelo, Pino has come to encapsulate everything that a sideman should be. But lost in the cult praise for his multi-genre chops and studio wizardry are 5 secret weapons!\n\n\n\nReason 1: Fretless Meets Fretted\n\nNo one did more to promote expressive bass playing back in the '80s than Pino Palladino. His big break came as a member of Paul Young\u2019s band, culminating in a truly amazing piece of fretless bass accompaniment to one of Young\u2019s biggest hits, his 1983 cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s Wherever I Lay My Hat.\n\nSome years later, Pino resurfaced in R&B groove mode with D\u2019Angelo. Having met in 1997 while recording for BB King\u2019s Deuces Wild, Pino went on to provide many of the flatwound-swinging bass lines on his 2000 landmark album, Voodoo.\n\nReason 2: Multi-Genre Wizardry\n\nThe sheer number of records that have been sold featuring Pino\u2019s work is astonishing. He played on not one but two of the biggest selling albums of the 21st century: Adele\u2019s 21 and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide. Palladino\u2019s bass playing is also the thread that links the John Mayer Trio with jazz/fusion trio PSP and Trent Reznor\u2019s Nine Inch Nails.\n\nReason 3: Secret Chops\n\nLesser-celebrated, but nonetheless awesome are Pino\u2019s chops when it comes to taking a solo. Check out his slick fretless lines with the Manu Katch\u00e9 Band, alongside Dominic Miller, at the 1999 Montreux Jazz Festival. The song is Truco, which appeared on Dominic Miller\u2019s 2003 album, Second Nature.\n\nReason 4: Groove Genius\n\nOf course, Pino is a technical master, but on such epic groove tracks as The Line by D\u2019Angelo, he combines finesse and remarkable originality into an undeniable groove. \u201cMy roots are in Motown, reggae, R&B,\u201d says Pino. \u201cI didn\u2019t get much of an opportunity to express that side of music and then I met D\u2019Angelo \u2013 how lucky was that?\u201d Reason 5: The Song Comes First Pino is often regarded as the pinnacle of the instrument, but no matter the sheer size of his expertise, it\u2019s his devotion to the song that has provided the sure-footing he needed to reach the summit of the bass world. And while it\u2019s no secret that he doesn\u2019t read a note of music, and he\u2019s never been one to rely on charts either, his intuitive understanding of the role of the bass and the responsibilities that go with it have ensured his standing as one of the most important bass players of all time."}, {"url": "https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-bassists-of-all-time-13565/pino-palladino-13579/", "page_content": "From funk masters to prog prodigies and beyond, we count down the players who have shaped our idea of the low-end theory\n\n\u201cThe bass is the foundation,\u201d session legend Carol Kaye once said, \u201cand with the drummer you create the beat. Whatever you play puts a framework around the rest of the music.\u201d\n\nA great bass line, whether it\u2019s Paul McCartney\u2019s hypnotic \u201cCome Together\u201d riff, Bootsy Collins\u2019 sly vamp from James Brown\u2019s \u201cSex Machine,\u201d or Tina Weymouth\u2019s minimal throb on Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cPsycho Killer,\u201d is like a mantra: It sounds like it could go on forever, and it only feels more profound the more you hear it. Guitarists, singers, and horn players tend to claim the flashiest moments in any given song, while drummers channel most of the kinetic energy, but what the bassist brings is something elemental \u2014 the part that loops endlessly in your head long after the music ends.\n\nBassists are often overlooked and undervalued, even within their own bands. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the number-one job,\u201d McCartney once said, reflecting on the fateful moment when he took over the four-string after Stu Sutcliffe exited the Beatles. \u201cNobody wanted to play bass, they wanted to be up front.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the instrument has its own proud tradition in popular music, stretching from the mighty upright work of Jimmy Blanton in Duke Ellington\u2019s orchestra and bebop pioneers like Oscar Pettiford to fellow jazz geniuses like Charles Mingus and Ron Carter; studio champs like Kaye and James Jamerson; rock warriors like Cream\u2019s Jack Bruce and the Who\u2019s John Entwistle; funk masters like Bootsy and Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s Larry Graham; prog prodigies like Yes\u2019 Chris Squire and Rush\u2019s Geddy Lee; fusion gods like Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius; and punk and postpunk masters like Weymouth and the Minutemen\u2019s Mike Watt. The alternative era brought new heroes on the instrument, from Sonic Youth\u2019s intuitive Kim Gordon to Primus\u2019 outlandish Les Claypool, and more recently, a fresh crop of bass icons \u2014 including Esperanza Spalding and the ubiquitous Thundercat \u2014 have placed the low end at the center of their musical universes.\n\nAs with our 100 Greatest Drummers list, this rundown of the 50 greatest bassists of all time celebrates that entire spectrum. It\u2019s emphatically not intended as a ranking of objective skill; nor does it assign any one set of criteria as a measure of greatness. Instead it\u2019s an inventory of the bassists who have had the most direct and visible impact on creating, to borrow Kaye\u2019s term, the very foundation of popular music \u2014 from rock to funk to country to R&B to disco to hip-hop, and beyond \u2014 during the past half-century or so. You\u2019ll find obvious virtuosos here, but also musicians whose more minimal concept of their instrument\u2019s role elevated everything that was going on around them.\n\n\u201cYou grab it, slide around on it, and feel it with your hands,\u201d Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Flea once said of his signature instrument. \u201cYou slap, pull, thump, pluck, and pop, and you get yourself into this hypnotic state, if you\u2019re lucky, beyond thought, where you\u2019re not thinking because you\u2019re just a conduit for this rhythm, from wherever it comes from, from God to you and this instrument, through a cord and a speaker.\u201d\n\nHere we pay tribute to 50 musicians who have found that same exalted state via the bass, and changed the world in the process."}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/features/pino-palladinos-best-bass-lines", "page_content": "Quite possibly the world's most famous working session bassist, Pino Palladino has built a career as the ultimate supporting player: providing a Stravinsky-inspired fretless performance on Paul Young\u2019s \u2018Wherever I Lay My Hat,\u2019 contributing to D\u2019Angelo\u2019s landmark album Voodoo, replacing the late John Entwistle in The Who, touring with the John Mayer Trio, and much more.\n\n\n\nPino has come to encapsulate everything that a sideman should be. \u201cThe sideman role just came out of me playing on records that people heard and liked,\u201d says Pino. \u201cIt's not something I planned or even dreamt of.\u201d\n\nJoin us, then, on Pino\u2019s 65th birthday, as we list the songs that prove he is a true bass genius.\n\n(Image credit: Photo by Chris McKay/WireImage)\n\nWherever I Lay My Hat - Paul Young (1983)\n\nNo one did more to promote expressive bass playing back in the '80s than Pino Palladino.

The harmony is open to interpretation, but Pino felt a B7 as the overall tonality.\n\nMy Generation - The Who (2007)\n\nPino\u2019s next call came following the untimely death of John Entwistle, who had died just as the Who was launching its 2002 tour. Pete Townshend later said on his website that he had made only one request of Pino; \"that he fucking turns up his amp and plays as loud as he can!\"\n\n\n\nIn this next video Pino plays probably the most famous bass solo in rock \u2013 \u2018My Generation\u2019 \u2013 on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland.\n\nWho Did You Think I Was - John Mayer Trio (2008)\n\nRecorded live at the Nokia Theatre in LA, together with John Mayer and drummer Steve Jordan, Pino\u2019s performance on 'Who Did You Think I Was' is stratospheric. The main riff is based around an A7 pentatonic shape that Pino anchors on the 5th fret of the E string. Keep your ears open at the 02:40 mark as the trio kick into \u2018Power of Soul\u2019 by Jimi Hendrix.\n\nSanctified - Nine Inch Nails (2013)\n\nPino\u2019s next stretch came with Nine Inch Nails following Trent Reznor\u2019s invitation to collaborate on the band\u2019s 2013 Hesitation Marks. Pino wasn't the only special guest to appear in the studio: who'd have imagined Lindsay Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac to crop up on a Nine Inch Nails album, let alone the king of the fretless bass? This next clip sees Pino add his slick fretless lines to Reznor\u2019s 1989 track \u2018Sanctified.\u2019\n\nBlake Mills - Notes With Attachments\n\nIn 2021 Pino released the first solo album of his career, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills on an archive of musical ideas.

This became his signature sound throughout the era, one that he has returned to in the past five years with his trio PSP.\n\nFender American Standard Jaguar Bass\n\nHaving previously played with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey, Palladino was an obvious choice to fill the big shoes left after the sudden passing of The Who bassist John Entwistle in 2002.\n\nAfter initially trying out his Fender Precision and Jazz basses with the band, he eventually settled on the powerful tone and cutting attack of the Fender Jaguar with two thunderbird pickups.\n\n1963 Fender Precision Bass\n\nPalladino made the move to a fretted P-Bass in the 1990s as a conscious decision to move away from his signature fretless sound and embrace a vintage soul and R&B tone, such as that of Motown bassist James Jameson.\n\nHe achieved this with a combination of the 1963 P-Bass with a sunburst finish, custom wound pickups, flatwound La Bella strings, and by keeping the volume turned all the way up and the tone all the way down.\n\nThis configuration can be heard on D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo and Black Messiah albums, on which he played tuned down to DGCF with a dampener.\n\n1961 Fender Precision Bass in Fiesta Red\n\nThis guitar is another of Palladino\u2019s favourites and also used with flatwound strings. It can be heard on Paul Simon\u2019s 2006 album Surprise.\n\nFender Pino Palladino Precision Bass\n\nPalladino was bestowed this signature model by the Fender Custom Shop. Its alder body is based on his \u201961 P-Bass, while the \u2018C\u2019 shape maple neck shape and rosewood fingerboard are based on his \u201963 P-Bass. It is finished in Fiesta Red over Desert Sand and has custom wound pickups.\n\nPalladino himself has used this model whilst on tour with The Who, although he added \u201860\u2019s Gibson Thunderbird pickups.\n\nMoon JJ-4 300B\n\nPalladino played an all-white Moon bass during the Voodoo tour with D\u2019Angelo in March-October 2002, playing tuned down to DGCF as he did on the album.

His touch, his sound, his feel, Pino\u2019s got the whole thing going on.\n\nIf you discuss influences with any R&B, pop or jazz electric bassist, I guarantee that the name Pino Palladino will appear 99.9% of the time. During the past four decades, Pino has spread his colossal bass grooves into all corners of contemporary music, in almost every conceivable style and genre. Hailed by many as the British Jaco, his early recordings with Paul Young put expressive fretless bass playing back on the map. He reinvented himself as an R&B wizard in the 90s and evoked the spirit of John Entwistle with The Who in 2002, before easing into his current vintage-vibe with The John Mayer Trio.\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales, in 1957, Pino started out on classical guitar aged 14, moving over to electric bass three years later after discovering Motown and Stax Records, along with players like James Jamerson and Jaco Pastorius.\n\n\n\nIn the early 80s he moved to London and landed the bass gig with ex-Squeeze keyboard player, Jools Holland. This was followed by a stint with synth-pop star Gary Numan, before getting his big break as a member of Paul Young\u2019s band. His groundbreaking bass work on the 1983 album No Parlez culminated in a truly mesmerizing piece of fretless playing on Paul Young\u2019s cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Wherever I Lay My Hat.\u2019\n\nHere's Pino demonstrating the famous intro to that track.\n\nA steady flow of top session gigs followed working with the likes of Go West, Elton John and David Knofler, peaking with another standout fretless performance on Don Henley\u2019s \u2018New York Minute\u2019...\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Pino opened up about this part of his career.\n\nIt's about the song, the timing, all sorts of factors, but there are quite a few artists I've worked with where I've contributed more than they would have expected, such as coming up with sub-hooks that make the record better. It certainly worked for me; for a few years people were phoning from all over the world wanting that sound.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close the sound of Pino\u2019s fretless MusicMan StingRay had become almost mandatory among studio producers of the day, with Pino often called in purely to overdub his sound over existing fretted bass tracks. One of the world\u2019s premier fretless bassists had well and truly arrived.\n\n\n\nNow it's easy to think that Pino is simply what we could refer to as a \"groover\". A bass player that is happiest in the background simply holding down the lowend and making the band, well, groove. And while that may be somewhat true, unknown to some, Pino has formidable chops and facility on the bass and can certainly solo with the best of them.\n\n\n\nJust check out Pino's blazing solo fretless lines on his 5 string Musicman Stingray with Manu Katche on drums and Dominic Miller on guitar.\n\nAnd here you can hear that soloing is not something he only saves for his 5 string, as he weaves his way around his trusty Musicman 4 string with ease.\n\n\n\nPino has played a number of basses during his career, but his trademark fretless sound came from his much loved Music Man StingRay, which he bought from Sam Ash music in NYC. He\u2019d tried out a few fretted Music Man basses before but thought they sounded too trebly, but with this particular bass, which I think is a 1979 sunburst model with a rosewood board, he found a warmer more versatile sound and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nOther basses in his early career included a fretless Pedulla and a Warwick Thumb, but his move back to playing more vintage-style fretted basses was led by a number of P Basses from the early 60s, one of which the Fender Custom Shop chose to reproduce for his signature model, complete with Thomastik-Infeld strings. He also plays a Moon Bass, which he used extensively for the D\u2019Angelo Voodoo tour back in 2002. And as for his strings, he uses Rotosound Swing Bass stainless steel mediums, which he prefers for the fretless sound, and Thomastiks or La Bella heavy gauge flatwounds for the P Bass.\n\nPino's Fender Signature P-Bass\n\nAside from his StingRay, Pino\u2019s fretless sound also became synonymous with a Boss 0C-2 octave pedal, which can really be heard on Paul Young\u2019s I\u2019m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down.\n\nPino continued to bolster his CV during the 1990s with sessions for the likes of Eric Clapton, Seal, Elton John, Tears for Fears, David Gilmour, Chaka Khan, Pete Townsend and Joan Armatrading, and jazzers such as Al Di Meola, John McClaughlin, David Sanborn and Chris Botti.\n\n\n\nIt was also around this time that he resurfaced in full on R&B groove mode, hitting unbelievable new heights with the epic 2000 recording, Voodoo by D\u2019Angelo.\n\n\n\nThe album\u2019s greasy, laid back feel caused a huge buzz among rhythm sections everywhere, and led to a who\u2019s who of hip hop artists summoning Pino and his 1963 P Bass to their studios. Just listen to how Pino's killer bass line on Chicken Grease sits so lazily in the back of the pocket. Pino is also all over D\u2019Angelo\u2019s 2014 album, Black Messiah, Erykah Badu\u2019s Mama\u2019s Gun and Aijuswanaseeing by Musiq (Soulchild) which all serve as an amazing schooling in the way of the lowend.\n\n\n\nAs the world ushered in the year 2000 Pino was about to reinvent himself yet again. Here's a quote directly from Pino:\n\nIt's important to be able to reinvent what you do. When the call came to play with The Who I was working with Erykah Badu and D'Angelo, and I had to change my whole style. The manager said: 'John [Entwistle] is dead. Can you do a gig at the Hollywood Bowl in three days' time?' You don't turn down something like that. It was only afterwards that I thought about the consequences. Pete Townshend's direction was, 'Play whatever you want, just as long as you play loud!'\n\nThe early 2000's saw Pino filling the bass chair with Simon and Garfunkel on their 2003 reunion tour and he was also drafted in for heavyweight album sessions with the likes of Adele, Ed Sheeran and even Nine Inch Nails. It was during this steady schedule of studio work that Pino took a call that would once again cement his place as one of the most admired bassists in contemporary music.\n\n\n\nWhen bassist Willie Weeks was unable to make a John Mayer gig for the Tsunami Aid benefit concert in 2005, drummer Steve Jordan suggested they call Pino and the rest is history. Countless tours and stadium gigs followed, with the band\u2019s chemistry captured brilliantly on the 2005 live album, Try! And again on the 2008 live DVD, Where The Light Is.\n\n\n\nJust check out the amazing chemistry between Pino, John and Steve on \"Who do you think I was\" to say it's a perfect demonstration of how in the pocket a trio can be would be an understatement, and please, let's just give it up for Steve Jordon on this one, surely one of the coolest drummers in history."}, {"url": "https://www.allaboutjazz.com/musicians/pino-palladino", "page_content": "Pino Palladino was featured on Gary Numan's 1982 album I, Assassin, in which his fretless bass sound made a prominent contribution to the overall sound of the album. He went on to play fretless bass with a healthy number of high-profile artists that include (on the short list), David Gilmour, Tears for Fears, Pete Townshend, Peter Gabriel, Joan Armatrading, Phil Collins, Chaka Khan and Don Henley.\n\nPalladino began playing the electric guitar at age 14. By age 17 he decided to play the bass guitar, and bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae within a rock and roll backbeat. His first professional gig was at a local television station in Cardiff, where he began playing in 1978. That same year, at age 20, he joined Jools Holland's band and recorded with Holland on his album entitled, Jools Holland and His Millionaires. Palladino toured with Jools to support the album, which gave him the opportunity to purchase his own Music Man StingRay Fretless Bass. Holland was touring with another new band; the Q-Tips, whose frontman, Paul Young made acquaintance with Palladino whilst they were on tour, who would, a year later offer Pino a place in his own backing band.\n\nPalladino has joined several bands and ensembles through which he is most visible. He joined jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove in forming The RH Factor, a band that mixes elements of soul, jazz, and R&B. He is a member of the John Mayer Trio, and was the first choice by Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey to fill the position left by John Entwistle as the current bassist for The Who.\n\nPino Palladino (17 October 1957 in Cardiff, Wales, UK) is a Welsh bass guitarist of Italian ancestry. Palladino rose to public notice playing primarily rock and roll, blues rock, and rhythm and blues music, although he has been lauded for his ability to play most genres of popular music, including jazz, neo soul, and funk. Adding to his eclectic grasp and melodic approach on his instrument, he has become one of the most sought-after session players on the bass in the music industry. He has played on a large number of recordings by some of the world's most successful entertainers, in part, by mastering a variety of techniques on both his late 1970s fretless Music Man StingRay bass guitar and later in his career, adding fretted Fender Precision and Jaguar basses. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.\n\nAfter vocalist Paul Young landed his own solo contract, Palladino was brought in as part of his backing band \"The Royal Family\" in 1983 with noticeable chart success with the No Parlez album, and major hit singles both in the UK and Europe. Examples of Young's new found success were the band's cover of the Marvin Gaye classic \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\", which reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart for three weeks in the summer of 1983, and \"Love of the Common People\". Palladino toured extensively at this time with Paul Young, remaining in the band for five years. 1983 additionally proved to be the year of another ensemble featuring Palladino, Paul Rodgers (formerly of Bad Company, drummer Kenney Jones, along with a rotating cast of other celebrity performers. The band only released one album through Atlantic; The Law, although there were enough out-takes that another bootleg-styled album followed in 1991. Sales were unremarkable, despite the names of those who recorded on the album.\n\nThroughout the 1980s Palladino was noted for his R&B roots on the fretless bass, even when supporting pop and rock heavy performers. One reviewer from Bass Player magazine points to Paul Young\u2019s cover of the Bobby Womack/Rufus tune \"Stop On By\" (on 1990\u2019s Other Voices), with its \"pre-hip-hop, swung funk groove\" as the precursor to Palladino's later neo-soul focus.\n\n1990s Changes in instrument\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino began to alternate between the sounds achieved in playing the fretless bass to one with frets, as well as the 4-string and 6-string bass. At the time, he was well known within the industry for his fretless bass sound. However, now, depending on which artist he was supporting, and the song to be played, he began gravitating towards fretted bass. He was maturing as a musician, and played with artists as diverse as Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Sir Elton John and Eric Clapton. Also in 1991 he joined Paul Rodgers (of Free, Queen+ Paul Rodgers, and Bad Company fame) to form the band The Law. In the mid 1990's, Palladino played bass for The London Metropolitan orchestra during their recording of \"An American Symphony\", soundtrack for the movie Mr Hollands Opus.\n\nPalladino supported Phil Collins, as a member of the house band for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, which played with Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett, among other notable performers. He later wrote that he felt privileged to have been amongst the others on stage in such an event.\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft, of The Verve, during the recording sessions of Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody. Richard proved to be mightily impressed by Pino's natural bass playing ability;\n\nThis Pino Palladino, I can say a Meters record and he can play me the bass line. He can play anything. He's one of the only people in the world who can totally replicate that kind of Beach Boys/scratch/Walker Brothers bass. You can get that sound if you want it, dead on. So it was very liberating working with him.\n\nPino also joined Ashcroft's touring band for the singer's first major solo outing throughout 2000.\n\nNeo Soul\n\nBy the mid- 1990s, Palladino had established himself as a busy, highly desirable bassist and a studio worker in many genres, but finally became visible to those artists who played largely left of center, and demand for his session playing grew within a different quarter. Palladino began moving from blues-rock toward neo soul projects. Palladino and Steve Jordan found themselves performing on the same session for B.B. King\u2019s 1997 duets CD Deuces Wild. It was the first time soul singer D'Angelo first heard Palladino, who had just switched from a signature sound fretless bass sound to that of performing with fretted basses. The result was an invitation to \"use Pino\u2019s big, behind-the-beat bass to help cast a neo-soul spell on his Grammy Award-winning Voodoo album\". It would not be his first uncredited Grammy performance.\n\nAs the word spread throughout the genre, Palladino found an increasing demand within the neo-soul genre. Examples of his bass work in this genre (in addition to D'Angelo) includes Mama's Gun, and \"Penitentiary Philosophy\" found on Erykah Badu\u2019s 2000 CD. Other albums using Pino's sound include 1st Born Second for Bilal, Like Water for Chocolate and Electric Circus for Common. Palladino has been described by Steve Jordan, who got his own professional start playing the drums for Stevie Wonder as having a \"deep funk\" side and a \"melodic\" side. Palladino admits, that \"Of all my influences, I would say what\u2019s always in the back of my mind is early Stevie Wonder, like Talking Book and Innervisions; that music is really in my blood.\"\n\n2000s\n\nFollowing the death of The Who's bassist John Entwistle in 2002, the eve before the band were to kick off their first world tour in years, Palladino was their first choice to become the band's full-time touring bass guitarist, and by 2006, he was invited to join the remaining original band members in recording their first album in twenty-four years. Pete Townshend, the band's composer, recorded the bassline on the majority of the songs to get the effect he himself wanted, with Palladino doing so on the other six of them. Released in October 2006, the album was named Endless Wire.\n\nPalladino also recently played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show, in February, 2010, alongside other backing artists: Simon Townsend on guitar, Zak Starkey, drums and percussion, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, on keyboard instruments.\n\nPaul Simon\n\nIn 2003, Palladino intended to go down to see his old friend Paul Simon and meet Brian Eno for the first time. He was asked to record with them, and had to borrow a bass guitar to play. The result was that he played with Simon and Garfunkel on their \"Old Friends\" reunion tour and in an interview with Bass Player Magazine he mentions drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Jamey Haddad \"had laid down some great grooves for me to add bass\". He had kept the recordings, and by the time that he appeared on the Old Friends: Live on Stage CD and DVD from the tour, he was able to use some of the material. He played on Paul Simon's 2006 release, Surprise.\n\nOther appearances\n\nPalladino has toured in the backing band for Joe Walsh. In 2004 he appeared to be playing with Gary Moore at the Wembley Arena.\n\nEmergence of the John Mayer Trio\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session players on many occasions, which blossomed into a friendship. When their work brought them to the same place, they would meet, usually jam together, and introduce other musicians to one another, forming friendships which sometimes blossomed into good working relationships. Jordan has remained keen about Pino since he met him, and only grows more enthusiastic about his talents, which he describes partly as his love for, and ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an amazing connection with genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he'd planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January, 2005 to perform a benefit concert on a NBC sponsored telethon Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope to raise funds and public awareness benefiting victims in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work, and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix classic, \"Bold as Love\", the three all agreed that they experienced such chemistry that they began talking right away about arranging their schedules to record a CD and a tour. The trio released the album Try!, on November 22, 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover songs, such as Jimi Hendrix's \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's release Heavier Things, as well as new songs written by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan wrote three songs on the album: \"Good Love Is On The Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\". Along with John Mayer on guitar and vocals, and Steve Jordan on drums, Palladino has toured and recorded as a member of the John Mayer Trio, and on Mayer's third album Continuum.\n\nRecent tours\n\nIn spring of 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck. He also played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido, alongside other notable musicians, including Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston. It was to be Preston's last work before he died only days afterward.\n\nInfluences on bass guitar\n\nInfluences for Palladino for bass guitar include Motown bassist James Jamerson; Stevie Wonder\u2019s keyboard-bass, jazz innovator Jaco Pastorius; British folk/rock upright bassist Danny Thompson; Norman Watt-Roy (of Ian Dury & the Blockheads); Larry Graham; Michael Henderson; Bootsy Collins; Paul Jackson; Anthony Jackson; Doug Rauch (of Carly Simon and Santana), and Billy Cobham.\n\nTechnique\n\nPino Palladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass in many 1980s chart records. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\" Palladino preferred a different sound (combining fretless tone with an octave effect) and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument as opposed to simply the aforementioned \"low notes\". Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's biggest chart hits, in particular his bass solo on \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\". His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nPino Palladino signature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modeled after two of Pino's Fender Precision Basses. The body featuring faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint is based on Pino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fret board are based on Pino's 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.\n\nRecent projects\n\nPalladino joined Eric Clapton's touring band for 11 dates in the Eastern U.S. and Canada in May 2008. Current work has included work on an with Clapton and Robbie Robertson, and Palladino guested on bass for Amos Lee on his third album, Last Days at the Lodge.\n\nIn 2009, Palladino joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips to form an instrumental trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, an instrumental jazz/funk rock ensemble, which have toured Europe through 2009 into 2010, playing songs that spotlight the talents of each performer, in the manner of many jazz outfits.
