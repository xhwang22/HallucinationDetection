{"Charlotte Rae appeared in Car 54, Where Are You?, All in the Family, Pretty Little Liars, and You Again?.": [{"url": "https://www.the60sofficialsite.com/Car-54-Where-Are-You.html", "page_content": "Car 54 Where Are You? Car 54, Where Are You? is an American sitcom that ran on NBC from September 17, 1961 to September 8,1963, airing 60 episodes. Most of its filming was on location in the The Bronx and at Biograph Studios.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of NYPD officers Gunther Toody (Joe E. Ross) and Francis Muldoon (Fred Gwynne) in the fictional 53rd precinct in the Bronx, assigned to Patrol Car 54. Toody was short, stocky, nosy, not very bright, and lived with his loud, domineering wife Lucille. Muldoon, an Irish American, was very tall, quiet, and more intelligent. He was a shy bachelor who lived with his mother and two younger sisters.\n\nOther cast members included Beatrice Pons, Al Lewis, Charlotte Rae, Nipsey Russell, Ossie Davis, Paul Reed, Larry Storch, and Hank Garrett. Mel Stewart, probably best known as Henry Jefferson in All in the Family, appeared as an uncredited dispatcher beginning in the fall of 1962. He appeared in more than one episode, and also appears in a cast photo. Car 54 was one of the first sitcoms that regularly featured characters from multiple ethnicities. I also found this to be interesting. The TV show's police cars on location shots were actually bright red and white, but appeared as the proper shade of gray for an NYPD car on black-and-white film. NYPD cars of that era were black and green with a white roof and trunk. Thus, the filmmakers achieved a realistic appearance without alarming or confusing bystanders during production. Car 54, Where Are You? was made into a 1994 film, filmed mainly in Toronto, starring John C. McGinley as Muldoon, David Johansen as Toody, and Rosie O'Donnell. The film was made in 1990 but not released until 1994 due to the bankruptcy of Orion Pictures. It was a box office bomb when it was first released and was panned by critics. Original cast members Lewis and Russell appeared in the film."}, {"url": "https://jacksonupperco.com/2020/09/01/the-ten-best-car-54-where-are-you-episodes-of-season-one/", "page_content": "Welcome to a new Sitcom Tuesday! This week, we\u2019re starting coverage on the best of Car 54, Where Are You? (1961-1963, NBC), which you can currently enjoy on DVD and Amazon.\n\nCar 54, Where Are You? stars JOE E. ROSS, FRED GWYNNE, BEATRICE PONS, PAUL REED and AL LEWIS. With CHARLOTTE RAE as Sylvia Schnauser.\n\nLet\u2019s dive right in\u2026 Car 54 is both an affirmation and evolution of the influential style nevertheless unique to its creator, Nat Hiken, the respected scribe also responsible for The Phil Silvers Show (1955-1959, CBS), identified here as one of the best and most foundational sitcoms of the 1950s. Hiken\u2019s second and final foray in the sitcom genre is Car 54, and because we\u2019ve already discussed his earlier effort thoroughly \u2014 pinpointing how Hiken refined a counterpoint to the model as developed by I Love Lucy and Desilu \u2014 I urge you to check out our Phil Silvers essay for a more in-depth look at his work and my theory on the genre\u2019s two contrasting engines. I\u2019m only going to briefly summarize those conclusions, so we can use them in our examination of Car 54, which requires an elemental awareness of Phil Silvers and what we\u2019ve already featured\u2026 First, Hiken came from the New York school of comedy, which prized the funny idea \u2014 what motivated a sketch on a variety series \u2014 over the more sustaining character-based humor that tended to exist in Hollywood as an outgrowth of the need to find vehicles for established stars in demand of a regular persona. With the comic concept as its guiding force, the New York style could employ stars (and indeed was shaped by them, like Phil Silvers), but its goal was more to use them in the execution of amusing notions, which required writers like Hiken to be both fertile thinkers and experts at communication. Accordingly, value was derived both from the strength of a premise and the way it was handled, or manipulated, within a structure. In the half-hour sitcom, Hiken\u2019s genius came from the way he built stories, with carefully plotted beats rising to crescendos and an obvious emphasis on moment-by-moment layering, which reinforced these ideas\u2019 importance while stringing them together in a semblance of crafted cohesion. This focus on plot embodies the origins of the idea-driven, story-driven, premise-driven brand of situation comedy, which would go on to count as adherents everything from high-concept \u201960s classics, popular agenda-led hits from the \u201970s, and tonal dissenters from the post-cable era, along with many recent gems like Seinfeld and Arrested Development, both of which faithfully opined that structures (form), could be just as funny as their contained ideas (content), and together these, not character, were the primary elements of the sitcom.\n\nGiven that Hiken\u2019s Phil Silvers is the premiere representation of the above style, it should be no surprise that Car 54 is another of its exemplars, with a premise that\u2019s merely a launching pad for episodes driven by their stories/funny ideas and the same complicated, Jenga tower plotting associated with all of the author\u2019s sitcom work. So, to say that they share the same ethos is an understatement, for beyond the writing, both were produced in New York and dipped into the same pool of actors \u2014 a different set than those usually found on Hollywood shows. (And, of course, Car 54\u2018s core cast all appeared in some capacity on Phil Silvers, particularly Joe E. Ross and Beatrice Pons, who played battling spouses on both.) Additionally, both of Hiken\u2019s classics are workplace comedies in a highly regimented, male-dominated, uniform-wearing world that can also be set aside for personal stories outside of it. And, because Car 54 really is in New York, it also gets to take advantage of its location \u2014 indulging another of Hiken\u2019s trademarks: his fascination with show biz, which didn\u2019t make sense on a Kansas army base, but is more legitimized now via the Broadway connection\u2026 However, it\u2019s important to note that unlike on Phil Silvers, this element of Car 54\u2018s identity does not come packaged to a fourth-wall-acknowledging metatheatricality, for although there are some stars who appear as themselves, there\u2019s a textual fullness to the 53rd precinct and its officers, not to mention an obvious attempt to avoid undermining them with figurative winks. That is, Car 54 makes an evolution in its New York sketch-like comedy by adopting some of the dramatic integrity of its rival strain and instilling in these weekly operations a loyalty to its particulars that strengthens the characterizations and, actually, makes it easier for them to exist in story. In fact, I\u2019d say Car 54 takes itself more seriously, and while that may seem unwise for a comedy, any effort to fortify the tools (character and premise) by which a sitcom earns laughs is beneficial, making this a much better built endeavor than Hiken\u2019s previous. Heck, it\u2019s literally more of a sitcom, with a more formal structure, a more nuanced set of characters, and a more solid groundwork for story. That\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t be silly or unrealistic \u2014 it can \u2014 but this silliness is approved by a design that permits some heightened hijinks; they\u2019re grounded.\n\nAt the heart of this evolution is a key difference: Phil Silvers was anchored \u2014 no, dominated \u2014 by a singular star, who had less of a characterization than an oversized persona (whose vaudevillian bent enabled the show\u2019s burlesque wall-breaking wink), while Car 54 creates its core in two actual characters, the impulsive Toody (Joe E. Ross) and the cautious Muldoon (Fred Gwynne), contrasting and easily discernible police officers who have enough definition to inspire story and supply the series with a weighted relationship, which itself provides an emotional base that gives this otherwise unsentimental comedy a sustaining dramatic stake within its weekly plots\u2019 situations. In other words, whatever crazy thing happens, Car 54 still has these two strong characters, and their unshakable bond, at its center. It\u2019s also got a richer supporting cast as a whole, for beyond Ross and Gwynne, it has regular haha-providers in the aforementioned Pons, who gets more of a chance to shine than she did on Phil Silvers, and fellow officer Schnauser, played by Gwynne\u2019s future Munsters costar Al Lewis. He joins the ensemble as a regular before the first year\u2019s midway point and represents the series\u2019 official ascension to its desired state, which quickly gets added dimension when the very funny Charlotte Rae is introduced as his wife, Sylvia. These five, plus Paul Reed as the captain \u2014 functioning almost like Phil Silvers\u2018 colonel, a nominal authority figure \u2014 constitute the series\u2019 main ensemble, and they\u2019re more ripe with opportunity than the cast of Hiken\u2019s first series, which was too consumed by Silvers to give anyone more depth, and had a supporting lineup that, while amusing, never was as inspirational regarding story ideas\u2026 That said, despite the robust bedrock provided by this roster of players, and the more naturally fruitful setting and premise, Hiken\u2019s aesthetic is, again, one that favors the comedic idea, and its telling in story, above all else, so Car 54, like Phil Silvers, really only lives and dies on the power of its Victories In Premise, with excellence also coming, as usual, if/when its scripts are able to create the same madcap, ever-moving and unpredictable plotting that enlivens its plots and affirms their worth. To that point, the fact that Car 54 is better built is only palpable inasmuch as the design makes it more able to deliver on behalf of its chosen ideas, the series\u2019 chief interest.\n\nHere, the principal dilemma with being story-driven is clear, for even with a sturdier safety net provided by more established regulars who can better sustain mediocrity by supplying continuity, there\u2019s a distinction between ideas that work and don\u2019t, and eventually, with Hiken in total control and unable to find anyone who matches his style successfully, his wellspring of good ideas runs dry. And as we\u2019ll see next week, when we discuss the second and final season, there is a point in even this relatively short 60-episode run where stories, and their construction, are not as excellent as they had been before. We\u2019ll be able to lay some of this blame on Hiken\u2019s own exhaustion, exacerbated by behind-the-scenes issues that we\u2019ll also soon discuss (they have a big effect on the writing, actually), because when someone has a voice as unique as this creator\u2019s, it\u2019s a double-edged sword, for then he\u2019s the only scribe who can write his opus with any degree of authenticity. Additionally, when there\u2019s an emphasis on narrative structure, it\u2019s easy to fall into patterns and templates, and Car 54, in its back stretch, stumbles into a bit of a rut because of this, losing freshness as a result\u2026 Although, to be fair, every show\u2019s novelty wears off at some point, and every show also goes through figurative dry spells, so perhaps had the series been allowed to continue, this dip would not have proved long-lasting and this criticism would carry less weight. (I\u2019m skeptical, however, because of Phil Silvers\u2018 trajectory.) As it stands, there\u2019s still a great baseline of quality here \u2014 ask fans which episode is their favorite, and you\u2019ll get dozens of different answers \u2014 the first season of Car 54 is probably on par with Phil Silvers\u2019, with an excellence rate of about 70% (seven out of every ten scripts) and most of this weighted to the year\u2019s back half. The second season is somewhere near 60% on this metric, which is still strong, but, as we\u2019ll see, it\u2019s marred by a less ideal use of character and a weakened command on plots and plotting. So, again, Hiken\u2019s first season is king\u2026 Now, if you\u2019re seeking a more official verdict on Car 54 in relation to Phil Silvers, I\u2019ll reiterate that it\u2019s better built \u2014 a smarter application of Hiken\u2019s style \u2014 and it\u2019s more of a sitcom as we define the word, which makes it easier to watch; it\u2019s got better characters, better stories, and a better premise.\n\nNevertheless, in terms of episodes, there\u2019s nothing here as iconic as \u201cThe Court Martial,\u201d Phil Silvers\u2018 high-water mark and an ambassador for all its classics, which collectively and individually stand out as seminal in a study of the genre. This is not entirely about quality \u2014 Phil Silvers is more groundbreaking, while Car 54 is just another in the column to which they both belong. Also, the latter tends not to get its full critical due because it was cancelled after only two years. (Never mind that going up against Ed Sullivan was tough, and\u2026 well, stay tuned\u2026) As a consequence of its short run, it\u2019s not viewed today as a quintessential \u201960s sitcom \u2014 it\u2019s written off as Hiken\u2019s coda to the very \u201950s Phil Silvers\u2026 and, okay, I get why it seems displaced in its era; not only is Car 54 a pretty literate show for the \u201960s, it\u2019s also an outlier because it\u2019s set in New York and has a more realistic world than the escapist decade\u2019s norm. However, I\u2019d argue there\u2019s a lot in it that speaks to the \u201960s directly. It\u2019s got a male-dominated ensemble workplace (like many of the military comedies of the day), and it\u2019s also idea-driven like most of the period\u2019s high-concept efforts, putting story first but with indelible characters in support. This is the era\u2019s modus operandi: strong people in stronger narratives. And even if its world looks real, its comedy is frequently goofy and larger-than-life; tonally, it fits too. Plus, it\u2019s got a catchy theme song with memorable lyrics that tell us exactly what the show is going to be \u2014 what can be more \u201960s than that? Seriously though, it belongs in this time for the same reason I wanted to highlight it here: it\u2019s the missing link between the initial sketch-based, idea-driven work of the \u201950s and all the \u201960s comedies that follow in this category, for in combining Hiken\u2019s style with a more legitimate sense of character and premise, Car 54 gives the era permission to go broader with story-heavy storytelling\u2026 as long as the \u201cgivens\u201d of people and place are treated seriously enough to remain sturdy \u2014 these are the rules of the decade, with Car 54, alongside Dick Van Dyke, providing initial points of reference. So, for all these reasons, not to mention the terrific quality \u2014 this is the best collection of sitcom episodes from the \u201961-\u201962 season \u2014 Car 54 is a classic. I have picked ten offerings that I think exemplify the finest from this first season, which received three Emmy nominations and one win for Hiken\u2019s directing.\n\n01) Episode 2: \u201cSomething Nice For Sol\u201d (Aired: 09/24/61)\n\nA sergeant is worried about his job as Toody and Muldoon try to get him an anniversary gift.\n\nWritten by Terry Ryan & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nProduced as the series\u2019 pilot but aired as its sophomore excursion, this entry showcases an emerging structure for Car 54 as competing objectives lead to a misunderstanding, involving slapstick that\u2019s rooted in established motivations throughout the narrative\u2019s twists and turns. Much stronger than the actual premiere, it also suggests a recurring role for Nathaniel Frey, which doesn\u2019t materialize \u2014 the void he leaves will soon be filled by Al Lewis.\n\n02) Episode 7: \u201cThe Paint Job\u201d (Aired: 10/29/61)\n\n\n\nAfter denting Car 54, Toody and Muldoon become involved with a stolen automobile ring.\n\nWritten by Marty Roth & Nat Hiken | Directed by Nat Hiken\n\nAn ideal example of Car 54\u2018s nuanced plotting at the hands of its creator, \u201cThe Paint Job\u201d is not only stuffed with funny character moments that, by this time, benefit from the growing comedic dynamic between the two leads, it also ably uses their profession to match the storytelling style that Hiken actively endeavors to offer. Also, Al Lewis, soon to be a regular, plays a different role \u2014 a painter aiding a ring of car thieves. Phil Silvers\u2018 Billy Sands appears.\n\n03) Episode 14: \u201cGet Well, Officer Schnauser\u201d (Aired: 12/17/61)\n\nA teller mistakes Muldoon for a crook when the cops try to bust a bank robber.\n\nWritten by Terry Ryan & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nMy choice for the season\u2019s Most Valuable Episode (MVE), \u201cGet Well, Officer Schnauser\u201d is the first installment of the entire series that seems to fully employ the most important aspects of Car 54\u2018s identity, benefiting from the inclusion of the recently introduced Officer Schnauser, who does factor into the plot, and a story that again involves the police profession while using the varying personas of our two main officers to drive comedic conflict \u2014 Toody gets to don an ostentatious disguise, and the sweet-but-scary-looking Muldoon inadvertently ends up mistaken for the bank robber they\u2019re trying to nab. This mistaken identity bit, common on all comedies, will become a regular template for Car 54, and mostly with Muldoon (given Gwynne\u2019s impressive stature), but this is one of its finest applications\u2026 Additionally, it also includes a terrific performance from future recurring cast member Charlotte Rae, who plays the frightened, mixed-up bank teller, meaning that the entry gets to utilize one of its strongest, funniest performers for the first time too\u2026 even if she\u2019s not yet in the role for which she\u2019ll be better known. So, the premise is used well, the characters are used well, and the performers are used well: this is classic Car 54 \u2014 fresh and funny. Billy Sands appears again.\n\n04) Episode 17: \u201cBoom, Boom, Boom\u201d (Aired: 01/14/62)\n\nToody and Muldoon\u2019s singing group helps drive Jan Murray to a nervous breakdown.\n\nWritten by Sid Zelinka, Will Glickman, & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nAs noted above, show biz stories are a significant aspect of all Hiken\u2019s work, and this beloved offering features Jan Murray as himself. It\u2019s predicated mostly on an unforgettable comic premise, in which the cops\u2019 singing quartet, anchored by Muldoon, auditions for Murray as one of over 100 groups performing the same song, which sticks in his brain and eventually haunts him so much that he\u2019s driven to a nervous breakdown. It\u2019s an ostentatious idea to which the series commits entirely, and as usual, it\u2019ll do shows like this again \u2014 more than just the bit about characters driven to paranoia (first seen in the hacky \u201cThe Gypsy Curse\u201d), there\u2019ll be another singing group story next season, with Mitch Miller \u2014 but never again so comedically.\n\n05) Episode 19: \u201cToody\u2019s Paradise\u201d (Aired: 01/28/62)\n\nToody\u2019s undercover assignment leads Lucille to believe he\u2019s got another wife and family.\n\nWritten by Sid Zelinka, Will Glickman, & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nA well-laid script with a string of misunderstandings, this is another great sample of the complicated plotting that underscores Car 54\u2018s best episodes because it\u2019s a manifestation of Hiken\u2019s unique, iconic style, first observed on Phil Silvers. Speaking of which, this outing guest stars Elisabeth Fraser as a female cop whom Toody pretends is his wife when they go undercover\u2026 Naturally, Lucille sees them together and thinks her husband has a whole family on the side. The story keeps trucking along from there \u2014 one of the series\u2019 best farces.\n\n06) Episode 22: \u201cWhat Happened To Thursday?\u201d (Aired: 02/18/62)\n\nToody and Muldoon try to trick Schnauser into believing it\u2019s not Thursday.\n\nWritten by Tony Webster & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nHiken\u2019s knack for utterly original and memorable stories is well on display here in Season One of Car 54, and I posit this entry as being perhaps the greatest showcase for his creativity, thanks to a truly madcap idea of the officers attempting to keep the Schnausers \u2014 Rae\u2019s Sylvia was introduced in the offering prior \u2014 from having their weekly Thursday argument by making him believe it\u2019s not really Thursday, but Friday. What a setup for silliness \u2014 and big laughs.\n\n07) Episode 23: \u201cHow Smart Can You Get?\u201d (Aired: 02/25/62)\n\nToody and Muldoon orient a rookie officer who makes Toody feel inferior.\n\nTeleplay by Tony Webster | Story by Tony Webster & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nTV Guide once ranked this as one of the 100 best sitcom episodes of all-time, but while it\u2019s great, I think if the magazine wanted to pick one segment of Car 54 for its list, there are funnier, more classic possibilities to choose\u2026 That said, I actually think this is a sharp character piece \u2014 one of the show\u2019s best \u2014 for when Toody and Muldoon are tasked with tutoring a rookie officer, the younger cop proves to be a smart conversationalist and strikes up a rapport with Muldoon that leaves Toody feeling inferior. It\u2019s one of the funniest \u201crelationship\u201d shows of the entire series, and I have to note that it stands on the shoulders of earlier less comic outings that did some of the formative bond-building for the pair (like \u201cChange Your Partner,\u201d \u201cThe Sacrifice,\u201d and \u201cToody and Muldoon Crack Down,\u201d all of which are fine, if unspectacular).\n\n08) Episode 24: \u201cToday I Am A Man\u201d (Aired: 03/04/62)\n\nA family mistakes Muldoon\u2019s intentions and believe they\u2019re being held hostage.\n\nTeleplay by Tony Webster | Story by Tony Webster & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nOne of the funniest entries of the entire run, \u201cToday I Am A Man\u201d uses the same comedic notion as \u201cGet Well, Officer Schnauser,\u201d for the innocent Muldoon unknowingly finds himself being mistaken for a bad guy\u2026 this time by a family of three (mother, father, daughter) whom he joins at a club when he pretends to his buddies that the young girl is his date. But when the confused strangers see Muldoon\u2019s gun, they believe he\u2019s holding them hostage. Their misplaced fear and his complete obliviousness \u2014 along with the girl\u2019s turnaround \u2014 is hysterical and another great example of why Car 54 is both a primary study of Hiken\u2019s developed tastes and one of the early \u201960s\u2019 best sitcoms. Also, Bob Hastings guests.\n\n09) Episode 25: \u201cNo More Pickpockets\u201d (Aired: 03/11/62)\n\nToody and Muldoon end up arrested, thanks to a skilled pickpocket.\n\nWritten by Tony Webster & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nWally Cox guest stars as an unassuming pickpocket at Yankee Stadium whose dexterity with swiped wallets leads to both Toody and Muldoon winding up in jail. Our two officers are made to look especially bumbling here \u2014 it\u2019s not unusual for the cops to accidentally step their feet in their own laid traps \u2014 but this is the best version of this formula, with a fast-moving teleplay bolstered by a distinguished structure that\u2019s quintessential Car 54. Again, Billy Sands appears.\n\n10) Episode 26: \u201cThe Beast Who Walked The Bronx\u201d (Aired: 03/18/62)\n\nThe precinct fears that the captain is to be temporarily replaced with a violent taskmaster.\n\nWritten by Terry Ryan & Nat Hiken | Directed by Al De Caprio\n\nMounting uncertainty, if not outright paranoia, is a common source of laughs on this series, and this installment does it better than most, mostly by intelligently setting up a scenario where the precinct erroneously comes to fear a meek, temporary replacement for the captain because they think he\u2019s a \u201cbeast\u201d who\u2019ll beat them all into submission. And when one of the officers goes into the office and seems to not come out, naturally they all fear the worst. Very funny.\n\nOther notable episodes that merit mention include: the closest to the above list, \u201cPut It In The Bank,\u201d in which the cops inadvertently cause panic around them simply because they\u2019re cops. Additional offerings that I think need to be cited here include the actual premiere, \u201cWho\u2019s For Swordfish?,\u201d which has a few strong comic scenes, \u201cHome Sweet Sing Sing,\u201d which is built on a sturdy comic premise, \u201cI Won\u2019t Go,\u201d which is the first (but not the best) of three stories featuring Molly Picon, \u201cCatch Me On The Paar Show,\u201d which is a show biz entry with amiable, if predictable comic centerpieces, \u201cThe Taming Of Lucille,\u201d a seemingly popular show for the Toodys, \u201cToody And The Art World,\u201d which is mostly a one-joke show but is also interesting for introducing Charlotte Rae as Sylvia, \u201cThe Courtship Of Sylvia Schnauser,\u201d which is Rae\u2019s best showcase this year, \u201cThe Auction,\u201d which is laudable only for its auction scene, \u201cQuiet! We\u2019re Thinking,\u201d which is yet another outing with an indelible comic premise, and \u201cI Love Lucille,\u201d which is a terrifically funny show for Beatrice Pons that I really enjoy\u2026 even though a few moments are a little too unmotivated to fully support.\n\n*** The MVE Award for the Best Episode from Season One of Car 54, Where Are You? goes to\u2026\n\n\u201cGet Well, Officer Schnauser\u201d\n\nCome back next week for Season Two!

Rae was also known for her role as the hilariously gossipy housewife 'Sylvia Schnauser' on the early 1960s NBC sitcom \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" (1961-63). Born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky, she started acting early with the Children's Theatre of Wauwatosa and later on radio. As a teenager, she won a summer apprenticeship with the Port Players, a professional summer theater company. She also was a regular on the stage at Shorewood High School. In 1944, she attended Northwestern University and studied alongside other later well-known actors and actresses such as Charlton Heston, Paul Lynde, Jeffrey Hunter, and Cloris Leachman. In 1948, she made the decision to leave school and go to New York to seek fame and fortune as a singer and dancer. She made her Broadway debut in 1952 in \"Three Wishes for Jamie\" and followed it up with such successful endeavors as \"The Threepenny Opera\" (off-Broadway) and \"L'il Abner\" (Broadway). She went on to later receive two Tony Award nominations in her career, for \"Pickwick\" in 1966 and \"Morning, Noon, and Night\" in 1969. She also recorded an album in 1955 which was titled \"Songs I Taught My Mother.\" She made her first television appearance in 1951 on the television series \"Once Upon a Time.\" Besides \"The Facts of Life\" and \"Car 54, Where Are You,\" she went on to appear in many television series during her career such as \"The Phil Silvers Show\", \"Sesame Street\", \"The Paul Lynde Show,\" \"Hot L Baltimore,\" \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (where she originated the 'Edna Garrett' character), \"Sisters,\" \"Murder She Wrote,\" \"ER,\" and \"The King of Queens.\" She made her first film appearance in 1969 in \"Hello Down There.\" Her big-screen credits would later include such films as \"Bananas\" (1971), \"Rabbit Test\" (1978), \"Hair\" (1979), \"Nowhere\" (1997), and \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\" (2008). She also did voice work on several animated series. She suffered from various health crises throughout her life and was one of the few people to survive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pancreatic cancer). Having lost her mother and elder sister to the disease, she had been enrolled in a long-term testing study. However, she was later diagnosed with bone cancer, and died, aged 92, according to her death certificate, from metabolic acidosis and carcinoma of the right parotid gland.\n\nBio by: Mr. Badger Hawkeye"}, {"url": "http://www.car54where.com/", "page_content": "Other cast members included Beatrice Pons, Al Lewis, Charlotte Rae, Nipsey Russell, Ossie Davis, Paul Reed, Larry Storch, Hank Garrett and Mel Stewart.

Ross who had previously been seen as Bilko\u2019s regular foil, Rupert Ritzik.\n\nHiken even retained some of the old Bilko chemistry by employing actress Beatrice Pons to appear as Ross\u2019s wife, Lucille \u2013 as she had done back at Fort Baxter.\n\nTo complete the comic connection, Al Lewis appeared as the henpecked Officer Leo Schnauser \u2013 whose wife, Sylvia (Charlotte Rae), was convinced he was having a secret affair with Marilyn Monroe \u2013 before teaming up again with Gwynne in The Munsters at the end of Car 54\u2018s two-season run.\n\nOfficers Toody and Muldoon were among the most unlikely patrol car partners ever seen on a police force. Toody was short, stocky, friendly, and just a bit nosy, a marked contrast to the tall, quiet Muldoon, who lived with his mother and sister.\n\nAlthough they were assigned to New York\u2019s 53rd precinct \u2013 a run-down area in the Bronx \u2013 they always seemed to encounter more comedy than crime.\n\nMuch of the series was shot on location on the streets of New York. To avoid confusion, their police car was painted bright red (pictured at left) so it would not be mistaken for an authentic police vehicle. This obviously did not show in the black and white film.\n\nAs the 1990s dawned, and Hollywood movie producers began to look back fondly and with covetous eyes at their childhood TV favourites, so Car 54 was updated for the big screen. It could have worked, had it been done well, but it was not.\n\nThe Car 54, Where Are You? movie was a crass, insulting shambles, made without regard to the qualities of the original and an ill-judged wholesale embrace of the \u2018rap\u2019 culture that heaps embarrassment upon the production.\n\nDavid Johansen starred as the gravel-voiced Toody, John C McGinley was cast as Muldoon and Rosie O\u2019Donnell as Lucille.\n\nOne nice touch was that two veterans of the TV series were employed: Al Lewis as the about-to-retire Leo Schnauzer (clearly, no regard was paid to spelling either) and Nipsey Russell appeared again as Anderson, now promoted to the rank of station captain.\n\nWhen completed, the best possible thing happened to this travesty of a movie: Orion Pictures, the production company, went into bankruptcy, and it never came out.

While it is a truly humorous look at the shenanigans of the police officers assigned to the fictional 53rd precinct in the Bronx, it is most often remembered as a minor cult classic filled with performers better known from other series and for its catchy opening theme song. The show focused on patrol-car partners Gunther Toody (Joe E. Ross) and Francis Muldoon (Fred Gwynne) as they attempted to serve and protect the citizens of New York. A more unlikely pairing of police officers had never been seen on television. Toody was a short and stocky, often slow-witted, talkative cop, and Muldoon was a tall and gangly, usually laconic, intellectual. Episodes were filled with the usual sitcom fare as the partners' bumbling caused misunderstandings within their squad, such as the time Toody attempted to make a plaster cast of a fellow patrolman's aching feet and chaos ensued. Each week the pair caused their superior, Captain Block, to become infuriated as they made more trouble for the Bronx than they resolved.\n\nIn many respects, Car 54, Where Are You? can be considered somewhat of a sequel to the popular 1950s sitcom You'll Never Get Rich, which is also known as The Phil Silvers Show. That series, created by writer-producer-director Nat Hiken and starring comedian Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko, focused on the misadventures of an oddball assembly of soldiers at Fort Baxter, a forgotten outpost in Kansas. Hiken was a gifted writer who had worked on Fred Allen's\n\nradio show and later contributed to Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater. The Silvers show had been a great hit as Sgt. Bilko and his motor pool staff schemed, gambled, and tried to avoid all types of work. When that series ended in 1959, Hiken decided to translate some of its comic sensibility to another setting. Like its predecessor, Car 54 was a series about men who failed to live up to the dignity of their uniform. Unlike the schemers of Fort Baxter, however, the police of the 53rd precinct were trying their best\u2014though often failing. Hiken filled the series with many performers featured on the earlier show. Joe E. Ross had played Mess Sergeant Rupert Ritzik \"the Lucretia Borgia of Company B.\" The character of Gunther Toody was an exact replica of the Ritzik character even down to his trademark expression of \"oooh-oooh-oooh.\" Toody's nagging wife Lucille was played by Beatrice Pons, the actress who had appeared as Mrs. Ritzik. Fred Gwynne, who had been a Harvard educated advertising man, was also a featured player on the Bilko show. Furthermore, many of the other officers had been seen as soldiers at the mythical Fort Baxter.\n\nThe core of the series was the great friendship Toody and Muldoon had forged from their many years patrolling the streets in Car 54. Their contrasting natures had meshed perfectly despite the fact they had absolutely nothing in common. Author Rick Mitz best captured their relationship when he described the pair by noting, \"Toody was the kind of guy who would say that he thought he should get a police citation for 'having the cleanest locker.' Muldoon was the kind of guy who would say nothing.\" Many episodes took place away from the police station and explored the partners' home lives. Toody and his frustrated wife often included the shy bachelor into their evening plans. One of the series' best episodes centered on Toody's mistaken idea that Lucille and Muldoon were having an affair. Surrounding them was a cast of top character actors including Paul Reed, Al Lewis, Charlotte Rae, Alice Ghostley, and Nipsey Russell. Many of these performers would later graduate to star in their own TV shows. All the characters on the program depicted an ethnic reality little seen on early television. Toody's Jewishness and Muldoon's Irish-Catholic background were more realistic than the bland characters, with no discernable heritage, seen on other programs. The series was also distinguished by Hiken's decision to film on the streets of New York. Sets were constructed on the old Biograph Studio in the Bronx. For street scenes, Toody and Muldoon's patrol car was painted red and white to indicate to New Yorkers that it was not actually a police vehicle. In black-and-white film, Car 54's unique colors looked identical to the genuine New York police vehicles.\n\nWhen it premiered in 1961, the series caused some controversy after several police associations claimed it presented a demeaning picture of police officers. The police department in Dayton, Ohio dropped their own Car # 54 from the fleet after constant teasing from the public. However, most viewers understood the series was intended as a satire that bore little relation to the lives of actual police officers. Viewers' affection for the show was evident in Nyack, New York where a patrol car stolen from the police station parking lot was nicknamed \"Car 54.\" The series ended in 1963 after failing to match the success of Hiken's earlier Phil Silvers program. Neither Nat Hiken, who died in 1968, nor Joe E. Ross, who passed away in 1982, ever again achieved the limited success they found with Car 54. Following the show's cancellation, Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis (who played Sgt. Schnauzer) achieved TV immortality playing \"Herman\" and \"Grandpa\" on the monster sitcom The Munsters. Gwynne died in 1993.\n\nThe sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? is an energetic series that never really attained a mass audience. Its presentation of the misad-ventures of Officers Toody and Muldoon gained a small cult audience that only expanded after the series began to be replayed on cable's Nick at Night network. An awful 1994 movie version update of the show (which was filmed in 1991) starred David Johansen and John C. McGinley as Toody and Muldoon. It also featured rising stars Rosie O'Donnell and Fran Drescher. Viewers of the original sitcom can ignore the film and enjoy a quirky short-lived series that offers an amusing update of the Keystone Kops. Furthermore, after one viewing it's almost impossible to forget that opening theme, which began: \"There's a holdup in the Bronx /Brooklyn's broken out in fights /There's a traffic jam in Harlem that's backed up to Jackson Heights\u2026.\"\n\n\u2014Charles Coletta\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nBrooks, Tim.

Although she didn't complete her studies she became friends with a number of future stars including Cloris Leachman, Charlton Heston and Paul Lynde. In 1948, she moved to New York City, where she performed in theater and nightclubs. She was convinced to drop her last name and became Charlotte Rae. Rae appeared on Broadway in \"Three Wishes for Jamie\" in 1952, and \"The Threepenny Opera\" in 1954, the same year she made her debut onscreen on the shows \"Look Up and Live\" (CBS, 1954-59) and \"The United States Steel Hour\" (ABC, 1945-1949; NBC, 1949-1953) and continued working consistently for the next six decades. Although she first intended to be a dramatic actress, Rae found her niche in comedy and her first substantial part came in a recurring role as Sylvia Schnauzer, wife of Officer Leo Schnauzer on the hit comedy \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" (NBC, 1961-63). After that show ended in 1963, Rae continued working on screen and on stage and was nominated for Tony Awards in 1966 (Best Featured Actress in \"Pickwick\") and 1969 (Best Actress in \"Morning, Noon and Night\"). In 1971, Rae was a recurring character on \"Sesame Street\" (NET, 1969-1970; PBS, 1970-2016; HBO, 2016-) and in 1974, collaborated for the first time with Norman Lear, appearing in guest roles on \"Good Times\" (CBS, 1974-79) and \"All in the Family\" (CBS, 1971-79). Rae was a series regular on \"Hot l Baltimore\" (ABC, 1975), a short-lived show, also Executive Produced by Lear. In 1978, Rae began playing the role that would define her career. On the first four seasons of the iconic sitcom \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (NBC, 1978-1985; ABC 1985-86), her character Edna Garrett provided back-up and support and comic relief for the Drummond family. After the second season of the show, Rae performed double duty, playing Edna on \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" and on the successful spin off \"The Facts of Life\" (NBC, 1979-1988). In 1982, she was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for \"The Facts of Life.\" Rae had a pacemaker implanted in 1982, and, after she left \"The Facts of Life\" in 1986, continued to work at a slower pace, often lending her voice to children's animated series such as \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\" (USA, 1994-96), but still making appearances on live action shows like \"Sisters\" (NBC, 1991-96), and \"ER\" (NBC, 1994-2009).

Al Lewis was born in New York in April of 1923 and passed away in New York in February of 2006. At first glance, they don\u2019t seem to have a lot in common, but a closer look reveals why they enjoyed a long friendship.\n\nFred Gwynne\n\nFred Gwynne grew up in New York and had a very wealthy and advantaged upbringing. He was a radioman in the Navy during World War II. When the war was over, Gwynne entered Harvard, studying drawing and dramatics. He became a member of their Hasty Pudding Club, being involved with many theatrical productions. Gwynne graduated in 1951 and went on to work for a Shakespeare repertory company. He was a talented man with a variety of interests and earned his living from several careers. He was a copywriter, a musician, a book illustrator, and a commercial artist.\n\nIn 1952, he made his Broadway debut, acting with Helen Hayes in \u201cMrs. McThing.\u201d The play ran for 320 performances. In 1953, he performed in his second Broadway play, \u201cThe Frogs of Spring\u201d which had a much shorter run. In 1954, he had a small role in On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando.\n\nHe also began appearing on television in the 1950s, and most of his roles were on dramas such as Kraft Theater or DuPont Show of the Week.\n\nThe one exception was The Phil Silvers Show where he appeared in 1955 and 1956. The producer of this show, Nat Hiken, went on to create a similar show called Car 54 Where Are You? about New York policemen. He cast Gwynne as one of the leads, Francis Muldoon. The show ran for two seasons and when it was cancelled, Gwynne went back to his theatrical dramas.\n\nIn 1964, the creators of Leave It to Beaver, decided on a different concept for a show called The Munsters. Fred was cast as the lead role. While this show also ran two years, the part of Herman Munster was much harder to overcome than Francis Muldoon had been. Gwynne struggled to find new roles, and when he was unsuccessful, he went back to Broadway. He did make one pilot during these years for a show called Guess What I Did Today, but no network picked it up. His favorite Broadway performance was Big Daddy in 1974 when he starred in \u201cCat On a Hot Tin Roof.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1980s, his cinema career picked up and he ended up with 15 movies to his credit from 1979-1992. Included in this list are The Cotton Club, The Secret of My Success, Fatal Attraction, Ironweed, Pet Sematary, and My Cousin Vinny.\n\nHis book writing and illustrating also continued. His first book, The Best in Show, was published in 1958. The King Who Rained came out in 1970, and Simon and Schuster published A Chocolate Moose for Dinner in 1976 and A Little Pigeon Toad in 1988.\n\nThroughout most of his career, Gwynne lived a quiet life far from Hollywood. He was married to his first wife Roxy from 1952-1980 and his second wife from 1981 until his death from pancreatic cancer in 1993.\n\nAl Lewis\n\nAl Lewis claimed he was born in 1910 and was a circus performer in the 1920s. He also said he went to Columbia and graduated with a PhD in child psychology. After he passed away, his son confirmed that he was born in 1923, and Columbia had no record of him attending school with his given name or his stage name. His son thought he made himself older to get the role of Grandpa in The Munsters because in real life Yvonne DeCarlo was a year older than he was.\n\nSome of his other jobs included a salesman, hot dog vendor for the Brooklyn Dodgers, waiter, pool room owner, and store detective. He was a good basketball player in high school and apparently worked as a basketball scout at some time in his early life. A friend convinced him to join an actor\u2019s workshop in 1949 and that led to a career in vaudeville. In the 1950s and 1960s, he appeared in a variety of TV shows including US Steel Hour, Route 66, Lost in Space, and Gomer Pyle. He too was cast in the Phil Silvers Show which later resulted in his role of Patrolman Leo Schnauzer in Car 54 Where Are You?\n\nIn 1964, he too was offered a role in The Munsters. In 1966 when the show went off the air, he continued making television appearances and starred in cinema movies. During the 1970s and 1980s, he appeared on Night Gallery, Green Acres, Love American Style, Here\u2019s Lucy, Taxi, and Best of the West. His career featured 22 films including They Shoot Horses Don\u2019t They, Boatniks, Used Cars, Married to the Mob, and a remake of Car 54 Where Are You?\n\nLike Gwynne, he was married twice: to Marge from 1956-1977 and to Karen from 1984 until his death from heart complications in 2006. Lewis also published several children\u2019s books during his acting career.\n\nMidway through his career he opened an Italian restaurant, Grandpa\u2019s Bella Gente, which Gwynne designed the logo for. He also got into radio and was featured on Howard Stern\u2019s Show often.\n\nIt is surprising that both of these stars were in two sitcoms which both lasted only two years. Let\u2019s take a look at the shows that made them household names.\n\nCar 54 Where Are You?\n\nThis sitcom, set in the 53rd precinct in Brooklyn was an early Barney Miller. Gwynne played Francis Muldoon. His partner, Gunther Toody, was his exact opposite. While Muldoon was a bachelor, an intellectual, calm and quiet, Toody was married, na\u00efve, excitable, and talkative. In one show, when the precinct is debating splitting up the two men, Muldoon says \u201cI guess most of the men are smarter than Gunther and less trouble than Gunther, but . . . well, I\u2019m so used to Gunther. When he chatters away, the days just fly by. I\u2019d just be lost without Gunther.\u201d Gunther concurs, \u201cYou mean ride around with someone next to me that\u2019s not Muldoon? Francis is a quiet man. He doesn\u2019t say a word. He just sits there all day thinking. It\u2019s very comforting for a man like me to know there\u2019s someone next to him doing the thinking for both of us.\u201d Of course, they split them up only to partner them up again because no one else could take the silence or constant chatter.\n\nAl Lewis played Officer Leo Schnauzer, appearing in every episode.\n\nPolicemen were split on their view of the show. Some took offense and felt they were portrayed in a negative light, while others enjoyed it and identified with some of the comedic elements. It was filmed in The Bronx at Biograph Studio. There was a large sign out front identifying it as the 53rd precinct till a woman came in pleading to save her from her abusive husband and the sign was quickly taken down.\n\nOriginally titled Snow Whites, the show aired at 8:30 eastern time Sunday nights between The Wide World of Disney and Bonanza. The only clue I could find for the original name was that the show was sponsored by Proctor and Gamble who made several detergents for clothing. It was filmed in black and white, but the police cars were red and white so they would show up better on black and white film. The show also starred Beatrice Pons, Charlotte Rae, Nipsey Russell, Alice Ghostley, and Larry Storch.\n\nPerhaps what the show is best remembered for was its catchy theme song. Anyone who viewed an episode or two can probably remember the fun lyrics:\n\nThere\u2019s a hold up in the Bronx, Brooklyn\u2019s broken out in fights.\n\nThere\u2019s a traffic jam in Harlem that\u2019s backed up to Jackson Heights.\n\nThere\u2019s a scout troop short a child; Kruschev\u2019s due at Idlewild . . .\n\nCar 54, where are you?\n\nThe Munsters\n\nIn 1964, the creators of Leave It to Beaver decided to feature another \u201cwholesome\u201d family who just happens to live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. The family consists of Grandpa who is always experimenting in his lab; Herman who is the funeral director at Gateman, Goodbury, and Graves; his wife Lilly, a vampire; their son Eddie who is a werewolf; and their beautiful black-sheep Marilyn. Marilyn was beautiful but they viewed her as odd looking and she seemed to get a lot of dates but when she brings them home, they never ask her out again. The family also owns two pets \u2013 Spot, a prehistoric animal Grandpa rescued and Igor, a bat. They lived a somewhat normal life but drank bat milk and cooked in a cauldron. On the hour, a cuckoo clock chimed and a raven, voiced by Mel Blanc, appeared and said \u201cNevermore.\u201d\n\nAll the actors had to endure a two-hour make-up session, but Gwynne had the worst time because he had to wear 40-50 pounds of padding. One day he lost 10 pounds filming under the lights. They gave him gallons of lemonade between takes and later rigged a way to blow cool air on him underneath the material.\n\nThe entire family could have been played by different actors. John Carradine was offered the role of Herman. The pilot featured Joan Marshall as the wife and instead of Lilly, her name was Phoebe. Marilyn was played by Beverly Owens for 13 episodes and then Pat Priest took over for the rest of the show\u2019s run. Eddie was first offered to Bill Mumy, Will Robinson from Lost in Space, and Grandpa to Bert Lahr from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAfter the show was cancelled, the Munster mobile often traveled to memorabilia shows. There was also a Dragula built with purple silk upholstery and chrome pipes for the exhaust. Although the show was only on the air for two years, there were a lot of collectibles such as board games, lunch boxes, paper dolls, and coloring books.\n\nIn 2001, the McKee family of Waxahachie, Texas was such a huge fan of the show that the family built their 5000+ square foot house to exactly resemble the Munsters\u2019 home including the crooked weather vane and grand staircase that lifted up to feed Spot.\n\nBoth Gwynne and Lewis were born in New York. They both appeared on the show Brenner early in their careers. Both were tapped from their roles in The Phil Silvers Show to play roles on Car 54 Where Are You? They both went on to star in The Munsters. Neither of them ever had another series. They both chose to live on the east coast. They both wrote children\u2019s books. They were each married twice and married to their second spouse for the rest of their lives. They both had a lot of success in the movies as well as television. They were both men with fascinating careers before they ever entered acting. I learned a lot about these interesting friends.
