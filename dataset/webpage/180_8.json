Each player\u2019s score is calculated by averaging his weighted rank from the fans, players and media. The two guards and three front court players with the best score in each conference are named starters.\n\nFan votes serve as the tiebreaker for players in a position group with the same score.\n\nSince 2018, instead of East vs. West teams, two captains pick the teams. The captains are the All-Star starters who earn the most fan votes in their respective conferences. Alternating picks, the captains draft the eight remaining players from the starter pool in the first round.\n\nHow were NBA All-Star starters selected in the past?\n\nAccording to NBA.com, for the first 24 NBA All-Star Games (1951 until 1974), a panel of select media, namely sportswriters and broadcasters, chose each conference\u2019s starting five (as well as three bench players).\n\nIn 1975, NBA All-Star fan voting was introduced and the fans selected all 10 starters, which remained the case until the 2016-17 season.\n\nHow are NBA All-Star reserves selected?"}, {"url": "https://www.sportscasting.com/nba-all-star-voting-how-does-a-player-get-chosen-for-the-all-star-game/", "page_content": "Since 2017, NBA All-Star Game starters have been selected by voting of fans, players, and media in a weighted process.\n\nFan voting for the NBA All-Star Game continues through Jan. 22. For more than 30 years, fans solely determined starters in the annual exhibition game. The process of choosing NBA players for the game has changed a few times since the first NBA All-Star Game in 1951. Today, multiple voting tallies account for the selection process.\n\nFans got the vote for the first time for the 1975 NBA All-Star Game, and that process continued through 2016. The fan\u2019s voice still weighs heavily on the process, but other influences have entered the mix.\n\nIn the early days of the NBA All-Star Game, the media picked the starters\n\nFrom 1951\u201374, a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters chose the starters for the East and West and selected three reserves for each side. The coaches determined the rest of the roster, 10 players until it grew to 12 in 1961.\n\nBut for the 1975 NBA All-Star Game, fan voting became the standard for naming the starters. The coaches chose reserves in each conference.\n\nThe top vote-getter in 1975 was Buffalo Braves center Bob McAdoo, who tallied 98,325 votes. New York Knicks guard Walt Frazier drew 91,621 ballots. Milwaukee Bucks center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got the most votes among Western Conference players with 77,832.\n\nUntil the 2013 NBA All-Star Game, voters selected two guards, two forwards, and a center. That year, voting adjusted to account for the small-ball trend in the game. Three frontcourt players and two backcourt players won starting spots in the East and West.\n\nThe current voting system, implemented in 2017, includes three votes.\n\nFans, players, and media choose the starters in a weighted NBA All-Star vote\n\nLeBron James has started 17 consecutive NBA All-Star Games. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nToday, fan voting begins on Christmas Day and continues to the fourth Saturday in January. Fans make up 50% of the selection process.\n\nVoting by NBA players counts 25%, as does a vote of NBA media members.\n\nAccording to NBA.com, the selection takes place after votes are counted. Players are ranked in each conference by frontcourt and backcourt within the three voting groups. Each player receives a score based on the weighted rank from fans, players, and media. In the case of a tie, fan voting takes precedence.\n\nThere was a tie in the 2021 voting. In the Western Conference backcourt race, Dallas Mavericks standout Luka Don\u010di\u0107 was second in the fan voting and third among both players and media. Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers was third, second, and second.\n\nBecause of the weighting system, each player finished with 2.5 points. Don\u010di\u0107 got the starting nod with more fan ballots cast for him.\n\nResults still break down by conference. But the NBA abandoned the East vs. West All-Star Game format in 2018.\n\nInstead, the leader in the fan voting from each conference is a team captain. The captains choose the other four starters from the winners of the vote. Selection of reserves follows.\n\nSince the format change, LeBron James leads with four straight years as a captain. Giannis Antetokounmpo has two, with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant also serving.\n\nInjuries almost always change the final rosters\n\nThe All-Star selection process seldom ends with the selection of starters and reserves. The teams last played as selected in 2005. Every year since at least one player missed the game because of injury.\n\nIn that case, commissioner Adam Silver names a replacement from the same conference as the injured player.\n\nLast year, Anthony Davis and Durant missed the game due to injury. Devin Booker and Domantas Sabonis replaced them. However, Booker got hurt. Mike Conley was the injury replacement for the injury replacement. As it turned out, rosters for the game were just 11 players; Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid ended up in health and safety protocols.\n\nThe NBA set rosters at 12 players for the 1974 NBA All-Star Game. An old rule requiring every team to have a representative necessitated larger rosters with expansion. After three years of 14-man teams, the NBA abolished the participation requirement.\n\nIn 1973, John Block represented the Philadelphia 76ers, his lone career All-Star appearance. At the time, the 76ers were 4\u201347 and would set an NBA record for futility with 73 losses. Other one-time All-Stars in the expansion years included Bob Boozer, Walt Hazzard, Jon McGlocklin, Flynn Robinson, Bob Rule, and Butch Beard.\n\nRegardless of who ends up in Cleveland on Feb. 20, there will be controversy. There always is. But that\u2019s part of the fun of the process, particularly in the social media era.

In actuality, though, Oakland should have been his second All-Star trip. The 1999 NBA All-Star Game, booked in Philadelphia \u2014 on Valentine\u2019s Day, at that \u2014 was the most high-profile casualty of an NBA lockout that threatened the entire 1998-99 season.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where it was supposed to be? In Philadelphia?\u201d Carter says after a January practice in Sacramento, California. Even over the phone there\u2019s genuine shock in his voice. \u201cWow,\u201d he says. \u201cI [really] had no idea.\u201d\n\nBut what if the NBA hadn\u2019t had to cancel the 1999 All-Star Game? What if, in a new, post-Michael Jordan NBA, there had been a huge Philly basketball celebration to help ease the pain of losing basketball\u2019s biggest star?\n\nWhat if there had been an All-Star Weekend in 1999? You\u2019re in luck. There is.\n\nBut first, some backstory.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to fault Carter for not recalling. The 1998-99 season is a forgotten, or at least rarely discussed, chapter in NBA history. Owners locked out the players on July 1, and the NBA season was shortened to 50 games. There were \u201cno trades, no player signings, no NBA-sanctioned summer leagues, or contact between players and team representatives.\u201d There was no All-Star Game. Shortly after the 1998 NBA draft, which featured future Hall of Famers such as Carter, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce, labor negotiations came to a screeching halt as growing profits, and how those profits would be allocated in coming seasons, became the glaring issue.\n\nTeam owners, among other things, talked salary cap issues and blamed Kevin Garnett\u2019s 1997 $126 million contract. \u201cThat \u2026 changed the landscape,\u201d said former NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik after the lockout. \u201cThis was the one where owners said something had to be done.\u201d Players talked about the NBA\u2019s swelling revenues, especially from television, and the rookie salary scale, among other things.\n\nPlayers unfairly shouldered much of the public blame for the lockout, though in fairness, some players didn\u2019t make it easy on themselves from a public relations perspective. While attempting to organize a charity game in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to benefit UNICEF \u2014 and NBA players \u2014 then-union president Patrick Ewing said pro athletes \u201cmake a lot of money, but spend a lot, too.\u201d The gesture of the game did anything but win the fans\u2019 favor back to the players. The Boston Celtics\u2019 Kenny Anderson joked about selling one of his eight cars. And Grant Hill took a temporary hit to his reputation for, in the eyes of many, not taking more of an assertive role during the lockout \u2014 and his Sprite commercial with Tim Duncan reportedly angered several players.\n\nBy mid-October, the NBA\u2019s preseason and the first two weeks of the regular season had been canceled. \u201cIf the [NBA] isn\u2019t back by Christmas,\u201d said Neil Hernberg, then the sports marketing manager of apparel behemoth Pro Player, \u201cwe could lose 75 percent of our NBA business.\u201d The effects of the lockout hit the pockets of other business partners as well. \u201cThe market is soft,\u201d noted Steve Raab, vice president of marketing for Starter. \u201cRetailers are reducing and canceling orders.\u201d\n\nNetworks were forced to revamp programming, and shortly before Christmas, the NBA announced for the first time in its history \u2014 and, to date, still the only time since 1951 \u2014 that the league would cancel its annual midseason classic. The city of Philadelphia lost out on an estimated $40 million.\n\n\u201c[The lockout] didn\u2019t set me back because I had nothing to be set back from,\u201d says Carter. \u201cI went back to [the University of North Carolina]. I did a semester \u2026 and had a chance to work out with Coach [Dean] Smith and the team while I was waiting for the lockout to end.\u201d\n\nThe players approved a new deal 179-5 at 6 a.m. on Jan. 6, 1999, and the league\u2019s Board of Governors unanimously agreed to ratify the compromise. The deal was widely viewed as a win for the owners, but the players did walk away with more money for non-franchise players, and for the superstars. \u201cDid [the players] blink?\u201d then-NBA Players Association executive director Billy Hunter asked rhetorically. \u201cI guess we both blinked.\u201d\n\nLess than a week after the return of pro basketball back, Jordan retired for a second time.\n\nThe announcement wasn\u2019t much of a shock, but the impact was massive and multidimensional. Television networks, which for years profited from Jordan\u2019s magnetism, were forced to adjust to an uncertain new reality. \u201cIt\u2019s unique to have been in a partnership with the NBA for eight years, and to have had this fairy dust sprinkled on us,\u201d said NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol. \u201cNow we have to reintroduce this generation of stars \u2026 will we get Babe Ruth tomorrow? No.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad to see him go,\u201d rhythm and blues singer/actress Aaliyah said. \u201cBut he\u2019s had an incredible career and we will miss him. \u2026 He\u2019s worked hard and he deserves to relax now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day weekend in Philadelphia. In real life, the 1998-99 season is just over a week old. Teams and players are working their way back into a groove.\n\nInstead of the pageantry of an All-Star Game, the 76ers are hosting the Atlanta Hawks. Allen Iverson is his usual self \u2014 32 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 6 steals and 2 blocks \u2014 helping Philly improve to 4-1 to start the season. He\u2019s the game\u2019s lone bright spot in a 78-70 Sixers victory. Unfortunately, the biggest news to hit the city that weekend is a fire that engulfed South Philly\u2019s St. Barnabas United Methodist Church. And the biggest sports-related news? Wrestlemania XV invading the city in March, headlined by a no-disqualification title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock.\n\nBut let\u2019s imagine an alternative history\n\nPhiladelphia is abuzz with Hollywood\u2019s elite, music\u2019s biggest names and NBA legends \u2014 both established and in the making. West Philadelphia\u2019s Will Smith, fresh off \u201cGettin\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d and Enemy of the State, is one of the biggest stars on the planet \u2014 he\u2019s down front. So is Lauryn Hill \u2014 she\u2019s one of the biggest musical artists on the planet. And Iverson? He\u2019s in his third season and already one of the league\u2019s most prolific scorers. But more than that? He reaches and represents a generation fueled by counterculture and soundtracked by hip-hop. While Iverson\u2019s cornrows and tattoos are to some a sign of basketball\u2019s decaying morals, to a younger generation he\u2019s a symbol of defiance, swagger and perseverance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair, but it\u2019s true,\u201d Iverson told Chris Rock. \u201cPeople look at the way I dress, who I hang around, [my] jewelry \u2014 people try to make me 34 years old and I\u2019m only 24.\u201d People hated Allen Iverson and people loved Allen Iverson. It\u2019s that dichotomy and that polarization that make him the obvious de facto mayor of the 1999 NBA All-Star Weekend that never was.\n\nTeam owners, among other things, blamed Kevin Garnett\u2019s 1997 $126 million contract.\n\nAlso at courtside for the game are hometown heroes such as Mike Schmidt and Moses Malone. There\u2019s plenty of room also for the other stars ruling culture: Denzel Washington, Mariah Carey, Aaliyah, Spike Lee, Snoop Dogg, Jim Carrey, Djimon Hounsou, Kate Winslet. Bill Russell is there, along with Wilt Chamberlain, whose relationship with Philadelphia is both storybook and tragic. The meeting at the 1999 NBA All-Star Game (that never was) would be one of their final times together, as Chamberlain would die eight months later.\n\nMuhammad Ali and Philly\u2019s own Joe Frazier, in the imaginary weekend\u2019s most touching moment, publicly end a bitter feud that had lasted nearly 30 years with vicious taunts from both men. In real life, the two boxing icons squashed their beef at the 2002 All-Star Game in Philadelphia. Places of honor go to Julius Erving, as well as Jordan, whose presence is impossible to avoid given that most fans have yet to accept his second retirement.\n\nJazzy Jeff is the weekend\u2019s official DJ. Hometown daughter Patti LaBelle performs the national anthem \u2014 paying homage to the city\u2019s soulful musical roots with the most soulful rendition since Whitney Houston at the 1991 Super Bowl. The aforementioned Hill, following the August 1998 release of her The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, is tapped to perform at halftime with a string of hits, including \u201cDoo Wop (That Thing),\u201d \u201cEverything Is Everything\u201d and \u201cLost Ones.\u201d Less than two weeks later, Hill\u2019s place in history is cemented with five Grammys, including album of the year.\n\nCelebrities are a necessary part of All-Star Weekend. As are big-name performers. But the biggest celebrities and performers are the ones voted in by the fans to start the game. Unlike 2019, the teams were still separated by conferences in 1999. Yet, like 2019, the game\u2019s starters will be selected via fan vote. Here are your 1999 NBA All-Stars, for a game that never was \u2014 current and future Hall of Famers each one.\n\nEastern Conference\n\nG \u2014 Allen Iverson | Philadelphia 76ers\n\nThe weekend\u2019s point person, if you will. Though if you\u2019re in the mix, you\u2019ll see Bubba Chuck at every party in the city. Iverson\u2019s popping bottles, rocking jewelry bright enough to light up the nightclub and partying to DMX, Jay-Z, Cash Money. You\u2019re probably wondering when he sleeps? It\u2019s All-Star Weekend! No sleep! It\u2019s Philly, and it\u2019s Allen Ezail Iverson, and you know he\u2019s bringing the city out. Iverson did eventually capture All-Star Game MVP in Washington, D.C., in 2001 \u2014 also a homecoming of sorts, given his Georgetown roots. So, needless to say, the league\u2019s leader in points per game and minutes per game in the 1998-99 season would\u2019ve put on a show before a crowd that treats him like a demigod to this day.\n\nG \u2014 Ray Allen | Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPenny Hardaway really could\u2019ve won a popular vote over Ray Allen, aka Jesus Shuttlesworth, in 1999. Penny started every game in \u201998-\u201999 and led Orlando to the playoffs. But Hardaway\u2019s injury history works against him here and is beginning to paint the picture of what could have been an all-time great NBA career derailed by factors beyond his control. Riding the wave of 1998\u2019s He Got Game, the Milwaukee Bucks superstar-in-the-making gets the nod, and you best believe he\u2019s rocking the HGG 12\u2019s in the process \u2014 with Washington, Lee and Jordan all sitting courtside too. Allen was a magnificent shooter from the day he entered the league, and in his later years he became a marksman who nailed the 3 that saved the Miami Heat\u2019s dynasty in 2013. But young Ray? Oh, young Ray could do it all. Including put you on a poster.\n\nF \u2014 Vince Carter | Toronto Raptors\n\nAll the hoopla and hysteria we see around Luka Doncic now? That would\u2019ve been Vince, the eventual Rookie of the Year, 20 seasons ago \u2014 had he actually had a real rookie season to lay ruin to. How massive was the Vince hype? Let his cousin and teammate, Tracy McGrady, tell it. \u201c[Carter] lit the league on fire with his athleticism, his spectacular dunks,\u201d he says with a smile you can almost see through the phone. \u201cThat momentum carrying into the \u201999 All-Star break just would\u2019ve been on fire.\u201d Even in the abbreviated season, Carter\u2019s athletic prowess became the theatrics of legend en route to a runaway Rookie of the Year campaign. Carter starts as a rookie in the All-Star Game because, why wouldn\u2019t he?\n\nF \u2014 Grant Hill | Detroit Pistons\n\nOne of the best (and most popular and marketable) stars in the league was set to be leaned on heavily in the post-Jordan era. His ability to do nearly any and everything on the court \u2014 Hill averaged 21.1 points, 7.1 rebounds, 6 assists and 1.6 steals on 47.9 percent shooting in \u201998-\u201999 \u2014 made him an undeniable superstar with crossover appeal. Hill\u2019s marriage to R&B star Tamia, whose brilliant 1998 self-titled album produced the hit \u201cSo Into You,\u201d also made the former Duke Blue Devil a star far beyond the court. The sky is the limit for Grant Hill in February 1999. One question no one\u2019s really asking at this point, though. Should we be talking about Hill\u2019s impending summer 2000 free agency? Too early, right? Yeah, you\u2019re right.\n\nC \u2014 Alonzo Mourning | Miami Heat\n\nWhen the center position actually counted in the All-Star Game, here is Mourning. Shaquille O\u2019Neal had long defected to the Western Conference. And Patrick Ewing\u2019s prime years are behind him. Mourning is, without question, the East\u2019s best center on a team many believe will compete for a championship come June. His 20 points and 11 rebounds per night would\u2019ve made him an All-Star in any season \u2014 but his league-leading 3.9 blocks per game make getting into Fort Knox easier than getting to the rim when Zo\u2019s in the neighborhood.\n\nCoach: Pat Riley | Miami Heat\n\nWith Jordan retired and the Chicago Bulls team a shell of its former self, Pat Riley\u2019s Heat had real-life title aspirations and the squad to do it. Just a hunch, though: They should probably try to avoid the New York Knicks in the first round.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nG \u2014 Gary Payton | Seattle SuperSonics\n\nWith fellow Oakland native and future Hall of Famer Jason Kidd in Phoenix, there\u2019s competition out west for the starting guard spot, but The Glove gets the nod because he\u2019s still very much the floor general who led the SuperSonics to the NBA Finals three years earlier. The Sonics aren\u2019t the dominant force in 1998-99 they were in the mid-\u201990s, but Payton\u2019s output was still up there with the best point guards in the league: 21.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 2.2 steals. Plus, Payton\u2019s a showman of the highest order, and being able to mic him up in-game is too much basketball trash-talk nirvana to pass up.\n\nG \u2014 Kobe Bryant | Los Angeles Lakers\n\nIt was pretty much written in stone that from the moment this teenager started his first All-Star Game in New York a year earlier, one of these guard spots would be his every February for the foreseeable future. In\ufe0f this alternate reality, Kobe Bryant returns to Philadelphia \u2014 the city he claimed, although it didn\u2019t always reciprocate his love \u2014 and puts on an absolute clinic. Not many players have had a higher flair for the dramatic than the perpetually dramatic Bryant. With Ali, Frazier, Hill, Jordan, Will Smith and others at courtside, maybe, just maybe, Bean captures MVP honors in Philadelphia in 1999 \u2014 just like he did in 2002.\n\nF \u2014 Kevin Garnett | Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nThe Big Ticket, like Bryant, is inked in here for as long as he can put up with Minnesota, largely accomplishing very little during his prime years. By the end of his third season in 1997-98, Garnett had become a one-of-one generational talent. He was a complete freak on the defensive end and was the only player in the league to put up 18 points, 9 rebounds and 4 assists per night. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the now three-time All-Star had no problem talking an opponent\u2019s ear off.\n\nF \u2014 Karl Malone | Utah Jazz\n\nQuick question. Don\u2019t use Google, either. And please don\u2019t Ask Jeeves. Who won MVP in 1999? If you guessed Malone, buy yourself a drink. Because of the lockout, his \u201999 MVP, won in his 14th year in the league at age 35, is relegated to obscurity, sandwiched as it is between Jordan\u2019s final MVP in 1998 and O\u2019Neal\u2019s virtuoso 2000 campaign. Malone, the game\u2019s future second-all-time leading scorer, gets the fan selection here, but it does come with a caveat. There\u2019s a young phenom in his second season at San Antonio by the name of Tim Duncan who will make this spot his very, very soon.\n\nC \u2014 Shaquille O\u2019Neal | Los Angeles Lakers\n\nLike Iverson, if you\u2019re in Philly for the 1999 All-Star Weekend that never was, it won\u2019t be easy to miss Shaq. Sure, because of his stature. But more importantly because of his larger-than-life personality. O\u2019Neal\u2019s a megastar not just on the court but with a broad appeal similar to Jordan\u2019s. And with Bryant in Philly too, there was the slight chance O\u2019Neal and Bryant could\u2019ve performed their long since forgotten rap collaboration \u201c3X\u2019s Dope\u201d from O\u2019Neal\u2019s 1998 album Respect at some random party in the city.\n\nCoach: Gregg Popovich | San Antonio Spurs\n\nGregg Popovich\u2019s Spurs, with a young Duncan and a wily vet in David Robinson, seem poised for something special in San Antonio. They might be on to something here.\n\nBonus: Is the 1999 NBA All-Star Dunk contest the greatest dunk contest that never happened?\n\nAside from a few special moments \u2014 see Cedric Ceballos\u2019 blindfold, Dee Brown\u2019s no-look, Shawn Kemp\u2019s double pump, Isaiah Rider\u2019s Eastbay Funk Dunk or Brent Barry\u2019s jump from the free throw line \u2014 the dunk contest lost steam in the \u201990s. Bryant, as a rookie, won the contest in 1997. There was no contest at all in 1998 \u2014 and no dunk contest in Madison Square Garden spoke volumes. The contest returned in 2000 with a bang. At the Golden State Warriors\u2019 home arena, Steve Francis, McGrady and Carter proved to be human defibrillators, reviving the contest with legendary swag.\n\n\u201cBro, I\u2019m trying to tell you. It was some highfliers with creativity and young legs! It would\u2019ve been crazy!\u201d \u2014 Tracy McGrady\n\nYet, McGrady still wonders what would have happened in Philly at the All-Star Game that never happened. Could the greatest field that never happened \u2026 have actually happened in 1999? \u201cYou had Kobe in [\u201997]. Then you got Vince come in. I mean, who knows?\u201d McGrady says. \u201cKobe probably would\u2019ve entered that Slam Dunk Contest that year with Vince. You just never know.\u201d\n\nCarter agrees, although the missed opportunity doesn\u2019t hurt as much given the light show he and his cousin put on in Oakland. \u201cAs far as what could\u2019ve been? Yeah, maybe that year \u2014 as far as a dunk contest,\u201d Carter says.\n\nA potential field of Bryant, McGrady and Carter? \u201cBro, I\u2019m trying to tell you. It was some highfliers with creativity and young legs!\u201d McGrady exclaims. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been crazy!\n\nCarter doesn\u2019t want to play the \u201cwhat if\u201d game too much, though. But he realizes what those three could have brought to the floor in the 1999 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest that never was. \u201cKobe and I played with each other in AAU \u2026 Tracy and Kobe were good friends. The friendly competition and the mutual respect we had for each other as athletes and dunkers would\u2019ve brought the best out of each and every one of us,\u201d Carter says. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been legendary.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://en.as.com/nba/who-are-the-captains-2023-nba-all-star-game-and-how-were-they-selected-n/", "page_content": "Another year and another chance to take a break from the normal league routine and enjoy the best of each Conference go head to head.

The lone defender was the West\u2019s Stephen Curry. Next to Antetokounmpo, Curry, at six feet three inches, looks something like the rest of us would, which is to say, very small. Rather than encouraging Curry to play defense, his teammates shouted at him to get out of the way, so that he\u2019d avoid becoming a visual punch line in a video that might travel the world through social-media moments later. As Antetokounmpo began to rotate his arm and leap in the air in order to unleash an exclamatory windmill dunk, Curry dropped to the floor, lay face down, closed his eyes, and covered his ears. The moment was the best the N.B.A. All-Star Game has to offer nowadays: broad, physical comedy.\n\nOnce a showcase for what the best N.B.A. talent could collectively create in at least the semblance of a competitive environment, the All-Star Game, which this year takes place Sunday night in Los Angeles, has completely devolved over the last decade into a revolving door of defenseless alley-oops and dunks. Until 2013, the most points scored in an All-Star Game was 155, but that came in a game that went into double overtime in 2003. In the last four years, the winning team has scored more than 160 points. In the last two years, it\u2019s scored more than 190. The game is the intended centerpiece of an All-Star Weekend packed full of assorted competitions and celebrity events, but it\u2019s become a ridiculed afterthought. This year, in an attempt to revive interest in it, the league changed the team format. The player in the East and the West who received the most fan votes became team captains and then, playground style, picked the squads. The league also doubled the payouts to this year\u2019s winners, from $50,000 to $100,000. Whether or not these changes will affect the way the game is played remains to be seen. But it\u2019s the league\u2019s initial attempts to inspire the return of a long-established culture of competitiveness at one of its flagship events.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks slam dunks as Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors lies on the court during the NBA All-Star game, 2017. From AP/REX/Shutterstock.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s always griping that players in All-Star Games deliberately don\u2019t play defense, but that wasn\u2019t true for us,\u201d Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was selected to play in 19 All-Star Games from 1970 to 1989, wrote in an e-mail last week. By way of example, Abdul-Jabbar cited the 1983 edition. After watching Marvin Gaye sing the pre-game national anthem (what Bill Simmons, founder of The Ringer, would later call, \u201cthe best moment in All-Star history, hands down\u201d), an inspired Abdul-Jabbar started the game by blocking two layup attempts by Julius Erving, arguably the greatest offensive player the sport has ever known. Abdul-Jabbar still holds the record for most blocks in an All-Star Game, with six, which he set in 1980. There have been six blocks total in the last three All-Star Games.\n\nIn Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s day, the prize money, too, was demonstrably different than it is today, as was the value of it to the players. In the early 70s, players on the winning side earned at most a couple thousand dollars, the losers a little bit less. But the difference mattered, Abdul-Jabbar said, \u201cbecause I remember [Phoenix Suns forward] Connie Hawkins once saying, \u2018Don\u2019t mess with my money.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf his approach to the All-Star Game in general, Abdul-Jabbar said, \u201cI played to win, but I also wanted to look good doing it.\u201d\n\nIn the early 80s, Isiah Thomas, later a two-time All-Star-Game M.V.P. and now an analyst for N.B.A. TV, began to conspire with his All-Star-Game opponent Magic Johnson to take Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s approach to the next level. At the time, the N.B.A. was trying to find its footing with the American public after its merger in the mid-70s with the A.B.A., a league that played a more flamboyant style of basketball than the N.B.A. In advance of the games, Thomas and Johnson would meet to try to orchestrate a form of entertainment that would captivate its audience.\n\n\u201cWe understood [that] in order to expand our game we had to bring in more people and more fans,\u201d Thomas said in a phone interview last week. \u201cThere was a partnership between the players and the league and the sponsors to come to this venue, on this day, and put on a great, entertaining show, to give [the fans] something that they won\u2019t see during the course of a regular-season game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe creativeness of your imagination had to come into play,\u201d Thomas continued. \u201cBut for your imagination and creativity to come into play, you needed the opponent to be competitive. You needed to do it against real defense.\u201d This, Thomas acknowledged, \u201cwas well thought out. It was planned.\u201d And it worked.\n\nThe N.B.A. became nationally respected for putting on an All-Star Game more entertaining than its counterparts in the three other major American sports. Sportswriters used words such as \u201celectric\u201d and \u201centhralling\u201d to describe the games. In the 90s, Michael Jordan carried the torch lit by Thomas and Johnson after their retirements. \u201cEveryone is very much aware of [Jordan\u2019s] competitiveness and his desire to win at all times,\u201d said Grant Hill, now a basketball analyst for TNT who played in seven All-Star Games during his N.B.A. career, including six in a row from 1995 to 2001. \u201cThat, in some ways, set the tone. . . . It was definitely, \u2018Let\u2019s compete. Let\u2019s go after these guys. . . . Let\u2019s win the money that the winning team gets.\u2019\u201d (In 1996, a player on the winning team earned $7,000; one on the losing side earned $5,000.)\n\nMagic Johnson and Isiah Thomas exchange their usual pregame kiss, 1988; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar takes a rebound away from Julius Erving during NBA All-Star game, 1980. Left, by Robert Kozloff/AP/REX/Shutterstock; right, from AP/REX/Shutterstock.\n\nAround this time, what the All-Star players considered entertainment during the weekend began to change, and to move beyond the sport. In 1994, the season that Jordan temporarily traded in his basketball high-tops for baseball cleats, the Orlando Magic\u2019s center Shaquille O\u2019Neal played a concertwith his rap group, Shaq Diesel. The performance provided O\u2019Neal the opportunity to promote the imminent release of the film Blue Chips, in which he starred alongside his teammate and future All-Star, Penny Hardaway."}, {"url": "https://en.as.com/nba/nba-all-star-game-which-players-have-made-the-most-appearances-n/", "page_content": "The 2023 NBA All-Star Game will be held at the Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah on Sunday, Feb. 19.

It\u2019s no surprise why. Wiggins is the least deserving of the 10 chosen starters, and by far the lowest scoring: The others are all averaging at least 25.7 points per game, through Sunday, while Wiggins is down at just 18.2. Barring unexpected injury replacements, he will probably be the last pick in the starter draft before the game.\n\nYet Wiggins isn\u2019t a bad All-Star pick, full stop. He is accomplishing everything the Warriors\u2014the team with the league\u2019s best point differential and second-best record\u2014ask of him on both ends, in effect transitioning from a failed superstar to an ideal 3-and-D wing. On offense, Wiggins ranks 10th in 3-point accuracy (41.4 percent) out of 91 players attempting at least five per game, and on defense he rates well despite a hefty burden: He defends the highest-usage opponents 30 percent of the time, per BBall Index, which is more than any other All-Star starter and more than any realistic All-Star reserve candidate, too. His total value, using a blend of Basketball-Reference\u2019s win shares and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s wins above replacement, compares favorably to that of other prospective All-Stars:\n\nAndrew Wiggins vs. Assorted Other All-Star Candidates Player Win Shares Wins Above Replacement Blend Player Win Shares Wins Above Replacement Blend Ja Morant 4.8 4.3 4.55 Darius Garland 4.1 4.9 4.50 Karl-Anthony Towns 5.9 3.0 4.45 James Harden 5.0 3.7 4.35 Jrue Holiday 3.9 4.5 4.20 Andrew Wiggins 4.3 4.0 4.15 Donovan Mitchell 4.2 3.9 4.05 Devin Booker 3.9 3.9 3.90 Luka Doncic 3.3 4.2 3.75 Zach LaVine 3.8 2.6 3.20\n\nWiggins didn\u2019t earn the Western Conference\u2019s third frontcourt starting spot based entirely on his sound production this season. He also placed third in the fan vote after a strong push from a Warriors-loving K-pop star named BamBam. Until the 2016-17 season, that would have been enough on its own. But in response to Zaza Pachulia coming some 14,000 votes short of knocking Kawhi Leonard out of the All-Star starting lineup, the NBA reduced the fan portion of the vote from 100 to 50 percent, adding in media and player votes, too.\n\nThe league acted just in the nick of time. In 2017, Pachulia actually finished second in the Western frontcourt fan voting, but a lack of support from the media and other players meant Anthony Davis received the starting nod instead. (Later in 2017, Pachulia stepped under Kawhi Leonard\u2019s foot as he landed on a jump shot, leading to a new rule that penalizes dangerous closeouts. How many other players in NBA history were so active that they inspired multiple unrelated rule changes in the same year?)\n\nThe rule change was meant to maintain the integrity of the voting process in a case like the internet-aided Pachulia\u2019s, or that of the Nets\u2019 Yi Jianlian, who was the first runner-up in the Eastern forward vote in 2009. It was not meant, however, to keep out players like Wiggins, who might have a sketchy starting case but are still sufficiently reasonable picks that they garner some support from fellow players and the media.\n\nBefore the league diluted the fan vote, though, the All-Star selection process was rife with undeserving yet nostalgic selections, turning the NBA\u2019s midseason main event into a reflection of player popularity more than purely on-court performance. Which selections were the biggest reaches? We used the same win shares/wins above replacement blend, with the caveat that we\u2019re looking at full-season performance, not just pre-All-Star performance, to find the least-valuable All-Star campaigns since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976-77.\n\n20. Shaquille O\u2019Neal, 2006-07\n\nAge: 34\n\nTeam: Heat\n\nAll-Star appearance: 14th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 2.1 wins\n\nFresh off a title in Miami, Shaq still ranked among the most popular players in the league in 2007. But in his mid-30s, ailing from an early-season knee injury, he was firmly on the downside of his career. He played just six of the Heat\u2019s first 45 games, but the fans still voted him in as the East\u2019s starting center, more than 150,000 votes ahead of runner-up Dwight Howard. Shaq would finish the season with 40 games played and\u2014to that point\u2014the lowest points (17.3 per game) and rebounds (7.4 per game) averages of his career.\n\n19. Danny Manning, 1993-94\n\nAge: 27\n\nTeam: Clippers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 2nd\n\nSelected as: reserve\n\nValue: 2.0 wins\n\nAs a reminder, these rankings reflect the entire season performance, not just the pre-All-Star portion. That\u2019s especially important in Manning\u2019s case, as the former no. 1 pick was much more productive with the Clippers (23.7 points per game, 28 percent usage, 53 percent true shooting) than he was with the Hawks (15.7 points per game, 23 percent usage, 50 percent true shooting) after a post-All-Star-break trade. Manning was still a relatively inefficient scorer, but there were no real qualms when he secured his second consecutive All-Star nod on the back of his first-half numbers; it\u2019s mostly his rest-of-season performance that relegates his overall value to the bottom 20 here.\n\n18. Michael Jordan, 1985-86\n\nAge: 22\n\nTeam: Bulls\n\nAll-Star appearance: 2nd\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 1.8 wins\n\nJordan played 18 games in his second season because of a broken foot\u2014including just three before the All-Star break. But that didn\u2019t stop the fans from expressing their enthusiasm for the budding superstar via the most votes in the East, and the second-most votes in the entire league, behind only Magic Johnson. \u201cNever underestimate the power of a sneaker advertisement,\u201d George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times.\n\n17. Ralph Sampson, 1986-87\n\nAge: 26\n\nTeam: Rockets\n\nAll-Star appearance: 4th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 1.6 wins\n\nSampson was a natural choice for fans voting in 1987: He\u2019d already been named to the All-Star Team in his first three seasons, and he\u2019d just helped lead Houston to an upset of the Lakers and a spot in the 1986 Finals. But the 7-foot-4 Sampson\u2019s productivity waned in 1986-87 as injuries mounted, most notably a knee injury the week before the All-Star Game that cost him two months. Seattle\u2019s Tom Chambers was a last-minute replacement and made the most of his opportunity, scoring 34 points to win the game\u2019s MVP award.\n\n16. Dwyane Wade, 2018-19\n\nAge: 37\n\nTeam: Heat\n\nAll-Star appearance: 13th\n\nSelected as: reserve (commissioner selection)\n\nValue: 1.5 wins\n\nWade wasn\u2019t chosen as a starter by the fans, or as a reserve by his conference\u2019s coaches. Instead, commissioner Adam Silver created special honorary bids for both Wade and Dirk Nowitzki as they stumbled through their final seasons. \u201cAs a league, I like to think we have the flexibility, when there are special occasions,\u201d Silver said, adding that \u201cit just seemed like a wonderful opportunity to honor two greats.\u201d\n\n15. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 1988-89\n\nAge: 41\n\nTeam: Lakers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 19th\n\nSelected as: reserve (injury replacement)\n\nValue: 1.5 wins\n\nAbdul-Jabbar\u2019s record 19th All-Star selection came in his last and worst season, when he averaged only 10.1 points and 4.5 rebounds per game while shooting below 50 percent for the only time in his career. Unlike many of the other final-season selections throughout league history, however, Abdul-Jabbar did not receive the nod because of a sentimental fan vote; rather, he was an injury replacement for teammate Magic Johnson, who tore his hamstring before the game.\n\nPart of commissioner David Stern\u2019s rationale for choosing Abdul-Jabbar might as well have come out of Silver\u2019s mouth when creating spots for Wade and Nowitzki three decades later. \u201cKareem received the next highest total of votes from the coaches in their selection of the All-Star reserves,\u2019\u2019 Stern said. \u201cBut more fittingly, his participation in one more All-Star Game is a fitting tribute to his unequaled NBA career.\u201d\n\n14. Joe Dumars, 1994-95\n\nAge: 31\n\nTeam: Pistons\n\nAll-Star appearance: 5th\n\nSelected as: reserve\n\nValue: 1.4 wins\n\nThe 31-year-old Dumars had two problems in 1994-95. First, he suffered from a season-long shooting slump, with 43-30-81 shooting splits that signified his worst accuracy since he was a youngster in the mid-\u201980s. Second, his defensive metrics\u2014as rudimentary as they are for the pre-play-by-play era\u2014all look abysmal, dragging down his overall value even farther.\n\nYet Dumars was an established All-Star and two-time champion scoring 18 points per game, and he apparently benefited from the spotlight shone on Grant Hill, who that season became the first rookie ever to tally the most All-Star votes. Nobody balked at giving Detroit a second All-Star in Dumars, even though the 28-54 Pistons were one of the NBA\u2019s worst teams.\n\n13. Anfernee Hardaway, 1997-98\n\nAge: 26\n\nTeam: Magic\n\nAll-Star appearance: 4th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 1.1 wins\n\nThis ballot was a weird one. Playing his final season in Chicago, Jordan ran away with the fan vote, more than doubling every other Eastern Conference guard. And out of the muddle of other contenders rose Hardaway, who had been an All-Star the previous three seasons but appeared in just 19 games in 1997-98 because of knee surgery. He did play in the All-Star Game, though, leading fellow Eastern guard Tim Hardaway to scorn, \u201cHe wants to play in the All-Star Game more than he wants to play for his team, I think.\u201d\n\nAs with Jordan a decade earlier, analysts attributed Penny Hardaway\u2019s enduring popularity to his Nike endorsement deal\u2014in this case, Hardaway\u2019s \u201cLittle Penny\u201d campaign. \u201cBasically players are voted on how many commercials [they make],\u201d Kings executive Jerry Reynolds said. \u201cPeople that vote for these things don\u2019t have a clue about basketball. They don\u2019t know who the players are, in my mind. They know who\u2019s on commercials. People know who Penny is. If \u2018Little Penny\u2019 were on the ballot, he\u2019d have probably started.\u201d\n\n12. Alonzo Mourning, 2000-01\n\nAge: 30\n\nTeam: Heat\n\nAll-Star appearance: 6th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 0.7 wins\n\nLike Jordan and Penny and more players to come on this list, Mourning was a perennial All-Star choice who retained his immense popularity. He won the fan vote despite being sidelined by a kidney disease that kept him from playing a single game by the time of his selection to the 2000-01 All-Star team. He eventually returned for just 13 games late in the season.\n\n11. Steve Johnson, 1987-88\n\nAge: 30\n\nTeam: Trail Blazers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 1st\n\nSelected as: reserve\n\nValue: 0.3 wins\n\nThe journeyman grabbed the Trail Blazers\u2019 starting center spot when Sam Bowie broke his leg, and welcomed All-Star support by scoring 15 points per game for a contender. Alas, Johnson didn\u2019t contribute as much as other big men on the boards or defensive end, limiting his overall value, and he played only 43 games in 1987-88 because of his own injuries. He was replaced in the starting lineup by Kevin Duckworth, who happened to make the All-Star Team the very next season with a similarly underwhelming statistical r\u00e9sum\u00e9; that Duckworth season would rank 21st on this list.\n\n10. Allen Iverson, 2009-10\n\nAge: 34\n\nTeam: 76ers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 11th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 0.3 wins\n\nBack in Philadelphia for the first time since being traded four years prior, Iverson was not an All-Star-worthy player in 2009-10. He played just 28 games\u2014three with the Grizzlies before a brief retirement, then 25 with the 76ers before leaving the team to deal with a family health issue. He shot just 43 percent and scored a career-low 13.8 points per game. But he\u2019d also made the last 10 All-Star teams, so the fans maintained that momentum in what would be his final NBA season.\n\n9. Grant Hill, 2000-01\n\nAge: 28\n\nTeam: Magic\n\nAll-Star appearance: 6th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 0.2 wins\n\nMourning wasn\u2019t the only Eastern Conference All-Star starter who barely played in 2001. Neither did Hill, who played in just four games in his first season with the Magic because of ankle injuries. Yet like so many other players on this list, Hill was an All-Star staple by that point, having been named to five of the previous six teams, so he continued to attract tremendous fan support.\n\nYet as with other players here like Hardaway and Sampson, that enthusiasm didn\u2019t linger for a second lost season, as Hill missed the next three All-Star Games after 2000-01. There\u2019s only one player on this list who appears more than once, with sufficiently overwhelming popularity to compensate for multiple subpar seasons in a row. Which leads to \u2026\n\n8. Kobe Bryant, 2014-15\n\nAge: 36\n\nTeam: Lakers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 17th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 0.2 wins\n\nBryant was an All-Star for the final 17 seasons of his career, including all throughout his final injury-plagued period. At the end of the 2012-13 season, he tore his Achilles; in 2013-14 (more on that one in a moment), he fractured a bone in his knee; in 2014-15, he played just 35 games because of a torn rotator cuff. The physical attrition didn\u2019t just keep him off the court, but affected his play on it: Basketball-Reference lists 264 players through the 2020-21 season who posted a usage rate of at least 30 percent in 1,000-plus minutes, and Bryant\u2019s 2014-15 campaign ranks 262nd on that list in true shooting percentage. The former All-Defensive mainstay had also become a defensive liability; in 2014-15, the Lakers allowed 6.8 points per 100 possessions more when Bryant was on the floor than when he was off, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nYet as with so many other players on this list, the fans didn\u2019t care that this version of Bryant didn\u2019t much resemble the peak iterations. He received more than a million votes and didn\u2019t start only because an injury kept him out of the game.\n\n7. Yao Ming, 2010-11\n\nAge: 30\n\nTeam: Rockets\n\nAll-Star appearance: 8th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 0.2 wins\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to overstate Yao\u2019s popularity in the All-Star vote throughout his career. With the NBA introducing ballots in Mandarin to accommodate its first Chinese star, Yao twice received the league\u2019s highest vote total, and was selected as the West\u2019s starting center in all eight seasons he played\u2014including in 2010-11, when debilitating injuries to his foot and ankle limited him to just five games and an unfortunate retirement after the season.\n\nWhile Yao was clearly unworthy of a 2010-11 selection given his playing time, he wasn\u2019t an All-Star regular solely because of his intercontinental appeal. In 2017, Rockets blog The Dream Shake estimated that Yao would still have received five selections had he played his whole career with the new voting process.\n\n6. Chris Kaman, 2009-10\n\nAge: 27\n\nTeam: Clippers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 1st\n\nSelected as: reserve (injury replacement)\n\nValue: 0.1 wins\n\nKaman was an injury replacement for Brandon Roy, with decent counting stats (18.5 points and 9.3 rebounds per game), but, like Steve Johnson, not much else stood out about his All-Star case. Kaman and Johnson are the only players on this list who were first-time All-Stars in the season in question. Far more often, the benefit of the doubt goes to All-Star veterans rather than All-Star neophytes.\n\nAs this graph demonstrates, first-time All-Stars are usually already very good, if not quite at their peaks yet. Then, those players maintain their high level of productivity through appearance number 10, at which point their statistical output smoothly declines due to aging, but reputation takes over and propels them into more and more games anyway.\n\n5. Magic Johnson, 1991-92\n\nAge: 32\n\nTeam: retired\n\nAll-Star appearance: 12th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: 0.0 wins\n\nWhat\u2019s one way to accumulate exactly 0.0 wins\u2019 worth of value over the course of a regular season? To not play at all, which is the position in which Magic Johnson found himself in 1991-92, on the heels of his announcement that he was HIV-positive. But the fans voted him into a starting spot anyway\u2014and, well, magic ensued, with an MVP performance in one of the most stirring scenes in league history.\n\n4. Kobe Bryant, 2013-14\n\nAge: 35\n\nTeam: Lakers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 16th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: negative-0.4 wins\n\nEven Bryant didn\u2019t think he should have been an All-Star this season, saying in January 2014 that playing in the All-Star Game \u201chas always been a huge honor. That being said, I haven\u2019t played this year.\u201d He wasn\u2019t exaggerating much: He managed only six games in 2013-14 due to his aforementioned injuries.\n\nGiven the changes to the voting process since Bryant\u2019s retirement, this might be the last time a player with so few games played is ever chosen as an All-Star starter. The only All-Stars since the implementation of the new rules to appear on this list are Wade and\u2014spoiler alert\u2014Nowitzki, who needed a special dispensation from the commissioner to appear in the game.\n\n3. Pete Maravich, 1978-79\n\nAge: 31\n\nTeam: Jazz\n\nAll-Star appearance: 5th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: negative-0.5 wins\n\nThe earliest selection on this list is yet another example of an aging, aching former star who enjoyed one last round of applause from the fans. The onetime scoring champion needed an average of 21.1 shots to collect his 22.6 points per night; as an NBA.com profile explains, Maravich\u2019s numbers in 1978-79 \u201cdeclined in nearly every category. \u2026 His knee problems were proving too tough to overcome. Although Maravich\u2019s game was not built on fundamentals, it did require precision, and his brace-encased knee slowed him down and turned his once-quick pirouettes into slow-motion spinouts.\u201d\n\nHe appeared in only 49 games that season, then played 43 more in 1979-80 before retiring.\n\n2. Dirk Nowitzki, 2018-19\n\nAge: 40\n\nTeam: Mavericks\n\nAll-Star appearance: 14th\n\nSelected as: reserve (commissioner selection)\n\nValue: negative-0.6 wins\n\nAt least Wade was a 15-points-per-game spark off the bench for Miami in his final season. Nowitzki was much more of a drag in Dallas, averaging just 7.3 points in 15.6 minutes and suffering from his worst shooting season since he was a rookie. But Silver rightly felt that Nowitzki had earned the right to give All-Star fans one last glimpse of his jumper\u2014and then he made all three of his 3-point tries in just four minutes in the game.\n\nWith precedent now existing for a commissioner\u2019s selection for \u201cspecial occasions,\u201d it seems like the NBA won\u2019t need the fan vote to send off all-timers in their final seasons. Even if 53-year-old LeBron James doesn\u2019t receive the media support necessary to land a starting spot when he announces his retirement in 2038\u2014veteran Bronny James will gobble up those votes, after all\u2014he can still receive one last chance to bid the All-Star Game adieu. In the past, the fans had to cooperate, or else an injury replacement would need to open up a spot, as was the case for Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s last All-Star nod; now, the commissioner could easily take matters into his own hands.\n\n1. Kobe Bryant, 2015-16\n\nAge: 37\n\nTeam: Lakers\n\nAll-Star appearance: 18th\n\nSelected as: starter\n\nValue: negative-0.8 wins\n\nWhile the league avoided Zaza mania taking over in 2016, the fans overwhelmingly voted for Bryant, even though his Lakers would tally an 11-44 record by the break. On the court, Bryant was even less valuable than in the previous season; this is the 263rd-ranked season on that aforementioned list of 264 high-usage players, and the Lakers were 7.7 points per 100 possessions worse on defense with Bryant. But that didn\u2019t stop fans from giving Bryant the most votes of any player, nearly 300,000 more than second-place Steph Curry.\n\nIn the final season before the voting process changed, Bryant carried on the long tradition of superstars gaining one last All-Star Game entry, powered more by nostalgia than present-day production. In fact, Bryant gained three last entries\u2014a fitting flourish for the man who\u2019s now the namesake for the All-Star Game MVP Award.\n\nA previous version of this piece misstated Magic Johnson\u2019s age for the 1992 All-Star Game. He was 32, not 35."}]}
