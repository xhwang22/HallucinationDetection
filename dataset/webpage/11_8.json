He was married two times and secretly engaged to another before his death.

Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great grandmother Susannah Randolph was a descendant of Pocahontas. What is remarkable, however, is that in Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s family line one finds a signator of the Declaration of Independence, and two U.S. Presidents. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great uncle, Benjamin Harrison not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but also introduced a resolution of independence to congress. One of Benjamin Harrison\u2019s sons, William Henry Harrison went on to become President of the United States in 1841, and President Harrison\u2019s great grandson Benjamin Harrison became President of the United States in 1889.\n\nWhile Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s father\u2019s side was noted for its politicians, his mother\u2019s side was distinguished for its soldiers. Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s mother was Caroline Evalind, whose father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all notable soldiers in their time. Her great grandfather was an officer in the English Army, her grandfather was General William Russell famous for fighting the Indian Wars, and her father Colonel Russell, a cavalry captain, is credited for leading the attack in the Revolutionary War Battle, King\u2019s Mountain.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison Senior was born February 15th, 1825 to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Evalind. Although, Carter Henry Harrison Senior is known as \u201csenior,\u201d he is technically the III in his family to bear the name. He grew up in Elk Hill, Kentucky in a log cabin. His father died, shortly after his birth, and his mother schooled him until he was 15. At this time, he went to Lexington to study under Dr. Lewis Marshall who was the brother of Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marshall. In 1845 he began attending Yale, and after graduating at age 20, studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After one year of law school, however, he decided to return home to live the life of a farmer on his family\u2019s plantation. In 1851, Harrison traveled Europe for two years where he began to develop an affinity for urban life. When he returned to the states he finished his law degree and graduated in 1853. The same year he married Sophonisba Preston and moved first to St. Louis and then finally to Chicago.\n\nAlthough Harrison intended to open a law office, he became involved in buying and selling real estate. However, a financial storm in 1857 affected him terribly and Harrison spent the next ten years trying to get on his feet financially. During this time, five of his children died in infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to move away from real-estate, Harrison made an unsuccessful attempt at running for the lower house of the State legislature, but it was not until the great Chicago Fire in 1871 that the catalyst for Harrison\u2019s life as politician would emerge. Harrison\u2019s support for the \u201cfire proof ticket,\u201d a ticket composed of both Democratic and Republican nominations for city offices, gained him a nomination and election as County Commissioner. After serving a three-year term as County Commissioner, Harrison decided to run again for congress. He was narrowly elected as the Democratic Representative for 44th National Congress, in March of 1875. Harrison quickly developed a reputation as a skilled orator, and was re-elected for a second term. During his re-election campaign his wife died suddenly of illness and Harrison immersed himself in his work. He served in congress until the end of his second term in 1878, and chose not to seek a third term. Harrison would lament later in life that he never fully enjoyed the life of a congressman. Harrison did not abandon statesmanship all together; in fact, he barely missed a beat. In the spring of 1879, Harrison was elected to be the mayor of Chicago.\n\nHarrison was elected to the office of mayor five times, serving from 1879-1887 and then again in 1893.. The time that Harrison served in office was a time of expansion and development for Chicago. When Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1855 the public revenue for taxation was slightly over $200,000; by the time of his death this number exceeded $15,000,000. Harrison was known, however, as a champion of people\u2019s rights. With railroads being built from one end of Chicago to the other, Harrison continually fought for workers\u2019 rights against the railroad companies that tried to usurp them. Harrison\u2019s commitment to the public is epitomized by his role in the Haymarket Riot. The night of March 4th, 1886 an unknown person threw a bomb at police officers during a workers\u2019 strike organized by local socialist party members. Harrison was quick to speak out against anti-socialist language in the media, not only saying that socialists did not sympathize with the bomb throwers, but also asserting that socialists represented the \u201cworkers, thinkers, and writers\u201d of the United States.\n\nHarrison made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois in 1884, and was only narrowly re-elected to his 4th term as mayor; he stepped down at the end of that term. Harrison decided he wanted to get back in public life, however, and ran for the mayorship unsuccessfully in 1891. Not to be easily dissuaded, however, he ran again, and was re-elected in 1893 in time to host the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His term, however, was cut short by assassination. Two days before the World Fair opened, on October 28th, 1893, failed politician Patrick Eugene Prendergast killed Carter Henry Harrison in Harrison\u2019s home. Earlier that day Harrison had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d Carter Henry Harrison Senior was the first Chicago Mayor to serve five terms; the next Mayor of Chicago to serve as long a term, was his son Carter Henry Harrison II.\n\nNext: Johnny Powers\n\nSources:\n\nAbbot, Willis John.

He previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives. Harrison was the first cousin twice removed of President William Henry Harrison.\n\nBorn near Lexington, Kentucky to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Russell, he was only a few months old when his father died. He was educated by private tutors, and was graduated from Yale College in 1845 as a member of Scroll and Key. Following graduation, he traveled and studied in Europe from 1851 to 1853 before entering Transylvania College in Lexington, where he earned a law degree in 1855. He was admitted to the bar in 1855 and commenced practice in Chicago; Harrison came to Chicago because he saw it as a land of opportunity.\n\nHarrison ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1872 for election to the Forty-third Congress. Beginning in 1874, he served as a member of the board of commissioners of Cook County. He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses, and delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic National Conventions.\n\nA Summer's Outing\n\nIn 1890, Harrison and his daughter took a vacation trip from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. His letters from the trip were first published in the Chicago Tribune and later compiled into the book (1891): A Summer's Outing and The Old Man's Story.\n\nAssassination\n\nThe night of the Haymarket Riot in 1886, Harrison walked unmolested through the crowd of anarchists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone. The riot was sparked by a bomb, reportedly thrown at police by anarchists. After leaving office, Harrison was owner and editor of the Chicago Times from 1891 to 1893. He was re-elected in 1893, in time for the World's Columbian Exposition. His desire was to show the world the true Chicago, and he appointed 1st Ward Alderman \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee. On October 28, 1893, two days before the close of the Exposition, Harrison was murdered in his home by Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a disgruntled office seeker. Harrison was buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894. Harrison was Chicago's first five-time elected mayor; eventually his son, Carter Harrison, Jr., was also elected mayor five times.\n\nHarrison's career and assassination are closely connected with the World's Columbian Exposition, and are discussed at some length as a subplot to the two main stories (about the fair and serial killer H. H. Holmes) in The Devil in the White City. The celebration of the close of the Exposition was cancelled in lieu of a large public memorial service for Harrison."}, {"url": "https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/devil-in-the-white-city/carter-harrison", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison\n\nMayor of Chicago, Harrison's a champion of the labor unions. By the time fairground construction gets under way, he's sixty-eight and widowed twice. (This book also gives us some weird trivia surrounding Harrison's diet: he drinks a lot of coffee, and eats watermelon with every meal.)\n\nWith four mayoral terms under his belt, Harrison runs again for office. Most view him as a friend of the city's lower classes, and he's admired by the Irish and union men. However, most newspapers in Chicago don't support his fifth term. With the fair representing the new Chicago, Harrison represents the old industrial Chicago of slaughterhouses and stockyards. To Burnham and the others, the city requires new leadership. Harrison loses the mayoral election.\n\nTwo years later in 1893, the legions of working class men rock the vote and Harrison is elected into office, serving his fifth term.\n\nEven his opponents recognized that Harrison, despite his privileged roots, made an intensely appealing candidate for the city's lesser tier. He was magnetic. (2.13.28)\n\nBasically, Harrison's a city icon.\n\nHe's also the target of a crazed Prendergast, who conjures delusions that Harrison will give him a position once he's re-elected. Harrison's never even heard of the dude. Not getting his way, Prendergast shoots Harrison in his home, and the fair's closing ceremony is transformed into a large memorial service."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8704/Carter-Henry-Harrison", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.
