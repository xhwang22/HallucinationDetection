{"Sirhan Sirhan was a 24-year-old Palestinian man.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sirhan-Bishara-Sirhan", "page_content": "Sirhan Sirhan, in full Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, (born March 19, 1944, Jerusalem), Palestinian-born Jordanian citizen who was convicted (1969) of fatally shooting U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. He received the death penalty, but the sentence was later commuted to life.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem. In 1948 Jordan took control of East Jerusalem and what is now the West Bank, and the following year it granted citizenship to people living in those areas. It is believed that this is how Sirhan became a Jordanian citizen. In the 1950s, he and his family moved to the United States and eventually settled in Pasadena, California. There he attended Pasadena City College and later held odd jobs, notably working at a horse stable and later at a health food store.\n\nDuring this time, Sirhan became vocal in his opposition to Israel, especially after the Six-Day War (June 1967), in which the country seized control of various territories, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Old City of Jerusalem. Sirhan began directing his anger at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who expressed support for Israel while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. On June 4, Kennedy won the California primary, and shortly after midnight, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. As he left through a service pantry, Kennedy was fatally shot; he died on June 6. In addition, five bystanders were wounded. Sirhan was apprehended at the scene\u2014tackled by George Plimpton, Rosey Grier, and others\u2014and he reportedly said, \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d The attack took place on the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan later claimed he was unable to remember the shooting, saying that he was intoxicated at the time. However, during his 1969 trial, he admitted to having committed the crime, though he later said that his statements were the result of his defense attorney\u2019s making him think he was guilty. On April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder, and several days later he was given the death sentence. When California abolished capital punishment in 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life. His efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories surrounded Kennedy\u2019s assassination. One of the most notable concerned the belief that there was a second gunman. On an audio tape of the shooting, 13 shots are reportedly heard, though Sirhan\u2019s revolver had only 8 rounds. In addition, at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing, one of those wounded in the attack testified that a different gunman had shot Kennedy. The parole board, however, was not swayed by the claims, and Sirhan was again denied release. In 2021 he faced the board for the 16th time. The panel\u2014which was operating under recent reforms that required it to consider age, health, and other factors\u2014recommended that he be freed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, however, denied his parole in 2022."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2021-08-30/sirhan-sirhan-robert-f-kennedy-essential-california", "page_content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It\u2019s Monday, August 30. I\u2019m Justin Ray.\n\nOn Friday, the world learned that the man who gunned down Sen. Robert F. Kennedy might get released, sparking uproar and confusion.\n\nThe news was surprising to me for three reasons: (1) There was a lot of evidence he did the crime. Back in 1968, a 24-year-old Sirhan Sirhan was captured at the scene with a .22-caliber handgun in his hand. Three weeks before the shooting, he wrote a manifesto calling for Kennedy\u2019s death. (2) He had also previously been denied parole 15 times. (3) And I\u2019ll even say it: The victim wasn\u2019t just some person on the street; he assassinated a Kennedy. It felt like in terms of uphill battles, this was Mt. Everest covered in oil.\n\nYet here we are, with Sirhan, now 77, recommended for parole after serving more than 50 years in prison . It doesn\u2019t guarantee he will be released, but it is a big step in his quest for freedom. The Times has reported on how the case has split the Kennedy family , a curious detail in an autopsy report about the position of the gunshot wound that has fueled conspiracy theories, and background on Sirhan\u2019s legal battle for freedom . But we haven\u2019t talked about Sirhan\u2019s life.\n\nIn my quest to understand Sirhan, I have read magazine articles, a book by investigative journalist Dan E. Moldea , and listened to a podcast series. Here is a condensed overview of his early years, including an incident that appears to have changed his personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born March 19, 1944 in Jerusalem, Palestine. As a child, it\u2019s likely he witnessed violence from the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. \u201cThere was probably a tremendous amount of trauma when Sirhan was small. There were villages being wiped out,\u201d Moldea\u2019s book quotes Sergeant Mike Nielsen as saying.\n\nIn 1956, the Sirhan family applied and qualified for U.S. visas as Palestinian refugees. They eventually moved to Pasadena. His father \u2014 described as a \u201cstrict disciplinarian, who beat young Sirhan\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t adapt to life in America and eventually abandoned his family. A high school teacher described Sirhan as having a \u201clanguage handicap,\u201d but said that he was \u201ccooperative [and] well-mannered.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating, he enrolled in Pasadena City College in fall of 1963, but he had poor attendance. The next year, he began coming home immediately after classes to care for his sister, Aida, who had leukemia. She died in March 1965 at the age of 29. Three months later, he dropped out of college.\n\nDuring the fall of 1965, Sirhan started working at Santa Anita racetrack. While there, he trained to be a jockey. The book says a foreman at the ranch told the LAPD, \u201cSirhan was a poor horse rider and was constantly being thrown or falling from horses that he was working.\u201d He quit in March 1966. Months later, he began working for Granja Vista del Rio Thoroughbred Horse Farm, near Corona. It was here that an incident would change his life.\n\nOn a foggy morning on Sept. 25, 1966, Sirhan fell from a mare named Hy-Vera, according to an article by Playboy . \u201cSirhan was thrown against a metal post, where he lay crumpled, crying and bleeding,\u201d wrote James McKinley. Sirhan later received a $2,000 settlement over the incident.\n\nThe accident had lasting health effects on Sirhan. In a podcast series created by the writers behind the popular HBO series \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s younger brother discussed how his personality changed: \u201cHe wanted to be by himself. It\u2019s kind of hard to put into words. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered. He was a little more irritable,\u201d Munir Sirhan said (On a side note, I\u2019ve noticed that many notorious killers experienced brain injuries during their childhoods, including California\u2019s Richard Ramirez and Glen Edward Rogers ).\n\nTwo years later, Sirhan would carry out the assassination, and RFK would become the third Kennedy son to die violently. Sirhan told The Times in 1985 : \u201cI originally had admired Sen. Kennedy. He was for the poor and downtrodden. He seemed to be for justice. But then he did things to support Israel, including backing the sending of 50 Phantom jets to Israel that I knew would be used to attack my people. It enraged me, I admit that.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to his potential release, parole staff still have 90 days to review Sirhan\u2019s case. After that, Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 or whoever might replace him following next month\u2019s recall election \u2014 could still decide to block Sirhan\u2019s release.\n\nAlthough he has admitted to the crime in the past, Sirhan didn\u2019t fully accept responsibility when expressing remorse at the Friday hearing.\n\n\u201cSen. Kennedy was the hope of the world and I injured, and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that,\u201d Sirhan said. \u201cI\u2019m still responsible for being there and probably causing this whole incident, through my own gun or other guns.\u201d\n\nAnd now, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening across California:\n\nNote: Some of the sites we link to may limit the number of stories you can access without subscribing.\n\nWhat we know about the five California service members killed in Kabul airport blast.

Blacks, anti-Vietnam protesters, white union members, Mexican workers, feminists and others \u2013 their fragile coalition increasingly cracked and splintered across the decade leading up to 1968, and then it fell apart all at once.\n\nThe backdrop was the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, in late August, which turned into a raging circus as the streets around the International Amphitheater went up in flames. The internal rift led to a Republican election victory that fall, as Richard Nixon, citing the chaos on the left, promised to restore law and order to the country. But for many, Nixon was just a historic traffic accident, in which a divided left and two assassins were involved. If the assassination of John F. Kennedy mortally wounded the left in 1963, the murder of his brother Robert F. Kennedy, almost five years later, confirmed the kill.\n\nOn March 31, 1968, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson dropped a political bombshell. The object of widespread hatred within his own party, Johnson announced that he would not seek another term of office. He wasn\u2019t one to relinquish power voluntarily, but two weeks earlier his avowed rival, Bobby Kennedy, had announced that he would take part in the primaries for the Democratic nomination against the serving president. Kennedy, a U.S. senator from New York, had served as the attorney general in his older brother\u2019s administration and was considered a force of nature in national politics at the ripe old age of 42. His tenure in the administration had forged the image of a tough, strong leader.\n\nIn the wake of his brother\u2019s assassination (which led to then-Vice President Johnson\u2019s taking over as president) and elevation to mythical status, RFK seemed poised to become the leading candidate in whatever race he chose to enter. Above all, though, he seemed to many to be the most appropriate candidate to pull the Democratic Party back together at the historic, dramatic and revolutionary moment of the late 1960s.\n\nThis was a period of accelerated social and cultural transformations, and RFK was the only one who had succeeded in unifying exploited farmworkers and young educated urbanites, and a full range in between. Though JFK had been more charismatic, Bobby projected the common touch, not least because he unhesitatingly positioned himself alongside people who hadn\u2019t necessarily voted for him and demonstrated with them against people who were likely to be potential voters.\n\nOpen gallery view Sirhan Sirhan, right, assassin of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy with his attorney Russell E. Parsons in Los Angeles. Credit: AP\n\nThe hope personified in RFK was aborted in a brief moment shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, just after he had been declared the winner of the key California primary. After delivering an optimistic victory speech in the hotel\u2019s main ballroom, he began to make his way out of the building through the kitchen, where, far from the eyes of the media, he stopped to shake hands with a busboy and greet workers. Suddenly, a man named Sirhan Sirhan, 24, armed with a pistol, stepped forward and fired a volley of shots. Kennedy was mortally wounded and five other people were also hit by bullets.\n\n\u201cLet me explain!\u201d Sirhan shouted as he was subdued by a former FBI agent and others. \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d He was arrested and given a widely covered trial, but no one bothered to listen to him.\n\nBobby Kennedy, who died the following day, underwent an apotheosis: from symbol of the idealistic left to a character in a Greek tragedy encompassing both a family and a nation. In this drama there was no place for Sirhan, who aroused two types of reactions. The majority viewed him as a madman whose rants were not even worth listening to, while the minority saw him as part of a larger conspiracy against Kennedy the revolutionary, and in any case considered him a mere puppet who had nothing of his own to say. The bottom line was the same in both cases: Sirhan\u2019s opinions were of no interest to anyone.\n\n'Let me explain!' Sirhan shouted as he was subdued by a former FBI agent and others. 'I did it for my country.'\n\nA new Netflix documentary series, \u201cBobby Kennedy for President,\u201d paints a vivid portrait of the secret of the politician\u2019s charm and of the vast emotional earthquake his assassination fomented. Kennedy touched deeply those who felt betrayed by the American dream; the four-part series shows his solidarity with their suffering and his ability to attract diverse groups, some of them conservative, with an openly liberal campaign that was characterized by cautious optimism. He represented the hope of the 1960s, and his assassination occurred just two months before the opening of the Democratic Party\u2019s convention. Those who had looked forward to a victory celebration had to cope instead with the disintegration of the left-wing coalition in prime time, while Chicago burned.\n\nAmid the political, cultural and social turbulence known as \u201cthe Sixties,\u201d the figure of Sirhan Sirhan was forgotten. In retrospect, it\u2019s worth looking more closely at him, because he was a type of killer Americans would soon encounter more of. Even more interesting is that all the facts were known at the time, but people were blind to them. That\u2019s logical, though, as historians insist that a distance of time is crucial for analyzing major developments and processes.\n\nFor the sake of comparison: Will history ultimately show that U.S. President Donald Trump is a footnote in a liberal narrative whose hero is President Barack Obama, or will Obama go down as a footnote in the story of the rise of the right wing, in which Trump is the hero? Historical perspective \u2013 and of course the passage of time \u2013 is needed to answer that question, and 50 years after the assassination of RFK, the case of Sirhan Sirhan offers an excellent case for reexamination.\n\nScarred in Jerusalem\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan, a Palestinian Christian, was born in 1944 in Jerusalem\u2019s Musrara neighborhood, opposite the Old City. He began to display psychological problems in early childhood, particularly during Israel\u2019s War of Independence, which broke out when he was 3 years old. His mother, Mary Sirhan, told The Washington Post in 1979 how her son was scarred by the horrific scenes of fighting he witnessed in and around the Old City.\n\nOpen gallery view U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy shakes hands with people in a crowd while campaigning for the Democratic party's presidential nomination in Philadelphia, April 2, 1968. Credit: Warren Winterbottom/AP\n\nIn 1948, at the height of the events, when the city was divided in two, the family fled Musrara and moved to the Jordanian-controlled eastern section of the city, for fear of what life would be like under Jewish rule. Until the war, Musrara had been an affluent Palestinian neighborhood, and the family lived comfortably. Afterward, however, they were forced to share one house with nine families. Sirhan\u2019s father, Bishara, lost his job.\n\nIn 1956, when Sirhan was 12, the family received a special immigration permit issued by the United States to Palestinian refugees, and they settled in Pasadena, in Los Angeles. It is known that the son flirted with a variety of different religious philosophies.\n\nImmediately after his arrest, following the shooting, Sirhan told his captors that he had made the decision to kill Kennedy only three weeks earlier. On the radio, he had heard a speech delivered by the candidate during a visit to a synagogue, in which Kennedy promised to arm Israel with dozens of warplanes, calling it the lesson he\u2019d learned from the Six-Day War a year earlier. A 2008 article in the Guardian quotes one of Sirhan\u2019s relatives as saying that the assassin had actually been a great admirer of Kennedy, but that after hearing the synagogue speech he ran from the room with \u201chis hands on his ears, and almost weeping.\u201d In his interrogation, too, Sirhan explained that the date of the assassination was not accidental, that he had chosen it because it was the first anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan was a type of killer Americans would soon encounter more of.\n\n\u201cTo me he [Kennedy] was my hero, he was my champion,\u201d Sirhan told British journalist David Frost during an interview at the state prison in Soledad, California, in 1989, one of only two television interviews he has given over the years. \u201cHe was the protector of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, and I felt that I was one [of those]. And to have him say that he was going to send 50 Phantom jets to Israel to deliver nothing but death and destruction on my countrymen, that seemed as though it were a betrayal, and it was sad for me to accept and it was hard for me to accept.\u201d\n\nResearchers have shown an increasing interest in Sirhan in recent years, particularly against the background of such phenomena as Al-Qaida and ISIS. In a 2011 biography of Sirhan, \u201cThe Forgotten Terrorist,\u201d Mel Ayton maintains that the prosecution deliberately chose to ignore evidence proving that this was the first American encounter with Middle Eastern terrorism. To prove his point, Ayton presented evidence, forensic findings and even a notebook in which Sirhan wrote the sentence \u201cRFK must die,\u201d obsessively, thousands of times, proof of premeditation on the assassin\u2019s part.\n\nAyton is probably right, but the harsh judgment about people not understanding the meaning of Sirhan\u2019s Palestinian identity is unfair. It\u2019s true that his origins and background, his cry of \u201cfor my country\u201d immediately after the shooting and his official statements during his interrogation were not sufficient to change the prosecution\u2019s presentation or alter the way Sirhan was publicly perceived. All the facts were known already during the trial, but they did not modify the narrative about a mad, brainwashed assassin, one that was widespread during the Cold War era.\n\nSirhan\u2019s case is a perfect example of a concept falling off the radar because of its newness. On the day of the assassination, June 5, 1968, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip was exactly one year old, and American interest in it was only minimally developed. The description \u201cassassin of Arab origin\u201d that clung to Sirhan was enough for Americans. Those who were interested in digging a little deeper classified him as a \u201cJordanian citizen\u201d \u2013 because of his passport \u2013 but that was as far as interest in his identity went.\n\nEven within the Arab world, an action taken in the name of so-called Palestinian nationhood was a relatively novel idea. The Palestine Liberation Organization was new \u2013 it was only a year later that Yasser Arafat would take its reins \u2013 and few in the West had ever heard the word \u201cPalestinian.\u201d The assertion by Golda Meir, Israel\u2019s prime minister at the time of the trial, that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian people\u201d certainly did not help Sirhan\u2019s being tagged as a political assassin with a national agenda.\n\nThe tacit assumption of the period \u2013 with its burgeoning number of political movements, undergrounds and cells \u2013 was that a political murder was by definition an act committed under the auspices of an organization. But the PLO, for its part, denied any connection to Sirhan, and it wasn\u2019t until the following decade that Palestinian organizations began to demand his release from prison.\n\n\u201cMy reaction and that of many people is that a crazy person could have had an infinite number of guiding forces and he just happened to have that one,\u201d Peter Edelman, who was issues director of Kennedy\u2019s campaign, told The Boston Globe in 2008. The same article quoted historian Steven Gillon as saying that Sirhan \u201cwas a Middle Eastern version of [JFK\u2019s killer] Lee Harvey Oswald a lone gunman who wants to become famous by shooting a famous person\u201d and not someone who is driven by political ideology. Sirhan simply did not meet the expectations of his contemporaries for what is now termed \u201clone-wolf terrorism.\u201d After all, if a terrorist attack takes place in a forest but there\u2019s no one to understand it as such, is it still a terrorist attack?\n\n'To have him say that he was going to send 50 Phantom jets to Israel to deliver nothing but death and destruction on my countrymen, that seemed as though it were a betrayal.' Sirhan\n\nSirhan was there from the beginning, but the idea and the definition of the \u201clone wolf terrorist\u201d were different. He was just another \u201cmadman,\u201d not a calculating assassin acting out of ideology.\n\nIn the 19th century, the \u201clone wolf\u201d label was employed rarely, and when it was, it was to describe murderers with apparently arbitrary motives. Only in the wake of events in the 1990s did the \u201clone wolf\u201d concept enter the public lexicon actively, with figures such as Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995, or in Israel, with the American-born Baruch Goldstein, who murdered 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron a year earlier. The American authorities became increasingly fearful of \u201cdomestic terrorism,\u201d and particularly of solitary killers against whom it was difficult to defend. Only then were the resources made available to investigate their psychological profile in order to thwart future attempts.\n\nNo fixed profile\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Gill, a senior lecturer in security and crime science at University College London, research on the subject of individual terror acts is still in a fledgling state, and the phenomenon has yet to be fully identified and defined. In a 2015 lecture, Gill presented new data on the subject revealing that a lone-actor terrorist is 13 times more likely to be suffering from a mental illness than a group-based terrorist.\n\nGill noted that researchers were surprised by the findings, which went \u201ccompletely against what the psychology of terror literature was saying.\u201d In fact, the earlier research showed that, only \u201cabout a third had been diagnosed with mental disorders before they [carried out] their attack.\u201d However, \u201cthe vast majority of those studies were focused on group-based [terrorism].\u201d Unemployment and addictions also tend to appear in these lone killers. In addition, the assumption that mental illness leads to spontaneous acts is not always correct, he noted, \u201cbecause sometimes a disorder will help you act in a much more rational way.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that no distinct personality profile of a lone-actor ideological killer exists. Such individuals can be of any age, from a range of professions, and in effect from any background. What surprised Gill was the psychological resemblance they bear to individuals who perpetrate massacres at workplaces or in schools.\n\n\u201cWe really did expect to find major differences between the two,\u201d Gill told the American PBS program \u201cFrontline\u201d in July 2016. \u201cBut our study shows that the behaviors they engage in, and their trajectory into violence, look really, really similar.\u201d The main difference, apart from the political and ideological rage vs. personal/individual rage, is in the choice of venue: The nonpolitical killers tend to attack in a place they\u2019re familiar with, whereas the political killers usually choose a place they didn\u2019t know before. Gill subsumes both groups under one category, which he terms \u201cgrievance-field violence.\u201d\n\n\u2018Burned the hell out of me\u2019\n\nEven within the Arab world, an action taken in the name of so-called Palestinian nationhood was a relatively novel idea.\n\nSirhan, 74, is still in prison, and his statements over the years are consistent with the research conclusions. In his trial, nearly 50 years ago, he stated, \u201cWhen you move a whole country, a whole people, bodily from their own homes, from their land, from their business, that is completely wrong. That burned the hell out of me.\u201d Yet today, when public opinion may be better primed to accept his original motivation, but less inclined to forgive him, he offers an alternative explanation. The last time he appeared before the parole board, in 2016, he adopted a popular conspiracy theory and claimed he had been hypnotized when he shot Sen. Kennedy.\n\nIt\u2019s the same problem criminology was facing five decades ago, Gill noted in his lecture. In the past, he said, \u201cThe study of terrorism has a really big aggregate of problems, which criminology had about 50 years ago. They talked about the \u2018criminal,\u2019 but over time our understanding of the criminal became a lot more disaggregated. [We found that] what interests arsonists and influences them is very different from sexual offenders, very different from burglars. They have very different drivers: The behavior and the motivational underpinnings behind those crimes are very, very different There\u2019s a different psychology involved. But we still talk about terrorism as a sort of aggregate problem. Yet what drives someone to be a suicide bomber might be very different from someone who is a financier for a terrorist organization, but we treat them all as \u2018terrorists.\u2019\u201d In short, he concluded, a more complex understanding of these phenomena is needed.\n\nOpen gallery view U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy speaks with civil rights leaders Rev.

That shift has engendered a readiness to investigate the lone murderers, after years in which they were generally categorized as \u201cmadmen,\u201d without further examination. Still, even now, although there is a more serious consideration of motives in such cases, it is often accompanied by the old approach that looks for the person pulling the strings: Perhaps there\u2019s a large organization behind the lone actor; perhaps such people have undergone \u201conline radicalization,\u201d as is usually said of ISIS terrorists. For instance, when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel rammed into and killed 84 people in Nice on Bastille Day 2016, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve stated, \u201cThis is a new type of attack. We are now confronted with individuals that are sensitive to the message of ISIS and are committed to extremely violent actions without necessarily being trained by them.\u201d\n\nMadness or conspiracy are convenient explanations for public opinion; belief in a tragic fate, as in the case of the Kennedy family, is sometimes easier to accept. However we define Sirhan \u2013 Palestinian terrorist or American psychopath \u2013 what\u2019s scary is precisely the rational motives that drove him. Journalists, like many readers, find it difficult to accept the thought that an individual with a pistol and sufficient malice can divert history from its course.\n\nThe assassination of Robert Kennedy left the Democrats without an obvious candidate going into the Chicago convention. Finally, it was the bland vice president, Hubert Humphrey, who was nominated as a compromise candidate, even though he hadn\u2019t run in the primaries. On November 5, 1968, with the Democratic Party in a shambles, Richard Nixon defeated Humphrey. The latter made a brief statement: \u201cI have done my best. I have lost, Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its will.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/sirhan-sirhan-who-killed-rfk", "page_content": "Was Sirhan Sirhan really the man who killed Robert Kennedy? Or was there a larger conspiracy at play?\n\nHistory knows Sirhan Sirhan as the man who killed Robert Kennedy. He was convicted under the decision that he was motivated by anger and vengeance for his country. But it appears that there could be more to this story than that.\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Sirhan shot Kennedy in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. But who was this 24-year-old that ended the life of a could-be president?\n\nSirhan Sirhan\u2019s Violent Childhood\n\nOf Palestinian descent and born in 1944 in Jerusalem, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan entered the world in a region already choked by conflict. His early life would foreshadow the grisly decisions he would make as a young adult.\n\nIn Palestine in 1947, war broke out. The violence forced the Sirhan family to flee their affluent neighborhood in Jerusalem and they relocated to territory controlled by Jordan. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1979, Sirhan\u2019s mother Mary detailed the horrors her son had witnessed as a boy. He\u2019d seen soldiers blown apart, severed limbs, and his own brother killed by a truck that had swerved into him to avoid gunfire.\n\n\u201cHe was a victim all his life,\u201d Mary Sirhan said almost 20 years after her son killed Bobby Kennedy. \u201cHe never had a childhood, never was happy, never laughed \u2014 all he has seen is fear, hunger, dying human beings in pieces. It\u2019s hard enough for a big man, but for a child\u2026And look what happened to him.\u201d\n\nThe conflict bled into the Sirhan household as well. After Sirhan Sirhan Sr. lost his home and his job to war, he became emotionally unstable. He began to beat his wife and children. Finally in 1957, the family fled the violence and immigrated to the United States. Sirhan Jr. attended a Lutheran school where he was described as quiet and bookish. But the violence and conflict had already done too much damage to the boy.\n\nThe Sirhans settled in a suburb of Pasadena, California. They lived about 30 minutes from the Ambassador Hotel where their son would end Bobby Kennedy\u2019s life.\n\nBobby Kennedy\u2019s Presidential Campaign Of 1968\n\nOn March 16, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy announced his intentions to run for president.\n\nIt was a controversial move. The Democratic party didn\u2019t want him to run as most had thrown their support already behind the incumbent Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson, who was seeking a second term. Younger Americans felt that Kennedy was an opportunist who had only decided to join the race after observing the strong performance of another Democratic Senator, Eugene McCarthy, in the New Hampshire primary.\n\n\u201cI run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course,\u201d Kennedy addressed a room of anxious supporters and journalists. \u201cI run,\u201d Kennedy continued, \u201cbecause it is now unmistakenly clear that we can change these disastrous, divisive policies only by changing the men who are now making them.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson took to television to tell the American people that he \u201cwould not seek, nor accept\u201d the nomination for president. Johnson\u2019s exit from the race set off a madcap campaign among Democrats. On the Republican side, political giants Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller, and Ronald Reagan battled amongst themselves. Meanwhile, Kennedy seemed to embody a hopeful side of politics. Sadly, his decision to enter the political fray would prove to be a fatal one.\n\nSirhan Sirhan\u2019s Obsession\n\nOn May 18, Sirhan Sirhan took to his journal. In the notebook that would soon become crucial evidence against him, he wrote: \u201cMy determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession\u2026Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before June 5, 1968.\u201d\n\nThe later trial of Sirhan revealed more of the same such entries: \u201cRFK must be disposed of,\u201d or \u201cRobert Fitzgerald Kennedy must soon die die die die die die die die die die.\u201d\n\nBut what was the impetus for these frenzied entries and subsequent violence? Accounts on Sirhan\u2019s motivation vary. By one account, Sirhan had heard on the radio that Bobby Kennedy, campaigning for Jewish votes, vowed to send 50 fighter jets to support Israel.\n\nHowever, Kennedy made the promise to send jets to Israel eight days after Sirhan\u2019s violent journaling of May 18.\n\nVictory And Assassination In California\n\nRegardless of why, Sirhan did act on his violence on June 5, 1968, as jubilant supporters of Bobby Kennedy gathered in the lobby of the Ambassador Hotel to cheer on his champion. Kennedy had just won the California primary. In a light-hearted mood, Kennedy thanked his dog, Freckles. He then spoke his last public words with his pregnant wife, Ethel, at his side:\n\n\u201cWe are a great country, an unselfish country, a compassionate country. And I intend to make that my basis for running. So, my thanks to all of you, and now it\u2019s on to Chicago and let\u2019s win there.\u201d\n\nKennedy headed to the kitchen, and to his death.\n\nIt happened quickly. Six pops, like firecrackers, fired into the air, although the number of gunshots is today disputed. Kennedy slumped to the floor. Juan Romero, a busboy, knelt next to him and tried to keep his head off the concrete. Sirhan shot five others as well. All but Kennedy would survive.\n\nAndrew West, a reporter for the Mutual Broadcasting System, had followed Kennedy into the kitchen. On camera, he gave a breathless and panicked play-by-play: \u201cRafer Johnson [a friend of Kennedy] has a hold of a man who apparently fired the shot. He has fired the shot. He still has the gun. The gun is pointed at me right at this moment! Get the gun! Get the gun! Get a hold of his thumb and break it if you have to!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me explain!\u201d Sirhan Sirhan shouted as horrified witnesses disarmed him. \u201cI did it for my country!\u201d\n\nAt his interrogation, Sirhan explained that he\u2019d purposefully chosen June 5 to kill Robert Kennedy. It was the first anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War between Israel and an Arab coalition of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.\n\nAt his trial, Sirhan reportedly told the court that Kennedy\u2019s support for Israel \u201cburned me up; if he were in front of me, the way I felt then, so help me God, he would have died right then and there.\u201d\n\nTheories Of Innocence and Conspiracy\n\nSirhan was sentenced to death by gas chamber at the San Quentin prison on April 23, 1969, after a jury had convicted him of first-degree murder. He stayed on death row for two years before California outlawed the punishment. When it was reinstated, Sirhan was reprieved and remains imprisoned for life.\n\nSirhan\u2019s own account of his state of mind before and during the assassination fluctuates over the years he was tried and serving time. On the stand, he took something of an anti-Israel stance which he claimed to have directed towards Kennedy. But years later, Sirhan would claim that he did not remember killing Kennedy. His attorney even asserted that Sirhan had been brainwashed.\n\nIn 1980, he said that while the anniversary of the Six-Day War was certainly an impetus for his anger, he was also very drunk the night he allegedly shot the candidate.\n\nHe has since appealed for parole 15 times as of 2016. His appeals have often been supported by some unlikely characters who sense foul play or conspiracy, including those closest to Robert Kennedy himself.\n\nWhile conspiracy theorists do not often have an intimate connection the case in question, those in support of Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s innocence certainly do: including the candidate\u2019s own son, Robert Kennedy Jr., and one of his campaign aides, Paul Schrade. Schrade, on the night of June 5, 1968, took a bullet himself.\n\nThey point to several oddities in the case.\n\nFirst, there is the matter of the number of bullets involved in the assassination. Witnesses claim to have heard more than six shots. In the recording of Polish journalist Stanislaw Pruszynski, some believe that up to 13 shots can be heard \u2014 but Sirhan Sirhan had a gun that could only fire eight shots.\n\nThe fatal bullet that entered Bobby Kennedy came from the back below his ear. However, witnesses remember Sirhan standing in front of the senator.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. noted that his father, \u201cas the chief law enforcement officer in this country [Kennedy served as Attorney General]\u2026would have [been] disturbed if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nSchrade, 91 years old, even went as far as to testify at Sirhan\u2019s parole hearing in April 2016. \u201cThe evidence clearly shows you were not the gunman who shot Robert Kennedy,\u201d Schrade said directly to the man accused of murdering his friend.\n\nThe question remains, then; who killed Bobby Kennedy? Until a more compelling story is revealed, Sirhan Sirhan will spend the rest of his life in jail for the crime. Among some of those closest to Bobby Kennedy, however, another belief persists: that the truth is still out there.\n\nAfter this look at Sirhan Sirhan and the ongoing uncertainty of who killed Bobby Kennedy, read the forgotten story of Rosemary Kennedy who received a lobotomy.

A young Democratic candidate is celebrating a crucial victory in the California primary elections. He has lived most of his life in the shadow of his more famous, charismatic brother. But he has been able to leave his mark on the American people through his work as Attorney General and New York Senator. Now, he is on his way to the top, on his way to becoming one of the best Presidents that America ever had.\n\nLoading...\n\nSame night, same place. A young Palestinian immigrant is attending the celebration. He has survived through war and displacement in his home country but has succeeded in starting a new life in the US. This night, he is not at the Ambassador Hotel to celebrate, though. Some may say he is mentally unstable. Some will say he has been manipulated.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the facts are undisputed.\n\nJune 5th 1968, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles. Robert Francis Kennedy, aged 42, Senator for the State of New York and on his way to become the Democratic candidate in November\u2019s presidential elections, is shot dead by Palestinian refugee Sirhan B. Sirhan.\n\nIn today\u2019s Biographics we will look at Bob Kennedy\u2019s remarkable life achievements, at how he fatally crossed paths with his murderer. And at the sinister theories that may explain one of the most shocking assassinations in American history.\n\nACT I\n\nBobby\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the third boy and seventh out of a total of nine children born to Rose and patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy. Smaller and weaker than his older brothers Joe Jr And John, Bobby was often considered the \u201crunt\u201d of the family, which meant that at least in his early childhood he was much attached to his devout mother, spending much of his time going to church with her.\n\nBut despite having a sweet and pleasant character he showed early on a disposition to fight against the odds and to let his own voice be heard.\n\n\u201cI was the seventh of nine children, and when you come from that far down you have to struggle to survive.\u201d\n\nRobert \u2013 or Bobby, as he was known to his family \u2013 struggled not only at home, but also at school. Due to Joseph Sr\u2019s work-related relocations, including an appointment as Ambassador to London, Bobby had a hard time in adjusting to different schools. He eventually attended 12 different primary and secondary schools in the U.S. and England. But he pulled through, graduating from Milton Academy and later at Harvard, where he proved his mettle as an accomplished varsity football player, despite him being a \u201crunt\u201d and playing with a severely broken leg.\n\nIn 1944, aged 19, Bobby interrupted his studies to serve in the US Navy, being commissioned to a relatively quiet theatre \u2013 the Caribbean \u2013 on anti U-Boot patrolling duties.\n\nThe ship he served on was named after his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr who had been killed in action during the war as a Navy fighter pilot. This tragedy had suddenly shifted the balance of expectations among the Kennedy boys. Now, \u2018Jack\u2019 was suddenly pushed to the fore, and Bobby was to be considered a close \u2018second in command\u2019.\n\nIn 1945, with WWII over, Bobby was able to pursue more pleasing interests and he was dating Patricia Skakel, the daughter of a railroad clerk turned coal magnate. Until he met and fell in love with one of his sister Jean\u2019s best friends, a younger girl called Ethel. Who happened to be Patricia\u2019s sister. We have no records, but we are going to guess Christmas 1945 must have been a pretty awkward one at the Skakels\u2019 \u2026\n\nBut Bobby and Ethel made a nice couple, had common interests and even worked together on Jack\u2019s campaign for the Congress in 1946. This was the first of many occasions in which the future President would rely on Bobby\u2019s trusted advice and support.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Bobby returned to his studies and earned a degree in government from Harvard University in 1948. He completed his education by attaining also a law degree from the University of Virginia three years later. But, as he recalled on many occasions, he considered his most formative experiences to be the conversations at the family dinner table, where Rose and Joe Sr would encourage their children to engage in heated discussions about history and current affairs.\n\nIn June 1950, after a brief engagement, Bobby and Ethel got married. Their first child, Kathleen, was born in 1951, on the 4th of July \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get more patriotic than that. Kathleen would be the first of eleven \u2013 yes, eleven \u2013 children.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn 1952, Bobby made his formal debut on the political stage, by managing his brother John\u2019s campaign to be elected as a Senator for the State of Massachusetts. The campaign was successful and proved that Bobby had a natural talent to organise and to lead.\n\nBut the young Kennedy possessed another talent which would come to the fore in the following year: he was in fact a skilful investigator and prosecutor, and in 1953 he served briefly on the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy was an old family friend \u2013 he had even dated two of the Kennedy girls \u2013 and had hired Bobby to help him on his crackdown on suspected communist infiltrators. Bobby, however, did not agree with McCarthy\u2019s brutal prosecution tactics and left the Subcommittee after only six months. He would later author a report condemning McCarthy\u2019s investigation of alleged Communists in the Army.\n\nBobby did not stop working within the Senate\u2019s investigating committees. By the end of the 1950s he had become Chief Counsel for the Senate Rackets Committee, in charge of investigating corruption in trade unions. This position won him national recognition, particularly because it pitted him directly against the powerful Jimmy Hoffa, president of the Brotherhood of Teamsters, the largest truckers\u2019 union. Hoffa was suspected of colluding with organised crime to further the progress and influence of the Brotherhood and developed a bitter personal feud with Kennedy, which became apparent in some of the televised Committee hearings. Hoffa would later say of Bobby:\n\n\u201cI used to love to bug the little bastard\u201d\n\nAttorney General\n\nIn 1960, Bobby resigned from his Chief Counsel position to better dedicate himself to running John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign. It was in this occasion that Bobby became John\u2019s closest confidante and collaborator. In fact, after being elected to the top office, John appointed Bobby Attorney General in his cabinet.\n\nAs Attorney General, Bobby gained a reputation as the President\u2019s loyal and ruthless enforcer and some of his actions are still controversial, but overall, he won respect for his effective administration of the Department of Justice.\n\nToday he is mostly remembered for two endeavours.\n\nFirst, his fight against organized crime. According to author Seymour Hersh, Joseph Kennedy had enlisted the help of mobster Sam Giancana to support JFK\u2019s presidential campaign. But neither Jack nor Bobby had any interest in maintaining this relationship. When Bobby increased the number of Mafia convictions from 35 to 288 over the three years of Jack\u2019s term, the mob were furious.\n\nAccording to Prof Larry Sabato it took the good offices of Frank Sinatra \u2013 good friends with both the Kennedys and the Mafia \u2013 to appease Giancana: the crooner had to perform eight nights for free at Giancana\u2019s club.\n\nBobby\u2019s second achievement was the enforcement of the 1954 Supreme Court decision on school desegregation, and in general his support of the Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn September 1962, Attorney General Kennedy sent US Marshals and troops to Oxford, Mississippi to enforce a federal court order admitting the first African American student \u2013 James Meredith \u2013 to the University of Mississippi. He also collaborated with the President in proposing the most far-reaching civil rights statute so far in American history, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which passed eight months after JFK\u2019s death.\n\nBobby\u2019s collaboration with his President brother was not limited to Justice. During the September 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, he developed the strategy of blockading Cuba as an alternative to military intervention that could have led to nuclear war.\n\nBut Cuba also marks one of the shadows in the Attorney General\u2019s career.\n\nAfter the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion \u2013 a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro using an ill-prepared force of Cuban exiles \u2013 President Kennedy asked his brother to oversee a clandestine mission, Operation Mongoose, dedicated to removing the Cuban leader once and for all. Bobby invested hundreds of millions of dollars in building secret bases, training spies and planning increasingly bizarre ways to do away with Castro for good. Operation Mongoose is known to have made at least eight failed attempts on the Communist leader\u2019s life, one of which involved CIA operatives hiring a Mafia hitman, Johnny Rosselli. Considering Bobby\u2019s stance against organised crime, this further involvement with the mob is controversial to say the least.\n\nAnother controversial decision involved the Civil Rights movement. Despite the Attorney General\u2019s sympathies towards this movement, in 1963 he approved the installation of wiretaps on Martin Luther King and several of his associates. In this case Bobby relented to lobbying from FBI director J Edgar Hoover who believed Dr King to be a Communist sympathizer, mainly because he had spoken up against the Vietnam War. For more than three years the Bureau would keep King under surveillance and even sent him anonymous threatening letters in the hopes of stopping his social justice campaigns.\n\nOn the 22nd of November 1963 John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas and we invite you to watch our video on JFK to learn more about the facts and theories behind that killing.\n\nLet\u2019s not lose our focus on Bobby: John\u2019s death was a devastating blow for him. Not only he had lost a brother whom he loved dearly, but his years as campaign manager and Attorney General had given him an identity, which was now struggling to find.\n\nHe continued his duties at the Department of Justice under Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency until 1964, but the two never got along well and Bobby quit his job. Instead he ran for the post of US Senator for the State of New York, launching an effective campaign which won him the November election by 719,000 votes.\n\nAs New York\u2019s Senator from January 1965, Bobby dedicated himself to three main causes:\n\nFirst, he strived to supporting the dispossessed and the powerless in America, mainly the urban poor populations, the racial minorities and Native Americans. He sought to remedy the problems of poverty through legislation to encourage private industry to locate in poverty-stricken areas, thus creating jobs for the unemployed, and stressed the importance of work over welfare.\n\nThen, he sought to advance human rights, both in the US and abroad. He was an outspoken critic of the apartheid system in South Africa, visiting the country in 1966 and delivering a memorable speech to an assembly of progressive students\n\n\u201cEach time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring, those ripples build a current\n\nAnd finally, he embarked on a personal quest to end the Vietnam War. Bobby had initially supported President Johnson\u2019s military escalation in Indochina \u2013 until February 1966. This is when he first publicly denounced this policy and asked for the reduction of the war effort, as well as for the initiation of talks with the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese government. He strongly opposed President Johnson\u2019s authorisation of the carpet bombing of civilian targets in North Vietnam, which he denounced in another memorable speech in the Senate:\n\n\u201cAre we like the God of the Old Testament that we can decide, in Washington, DC, what cities, what towns, what hamlets in Vietnam are going to be destroyed?\u2026 Do we have to accept that?\u2026 I do not think we have to. I think we can do something about it.\u201d\n\nOn March 16, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. He would be running on a very progressive platform against the other main Democratic candidate, Hubert Humphrey.\n\nIt was, in the words of author Arthur Schlesinger Jr.,\n\n\u201can uproarious campaign, filled with enthusiasm and fun\u2026 It was also a campaign moving in its sweep and passion.\u201d\n\nIn his campaign Bobby built on the themes that had marked his senatorial term: advancement of human rights, including supporting the Civil Rights movement, helping the dispossessed in the urban areas and the Native American reservations and putting an end to the Vietnam War.\n\nHis candidates were supportive of a broader, safer, more conservative message, and yet Bobby managed to win critical primary elections in Nebraska and Indiana.\n\nAnd it was just before speaking at an Indianapolis rally that Bobby learned of the murder of Martin Luther King. It was the 4th of April 1968, five years since the former Attorney General had approved of the Reverend\u2019s surveillance by the FBI.\n\nThat evening Bobby delivered one his most famous speeches informing the crowd of King\u2019s death and urging them to not react angrily. He concluded by making an appeal for racial unity in those difficult times. Following King\u2019s death, riots broke out in more than 100 cities across the US, but Indianapolis remained peaceful.\n\nAfter securing Nebraska and Indiana, Bobby was looking forward to winning the California primaries in early June. The Democratic candidacy was within his grasp.\n\nAnd so, we are back to the start of our video.\n\nIt\u2019s the night between the 4th and the 5th of June 1968, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles. Robert F. Kennedy has just announced his victory at the California primaries to an ecstatic crowd of supporters. After a brief speech Bobby mingled with the crowd and Hotel staff. According to witnesses, he was moving slowly through the Hotel restaurant\u2019s pantry. When he reached out to shake the hand of a busboy, Juan Romero, a young man stepped out from the crowd, raised his arm and after shouting \u201cKennedy, you son of a bitch!\u201d he began shooting.\n\nThat man was called Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year old Palestinian refugee.\n\nKennedy was hit three times: in his armpit, in the back and behind his right ear. Members of his entourage apprehended Sirhan and slammed him down on a metal table, but he was able to continue shooting, wounding five other by-standers.\n\nAs Kennedy\u2019s friends, which included a professional Football player, struggled to pin down the diminutive Sirhan, he yelled\n\n\u201cLet me explain! I can explain! I did it for my country. I love my country.\u201d\n\nJuan Romero knelt to help Bobby, who was on the floor, bleeding. Kennedy asked\n\n\u201cIs everybody OK?\u201d\n\nRomero replied that \u2018Yes, everybody\u2019s OK\u2019. Bobby then turned away and said\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThose were his last words. Robert Kennedy died 26 hours later, aged 42. His eleventh child, Rory, would be born six months later.\n\nAct II\n\nIt\u2019s time now to examine the life of the man on the other side of the gun. Who was Sirhan Sirhan and what had driven him to murder Robert Kennedy?\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was a Jordanian citizen born on March 19, 1944, in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, into a highly religious family of Arab\u2013Christians. He spent the early few years of his life in his home country and also completed his early schooling there.\n\nIf you know even a little of Middle Eastern history, you may have guessed that being a Palestinian child in the late 1940s did not make for a quiet upbringing, and Sirhan\u2019s childhood was no exception. Following the declaration of Israel as an independent state and the subsequent declaration of war by the surrounding Arab Countries, Sirhan and his family would witness violence on a daily basis.\n\nIn one traumatic experience, Sirhan saw a man being ripped to pieces during a bombing raid in his neighbourhood. His mother, Mary, said that the image haunted her son, and he would never be the same.\n\nAt the age of 12, the Sirhans had the chance to emigrate to the United States, as part of a special visa programme granted to Palestinian refugees. The young Sirhan did not escape completely from a life of violence, though, as his father had a volatile temper and would physically assault him on several occasions.\n\nDespite being an outsider within a dysfunctional family, Sirhan adapted quite well to American life. He first attended the Eliot Junior High School in New York, before the family relocated to California where he enrolled in the Pasadena City College. Sirhan was academically good and proved his worth in both school and college. However, despite having the chance to do so, he never applied for American citizenship and preferred to remain a Jordanian.\n\nAfter graduating from Pasadena, Sirhan drifted from one job to another, never settling into a career and holding a series of menial jobs. The only career prospect he considered seriously was horse racing. At one point, he found himself working as a stable boy at the Santa Anita racetrack. Being only 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 115 pounds, he had the perfect physique to become a professional jockey, but his hopes did not materialise.\n\nWhat did really define him at this stage in his life was his religious belief. He was an ardent Christian believer and he experimented with different church denominations, shifting from being a Coptic to joining the Baptist and the Adventist churches. In 1966, he finally joined the \u2018Ancient Mystical Order of the Rose Cross,\u2019 an American branch of Rosicrucianism.\n\nThis is a mystical branch of Christianity which dates back to the teachings of Johan Valentin Andreae, a XVIIth century Lutheran theologian. Rosicrucians combined early Christian philosophy with alchemy and even ancient Egyptian mysticism and have been associated with Freemasonry and Theosophism through the ages. We could talk about Rosicrucianism for hours on an end, but for the purpose of our story we will only mention that Sirhan\u2019s association to this movement has been linked to his shift towards religious extremism, nationalism or even brainwashing.\n\nSirhan and Bobby\n\nSo what we have so far is a deeply religious yet alienated young man, with few prospects in life and a violent upbringing. Was this enough to push him towards murder? And why Bobby Kennedy? What was his relationship with him?\n\nSirhan would declare to journalist David Frost that he saw Robert Kennedy as a hero, a protector of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged\n\n\u2018 \u2026 and I felt that I was one of those\u2019\n\nBut this perception changed in June 1967 with the six-day war, another victory which the State of Israel had gained against its Arab neighbours. As a Senator, Robert Kennedy had openly supported Israel during that conflict.\n\nAfter announcing his candidacy in March 1968 as new Democratic hopeful President, Kennedy made his support of Israel more frequent and outspoken. At a speech in a synagogue, broadcasted via radio, Kennedy pledged to support Israel with 50 fighter jets should he become President.\n\nSirhan\u2019s feelings towards the candidate had grown increasingly hostile since the Six-day war. After hearing the speech, Sirhan had a violent reaction witnessed by his family, screaming and storming out of the room.\n\nOn the 18th of May, Sirhan wrote in his diary:\n\n\u201cMy determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession\u2026Kennedy must die before June 5th \u2026 die, die, die, die, die.\u201d\n\nThe 5th of June 1968, it would have been the first anniversary of the Six-days War.\n\nOn the 1st of June, witnesses reported seeing Sirhan at the Lock, Stock, \u2018N Barrel gun shop in Los Angeles, where he bought two boxes of .22-caliber hollow point bullets.\n\nOn the 3rd of June, he was first spotted by staff at the Ambassador Hotel, apparently surveying the site where the presidential hopeful would be expected to wait for the results of the California primaries on the following day.\n\nOn the 4th of June, only hours before the shooting, Sirhan visited the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club to practice at its gun range.\n\nAnd now to the night of the 4th, a few minutes before midnight. Robert Kennedy was delivering the last lines of his speech in the Embassy ballroom at the Ambassador hotel, while Sirhan was in the hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry area, waiting \u2013 with a .22-caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet handgun in his pocket.\n\nAmbassador employees Jesus Perez and Martin Petrusky, remembered Sirhan lingering around the elevator area as Kennedy was still on stage.\n\nYou know what happened next: the screams, the gun shots, Kennedy falling on the floor, while Sirhan was apprehended still yelling \u201cI did it for my country!\u201d\n\n.\n\nAfter the arrest\n\nSirhan initially refused to speak or identify himself to the police. It wasn\u2019t until the 9th of June that decided to confess to the crime. But on insistence from his lawyers, he retracted his confession and pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial took place between January and April 1969 and during court hearings Sirhan behaved erratically. Sometimes he claimed that on the night of the murder he was drunk and that he had no recollection of killing Kennedy, while in other occasions he stated that if he had killed him, it wasn\u2019t out of personal hatred but as an act in service to his Country, Palestine. These discrepancies may have been part of the defence strategy, based on the concept that Sirhan was suffering from a condition known as \u2018diminished capacity\u2019, a thesis supported by professor of psychiatry at UCLA, Bernard Diamond.\n\nThe jury was not convinced, though, and eventually Sirhan was found guilty of murder on the 17th of April 1969 and sentenced to death.\n\nHis story may have ended there, but in 1972 the State of California declared the death penalty to be unconstitutional and so his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nSirhan Sirhan has been a convict in the Californian state prisons since then, first serving time in San Quentin, then Soledad, Pleasant Valley and finally the Richard Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.\n\nOver the years Sirhan has not been a silent convict, far from it. His lawyers have been constantly filing requests for parole hearings: one of these is held every five years, the last one in 2016, and they have all been rejected. What is interesting about these hearings, though, is that they have given the chance to Sirhan, his lawyers and his supporters to present new evidence supporting the claim that he was not Kennedy\u2019s assassin \u2013 or at least not a willing one \u2013 or maybe not the only one.\n\nIt\u2019s time now to look at these theories. I hope you are not easily offended by the \u2018C- word\u2019: Conspiracy.\n\nAct III\n\nThe Conspiracy\n\nThe official explanation for the murder of Robert F. Kennedy is that Sirhan Sirhan had acted alone, because he was mentally instable, because he wanted to strike at an enemy of the Arab cause, or both. This would make Bobby\u2019s assassination the first American encounter with Middle Eastern terrorism.\n\nOver the years many more theories have emerged, claiming that Sirhan had not acted alone or that he had been a pawn in the hands of more powerful and sinister forces.\n\nAt the 2011 parole hearing, Sirhan\u2019s attorney Larry Teeter brought forward the hypothesis that Sirhan may have been hypnotised, brainwashed and conditioned to carry out the assassination of RFK. He had been identified and selected as a \u2018patsy\u2019 or \u2018fall guy\u2019, because of his foreign origin and support of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThese theory is supported also by British author Peter Evans in his book Nemesis. According to Evans and Teeter, after interrogating Sirhan the Los Angeles Police Department could not account for a period of three months, known as the \u201cwhite fog\u201d, during which Sirhan\u2019s movements were unknown. It was during this \u2018white fog\u2019 days that Sirhan may have been hypnotised by psychiatrist Dr William Joseph Bryan Jnr, who had worked on the infamous CIA mind-control programme called MKULTRA.\n\nThis programme was an expansion on two pre-existing operations run by the CIA in the 1950s, called Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke. Both projects envisage the possibility of using hypnosis as an interrogation technique or as a way of manipulating a foreign national \u2013 and I stress, a foreign national \u2013 to carry out political assassinations. Bluebird, Artichoke and MKULTRA, as outlandish as they may sound, have all been acknowledged by the CIA and documentation related to them is freely accessible via Freedom of Information requests.\n\nWhat is chilling is that the official documentation for Bluebird and Artichoke does not raise any moral considerations around using hypnosis in interrogations or brainwashing innocent people to turn them into assassins. The main concern is sourcing the right psychiatrist for the job, because a private practitioner would likely not accept a lowly CIA salary \u2026\n\nDidn\u2019t know that the \u2018C\u2019 in CIA stood for \u2018Cheap\u2019 (!)\n\nBut back to the 2011 parole hearing! Why did the hypnosis theory emerge only then? Well, ironically enough, it was only then that Attorney Teeter had the idea to have Sirhan hypnotised to retrieve repressed memories of the assassination.\n\nDuring those sessions Sirhan was able to remember a detail previously concealed. He remembered meeting a girl in a polka-dot dress on the night of the assassination\n\n\u201cI was fascinated with her looks \u2026. She never said much. It was very erotic. I was consumed by her. She was a seductress with an unspoken unavailability.\u201d\n\nThe girl took him to the kitchen pantry and then pinched him on the arm. This was a \u2018trigger action\u2019 which led him to believe that he was on a weapons firing range \u2013 that\u2019s when Sirhan began shooting.\n\nBut who were the brains behind the whole operation?\n\nAccording to Teeter,\n\n\u201cThe assassination was staged by US intelligence for the purpose of continuing the war against Vietnam and putting the Republican Party in the White House. The assassination was arranged with the CIA, the FBI and the LAPD. There was a massive cover-up. If he had lived and been allowed to run, Bobby Kennedy would have been elected president and this was a multi-agency task force to make sure that the Democrats didn\u2019t take the White House again.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Peter Evans states a completely different theory in Nemesis. Sirhan had been hypnotised to be at the Ambassador and take the blame off the actual assassin, a Palestinian terrorist named Mahmoud Hamshari.\n\nAnd Hamshari was himself a pawn, on the payroll of none other than Greek magnate Aristotle Onassis, Jackie Kennedy\u2019s suitor at that time. The motive? Personal resentment towards Bobby, who had foiled a major deal between Onassis and the Saudis in 1953 and was opposed to the Greek billionaire marrying his sister-in-law.\n\nAccording to Evans, the CIA psychiatrist Dr Bryan had links to both Hamshari and Onassis, having cured the former for migraine, and the latter for sexual dysfunction. And finally one of Onassis\u2019 lovers, Helen Gaillet De Neergaard, reported that he himself had admitted his complicity in the killing in1974.\n\nOh, by the way, Dr Bryan? He was found dead in a Las Vegas hotel room in 1978, either shot himself or was murdered. The case remains unsolved.\n\nThe brainwashing theory is certainly fascinating, and we know by the CIA\u2019s own admission that the use of hypnosis to interrogate, or kill, was in their plans.\n\nBut something does not add up, and please note these are our personal considerations:\n\nif Sirhan had been programmed to believe he was at a firing range, shooting at targets\n\nif such belief was triggered by the pinch from the girl in the polka-dot dress\n\nwhy did he shout, \u201cKennedy you son of a bitch?\u201d. Why did he shout, \u201cI did it for my country?\u201d\n\nIf he was a \u2018patsy\u2019 all along, acting mechanically at the tap of some girl in polka-dots, how could he behave in such a competent way prior to the assassination? He knew where Kennedy was due to speak, he visited the location, he practised at a firing range and he acquired a .22 caliber gun \u2013 a low powered pistol, perfect choice for shooting in a closed environment such a pantry.\n\nNow, this choice of a weapon makes even more sense if other assassins are there. Other hitmen, even more competent, who want to avoid the risk of being hit by \u2018friendly fire\u2019. Time for our second Conspiracy theory.\n\nWhile researching the case for a screenplay, author and reporter Shane O\u2019Sullivan uncovered new video and photographic evidence suggesting that three senior CIA operatives were behind the killing. This time, not as shady hypnotists, but as hitmen involved directly in the assassination.\n\nThe first agent is David Sanchez Morales, known for leading covert operations in Latin America. As far back as 1973, Morales had been reported as saying\n\n\u201cI was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.\u201d\n\nReferring to both Kennedy brothers, of course.\n\nAnalysing footage and stills from the night of the assassination, \u2018O Sullivan was able to identify Morales standing at the back of the ballroom, in the moments between the end of Kennedy\u2019s speech and the shooting. Morales was also spotted alongside another operative called Gordon Campbell. Morales and Campbell had worked together at the CIA\u2019s Miami base in 1963. Both had been involved in the planning of the Bay of the Pigs invasion and were harsh critics of the Kennedys, blaming them for the failure of that operation.\n\nA third senior CIA figure was identified by looking at the crime scene photos taken by the LAPD: George Joannides, chief of psychological warfare operations at the Miami base.\n\nWhatever the involvement of Morales, Campbell and Joannides, it is a shared belief that Sirhan was not the only shooter at the Ambassador hotel.\n\nIn the last parole hearing in 2016, Paul Schrade, one of the five other people injured in the shooting, said the evidence clearly showed a second gunman had been in the kitchen pantry.\n\nFirst piece of evidence, the number of shots. Sirhan\u2019s gun could only carry eight rounds, and yet a radio reporter recorded the sound of 13 shots being fired in the pantry. This was confirmed by campaign volunteer Nina Rhodes-Hughes who reported to the FBI that she heard anywhere from 12-14 shots that night. Bobby\u2019s own son, Robert Kennedy Jr is convinced of this thesis, as he declared to The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cThere were too many bullets. You can\u2019t fire 13 shots out of an eight-shot gun.\u201d\n\nSecond point: direction of shooting. How could Sirhan have shot Kennedy in the back and behind the ear if all eye witnesses confirm that he was standing in front of him?\n\nThird: distance. Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi found that Bobby\u2019s fatal head wound, with an entry trajectory form behind the ear, had been inflicted from a distance of 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches. And Sirhan, he had been standing at at least 18 inches\u2019 distance.\n\nSo, another hitman, closer to Bobby than Sirhan was, had shot him behind the ear at close distance. Morales? Campbell? Joannides? Or somebody else? According to some witnesses, a security guard called Thane Cesar, standing behind Kennedy at the time was seen drawing his weapon. Although we should specify, he was not seen shooting and he later passed a polygraph test that included questions about whether he shot Kennedy.\n\nCan we handle the truth?\n\nWe have presented only three possible explanations of who, why and how could have been behind the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Bobby, a man who could have shone a beacon of hope in a traumatic period of American history. He could have ended the Vietnam War much earlier, supported the cause of the desperately poor and accelerated the process of integration brought about by the Civil Rights movement. These progressive goals would be at least partially achieved by subsequent administrations. But sadly at that time they could have provided enough motive for US intelligence agencies \u2013 or at least for factions within them \u2013 to be involved in Bobby\u2019s killing.\n\nAnd what was Sirhan\u2019s real role in this event? Was he really the victim of brainwashing, or perhaps the willing participant of a larger conspiracy, the only one to take the blame? We will stand by to hear from Sirhan\u2019s next parole hearing in 2021, hoping that the truth will finally emerge. Whether we will be able to handle it, that\u2019s another question.\n\nSo I hoped you liked this new, extended format, please leave your comments as usual. Did you like it? Hate it? But most of all, don\u2019t forget to tell us what is your theory for Robert Kennedy\u2019s assassination. And as usual, thank you for watching."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/27/sirhan-sirhan-bobby-kennedy-assassination-parole", "page_content": "The man who killed Robert F Kennedy was granted parole on Friday after two of the former attorney general, senator and presidential hopeful\u2019s sons spoke in favor of release and prosecutors declined to argue he should be kept behind bars.\n\nThe decision was a major victory for Sirhan Sirhan, 77, though it did not assure his release.\n\nThe ruling by the two-person panel at Sirhan\u2019s 16th parole hearing will be reviewed over 90 days by the California parole board. Then it will be sent to the governor, who will have 30 days to decide whether to grant it, reverse it or modify it.\n\nDouglas Kennedy, a toddler when his father was killed in 1968, said he was moved to tears by Sirhan\u2019s remorse and said he should be released if he\u2019s not a threat to others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr Sirhan face-to-face,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.\u201d\n\nRobert Kennedy, a New York senator and brother of President John F Kennedy, was a Democratic presidential candidate when he was killed on 6 June 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, moments after delivering a victory speech in the pivotal California primary.\n\nSirhan, convicted of first-degree murder, has said he doesn\u2019t remember the killing. His lawyer, Angela Berry, argued that the board should base its decision on who Sirhan is today.\n\nProsecutors declined to participate or oppose his release, under a policy by Los Angeles county district attorney George Gascon, a former police officer who took office last year. Gascon, who said he idolized the Kennedys and mourned RFK\u2019s assassination, believes the prosecutors\u2019 role ends at sentencing and they should not influence decisions to release prisoners.\n\nAs Douglas Kennedy spoke, Sirhan, in a blue prison uniform with a paper towel folded like a handkerchief and tucked into his pocket, smiled as Kennedy spoke. Sirhan said he had learned to control his anger and was committed to living peacefully.\n\nBobby Kennedy addresses campaign workers moments before being shot in Los Angeles in 1968.

I will always look to safety and peace and non-violence.\u201d\n\nSome Kennedy family members, Los Angeles law enforcement officers and the public submitted letters opposing Sirhan\u2019s release, parole board commissioner Robert Barton said at the start of the proceeding, which was held virtually.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a DA here but I have to consider all sides,\u201d Barton said.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian from Jordan, has served 53 years. He has acknowledged he was angry at Kennedy for his support of Israel. When asked how he feels about the Middle East conflict today, Sirhan broke down crying and temporarily couldn\u2019t speak.\n\n\u201cTake a few deep breaths,\u201d said Barton, who noted the conflict had not gone away and still touched a nerve.\n\nSirhan said he doesn\u2019t follow what\u2019s going on in the region but thinks about the suffering of refugees.\n\n\u201cThe misery that those people are experiencing. It\u2019s painful,\u201d Sirhan said.\n\nIf released, Sirhan could be deported to Jordan. Barton said he was concerned he might become a \u201csymbol or lightning rod to foment more violence\u201d.\n\nSirhan said he was too old to be involved in the Middle East conflict and would detach himself from it.\n\n\u201cThe same argument can be said or made that I can be a peacemaker, and a contributor to a friendly nonviolent way of resolving the issue,\u201d Sirhan said.\n\nPaul Schrade, who was wounded in the shooting, also spoke in favor of his release. Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spoken in favor of Sirhan\u2019s release in the past, wrote in favor of parole.\n\nSirhan was sentenced to death but that sentence was commuted to life when the California supreme court briefly outlawed capital punishment in 1972. At his last parole hearing in 2016, commissioners concluded after more than three hours of intense testimony that Sirhan did not show adequate remorse or understand the enormity of his crime.\n\nSirhan has stuck to his account that he does not remember the killing."}, {"url": "https://murderpedia.org/male.S/s/sirhan-sirhan.htm", "page_content": "Murderpedia has thousands of hours of work behind it.

Kennedy died after being shot in the dimly lit kitchen of a Los Angeles hotel.\n\n>> Read more trending news\n\nKennedy\u2019s killer confronted him in the heady moments after the senator had scored a victory in the all-important California Democratic primary during the race for president of the United States in 1968.\n\nIt was there that Kennedy\u2019s dream of being the next president would end with a bullet to the head.\n\nHis assassin, Sirhan B. Sirhan, was 24. He was a young man who struggled not only with the violence he saw firsthand as a child in the Middle East but also with finding his place as an adult in one of the most seminal decades in U.S. history.\n\nThe course of history would change just after midnight on June 5, 1968, as the two came face-to-face in the Ambassador Hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry.\n\nWho is Sirhan and why did he shoot Kennedy? Here\u2019s what you may not know about him.\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born into a Christian family in the Palestinian section of Jerusalem in 1944. By the time he turned 3, witnessing violent clashes stemming from the war for Israeli independence was a daily occurrence.\n\nHis mother, Mary, said that as a youngster Sirhan had seen a man ripped to pieces by a bomb during an attack in his neighborhood. The image haunted her son, she said, and he would never be the same.\n\nWhen he was 12, his family emigrated to the United States on a special visa granted to Palestinian refugees. The family stayed briefly in New York and then moved on to California where Sirhan attended junior high, high school and community college.\n\nHis faith was important to him, according to his mother. He even complained to her once that children of his age did not take religion seriously enough.\n\nHe joined the Baptist church and was briefly a Seventh-day Adventist. In 1966, two years before he would kill Kennedy, he turned to an occult organization called the Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosae Crucis, or the Rosicrucians. The organization studies mystical and philosophical doctrines and how they apply to modern life.\n\nSirhan never settled into a career but held a series of menial jobs. At one point, he was working at the Santa Anita racetrack, and at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 115 pounds, he had hopes of one day becoming a jockey. That plan had not panned out, and by the end of May 1968, Sirhan was adrift with no job prospects.\n\nPhotographer David Hume Kennerly on memories of RFK on 55th anniversary of his assassinationhttps://t.co/jpOrlSSQXY \u2014 Mike Mathews @memathews@twit.social (@memathews) June 6, 2023\n\nKilling Kennedy\n\nLate on June 4, 1968, election returns in the California and South Dakota Democratic primaries for president were counted and Kennedy was declared the winner. As the people who had been crammed into the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles cheered, Kennedy\u2019s victory speech recalled the themes that had propelled him to victory that night \u2013 resetting the moral compass of the country, the fight against poverty and hunger in the United States, peace in Vietnam.\n\nFrom the stage, he acknowledged supporters by name and thanked volunteers \u2013 many of them in their late teens and 20s \u2013 who had worked hard for him in California, a state vital to his run for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cMy thanks to all of you. Now it\u2019s on to Chicago and let\u2019s win there,\u201d Kennedy said to the crowd.\n\nWhile Kennedy was ending his speech in the ballroom, Sirhan was in the hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry area with a .22-caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet handgun in his pocket. Two hotel employees would later say they saw Sirhan near the service elevator close to the door that leads into the Embassy Ballroom as Kennedy came down earlier to give his victory speech.\n\nAccording to Jesus Perez and Martin Petrusky, Sirhan asked if Kennedy would be returning through the kitchen area, the same way as he had gone to the stage. Petrusky and Perez told him they did not know. Both men remembered that Sirhan lingered around the elevator area as Kennedy spoke from the stage.\n\nIt was not the first time Sirhan had been in the hotel, according to testimony at his trial. The prosecution was able to place him there on June 3, two days before Kennedy was shot. According to testimony, he was noticed by someone who worked at the Ambassador because he seemed to be out of place.\n\nTwo days before he was spotted at the hotel, Sirhan visited the Lock, Stock \u2018N Barrel gun shop, according to testimony. He purchased two boxes of .22-caliber hollow-point bullets. Early on June 4, hours before he would confront Kennedy in the hotel kitchen, he visited the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club to practice at its gun range.\n\nSirhan was waiting with the gun in the service area as Kennedy finished speaking. Kennedy was led off the stage, through a door and down a hallway toward the Colonial Room of the hotel where the press was waiting to talk to him.\n\nAccording to witnesses, Kennedy was moving slowly through the pantry, shaking hands with some of the people who worked there. Kennedy reached out to shake the hand of a busboy, Juan Romero, when Sirhan, smiling, moved toward Kennedy, planted his right foot, raised his arm and shouted \u201cKennedy, you son of a bitch,\u201d and began shooting.\n\nKennedy was hit three times \u2014 one bullet went into his armpit, a second hit him in the back and the third went into the back of his head behind his right ear. A fourth bullet tore a hole in his jacket. He fell to the floor bleeding as those in his entourage, including former NFL star Rosey Grier, writer George Plimpton, Olympic track star Rafer Johnson, journalist Pete Hamill and others, wrestled Sirhan down, pried the gun from his hand, grabbed him up and slammed him down on some metal steaming tables.\n\n\u201cLet me explain!\u201d Sirhan screamed. \u201cI can explain. I did it for my country. I love my country.\u201d\n\nBefore the gun was wrested from his hand, five others in the pantry \u2014 Paul Schrade, William Weisel, Ira Goldstein, Elizabeth Evans and Irwin Stroll \u2014 were shot. All five would recover from their wounds.\n\nRomero, an Ambassador busboy, knelt to help Kennedy, who was on the floor, bleeding from his head and back. According to Romero, he bent down to hear Kennedy reportedly ask, \u201cIs everybody OK?\u201d Romero told The Los Angeles Times, \u201cI told him \u2018Yes, everybody\u2019s OK\u2019. And then he turned away from me and said, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThose were the last words he spoke. Kennedy died about 26 hours later, having never regained consciousness.\n\n\u201cSomeone said he\u2019s been shot!\u201d 55 yrs ago today. Chaos at the Ambassador Hotel as Sen. Robert F.

In the spiral notebook showed evidence of a growing rage against all Zionists, with Kennedy\u2019s name mentioned throughout.\n\nOne entry even named the date by which Sirhan said Kennedy should die. The date was June 5, the day Kennedy was shot. June 5, 1968, was the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt, Jordan and Syria.\n\nSirhan was angry with Kennedy for his support of Israel and his support for the U.S. selling jet fighters to Israel. He said he had made the decision to kill Kennedy after he heard him say in a speech in the spring of 1968 that he would support giving the planes to Israel.\n\nThe entry on May 18, 1968, read, \u201cMy determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th.\u201d Other entries more hauntingly read, \u201cdie, die, die, die, die.\u201d\n\nCaught, confessed, convicted\n\nSirhan refused to speak or to identify himself after he was taken into custody in the hotel\u2019s pantry that night. It wasn\u2019t until June 9, four days after the shooting, that he confessed to police that he was the one who shot Kennedy. Despite the confession, Sirhan pleaded not guilty in court.\n\nThe trial was set for January 1969.\n\nOpening statements began in February, and, after a three-month trial in which his defense team argued he was mentally ill, Sirhan was found guilty of Kennedy\u2019s murder. He was sentenced to death in California\u2019s gas chamber.\n\nSirhan testified in his own defense, saying he had no memory of killing Kennedy, and that he had been drunk the night of the shooting. He testified that he had borne no \u201cill-will towards Kennedy.\u201d\n\nAfter three years in prison, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned California\u2019s death penalty law, and Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison. He has remained an inmate of the state of California since.\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy with children and John Glenn at Disneyland two days before 1968 California Presidential primary, fifty-five years ago today: pic.twitter.com/rHEHE93poS \u2014 Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) June 3, 2023\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThrough the years, Sirhan changed aspects of his story in some ways but has always repeated the claim that he does not remember what took place in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel.\n\nConspiracy theories were born even as Sirhan was being restrained in the moments after the shooting According to Hamill, someone yelled as Sirhan was being slammed onto the table, \u201cDon\u2019t kill him. Don\u2019t kill him. No Jack Ruby!\u201d\n\nMany thought Sirhan a patsy, the same thing Lee Harvey Oswald called himself following JFK\u2019s assassination. They said larger forces used him as a cover so someone else could kill another Kennedy.\n\nIn 2011, Sirhan\u2019s lawyers claimed in court papers that he had been speaking to and had been hypnotized by a psychiatrist. According to the filings, Sirhan revealed that while he shot Kennedy, he had not killed him and that he had seen a flash from the gun of the person who did kill him. The flash came from behind Kennedy, Sirhan said under hypnosis.\n\nOne of his attorneys said Sirhan also revealed under hypnosis that a \u201cgirl in the polka-dot dress\u201d tapped or pinched him on the arm and that when that happened he was conditioned to believe that he was on a weapons firing range and he was to begin firing.\n\nUnder hypnosis, he remembered meeting the girl that night and that she led him to the pantry, according to an Associated Press report.\n\n\u201cI am trying to figure out how to hit on her.... That\u2019s all that I can think about,\u201d he said in one interview cited in the documents. \u201cI was fascinated with her looks .... She never said much. It was very erotic. I was consumed by her. She was a seductress with an unspoken unavailability.\u201d\n\nWhen he was not under hypnosis, he remembered nothing about the shooting, according to his attorneys.\n\nSirhan\u2019s defense team in 1969 claimed Kennedy\u2019s autopsy proved that he could not have killed the senator because the fatal shot entered his head from behind his right ear. Sirhan was standing in front of Kennedy.\n\nIn a parole hearing in 2016, Paul Schrade, one of the five other people injured in the shooting, apologized to Sirhan for not helping him before by testifying at his parole hearings. It was the first time Schrade had seen Sirhan since 1969. Schrade said the evidence clearly showed a second gunman had been in the kitchen pantry.\n\n\u201cI should have been here long ago and that\u2019s why I feel guilty for not being here to help you and to help me,\u201d Schrade said in the hearing.\n\nSchrade since called for the investigation into Kennedy\u2019s shooting be reopened.\n\nOther conspiracy theories claim:\n\nThe CIA was involved in Kennedy\u2019s death. According to a story in the Guardian, a CIA agent named David Morales once bragged to friends while talking about the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, \u201cI was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.\u201d\n\nStill, others have wondered how Sirhan shot Kennedy in the back if he was standing in front of him as he fired the gun. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2005 that Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi found: \u201cEyewitnesses put Sirhan no closer than 18 inches from Kennedy, but Noguchi testified that when the fatal wound was inflicted the gun was 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches from Kennedy\u2019s ear. His testimony fed conspiracy theories that Sirhan had not acted alone.\u201d \u201cBased solely on the examination of the remains and the scene afterwards, I came to the conclusion that Senator Bobby Kennedy was shot by a small caliber gun from the right side of the back of the head,\u201d Noguchi said.\n\nA radio reporter recorded the sound of 13 shots being fired in the pantry. Sirhan\u2019s gun held only eight bullets.\n\nAn actress and Kennedy campaign volunteer, Nina Rhodes-Hughes, was in the pantry when the shooting started and she reported to the FBI that she heard anywhere from 12-14 shots that night. \u201cThere were at least 12, maybe 14. And I know there were because I heard the rhythm in my head,\u201d Rhodes-Hughes told CNN in 2012. She says she believes senior FBI officials altered statements she made to the agents to \u201cconform with what they wanted the public to believe, period.\u201d\n\nAccording to some witnesses, a security guard standing behind Kennedy at the time was seen drawing his weapon. That man, Thane Cesar, later passed a polygraph test that included questions about whether he shot Kennedy.\n\nThrough the years other theories have been advanced and even members of Kennedy\u2019s family have wondered if the right man is in prison for the assassination. Robert Kennedy\u2019s son, Robert Kennedy Jr., told The Washington Post that he believes that there were two shooters in the kitchen pantry that night. \u201cThere were too many bullets,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire 13 shots out of an eight-shot gun.\u201d\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. is running for president in 2024."}, {"url": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/02/sirhan-sirhan-robert-kennedy-assassination-508476", "page_content": "To understand that resonance, the best starting point is June 4, 1968, when California was staging a bare-knuckled presidential primary that Bobby knew would decide whether he had a political future. With the polls staying open until 8, election results came in slowly and differently on each network. CBS had Kennedy ahead. NBC was less sure. But buoyed by unprecedented turnouts and majorities in Black and Mexican American districts, Bobby scored a clear-cut victory with 46.3 percent of the vote, compared to 41.8 for Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy and 12 percent for unpledged delegates. That was enough for Bobby to go on TV and quietly claim victory, and for journalists and friends gathered across the hall to start the party.\n\nSen. Eugene McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 7, 1965. | AP Photo/Henry Griffin\n\nFor the first time since he\u2019d jumped in late to the race, Bobby believed he could do it. The dream \u2014 \u201cmake room for the next leader of the free world,\u201d he\u2019d tease as he sprinted from hotel showers wrapped in a towel \u2014 seemed less distant following the win in California and another that day in South Dakota. Battle plans were being charted that very night for the campaign ahead. There\u2019d be a single-minded press in his adopted state of New York. A full-page ad in The New York Times would feature photos of AFL-CIO boss George Meany and segregationist Governor Lester Maddox of Georgia \u2014 both staunchly anti-Bobby \u2014 asking rhetorically whether insiders like them should be allowed to pick the next president. The candidate would head overseas next, showing his gravitas by meeting with the Pope and foreign leaders. Nobody, least of all Bobby, minimized the obstacles remaining. But he knew the threat was over from McCarthy, whose defining and sole issue was opposing the Vietnam War. The only one who could deny him the nomination was Vice President Hubert Humphrey, or, as the comedian and mock presidential candidate Pat Paulsen had dubbed him earlier that evening, Herbert Humphrey. \u201cI\u2019m going to chase Herbert\u2019s ass all over the country,\u201d Bobby vowed.\n\nBefore he went anywhere, Bobby took a quiet moment. Sitting on the floor of his hotel room, arms around his knees, he lit a victory cigar and contemplated. At the start he hadn\u2019t been sure whether he was running as Joe Kennedy\u2019s son, Jack\u2019s brother, or President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s avowed enemy. He still was all of those, but had found a voice and two uncomplicated motivations of his own: to end the war and end poverty. Both were doable, he told himself, as aides pressed him to head down to the ballroom. Legions of restless believers were there singing \u201cThis Land Is Your Land,\u201d the Woody Guthrie ballad that Bobby had promised to make America\u2019s anthem.\n\nHis valedictory speech began with a nod to Don Drysdale, the Los Angeles Dodgers ace \u201cwho pitched his sixth straight shutout tonight, and I hope that we have as good fortune in our campaign.\u201d (Bobby was one of the few men in America who actually didn\u2019t know who the future Hall of Famer was.) Then he got serious: \u201cI think we can end the divisions within the United States . . . whether it\u2019s between Blacks and whites, between the poor and the more affluent, or between age groups, or over the war in Vietnam.\u201d The crowd loved it, shouting \u201cBobby Power!\u201d He ended on another light note, saying that \u201cMayor Yorty has just sent me a message that we\u2019ve been here too long already. So my thanks to all of you, and on to Chicago, and let\u2019s win there.\u201d Giving a thumbs-up, then flashing the V-for-victory sign, he turned to leave for a reception on a lower level followed by a press conference.\n\nBut plans had changed. Aides decided to skip the reception and go directly to the press conference, where reporters were eager to file their stories. The shortest route was the way he\u2019d come in, through the waiters\u2019 swinging doors and into the kitchen and pantry. In the pushing of the crowd, Bobby got separated from ex-FBI agent Bill Barry, his devoted and solitary bodyguard, who was helping Kennedy\u2019s pregnant wife Ethel off the podium. Nobody worried, since the candidate was among friends, with a busboy reaching for his hand as a cluster of reporters, photographers, and aides trailed behind. Past the rusty ice machine, 30 feet from the media room, a curly-haired young man wearing a pale blue sweatshirt was standing unnoticed on a low tray stacker, waiting for his opening. It was shortly after midnight and Andrew West, a reporter for the Mutual Radio Network, was asking Bobby his plans for catching up to Humphrey\u2019s delegate lead. Bobby: \u201cIt just goes back to the struggle for it . . .\u201d\n\nThat was as far as he got. The shooter stepped from his hiding place, reached straight ahead with his right arm, and started firing a .22-caliber revolver. A single shot was followed by a volley \u2013 pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop. Just how many shots were fired, at what range and angle, would become grist for another assassination conspiracy mill. Bobby lurched against the ice machine, then sagged to the ground, lying face-up on the grimy concrete floor. He was conscious, eyes wide open, as blood oozed behind his right ear. \u201cIs everybody okay?\u201d he whispered. The busboy, Juan Romero, placed rosary beads in Bobby\u2019s hand and tried to cushion his head as Ethel pleaded with the pressing crowd to \u201cgive him room to breathe.\u201d Then she turned to her husband and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m with you, my baby.\u201d The scene was bedlam. \u201cGet the gun,\u201d pleaded West, the radio man. \u201cYou monster! You\u2019ll die for this!\u201d a kitchen worker yelled from his perch atop the steam table. The only one who seemed serene was Bobby himself \u2014 \u201ca kind of sweet accepting smile on his face,\u201d recalled the journalist and Kennedy friend Pete Hamill, \u201cas if he knew it would all end this way.\u201d\n\nMedics finally arrived, and as the ambulance drove away, campaign volunteers sobbed and prayed as a large man pounded a hotel pillar with his bloody right fist, shouting the questions being echoed across America: \u201cWhy, God, why? Why again? Why another Kennedy?\u201d\n\nThe next 25 hours were a hellish whirlwind. Police, who showed up at the hotel about fifteen minutes after the shooting, quickly assembled evidence that the gunman was a 24-year-old Palestinian with the improbable name Sirhan Sirhan who hated Israel and hated the Kennedys for supporting Israel. His shooting spree wounded five others along with Bobby, whose wounds were recognized from the first to be life-threatening. Friends rounded up the children. 12-year-old son David, who\u2019d always been scared to death that his father would be shot like Uncle Jack, learned by watching the election-night proceedings on TV that his nightmare had come true. Kerry, who was just 8, woke early the following morning to watch Bugs Bunny; \u201ca news flash interrupted the cartoon,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s how I learned my father had been shot.\u201d\n\nSirhan Sirhan is escorted by his attorney from the Los Angeles county jail chapel to enter his plea to the charge of murder in the assassination of RFK. | AP Photo/George Brich\n\nAt two o\u2019clock the following morning campaign press secretary Frank Mankiewicz appeared in the media room across from the hospital with the announcement everyone dreaded. \u201cSenator Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1:44 a.m. today, June 6, 1968 \u2026 He was 42 years old.\u201d Back at the Ambassador Hotel, a red rose marked the spot on the blood-stained pantry floor where the senator was felled. On the wall above was a hand-lettered cardboard sign that might have been up for weeks but seemed especially appropriate now: \u201cThe Once and Future King.\u201d\n\n53 years later, the question still haunts: While Bobby never was the king, could he have been? Research I did for my biography of this iconic Kennedy convinces me the answer is a resounding yes.\n\nThat evidence begins with what Bobby really meant that night when he uttered \u201con to Chicago.\u201d Journalists and most everyone else assumed he was referring to that summer\u2019s Democratic Convention in the Windy City, but this last progressive icon was a master political maestro, and he wasn\u2019t about to wait until August. What he actually was signaling is that he intended to stop in Chicago on his way from Los Angeles back East, and to meet quietly with Mayor Richard J. Daley, who\u2019d help Jack Kennedy win the White House eight years before. \u201cI would say there was a 70 percent chance he was going to endorse him,\u201d says Bill Daley, son of the legendary mayor and chief of staff to President Obama, who was privy to and told me about the planned rendezvous. \u201cThen the momentum would have shifted to where other people like my dad who were still left would have been hard pressed not to go there.\u201d\n\nBobby knew that Humphrey was counting not on primary voters but on kingmakers like Daley to anoint him the nominee. I think RFK was right about the way to upend the vice president\u2019s plans and nail down the nomination for himself. Daley would woo other Democratic leaders into the Kennedy camp, justifying the move by pointing to Bobby\u2019s wide margin over Humphrey among actual voters. The party would then unite behind a Kennedy-Humphrey ticket much as it had four years before behind former adversaries JFK and LBJ. And the Chicago convention would have had none of the angry left-wing riots that ended up dooming Humphrey\u2019s campaign and leading to a bitter third-party bid by George Wallace, who captured 13.5 percent of the vote in an election where Nixon edged Humphrey by just 0.7 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s not history\u2019s conventional version of what would have come next, but it is the read of crucial insiders from back then. \u201cHad Bobby lived,\u201d said Humphrey, \u201cI think there\u2019d have been a Democrat in the White House.\u201d And on that night of the California primary, Nixon told his family, \u201cIt sure looks like we\u2019ll be going against Bobby.\u201d Nixon knew that it was Bobby even more than Jack, who\u2019d orchestrated the Kennedy win over him in 1960, and that nobody was better situated than Bobby to answer Nixon and Wallace on fighting crime and restitching the social safety net into a trampoline.\n\nMichael Harrington was contemplating that and more as he looked out the window of the 21-car train that carried Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s corpse from his funeral in New York to his burial in Washington that sticky Saturday afternoon in June 1968. Girl Scouts lined the Penn Central tracks next to Little Leaguers. Factory workers stood alongside rag pickers and nuns, stretching on tiptoes to see. Husbands embraced sobbing wives. They arrived in yellow pick-up trucks and flotillas of boats, wearing Bermuda shorts and hair curlers, tossing roses. Outside Newark, three firemen saluted from the deck of their vessel, The John F. Kennedy. There were brass bands, police bands, school bands, and Catholic bands. Hands were cupped in prayer or held over hearts, hats off.\n\nIt was Bobby\u2019s America, and Harrington couldn\u2019t keep from staring. \u201cEvery time I did, I began to cry. The sorrowing faces along the way were a mirror of my own feelings,\u201d said the author whose writings helped launch the War on Poverty and who saw Bobby as \u201cthe man who actually could have changed the course of American history.\u201d As for those with him inside the rail cars \u2014 politicians of the old school and new, intellectuals and trade unionists, Black, Irish, Chicano, and Jewish citizens \u2014 they were, said Harrington, \u201cthe administration of Robert Kennedy that was never going to be.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/robert-kennedy-murdered-sirhan-sirhan", "page_content": "On June 5, 1968, after scoring a major victory in winning the California primary, Robert F.

Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. He received the death penalty, but the sentence was later commuted to life.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem. In 1948 Jordan took control of East Jerusalem and what is now the West Bank, and the following year it granted citizenship to people living in those areas. It is believed that this is how Sirhan became a Jordanian citizen. In the 1950s, he and his family moved to the United States and eventually settled in Pasadena, California. There he attended Pasadena City College and later held odd jobs, notably working at a horse stable and later at a health food store.\n\nDuring this time, Sirhan became vocal in his opposition to Israel, especially after the Six-Day War (June 1967), in which the country seized control of various territories, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Old City of Jerusalem. Sirhan began directing his anger at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who expressed support for Israel while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. On June 4, Kennedy won the California primary, and shortly after midnight, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. As he left through a service pantry, Kennedy was fatally shot; he died on June 6. In addition, five bystanders were wounded. Sirhan was apprehended at the scene\u2014tackled by George Plimpton, Rosey Grier, and others\u2014and he reportedly said, \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d The attack took place on the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan later claimed he was unable to remember the shooting, saying that he was intoxicated at the time. However, during his 1969 trial, he admitted to having committed the crime, though he later said that his statements were the result of his defense attorney\u2019s making him think he was guilty. On April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder, and several days later he was given the death sentence. When California abolished capital punishment in 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life. His efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories surrounded Kennedy\u2019s assassination. One of the most notable concerned the belief that there was a second gunman. On an audio tape of the shooting, 13 shots are reportedly heard, though Sirhan\u2019s revolver had only 8 rounds. In addition, at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing, one of those wounded in the attack testified that a different gunman had shot Kennedy. The parole board, however, was not swayed by the claims, and Sirhan was again denied release. In 2021 he faced the board for the 16th time. The panel\u2014which was operating under recent reforms that required it to consider age, health, and other factors\u2014recommended that he be freed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, however, denied his parole in 2022."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2021-08-30/sirhan-sirhan-robert-f-kennedy-essential-california", "page_content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It\u2019s Monday, August 30. I\u2019m Justin Ray.\n\nOn Friday, the world learned that the man who gunned down Sen. Robert F. Kennedy might get released, sparking uproar and confusion.\n\nThe news was surprising to me for three reasons: (1) There was a lot of evidence he did the crime. Back in 1968, a 24-year-old Sirhan Sirhan was captured at the scene with a .22-caliber handgun in his hand. Three weeks before the shooting, he wrote a manifesto calling for Kennedy\u2019s death. (2) He had also previously been denied parole 15 times. (3) And I\u2019ll even say it: The victim wasn\u2019t just some person on the street; he assassinated a Kennedy. It felt like in terms of uphill battles, this was Mt. Everest covered in oil.\n\nYet here we are, with Sirhan, now 77, recommended for parole after serving more than 50 years in prison . It doesn\u2019t guarantee he will be released, but it is a big step in his quest for freedom. The Times has reported on how the case has split the Kennedy family , a curious detail in an autopsy report about the position of the gunshot wound that has fueled conspiracy theories, and background on Sirhan\u2019s legal battle for freedom . But we haven\u2019t talked about Sirhan\u2019s life.\n\nIn my quest to understand Sirhan, I have read magazine articles, a book by investigative journalist Dan E. Moldea , and listened to a podcast series. Here is a condensed overview of his early years, including an incident that appears to have changed his personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born March 19, 1944 in Jerusalem, Palestine. As a child, it\u2019s likely he witnessed violence from the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. \u201cThere was probably a tremendous amount of trauma when Sirhan was small. There were villages being wiped out,\u201d Moldea\u2019s book quotes Sergeant Mike Nielsen as saying.\n\nIn 1956, the Sirhan family applied and qualified for U.S. visas as Palestinian refugees. They eventually moved to Pasadena. His father \u2014 described as a \u201cstrict disciplinarian, who beat young Sirhan\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t adapt to life in America and eventually abandoned his family. A high school teacher described Sirhan as having a \u201clanguage handicap,\u201d but said that he was \u201ccooperative [and] well-mannered.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating, he enrolled in Pasadena City College in fall of 1963, but he had poor attendance. The next year, he began coming home immediately after classes to care for his sister, Aida, who had leukemia. She died in March 1965 at the age of 29. Three months later, he dropped out of college.\n\nDuring the fall of 1965, Sirhan started working at Santa Anita racetrack. While there, he trained to be a jockey. The book says a foreman at the ranch told the LAPD, \u201cSirhan was a poor horse rider and was constantly being thrown or falling from horses that he was working.\u201d He quit in March 1966. Months later, he began working for Granja Vista del Rio Thoroughbred Horse Farm, near Corona. It was here that an incident would change his life.\n\nOn a foggy morning on Sept. 25, 1966, Sirhan fell from a mare named Hy-Vera, according to an article by Playboy . \u201cSirhan was thrown against a metal post, where he lay crumpled, crying and bleeding,\u201d wrote James McKinley. Sirhan later received a $2,000 settlement over the incident.\n\nThe accident had lasting health effects on Sirhan. In a podcast series created by the writers behind the popular HBO series \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s younger brother discussed how his personality changed: \u201cHe wanted to be by himself. It\u2019s kind of hard to put into words. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered. He was a little more irritable,\u201d Munir Sirhan said (On a side note, I\u2019ve noticed that many notorious killers experienced brain injuries during their childhoods, including California\u2019s Richard Ramirez and Glen Edward Rogers ).\n\nTwo years later, Sirhan would carry out the assassination, and RFK would become the third Kennedy son to die violently. Sirhan told The Times in 1985 : \u201cI originally had admired Sen. Kennedy. He was for the poor and downtrodden. He seemed to be for justice. But then he did things to support Israel, including backing the sending of 50 Phantom jets to Israel that I knew would be used to attack my people. It enraged me, I admit that.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to his potential release, parole staff still have 90 days to review Sirhan\u2019s case. After that, Gov.

Kennedy was the hope of the world and I injured, and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that,\u201d Sirhan said. \u201cI\u2019m still responsible for being there and probably causing this whole incident, through my own gun or other guns.\u201d\n\nAnd now, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening across California:\n\nNote: Some of the sites we link to may limit the number of stories you can access without subscribing.\n\nWhat we know about the five California service members killed in Kabul airport blast.

Robert F. Kennedy, with his attorney Russell E. Parsons in Los Angeles.\n\nThere was never really a question about whether Sirhan Sirhan killed Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.\n\nHe admitted to opening fire, and there were multiple witnesses to the terror at the Ambassador Hotel. Earlier he had written a manifesto calling for Kennedy\u2019s death.\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the parole review period. It is 120 days\n\nBut for decades now, Sirhan has tried to gain freedom, using a variety of arguments. And along the way, his cause has gained some unexpected supporters, along with conspiracy theories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet time after time, the Parole Board rejected his requests. Until Friday.\n\nThe board recommended his release Friday, in part after receiving letters of support from two members of the slain senator\u2019s family, including his son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The move sparks a 120-day review period by parole staff. After that, Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 or whoever might replace him in next month\u2019s recall election \u2014 could still decide to block Sirhan\u2019s release.\n\nHere is a look at the 50-year road to this moment:\n\nSirhan Sirhan at a parole hearing in 2016 at the Richard J.

(Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe late Times photographer Boro Yaro witnessed the assassination and described it this way:\n\nWhen the shooting started I thought someone was tossing firecrackers because I was being hit in the face with debris. I grew up playing with fireworks, and this was not an unusual thing to happen.\n\nThen the crowd parted, and I watched in horror as Sirhan emptied his revolver at Robert Kennedy. I had my camera at chest level, but I didn\u2019t make a photo during the shooting. It was dark, and I think I was afraid.\n\nWhen the shooting stopped there was a pregnant pause, and then two men, one in a tuxedo, grabbed Sirhan and forced him face down on a metal countertop and shook his revolver loose.\n\nSirhan kept trying to reach the revolver, and I was afraid he might get it, so I stuck my hand in under the guys holding him and picked up the gun.\n\nI turned away from the scuffle and was thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s warm. The gun is warm,\u201d and all of a sudden it was taken from me. I didn\u2019t see who grabbed it, but I saw the back end of a sport coat and figured it might be a cop.\n\nWhen I turned back to the scene, RFK was slowly sinking to the floor, and I realized I had better make pictures.\n\nPallbearers carry the coffin of Sen.

(Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images)\n\nSirhan Sirhan\u2019s claims\n\nIn 1985, The Times published an in-depth series of interviews with Sirhan Sirhan, in which he took responsibility for the assassination and said there was no conspiracy.\n\nSpeaking to Times reporter Bill Farr, he described what he insisted was a random series of events that led him to the Ambassador Hotel that night:\n\nRecalling the assassination, Sirhan said: \u201cThat whole evening is fuzzy. I remember some things but I honestly have no recollection to this day of firing at Kennedy or shouting \u2018You son of a bitch\u2019 at him. That part is a total blank.\u201d\n\nSirhan, who is now 41, says his time in the Ambassador is \u201cpretty much a blur.\u201d He remembers the dizzying effect of the hotel\u2019s mirrored hallways, compounded by the effect of the drinks he had consumed earlier in the evening. He says he initially went to the hotel \u201cto get some coffee to help sober me up.\u201d\n\nIf he had no memory of the shooting, Sirhan was asked by a reporter, what was the last thing he remembers?\n\n\u201cThis is a funny thing. What I remember, in my confused state, was a typewriter typing without anybody doing the typing. Now I know that I was in the press room and what I was looking at was a Teletype machine. There was a lady there who saw me and told police that I seemed to be in a trance. That report, by the way, couldn\u2019t be found at the time of my trial but I understand they found it later.\u201d\n\nSirhan said his first recollection after the shooting is of \u201cbeing choked by someone. I thought I was going to be choked to death. Then I remember someone prying that person\u2019s hold off my throat. I think the person who did the prying that saved me was Roosevelt Grier. I thought I was going to die right there.\u201d\n\nSirhan talked about the many \u201cifs\u201d that might have altered the tragic outcome of that evening.\n\n\u201cI had planned to go to the races that day but because the track was closed, I ended up having the whole day free. If the horses had been running, I would not have ended up downtown at all.\u201d\n\nWhen he learned the track was closed, he went to a private firing range and practiced shooting with the .22-caliber pistol that he had purchased months earlier.\n\nHe then went to the Wilshire area with some thoughts of disrupting or at least heckling at a parade scheduled to observe the anniversary of the Six Day War, which had ended in a devastating defeat for the Arabs as Israel captured the Sinai, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem.\n\nHe insists that he did not even know that Kennedy was going to be at the Ambassador.\n\n\u201cThey claim I was lying in wait. How could that be? I did not know what way he was coming out. In fact, only a last-minute decision by a Secret Service man prompted Kennedy to leave through the kitchen. There is another \u2018if.\u2019 If the Secret Service man had not suddenly changed the route, our paths would not have crossed. Kennedy would not be dead and I would not be in prison.\u201d\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Inspiration Park (Ricardo DeAratanha / Los Angeles Times)\n\nConspiracy theories, new obsessions\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the assassination, The Times published a look at how the assassination still reverberated. The story included efforts by Sirhan and his supporters for a new trial:\n\nSirhan and his supporters point to what they say is intriguing new ballistics evidence and say it could either clear Sirhan or at least implicate a second gunman. They are particularly captivated by forensic evidence suggesting that the bullets that killed Kennedy were fired at point-blank range, an important fact because witnesses say Sirhan did not get that close to the senator.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they accuse the Los Angeles Police Department of wantonly mishandling and cavalierly destroying evidence. Some of Sirhan\u2019s most aggressive backers go so far as to implicate the department in an active cover-up \u2014 making police accessories after the fact to one of the most traumatic criminal acts of the 1960s.\n\nOther veterans of the period, however, say that they are confident the right man is spending his life behind bars for the crime.\n\n\u201cThese conspiracy people have exhausted their remedies,\u201d snorted Ed Davis, the retired LAPD chief who was a deputy chief at the time of the killing. \u201cImmediately after the assassination, the conspiracy theorists came up with implausible hypotheses. The Board of Police Commissioners ... listened patiently for months and months but decided there was nothing to them.\u201d\n\nSirhan Sirhan is sworn in during a parole hearing on Feb. 10, 2016. (Associated Press )\n\nA new ally\n\nOn the 50th anniversary, RFK\u2019s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., emerged raising new theories and questions. \u201cAlthough Sirhan was captured at the scene with a .22-caliber handgun in his hand and later admitted that he shot Kennedy, new evidence has emerged over the years that suggests there may have been as many as 13 shots fired that night. Sirhan\u2019s gun held only eight bullets,\u201d The Times reported.\n\n\u201cI was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father,\u201d Kennedy told the Washington Post in 2018. \u201cMy father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country. I think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nAuthorities rejected Kennedy\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cHis comments are just way off base,\u201d said Russell Iungerich, who worked as a deputy attorney general for the state of California when officials reopened the Kennedy case from 1975 to 1976.\n\n\u201cWhen you add up all the evidence produced at the hearings, there\u2019s no way you can configure the evidence to say that there was a second gunman. RFK Jr. may believe this because he talked to Sirhan,\u201d he said.\n\nSirhan had worked as a groom at Hollywood Park and he was kicked in the head by a horse which created some brain damage, Iungerich said, \u201cand he had some delusional thinking about RFK.\u201d\n\nA long quest for freedom\n\nSirhan has repeatedly sought parole and has always been rejected.\n\nIn 2016, he lost his 15th quest for freedom, with the board saying Sirhan did not show adequate remorse or understand the enormity of his crime.\n\nHe was stabbed in a San Diego area prison in 2019.\n\nHe once suggested he simply be allowed to leave America. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d he told the Parole Board in 1987. \u201cis why don\u2019t you just deport me and get me out of your hair?\u201d\n\nLeaving his hearing that year, Sirhan was asked if he thought he would ever be free.\n\n\u201cThe American system of justice,\u201d he said, \u201cwill let me go home in a coffin. I\u2019m abandoning hope.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/590083/the-untold-truth-of-sirhan-sirhan/", "page_content": "The Untold Truth Of Sirhan Sirhan\n\nIn the early morning hours of June 5, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) was making his way through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel (via ABC News). Located in Los Angeles, California, the Ambassador Hotel was playing home to Kennedy and staff for the 1968 presidential primary elections taking place in California. The junior senator for New York at the time, Robert Kennedy's star was clearly on the ascent. Younger brother to President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Robert Kennedy's intent was to pick up where his older brother's work had ended. Unfortunately for Robert \u2014 and the world \u2014 his life would be tragically cut short, as well.\n\nBorn Robert Francis Kennedy on November 20, 1925, Robert was one of eight children born to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. A prominent businessman and politician hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. \u2014 along with his wife Rose \u2014 began a lineage of politicians that is still very much prominent today. Much like his brother John before him, Robert Kennedy became active in politics at an early age.

Robert Francis Kennedy, aged 42, Senator for the State of New York and on his way to become the Democratic candidate in November\u2019s presidential elections, is shot dead by Palestinian refugee Sirhan B. Sirhan.\n\nIn today\u2019s Biographics we will look at Bob Kennedy\u2019s remarkable life achievements, at how he fatally crossed paths with his murderer. And at the sinister theories that may explain one of the most shocking assassinations in American history.\n\nACT I\n\nBobby\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the third boy and seventh out of a total of nine children born to Rose and patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy. Smaller and weaker than his older brothers Joe Jr And John, Bobby was often considered the \u201crunt\u201d of the family, which meant that at least in his early childhood he was much attached to his devout mother, spending much of his time going to church with her.\n\nBut despite having a sweet and pleasant character he showed early on a disposition to fight against the odds and to let his own voice be heard.\n\n\u201cI was the seventh of nine children, and when you come from that far down you have to struggle to survive.\u201d\n\nRobert \u2013 or Bobby, as he was known to his family \u2013 struggled not only at home, but also at school. Due to Joseph Sr\u2019s work-related relocations, including an appointment as Ambassador to London, Bobby had a hard time in adjusting to different schools. He eventually attended 12 different primary and secondary schools in the U.S. and England. But he pulled through, graduating from Milton Academy and later at Harvard, where he proved his mettle as an accomplished varsity football player, despite him being a \u201crunt\u201d and playing with a severely broken leg.\n\nIn 1944, aged 19, Bobby interrupted his studies to serve in the US Navy, being commissioned to a relatively quiet theatre \u2013 the Caribbean \u2013 on anti U-Boot patrolling duties.\n\nThe ship he served on was named after his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr who had been killed in action during the war as a Navy fighter pilot. This tragedy had suddenly shifted the balance of expectations among the Kennedy boys. Now, \u2018Jack\u2019 was suddenly pushed to the fore, and Bobby was to be considered a close \u2018second in command\u2019.\n\nIn 1945, with WWII over, Bobby was able to pursue more pleasing interests and he was dating Patricia Skakel, the daughter of a railroad clerk turned coal magnate. Until he met and fell in love with one of his sister Jean\u2019s best friends, a younger girl called Ethel. Who happened to be Patricia\u2019s sister. We have no records, but we are going to guess Christmas 1945 must have been a pretty awkward one at the Skakels\u2019 \u2026\n\nBut Bobby and Ethel made a nice couple, had common interests and even worked together on Jack\u2019s campaign for the Congress in 1946. This was the first of many occasions in which the future President would rely on Bobby\u2019s trusted advice and support.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Bobby returned to his studies and earned a degree in government from Harvard University in 1948. He completed his education by attaining also a law degree from the University of Virginia three years later. But, as he recalled on many occasions, he considered his most formative experiences to be the conversations at the family dinner table, where Rose and Joe Sr would encourage their children to engage in heated discussions about history and current affairs.\n\nIn June 1950, after a brief engagement, Bobby and Ethel got married. Their first child, Kathleen, was born in 1951, on the 4th of July \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get more patriotic than that. Kathleen would be the first of eleven \u2013 yes, eleven \u2013 children.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn 1952, Bobby made his formal debut on the political stage, by managing his brother John\u2019s campaign to be elected as a Senator for the State of Massachusetts. The campaign was successful and proved that Bobby had a natural talent to organise and to lead.\n\nBut the young Kennedy possessed another talent which would come to the fore in the following year: he was in fact a skilful investigator and prosecutor, and in 1953 he served briefly on the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy was an old family friend \u2013 he had even dated two of the Kennedy girls \u2013 and had hired Bobby to help him on his crackdown on suspected communist infiltrators. Bobby, however, did not agree with McCarthy\u2019s brutal prosecution tactics and left the Subcommittee after only six months. He would later author a report condemning McCarthy\u2019s investigation of alleged Communists in the Army.\n\nBobby did not stop working within the Senate\u2019s investigating committees. By the end of the 1950s he had become Chief Counsel for the Senate Rackets Committee, in charge of investigating corruption in trade unions. This position won him national recognition, particularly because it pitted him directly against the powerful Jimmy Hoffa, president of the Brotherhood of Teamsters, the largest truckers\u2019 union. Hoffa was suspected of colluding with organised crime to further the progress and influence of the Brotherhood and developed a bitter personal feud with Kennedy, which became apparent in some of the televised Committee hearings. Hoffa would later say of Bobby:\n\n\u201cI used to love to bug the little bastard\u201d\n\nAttorney General\n\nIn 1960, Bobby resigned from his Chief Counsel position to better dedicate himself to running John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign. It was in this occasion that Bobby became John\u2019s closest confidante and collaborator. In fact, after being elected to the top office, John appointed Bobby Attorney General in his cabinet.\n\nAs Attorney General, Bobby gained a reputation as the President\u2019s loyal and ruthless enforcer and some of his actions are still controversial, but overall, he won respect for his effective administration of the Department of Justice.\n\nToday he is mostly remembered for two endeavours.\n\nFirst, his fight against organized crime. According to author Seymour Hersh, Joseph Kennedy had enlisted the help of mobster Sam Giancana to support JFK\u2019s presidential campaign. But neither Jack nor Bobby had any interest in maintaining this relationship. When Bobby increased the number of Mafia convictions from 35 to 288 over the three years of Jack\u2019s term, the mob were furious.\n\nAccording to Prof Larry Sabato it took the good offices of Frank Sinatra \u2013 good friends with both the Kennedys and the Mafia \u2013 to appease Giancana: the crooner had to perform eight nights for free at Giancana\u2019s club.\n\nBobby\u2019s second achievement was the enforcement of the 1954 Supreme Court decision on school desegregation, and in general his support of the Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn September 1962, Attorney General Kennedy sent US Marshals and troops to Oxford, Mississippi to enforce a federal court order admitting the first African American student \u2013 James Meredith \u2013 to the University of Mississippi. He also collaborated with the President in proposing the most far-reaching civil rights statute so far in American history, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which passed eight months after JFK\u2019s death.\n\nBobby\u2019s collaboration with his President brother was not limited to Justice. During the September 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, he developed the strategy of blockading Cuba as an alternative to military intervention that could have led to nuclear war.\n\nBut Cuba also marks one of the shadows in the Attorney General\u2019s career.\n\nAfter the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion \u2013 a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro using an ill-prepared force of Cuban exiles \u2013 President Kennedy asked his brother to oversee a clandestine mission, Operation Mongoose, dedicated to removing the Cuban leader once and for all. Bobby invested hundreds of millions of dollars in building secret bases, training spies and planning increasingly bizarre ways to do away with Castro for good. Operation Mongoose is known to have made at least eight failed attempts on the Communist leader\u2019s life, one of which involved CIA operatives hiring a Mafia hitman, Johnny Rosselli. Considering Bobby\u2019s stance against organised crime, this further involvement with the mob is controversial to say the least.\n\nAnother controversial decision involved the Civil Rights movement. Despite the Attorney General\u2019s sympathies towards this movement, in 1963 he approved the installation of wiretaps on Martin Luther King and several of his associates. In this case Bobby relented to lobbying from FBI director J Edgar Hoover who believed Dr King to be a Communist sympathizer, mainly because he had spoken up against the Vietnam War. For more than three years the Bureau would keep King under surveillance and even sent him anonymous threatening letters in the hopes of stopping his social justice campaigns.\n\nOn the 22nd of November 1963 John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas and we invite you to watch our video on JFK to learn more about the facts and theories behind that killing.\n\nLet\u2019s not lose our focus on Bobby: John\u2019s death was a devastating blow for him. Not only he had lost a brother whom he loved dearly, but his years as campaign manager and Attorney General had given him an identity, which was now struggling to find.\n\nHe continued his duties at the Department of Justice under Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency until 1964, but the two never got along well and Bobby quit his job. Instead he ran for the post of US Senator for the State of New York, launching an effective campaign which won him the November election by 719,000 votes.\n\nAs New York\u2019s Senator from January 1965, Bobby dedicated himself to three main causes:\n\nFirst, he strived to supporting the dispossessed and the powerless in America, mainly the urban poor populations, the racial minorities and Native Americans. He sought to remedy the problems of poverty through legislation to encourage private industry to locate in poverty-stricken areas, thus creating jobs for the unemployed, and stressed the importance of work over welfare.\n\nThen, he sought to advance human rights, both in the US and abroad. He was an outspoken critic of the apartheid system in South Africa, visiting the country in 1966 and delivering a memorable speech to an assembly of progressive students\n\n\u201cEach time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring, those ripples build a current\n\nAnd finally, he embarked on a personal quest to end the Vietnam War. Bobby had initially supported President Johnson\u2019s military escalation in Indochina \u2013 until February 1966. This is when he first publicly denounced this policy and asked for the reduction of the war effort, as well as for the initiation of talks with the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese government. He strongly opposed President Johnson\u2019s authorisation of the carpet bombing of civilian targets in North Vietnam, which he denounced in another memorable speech in the Senate:\n\n\u201cAre we like the God of the Old Testament that we can decide, in Washington, DC, what cities, what towns, what hamlets in Vietnam are going to be destroyed?\u2026 Do we have to accept that?\u2026 I do not think we have to. I think we can do something about it.\u201d\n\nOn March 16, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. He would be running on a very progressive platform against the other main Democratic candidate, Hubert Humphrey.\n\nIt was, in the words of author Arthur Schlesinger Jr.,\n\n\u201can uproarious campaign, filled with enthusiasm and fun\u2026 It was also a campaign moving in its sweep and passion.\u201d\n\nIn his campaign Bobby built on the themes that had marked his senatorial term: advancement of human rights, including supporting the Civil Rights movement, helping the dispossessed in the urban areas and the Native American reservations and putting an end to the Vietnam War.\n\nHis candidates were supportive of a broader, safer, more conservative message, and yet Bobby managed to win critical primary elections in Nebraska and Indiana.\n\nAnd it was just before speaking at an Indianapolis rally that Bobby learned of the murder of Martin Luther King. It was the 4th of April 1968, five years since the former Attorney General had approved of the Reverend\u2019s surveillance by the FBI.\n\nThat evening Bobby delivered one his most famous speeches informing the crowd of King\u2019s death and urging them to not react angrily. He concluded by making an appeal for racial unity in those difficult times. Following King\u2019s death, riots broke out in more than 100 cities across the US, but Indianapolis remained peaceful.\n\nAfter securing Nebraska and Indiana, Bobby was looking forward to winning the California primaries in early June. The Democratic candidacy was within his grasp.\n\nAnd so, we are back to the start of our video.\n\nIt\u2019s the night between the 4th and the 5th of June 1968, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles. Robert F. Kennedy has just announced his victory at the California primaries to an ecstatic crowd of supporters. After a brief speech Bobby mingled with the crowd and Hotel staff. According to witnesses, he was moving slowly through the Hotel restaurant\u2019s pantry. When he reached out to shake the hand of a busboy, Juan Romero, a young man stepped out from the crowd, raised his arm and after shouting \u201cKennedy, you son of a bitch!\u201d he began shooting.\n\nThat man was called Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year old Palestinian refugee.\n\nKennedy was hit three times: in his armpit, in the back and behind his right ear. Members of his entourage apprehended Sirhan and slammed him down on a metal table, but he was able to continue shooting, wounding five other by-standers.\n\nAs Kennedy\u2019s friends, which included a professional Football player, struggled to pin down the diminutive Sirhan, he yelled\n\n\u201cLet me explain! I can explain! I did it for my country. I love my country.\u201d\n\nJuan Romero knelt to help Bobby, who was on the floor, bleeding. Kennedy asked\n\n\u201cIs everybody OK?\u201d\n\nRomero replied that \u2018Yes, everybody\u2019s OK\u2019. Bobby then turned away and said\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThose were his last words. Robert Kennedy died 26 hours later, aged 42. His eleventh child, Rory, would be born six months later.\n\nAct II\n\nIt\u2019s time now to examine the life of the man on the other side of the gun. Who was Sirhan Sirhan and what had driven him to murder Robert Kennedy?\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was a Jordanian citizen born on March 19, 1944, in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, into a highly religious family of Arab\u2013Christians. He spent the early few years of his life in his home country and also completed his early schooling there.\n\nIf you know even a little of Middle Eastern history, you may have guessed that being a Palestinian child in the late 1940s did not make for a quiet upbringing, and Sirhan\u2019s childhood was no exception. Following the declaration of Israel as an independent state and the subsequent declaration of war by the surrounding Arab Countries, Sirhan and his family would witness violence on a daily basis.\n\nIn one traumatic experience, Sirhan saw a man being ripped to pieces during a bombing raid in his neighbourhood. His mother, Mary, said that the image haunted her son, and he would never be the same.\n\nAt the age of 12, the Sirhans had the chance to emigrate to the United States, as part of a special visa programme granted to Palestinian refugees. The young Sirhan did not escape completely from a life of violence, though, as his father had a volatile temper and would physically assault him on several occasions.\n\nDespite being an outsider within a dysfunctional family, Sirhan adapted quite well to American life. He first attended the Eliot Junior High School in New York, before the family relocated to California where he enrolled in the Pasadena City College. Sirhan was academically good and proved his worth in both school and college. However, despite having the chance to do so, he never applied for American citizenship and preferred to remain a Jordanian.\n\nAfter graduating from Pasadena, Sirhan drifted from one job to another, never settling into a career and holding a series of menial jobs. The only career prospect he considered seriously was horse racing. At one point, he found himself working as a stable boy at the Santa Anita racetrack. Being only 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 115 pounds, he had the perfect physique to become a professional jockey, but his hopes did not materialise.\n\nWhat did really define him at this stage in his life was his religious belief. He was an ardent Christian believer and he experimented with different church denominations, shifting from being a Coptic to joining the Baptist and the Adventist churches. In 1966, he finally joined the \u2018Ancient Mystical Order of the Rose Cross,\u2019 an American branch of Rosicrucianism.\n\nThis is a mystical branch of Christianity which dates back to the teachings of Johan Valentin Andreae, a XVIIth century Lutheran theologian. Rosicrucians combined early Christian philosophy with alchemy and even ancient Egyptian mysticism and have been associated with Freemasonry and Theosophism through the ages. We could talk about Rosicrucianism for hours on an end, but for the purpose of our story we will only mention that Sirhan\u2019s association to this movement has been linked to his shift towards religious extremism, nationalism or even brainwashing.\n\nSirhan and Bobby\n\nSo what we have so far is a deeply religious yet alienated young man, with few prospects in life and a violent upbringing. Was this enough to push him towards murder? And why Bobby Kennedy? What was his relationship with him?\n\nSirhan would declare to journalist David Frost that he saw Robert Kennedy as a hero, a protector of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged\n\n\u2018 \u2026 and I felt that I was one of those\u2019\n\nBut this perception changed in June 1967 with the six-day war, another victory which the State of Israel had gained against its Arab neighbours. As a Senator, Robert Kennedy had openly supported Israel during that conflict.\n\nAfter announcing his candidacy in March 1968 as new Democratic hopeful President, Kennedy made his support of Israel more frequent and outspoken. At a speech in a synagogue, broadcasted via radio, Kennedy pledged to support Israel with 50 fighter jets should he become President.\n\nSirhan\u2019s feelings towards the candidate had grown increasingly hostile since the Six-day war. After hearing the speech, Sirhan had a violent reaction witnessed by his family, screaming and storming out of the room.\n\nOn the 18th of May, Sirhan wrote in his diary:\n\n\u201cMy determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession\u2026Kennedy must die before June 5th \u2026 die, die, die, die, die.\u201d\n\nThe 5th of June 1968, it would have been the first anniversary of the Six-days War.\n\nOn the 1st of June, witnesses reported seeing Sirhan at the Lock, Stock, \u2018N Barrel gun shop in Los Angeles, where he bought two boxes of .22-caliber hollow point bullets.\n\nOn the 3rd of June, he was first spotted by staff at the Ambassador Hotel, apparently surveying the site where the presidential hopeful would be expected to wait for the results of the California primaries on the following day.\n\nOn the 4th of June, only hours before the shooting, Sirhan visited the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club to practice at its gun range.\n\nAnd now to the night of the 4th, a few minutes before midnight. Robert Kennedy was delivering the last lines of his speech in the Embassy ballroom at the Ambassador hotel, while Sirhan was in the hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry area, waiting \u2013 with a .22-caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet handgun in his pocket.\n\nAmbassador employees Jesus Perez and Martin Petrusky, remembered Sirhan lingering around the elevator area as Kennedy was still on stage.\n\nYou know what happened next: the screams, the gun shots, Kennedy falling on the floor, while Sirhan was apprehended still yelling \u201cI did it for my country!\u201d\n\n.\n\nAfter the arrest\n\nSirhan initially refused to speak or identify himself to the police. It wasn\u2019t until the 9th of June that decided to confess to the crime. But on insistence from his lawyers, he retracted his confession and pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial took place between January and April 1969 and during court hearings Sirhan behaved erratically. Sometimes he claimed that on the night of the murder he was drunk and that he had no recollection of killing Kennedy, while in other occasions he stated that if he had killed him, it wasn\u2019t out of personal hatred but as an act in service to his Country, Palestine. These discrepancies may have been part of the defence strategy, based on the concept that Sirhan was suffering from a condition known as \u2018diminished capacity\u2019, a thesis supported by professor of psychiatry at UCLA, Bernard Diamond.\n\nThe jury was not convinced, though, and eventually Sirhan was found guilty of murder on the 17th of April 1969 and sentenced to death.\n\nHis story may have ended there, but in 1972 the State of California declared the death penalty to be unconstitutional and so his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nSirhan Sirhan has been a convict in the Californian state prisons since then, first serving time in San Quentin, then Soledad, Pleasant Valley and finally the Richard Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.\n\nOver the years Sirhan has not been a silent convict, far from it. His lawyers have been constantly filing requests for parole hearings: one of these is held every five years, the last one in 2016, and they have all been rejected. What is interesting about these hearings, though, is that they have given the chance to Sirhan, his lawyers and his supporters to present new evidence supporting the claim that he was not Kennedy\u2019s assassin \u2013 or at least not a willing one \u2013 or maybe not the only one.\n\nIt\u2019s time now to look at these theories. I hope you are not easily offended by the \u2018C- word\u2019: Conspiracy.\n\nAct III\n\nThe Conspiracy\n\nThe official explanation for the murder of Robert F. Kennedy is that Sirhan Sirhan had acted alone, because he was mentally instable, because he wanted to strike at an enemy of the Arab cause, or both. This would make Bobby\u2019s assassination the first American encounter with Middle Eastern terrorism.\n\nOver the years many more theories have emerged, claiming that Sirhan had not acted alone or that he had been a pawn in the hands of more powerful and sinister forces.\n\nAt the 2011 parole hearing, Sirhan\u2019s attorney Larry Teeter brought forward the hypothesis that Sirhan may have been hypnotised, brainwashed and conditioned to carry out the assassination of RFK. He had been identified and selected as a \u2018patsy\u2019 or \u2018fall guy\u2019, because of his foreign origin and support of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThese theory is supported also by British author Peter Evans in his book Nemesis. According to Evans and Teeter, after interrogating Sirhan the Los Angeles Police Department could not account for a period of three months, known as the \u201cwhite fog\u201d, during which Sirhan\u2019s movements were unknown. It was during this \u2018white fog\u2019 days that Sirhan may have been hypnotised by psychiatrist Dr William Joseph Bryan Jnr, who had worked on the infamous CIA mind-control programme called MKULTRA.\n\nThis programme was an expansion on two pre-existing operations run by the CIA in the 1950s, called Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke. Both projects envisage the possibility of using hypnosis as an interrogation technique or as a way of manipulating a foreign national \u2013 and I stress, a foreign national \u2013 to carry out political assassinations. Bluebird, Artichoke and MKULTRA, as outlandish as they may sound, have all been acknowledged by the CIA and documentation related to them is freely accessible via Freedom of Information requests.\n\nWhat is chilling is that the official documentation for Bluebird and Artichoke does not raise any moral considerations around using hypnosis in interrogations or brainwashing innocent people to turn them into assassins. The main concern is sourcing the right psychiatrist for the job, because a private practitioner would likely not accept a lowly CIA salary \u2026\n\nDidn\u2019t know that the \u2018C\u2019 in CIA stood for \u2018Cheap\u2019 (!)\n\nBut back to the 2011 parole hearing! Why did the hypnosis theory emerge only then? Well, ironically enough, it was only then that Attorney Teeter had the idea to have Sirhan hypnotised to retrieve repressed memories of the assassination.\n\nDuring those sessions Sirhan was able to remember a detail previously concealed. He remembered meeting a girl in a polka-dot dress on the night of the assassination\n\n\u201cI was fascinated with her looks \u2026. She never said much. It was very erotic. I was consumed by her. She was a seductress with an unspoken unavailability.\u201d\n\nThe girl took him to the kitchen pantry and then pinched him on the arm. This was a \u2018trigger action\u2019 which led him to believe that he was on a weapons firing range \u2013 that\u2019s when Sirhan began shooting.\n\nBut who were the brains behind the whole operation?\n\nAccording to Teeter,\n\n\u201cThe assassination was staged by US intelligence for the purpose of continuing the war against Vietnam and putting the Republican Party in the White House. The assassination was arranged with the CIA, the FBI and the LAPD. There was a massive cover-up. If he had lived and been allowed to run, Bobby Kennedy would have been elected president and this was a multi-agency task force to make sure that the Democrats didn\u2019t take the White House again.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Peter Evans states a completely different theory in Nemesis. Sirhan had been hypnotised to be at the Ambassador and take the blame off the actual assassin, a Palestinian terrorist named Mahmoud Hamshari.\n\nAnd Hamshari was himself a pawn, on the payroll of none other than Greek magnate Aristotle Onassis, Jackie Kennedy\u2019s suitor at that time. The motive? Personal resentment towards Bobby, who had foiled a major deal between Onassis and the Saudis in 1953 and was opposed to the Greek billionaire marrying his sister-in-law.\n\nAccording to Evans, the CIA psychiatrist Dr Bryan had links to both Hamshari and Onassis, having cured the former for migraine, and the latter for sexual dysfunction. And finally one of Onassis\u2019 lovers, Helen Gaillet De Neergaard, reported that he himself had admitted his complicity in the killing in1974.\n\nOh, by the way, Dr Bryan? He was found dead in a Las Vegas hotel room in 1978, either shot himself or was murdered. The case remains unsolved.\n\nThe brainwashing theory is certainly fascinating, and we know by the CIA\u2019s own admission that the use of hypnosis to interrogate, or kill, was in their plans.\n\nBut something does not add up, and please note these are our personal considerations:\n\nif Sirhan had been programmed to believe he was at a firing range, shooting at targets\n\nif such belief was triggered by the pinch from the girl in the polka-dot dress\n\nwhy did he shout, \u201cKennedy you son of a bitch?\u201d. Why did he shout, \u201cI did it for my country?\u201d\n\nIf he was a \u2018patsy\u2019 all along, acting mechanically at the tap of some girl in polka-dots, how could he behave in such a competent way prior to the assassination? He knew where Kennedy was due to speak, he visited the location, he practised at a firing range and he acquired a .22 caliber gun \u2013 a low powered pistol, perfect choice for shooting in a closed environment such a pantry.\n\nNow, this choice of a weapon makes even more sense if other assassins are there. Other hitmen, even more competent, who want to avoid the risk of being hit by \u2018friendly fire\u2019. Time for our second Conspiracy theory.\n\nWhile researching the case for a screenplay, author and reporter Shane O\u2019Sullivan uncovered new video and photographic evidence suggesting that three senior CIA operatives were behind the killing. This time, not as shady hypnotists, but as hitmen involved directly in the assassination.\n\nThe first agent is David Sanchez Morales, known for leading covert operations in Latin America. As far back as 1973, Morales had been reported as saying\n\n\u201cI was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.\u201d\n\nReferring to both Kennedy brothers, of course.\n\nAnalysing footage and stills from the night of the assassination, \u2018O Sullivan was able to identify Morales standing at the back of the ballroom, in the moments between the end of Kennedy\u2019s speech and the shooting. Morales was also spotted alongside another operative called Gordon Campbell. Morales and Campbell had worked together at the CIA\u2019s Miami base in 1963. Both had been involved in the planning of the Bay of the Pigs invasion and were harsh critics of the Kennedys, blaming them for the failure of that operation.\n\nA third senior CIA figure was identified by looking at the crime scene photos taken by the LAPD: George Joannides, chief of psychological warfare operations at the Miami base.\n\nWhatever the involvement of Morales, Campbell and Joannides, it is a shared belief that Sirhan was not the only shooter at the Ambassador hotel.\n\nIn the last parole hearing in 2016, Paul Schrade, one of the five other people injured in the shooting, said the evidence clearly showed a second gunman had been in the kitchen pantry.\n\nFirst piece of evidence, the number of shots. Sirhan\u2019s gun could only carry eight rounds, and yet a radio reporter recorded the sound of 13 shots being fired in the pantry. This was confirmed by campaign volunteer Nina Rhodes-Hughes who reported to the FBI that she heard anywhere from 12-14 shots that night. Bobby\u2019s own son, Robert Kennedy Jr is convinced of this thesis, as he declared to The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cThere were too many bullets. You can\u2019t fire 13 shots out of an eight-shot gun.\u201d\n\nSecond point: direction of shooting. How could Sirhan have shot Kennedy in the back and behind the ear if all eye witnesses confirm that he was standing in front of him?\n\nThird: distance. Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi found that Bobby\u2019s fatal head wound, with an entry trajectory form behind the ear, had been inflicted from a distance of 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches. And Sirhan, he had been standing at at least 18 inches\u2019 distance.\n\nSo, another hitman, closer to Bobby than Sirhan was, had shot him behind the ear at close distance. Morales? Campbell? Joannides? Or somebody else? According to some witnesses, a security guard called Thane Cesar, standing behind Kennedy at the time was seen drawing his weapon. Although we should specify, he was not seen shooting and he later passed a polygraph test that included questions about whether he shot Kennedy.\n\nCan we handle the truth?\n\nWe have presented only three possible explanations of who, why and how could have been behind the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Bobby, a man who could have shone a beacon of hope in a traumatic period of American history. He could have ended the Vietnam War much earlier, supported the cause of the desperately poor and accelerated the process of integration brought about by the Civil Rights movement. These progressive goals would be at least partially achieved by subsequent administrations. But sadly at that time they could have provided enough motive for US intelligence agencies \u2013 or at least for factions within them \u2013 to be involved in Bobby\u2019s killing.\n\nAnd what was Sirhan\u2019s real role in this event? Was he really the victim of brainwashing, or perhaps the willing participant of a larger conspiracy, the only one to take the blame? We will stand by to hear from Sirhan\u2019s next parole hearing in 2021, hoping that the truth will finally emerge. Whether we will be able to handle it, that\u2019s another question.\n\nSo I hoped you liked this new, extended format, please leave your comments as usual. Did you like it? Hate it? But most of all, don\u2019t forget to tell us what is your theory for Robert Kennedy\u2019s assassination. And as usual, thank you for watching."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/us/robert-f-kennedy-assassin-sirhan-sirhan-is-said-to-have-been-stabbed.html", "page_content": "Sirhan B.

Eilleen Bolger is Regional Archives Director.\n\nThe first naturalization act, passed by Congress on March 26, 1790 (1 Stat. 103), provided that any free, white, adult alien, male or female, who had resided within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States for a period of 2 years was eligible for citizenship. Under the act, any individual who desired to become a citizen was to apply to \u201cany common law court of record, in any one of the states wherein he shall have resided for the term of one year at least.\u201d Citizenship was granted to those who proved to the court\u2019s satisfaction that they were of good moral character and who took an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Under the system established by the act, aliens could be naturalized not only in Federal courts, but also in State and local courts, and the children of successful applicants, if under 21 years of age, automatically became citizens.\n\nThe act of January 29, 1795 (1 Stat. 414) increased the period of residence required for citizenship from 2 to 5 years. It also required applicants to declare publicly their intention to become citizens of the United States and to renounce any allegiance to a foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty 3 years before admission as citizens. Immigrants who had \u201cborne any hereditary title, or been of the order of nobility\u201d were also required to renounce that status. These actions could be taken before the supreme, superior, district, or circuit court of any State or Territory, or before a Federal circuit or district court of the United States.\n\nOn April 14, 1802, Congress passed an act (2 Stat. 153) that directed the clerk of the court to record the entry of all aliens into the United States. The clerk collected information including the applicant\u2019s name, birthplace, age, nation of allegiance, country of emigration, and place of intended settlement, and granted each applicant a certificate that could be exhibited to the court as evidence of time of arrival in the United States.\n\nCertain doubts had arisen as to whether State and local courts were included within the description of U.S. district or circuit courts. The act of 1802 reaffirmed that every State and Territorial court was considered a district court within the meaning of the laws pertaining to naturalization, and that any persons naturalized in such courts were accorded the same rights and privileges as if they had been naturalized in a district or circuit court of the United States.\n\nThe act of 1802 was the last major piece of naturalization legislation during the 19th century. A number of minor revisions were introduced, but these merely altered or clarified details of evidence and certification without changing the basic nature of the admission procedure. The most important of these revisions occurred in 1855, when citizenship was automatically granted to alien wives of U.S. citizens (10 Stat. 604), and in 1870, when the naturalization process was opened to persons of African descent (16 Stat. 256).\n\nOn June 27, 1906, Congress passed an act (34 Stat. 596) that expanded the existing Immigration Bureau to the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization and put it in charge of \u201call matters concerning the naturalization of aliens.\u201d Although the new Bureau was part of the Department of Labor and Commerce initially, and part of the Department of Labor from 1913 to 1940, most of its operations were directed by the Department of Justice, and, in 1940, the Bureau was made part of the Justice Department. Under the act of 1906, every petition for naturalization became a case for examination by Bureau officials.\n\nThis act also established the basic procedure for naturalization during the period 1906-52. The procedure began with the filing of a declaration of intention, which recorded the applicant\u2019s oath to the clerk of the court that it was his or her bona fide intention to become a citizen of the United States, to reside permanently therein, and to renounce all allegiances to other nations. Within a period of 2 to 7 years after filing the declaration, the applicant could petition the court for citizenship, presenting at this time the affidavits of two witnesses with personal knowledge of the applicant, stating that the applicant had resided in the United States for at least 5 years and possessed a good moral character. The petition then became the subject of an investigation and hearing before a judge. Officials of the Bureau conducted preliminary examinations and submitted findings and recommendations to the court. The hearing before a judge was the last step in the procedure, provided the judge found the findings and recommendation of naturalization officials favorable and satisfactory. If so, the applicant would take an oath of allegiance to the U.S. Constitution and laws and renounce all foreign allegiances, and the judge would issue an order of admission to citizenship and grant the applicant a certificate of citizenship. However, a judge could also order a continuance of the investigation or deny the petition, listing the reasons for the denial. A major change in this procedure occurred in 1952, when the filing of the declaration of intention was eliminated.\n\nOn May 9, 1918, Congress passed an act (40 Stat. 542) stating that any alien who had been a member of the Armed Forces for 3 or more years could file a petition for naturalization without proof of the 5-year residency requirement, and that any applicant who had been in the service during World War I was exempt from the requirement to file a declaration of intention. This act consolidated the previous statutes of July 17, 1862 (12 Stat. 597), which allowed waiver of the filing of a declaration if the applicant had a favorable discharge from the Army, and of July 24, 1894 (28 Stat. 124), which extended this provision to applicants discharged from the Navy or the Marines.\n\nOn September 22, 1922, Congress enacted a law (42 Stat. 1021) that changed the naturalization procedure for married women. Before that date, women who were married to a U.S. citizen or naturalized citizen automatically became U.S. citizens by reason of the marriage. The new law required that any woman married after the date of enactment who desired to become a citizen must meet the requirements of the naturalization laws. No declaration of intention was needed, however, and the period of required residence was reduced from 5 years to 1 year.\n\nSource: Rocky Mountain Regional National Archives and Records Administration\n\nHow to Cite this Article (APA Format): Bolger, E.

Choose your plan ArrowRight A two-member panel of the California parole board in August approved release for Sirhan after serving 53 years behind bars, and that ruling was then approved by the parole board\u2019s legal staff.\n\nBut California voters amended their state constitution in 1988 to allow the governor to reverse decisions by the state Board of Parole Hearings for convicted murderers. Newsom elected to do so, saying in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times that Sirhan, after decades in prison, \u201cstill lacks the insight that would prevent him from making the kind of dangerous and destructive decisions he made in the past. The most glaring proof of Sirhan\u2019s deficient insight is his shifting narrative about his assassination of Kennedy, and his current refusal to accept responsibility for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy\u2019s wife, Ethel Kennedy, publicly declared her opposition to parole in September, and she was joined by six of her nine surviving children. They issued a statement Thursday evening welcoming Newsom\u2019s decision. \u201cWe are greatly appreciative of the Governor\u2019s consideration of the facts and his faithful application of the law,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHis decision represents the vindication of the rule of law over all who would betray it with hatred and violence. \u2026 The Governor protects Californians and people around the world \u2014 and that is in the tradition, and faithful to the legacy, of Robert Kennedy. We are deeply grateful for this decision.\u201d\n\nThe reversal returns Sirhan\u2019s case to the parole board, which must hold another parole hearing within 18 months, according to California law. Newsom has reversed 161 paroles for murderers in his three years as governor, state records show. Very few states allow governors to overrule parole boards.\n\nSirhan\u2019s attorney, Angela Berry, released a statement that said the parole process had become politicized, and that she would challenge Newsom\u2019s decision in the courts. \u201cWe fully expect that judicial review of the governor\u2019s decision will show that the governor got it wrong,\u201d Berry said. \u201cThe California Supreme Court has declared that life prisoners have a due process right to meaningful consideration for parole. Parole is presumed and it will only be denied under the law if the prisoner poses a current unreasonable risk to the public if released. Not an iota of evidence exists to suggest Mr. Sirhan is still a danger to society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo of Robert Kennedy\u2019s children, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, supported Sirhan\u2019s release during his most recent parole hearing in August, and one daughter, former Maryland lieutenant governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, has not spoken recently about the case.\n\nKennedy was 42 years old and had just won the California Democratic presidential primary when he was shot at point-blank range in the back of the head, as he moved through the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel in downtown Los Angeles shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968. Two other close-range shots slightly wounded the senator, and a fourth passed through his coat without hitting him, all from behind.\n\nKennedy died a day later, on June 6, 1968, further convulsing a country already reeling from the assassination two months earlier of civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Some believed Kennedy had a chance to capture the Democratic nomination for president, and follow his older brother John F. Kennedy into the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan, then 24, was seen moving quickly toward Kennedy in the pantry, yelling and firing a .22-caliber pistol. He was wrestled onto a table by hotel staff, author George Plimpton and athletes Rafer Johnson and Rosey Grier, among others.\n\nSirhan was taken to a Los Angeles police station, where he chatted calmly with officers and prosecutors for hours without ever discussing the shooting or revealing his name. Police had no idea who he was until his brothers saw his picture in the newspaper the next day and notified the authorities.\n\nSirhan was quickly indicted on a charge of murder. But the lawyers on both sides, and their psychological experts, suspected something was different with Sirhan. He claimed not to remember the shooting. He was easily hypnotized. The prosecution and defense agreed to a deal to allow Sirhan to plead guilty to first-degree murder and serve a life sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Judge Herbert V. Walker rejected the deal and demanded a trial, saying the public needed a full airing of the momentous slaying. Sirhan\u2019s defense team, led by a lawyer then under indictment himself, launched a mental incompetence defense, but the jury rejected that, convicted Sirhan in April 1969 and sentenced him to die.\n\nIn 1972, the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional, and Sirhan was one of 107 condemned prisoners resentenced to life with the possibility of parole. He continued to claim that he did not remember the slaying, and his lack of full contrition followed him through 15 parole hearings in which he was rejected for release every time.\n\nFor his most recent hearing, Sirhan took a different approach. A group of high-profile inmates at the San Diego prison where Sirhan is held took up his cause, including music executive Suge Knight and Mexican Mafia gang leader Arturo Guzman, conducting mock parole hearings under the guidance of Redemption Row California. Redemption Row\u2019s executive director, Jen Abreu, told the Intercept that the mock hearings went for hours, tossing countless possible questions at Sirhan, and seeking to reduce the anger he has sometimes flashed in prior hearings. Abreu told the \u201cVoices: River City\u201d podcast that Redemption Row had helped 19 of 20 \u201clifers\u201d win their release. Abreu spoke at Sirhan\u2019s parole hearing.\n\nAbreu said that the inmates helped convince Sirhan to admit he brought a loaded gun to the Ambassador Hotel that night and that he had been drinking at the Kennedy victory party. A transcript of the parole hearing shows that Sirhan did acknowledge bringing the gun and having multiple drinks that night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the first time at the August hearing, no one from the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office attended to oppose Sirhan\u2019s parole. Newly elected district attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said it was not the prosecution\u2019s role to become involved in post-conviction decisions.\n\nHearing this, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore sent a letter to the parole board saying, \u201cThis crime was a political statement, and we cannot afford to allow individuals to believe there are not severe consequence[s] associated with attacking the fabric of a democratic society.\u201d\n\nThe two-member panel of the California parole board, commissioners Robert Barton and Teresa Meighan, questioned Sirhan closely about his decades in prison and also his actions on the night of the assassination, according to a transcript released in October. \u201cI want to express my utter remorse for everything that took place that night,\u201d Sirhan said, \u201cwhether I\u2019m responsible for it or not,\u201d a seeming reference to theories that he was hypnotized into firing the shots on a certain cue. Later Sirhan said, \u201cit pains me to experience the knowledge that I\u2019m responsible for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn granting Sirhan\u2019s request for parole, Barton acknowledged that Sirhan did not accept full responsibility for the assassination. But he said California law required the board to consider that Sirhan, at 24, was a \u201cyouth offender\u201d whose brain was not fully developed, that he had no prior record and virtually no problems in five decades in prison, and was now 77 with multiple health problems. \u201cWe find that you no longer pose an unreasonable risk to public safety,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe think that you have grown.\u201d\n\nThe Kennedy family had been largely silent on Sirhan\u2019s case over the years, even as questions were raised about whether he had fired the fatal shots, since he approached Kennedy from the front and the shots struck Kennedy in the back. Then in 2017, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with Paul Schrade, one of five people who were wounded in the same shooting. Schrade believes that Sirhan fired the shot which grazed him in the head, but not the shot that killed Kennedy.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. looked at Schrade\u2019s files, including ballistics evidence indicating that the four shots into his father and the wounding of five other people, plus bullet holes in doors and the ceiling, were more bullets than Sirhan\u2019s eight-shot pistol held. He then went to meet with Sirhan at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Center in December 2017. Kennedy told The Washington Post in 2018 that he had spent three hours with Sirhan, and told Sirhan he did not think he killed his father.\n\n\u201cI went there because I was curious and disturbed by what I had seen in the evidence,\u201d said Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and the third oldest of his father\u2019s 11 children. (Two of those children are deceased.) \u201cI was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father. My father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country. I think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKathleen Kennedy Townsend told The Post in 2018, \u201cBobby makes a compelling case. I think [the investigation] should be reopened.\u201d Douglas Kennedy, a Fox News correspondent, joined his brother in supporting Sirhan\u2019s parole. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has become a controversial figure for his opposition to coronavirus vaccines and his endorsement of related conspiracy theories.\n\nBut the six other Kennedy children issued a statement soon after the parole decision, denouncing it. \u201cAs children of Robert F. Kennedy, we are devastated that the man who murdered our father has been recommended for parole,\u201d wrote former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Christopher G. Kennedy, Maxwell T. Kennedy and Rory Kennedy. Ethel Kennedy issued her statement soon after. More recently, Joseph and Kerry Kennedy have voiced their opposition in television interviews, and both Rory Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have published opinion pieces voicing their views on Sirhan.\n\n\u201cHis suitability for release has not changed,\u201d Rory Kennedy wrote, noting that Sirhan told the two-member parole panel that he was pained by his involvement in the case, \u201cif I did in fact do that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. wrote, \u201cThe pain that we all continue to feel from my father\u2019s death should not prevent us from pursuit of the truth \u2026 the real killer has evaded justice.\u201d He named an armed security guard who stood behind his father as the true assassin. That man was reported to have died in 2019 and denied firing his gun.\n\nThe parole board legal staff had until late December to review the ruling, and did not take any action to reconsider the ruling, according to Berry, Sirhan\u2019s lawyer. The case then moved to Newsom, who had 30 days to approve parole, reverse it or return it to the parole board. In 2019, his first year as governor, Newsom reversed 95 grants of parole and returned one to the parole board, according to annual reports his office has filed. In each of the last two years, he has reversed 33 paroles for murderers, including 17 before his recall election in September, which he won. There were no statistics available on how many murder paroles he approved.\n\nNewsom\u2019s statement in the Los Angeles Times said that Sirhan \u201crefuses to accept responsibility for the crimes,\u201d and he dismissed any claims of Sirhan\u2019s innocence as \u201cinvestigated and disproved.\u201d He said that Sirhan \u201cremains a potent symbol of political violence\u201d and that Sirhan does not understand \u201cthe complex risks of his self-created notoriety. He cannot be safely released from prison because he has not mitigated the risk of fomenting further political violence.\u201d\n\nBerry said, \u201cSince the mid-1980s Mr. Sirhan has consistently been found by prison psychologists and psychiatrists to not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public; he has been discipline-free since 1972.\u201d She said the parole board \u201cacts as the final gatekeeper for society. It does not recommend release of any prisoner who poses a risk to the public.\u201d Statistics show the board granted only 17 percent of all parole requests, for all crimes, last year.\n\nMagda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/us/sirhan-sirhan-parole-robert-kennedy.html", "page_content": "SACRAMENTO \u2014 A California panel on Wednesday denied parole for Sirhan B.

Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. He received the death penalty, but the sentence was later commuted to life.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem. In 1948 Jordan took control of East Jerusalem and what is now the West Bank, and the following year it granted citizenship to people living in those areas. It is believed that this is how Sirhan became a Jordanian citizen. In the 1950s, he and his family moved to the United States and eventually settled in Pasadena, California. There he attended Pasadena City College and later held odd jobs, notably working at a horse stable and later at a health food store.\n\nDuring this time, Sirhan became vocal in his opposition to Israel, especially after the Six-Day War (June 1967), in which the country seized control of various territories, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Old City of Jerusalem. Sirhan began directing his anger at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who expressed support for Israel while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. On June 4, Kennedy won the California primary, and shortly after midnight, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. As he left through a service pantry, Kennedy was fatally shot; he died on June 6. In addition, five bystanders were wounded. Sirhan was apprehended at the scene\u2014tackled by George Plimpton, Rosey Grier, and others\u2014and he reportedly said, \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d The attack took place on the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan later claimed he was unable to remember the shooting, saying that he was intoxicated at the time. However, during his 1969 trial, he admitted to having committed the crime, though he later said that his statements were the result of his defense attorney\u2019s making him think he was guilty. On April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder, and several days later he was given the death sentence. When California abolished capital punishment in 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life. His efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories surrounded Kennedy\u2019s assassination. One of the most notable concerned the belief that there was a second gunman. On an audio tape of the shooting, 13 shots are reportedly heard, though Sirhan\u2019s revolver had only 8 rounds. In addition, at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing, one of those wounded in the attack testified that a different gunman had shot Kennedy. The parole board, however, was not swayed by the claims, and Sirhan was again denied release. In 2021 he faced the board for the 16th time. The panel\u2014which was operating under recent reforms that required it to consider age, health, and other factors\u2014recommended that he be freed. California Gov.

He wounded five others during the shooting.\n\nIn January Gavin Newsom, the California governor, overruled two parole commissioners who had found that Sirhan no longer was a risk.

Kennedy was the hope of the world and I injured, and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still responsible for being there and probably causing this whole incident, through my own gun or other guns.\u201d\n\nTwo of Kennedy\u2019s children submitted letters on Sirhan\u2019s behalf. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who has previously expressed doubt about Sirhan\u2019s guilt and echoed others\u2019 claims that a second gunman actually killed the senator \u2014 said he believed his father might extend mercy to Sirhan.\n\n\u201cWhile nobody can speak definitively on behalf of my father, I firmly believe that based on his own consuming commitment to fairness and justice, that he would strongly encourage this board to release Mr. Sirhan because of Sirhan\u2019s impressive record of rehabilitation,\u201d Kennedy Jr. wrote in a letter submitted in advance of Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nIn an interview with The Times late Friday, Kennedy Jr. said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d Sirhan had been recommended for release and reiterated concerns that the wrong man was convicted.\n\nKennedy, who was a teen at the time of the murder, pointed to an autopsy report indicating the senator had been shot from behind when Sirhan had been standing in front of Kennedy. Some have argued that this would have made it impossible for Kennedy to have been shot in the back by Sirhan, while others have said that Kennedy turned after the first shot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that the justice system showed some humanity,\u201d said Kennedy Jr., who has sometimes garnered criticism for indulging in conspiracy theories surrounding both his father\u2019s killing and the use of vaccines. \u201cI think that my father, who was the top administrator of justice in this country as attorney general and he fought to assure the justice system was humane. \u2026 He would be very happy with this result.\u201d\n\nPaul Schrade, a former Kennedy aide who was one of several bystanders wounded in the shooting, also said Friday that he believed Sirhan was innocent.\n\n\u201cI sympathize very clearly about the way that Sirhan\u2019s been treated,\u201d said Schrade, 96, from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cThis was his 16th parole board hearing, when the guy is not guilty.\u201d\n\nSchrade said that he hopes the granting of parole will push police to reopen their investigation of Kennedy\u2019s death.\n\nDouglas Kennedy also said that while he\u2019d lived in fear of Sirhan for years, he saw him now as \u201cworthy of compassion and love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really do believe any prisoner who is found to be not a threat to themselves or the world should be released,\u201d Douglas Kennedy wrote. \u201cI believe that applies to everyone, every human being, including Mr. Sirhan.\u201d\n\nOther family members, however, were not in support of the parole recommendation.\n\nIn a joint statement late Friday, six of Kennedy\u2019s surviving children \u2014 Joseph P. Kennedy II, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Christopher G. Kennedy, Maxwell T. Kennedy and Rory Kennedy \u2014 said they were devastated that the man who murdered their father received the recommendation.\n\n\u201cOur father\u2019s death is a very difficult matter for us to discuss publicly and for the past many decades we have declined to engage directly in the parole process,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe six Kennedy siblings said they adamantly opposed Sirhan\u2019s parole and release, and were \u201cshocked by a ruling\u201d they believe ignores standards for paroling \u201ca confessed, first-degree murderer in the state of California,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe siblings said that the parole board\u2019s decision \u201chas inflicted enormous additional pain,\u201d and that they were in disbelief that Sirhan would be recommended for release.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Parole Board staff, the full board and ultimately ... Newsom, to reverse this initial recommendation,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cIt is a recommendation we intend to challenge every step of the way, and we hope that those who also hold the memory of our father in their hearts will stand with us.\u201d\n\nAngela Berry, Sirhan\u2019s attorney, said the 77-year-old has not been accused of a serious violation of prison rules since 1972 and that prison officials have deemed him a low risk for violence. Sirhan first became eligible for parole in 1972. Between 1983 and 2006, he appeared before the parole board every one to two years, but was always denied. Beginning in 2006, those hearings were held just twice a decade. He was last denied release in 2016.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department, other relatives and several members of the public submitted letters opposing Sirhan\u2019s release, according to Parole Board Commissioner Robert Barton.\n\nSirhan\u2019s fate could now lie with Newsom, who has long idolized Kennedy and has a fondness for quoting the slain senator. Months after taking office, Newsom lined the hallways of the governor\u2019s office with more than 50 photographs of mourners who lined the railways to see Kennedy\u2019s funeral train as it carried his body from New York to Washington, D.C. more than a half century ago.\n\nErin Mellon, a spokeswoman for Newsom, said the governor will review Sirhan\u2019s case if it is presented to him.\n\nNewsom has not hesitated to reject the recommendations of parole boards in the past. In November, Newsom blocked the release of Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten. He did the same just last month for Royce Casey, one of three men who brutally murdered a 15-year-old boy in Nipomo more than two decades ago.\n\nStill, earlier this month Newsom faced harsh criticism for not blocking the release of David Weidert, who served four decades in prison for killing a developmentally disabled Clovis man whom he buried alive.\n\nWhile Sirhan\u2019s case would not reach the governor\u2019s desk until after the Sept. 14 recall election, the decision could still impact Newsom politically if he remains in power beyond next month. Rising crime has become a central issue of the effort to oust him from office and would likely remain so if Newsom seeks a second term in 2022.\n\nThe recommendation for Sirhan\u2019s release also came without opposition from L.A. County prosecutors, who are barred from fighting release at parole hearings under a policy enacted by reform-minded Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n.\n\nWhile Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s policy had been in effect for nearly nine months, it attracted new scrutiny this week because of Sirhan\u2019s case. Gasc\u00f3n has said it should be up to the parole board to determine an inmate\u2019s suitability for release, rather than prosecutors who are simply relitigating the facts of old cases, sometimes decades later.\n\n\u201cThe role of a prosecutor and their access to information ends at sentencing. The parole board, however, has all the pertinent facts and evaluations at their disposal, including how someone has conducted themselves over the last few decades in prison,\u201d Alex Bastian, a special adviser to Gasc\u00f3n, said in a statement.\n\nCritics of Gasc\u00f3n have said the parole policy is indicative of a broader abandonment of victims under his administration and some victims have complained that they felt helpless without an advocate present when they went to oppose the release of a loved one\u2019s killer earlier this year.\n\nAs news of the parole board\u2019s decision broke late Friday, some rushed to attack Gasc\u00f3n. The California District Attorneys Assn. released a statement bashing Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s policy as \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLetting a victim or a victim\u2019s family member be at a parole hearing by themselves is just plain cruel. Gasc\u00f3n is completely abandoning his job,\u201d added L.A. County Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Hatami, a leading figure in the effort to recall Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cWe all know the parole board doesn\u2019t always get it right \u2014 it\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nBut during the hearing, Barton said the presence of a prosecutor would have had no impact on the board\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cObviously they opposed in the past and even if they had opposed it today our decision would be the same,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\nWhile critics of Gasc\u00f3n have claimed the parole policy will end with a flood of violent criminals returning to the streets, statistics suggest otherwise. Records show the state parole board granted release in only about 19% of all cases it heard from 2018 to 2020, and that does not factor in cases where Newsom later blocked an inmate\u2019s release.\n\nTimes staff writers Anita Chabria and Gregory Yee contributed to this report, as did the Associated Press."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2021-08-30/sirhan-sirhan-robert-f-kennedy-essential-california", "page_content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It\u2019s Monday, August 30. I\u2019m Justin Ray.\n\nOn Friday, the world learned that the man who gunned down Sen. Robert F. Kennedy might get released, sparking uproar and confusion.\n\nThe news was surprising to me for three reasons: (1) There was a lot of evidence he did the crime. Back in 1968, a 24-year-old Sirhan Sirhan was captured at the scene with a .22-caliber handgun in his hand. Three weeks before the shooting, he wrote a manifesto calling for Kennedy\u2019s death. (2) He had also previously been denied parole 15 times. (3) And I\u2019ll even say it: The victim wasn\u2019t just some person on the street; he assassinated a Kennedy. It felt like in terms of uphill battles, this was Mt. Everest covered in oil.\n\nYet here we are, with Sirhan, now 77, recommended for parole after serving more than 50 years in prison . It doesn\u2019t guarantee he will be released, but it is a big step in his quest for freedom. The Times has reported on how the case has split the Kennedy family , a curious detail in an autopsy report about the position of the gunshot wound that has fueled conspiracy theories, and background on Sirhan\u2019s legal battle for freedom . But we haven\u2019t talked about Sirhan\u2019s life.\n\nIn my quest to understand Sirhan, I have read magazine articles, a book by investigative journalist Dan E. Moldea , and listened to a podcast series. Here is a condensed overview of his early years, including an incident that appears to have changed his personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born March 19, 1944 in Jerusalem, Palestine. As a child, it\u2019s likely he witnessed violence from the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. \u201cThere was probably a tremendous amount of trauma when Sirhan was small. There were villages being wiped out,\u201d Moldea\u2019s book quotes Sergeant Mike Nielsen as saying.\n\nIn 1956, the Sirhan family applied and qualified for U.S. visas as Palestinian refugees. They eventually moved to Pasadena. His father \u2014 described as a \u201cstrict disciplinarian, who beat young Sirhan\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t adapt to life in America and eventually abandoned his family. A high school teacher described Sirhan as having a \u201clanguage handicap,\u201d but said that he was \u201ccooperative [and] well-mannered.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating, he enrolled in Pasadena City College in fall of 1963, but he had poor attendance. The next year, he began coming home immediately after classes to care for his sister, Aida, who had leukemia. She died in March 1965 at the age of 29. Three months later, he dropped out of college.\n\nDuring the fall of 1965, Sirhan started working at Santa Anita racetrack. While there, he trained to be a jockey. The book says a foreman at the ranch told the LAPD, \u201cSirhan was a poor horse rider and was constantly being thrown or falling from horses that he was working.\u201d He quit in March 1966. Months later, he began working for Granja Vista del Rio Thoroughbred Horse Farm, near Corona. It was here that an incident would change his life.\n\nOn a foggy morning on Sept. 25, 1966, Sirhan fell from a mare named Hy-Vera, according to an article by Playboy . \u201cSirhan was thrown against a metal post, where he lay crumpled, crying and bleeding,\u201d wrote James McKinley. Sirhan later received a $2,000 settlement over the incident.\n\nThe accident had lasting health effects on Sirhan. In a podcast series created by the writers behind the popular HBO series \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s younger brother discussed how his personality changed: \u201cHe wanted to be by himself. It\u2019s kind of hard to put into words. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered. He was a little more irritable,\u201d Munir Sirhan said (On a side note, I\u2019ve noticed that many notorious killers experienced brain injuries during their childhoods, including California\u2019s Richard Ramirez and Glen Edward Rogers ).\n\nTwo years later, Sirhan would carry out the assassination, and RFK would become the third Kennedy son to die violently. Sirhan told The Times in 1985 : \u201cI originally had admired Sen. Kennedy. He was for the poor and downtrodden. He seemed to be for justice. But then he did things to support Israel, including backing the sending of 50 Phantom jets to Israel that I knew would be used to attack my people. It enraged me, I admit that.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to his potential release, parole staff still have 90 days to review Sirhan\u2019s case. After that, Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 or whoever might replace him following next month\u2019s recall election \u2014 could still decide to block Sirhan\u2019s release.\n\nAlthough he has admitted to the crime in the past, Sirhan didn\u2019t fully accept responsibility when expressing remorse at the Friday hearing.\n\n\u201cSen. Kennedy was the hope of the world and I injured, and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that,\u201d Sirhan said. \u201cI\u2019m still responsible for being there and probably causing this whole incident, through my own gun or other guns.\u201d\n\nAnd now, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening across California:\n\nNote: Some of the sites we link to may limit the number of stories you can access without subscribing.\n\nWhat we know about the five California service members killed in Kabul airport blast.

The son of a middle-class Christian Palestinian family uprooted by the violent offensive of Jewish militias from its native Jerusalem and forced to flee to the United States, at age 24 Sirhan found himself at the centre of major historical events.\n\nIn the early hours of June 5, 1968, he shot an Iver-Johnson .22 revolver at Senator Robert F Kennedy (RFK), minutes after he had given a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Despite contradictory evidence and witness accounts, Sirhan was summarily tried and sentenced for Kennedy\u2019s murder.\n\nSirhan\u2019s 50 years in prison are coloured by the failures of the US criminal justice system, in which racial disparities are apparent. A poor young unconnected Palestinian was easily convicted and accused of political fanaticism. Today, Sirhan would likely have been charged with \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nSirhan Sirhan has been denied parole 15 times. He was initially scheduled for release in 1984. Now 74 years old, this forever prisoner has served longer in jail than any Palestinian prisoner in Israel including Nael Barghouthi, who was imprisoned for 37 years, released and then re-imprisoned.\n\nWho is Sirhan Sirhan?\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born on March 19, 1944, in Jerusalem, the fifth son of Christian Orthodox parents. His father, Bishara, originally from the Palestinian village of Taybeh, worked for the British mandate government in Jerusalem\u2019s water department, and his mother, Mary Muzher, was from Bethlehem. Sirhan witnessed the 1947 bombing of Damascus Gate as a child, the death of his older brother, a man disembowelled by a bomb and other traumatic events.\n\nIn 1948, with Israel\u2019s seizure of mandate and Arab properties, Sirhan\u2019s father lost his job. The family had to move from the Musrara neighbourhood to what was then Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem, where they shared a single room with nine other families. They immigrated to the US when Sirhan was 12, but his father returned to Palestine after a family dispute.\n\nSirhan went to high school in California and then attended a community college for two years but dropped out and held various short-term manual jobs. He enjoyed attending horse races and was interested in becoming a jockey.\n\nHe worked as an exercise boy at the Granja Vista Del Rio ranch but quit after he fell from a horse. He and his immigrant family were motivated to keep away from serious trouble and were not connected to any radical organisations.\n\nSirhan was fascinated with the idea of mind control. He was not a gun person but acquired a gun from his brother in early 1968 \u201cfor target practice\u201d.\n\nWhat happened on June 5, 1968?\n\nHe acted strangely in the days just before the assassination. When questioned later, he stated that he drove downtown on June 4 because there was supposed to be an anniversary commemoration of the 1967 war, but he had the wrong date (the anniversary was to be commemorated on June 5).\n\nHe stopped at the Ambassador Hotel, where he quickly drank four Tom Collins cocktails. Kennedy, who had won the California presidential primaries, spoke in the main ballroom until after midnight, then was guided to exit through the kitchen and pantry area.\n\nKennedy was shaking busboy Juan Romero\u2019s hand when Sirhan, facing him, shot him. Five others were also hit and wounded.\n\nRFK had a small security detail. Congress did not authorise protection of presidential candidates until after his assassination. He wanted to be able to see and touch people, and he was reportedly averse to being spied on by the FBI.\n\nTwo of his guards, Roosevelt Grier, a football player and Rafer Johnson, an Olympic gold medalist, tackled Sirhan, and witnesses heard him say, \u201cI can explain. I did it for my country\u201d. Thane Eugene Cesar, a security guard, was standing behind RFK. There was also Bill Barry, an ex-FBI agent who had followed Kennedy into the kitchen pantry area, and two more guards.\n\nNumerous investigators and Sirhan\u2019s defence teams believe that a second shooter was involved. An audio recording made that night by a freelance reporter, Stanislaw Pruszynski, revealed the sounds of up to thirteen bullets according to analysts and that there was insufficient time between certain firings for one weapon to have been used.\n\nSirhan\u2019s Cadet model Iver-Johnson .22 revolver had only eight bullets. Three bullets hit Kennedy, two remaining in his body. A fourth bullet passed through his coat without injuring him. Five other people around him were also shot.\n\nIt has been suggested that there were three bullet holes in the ceiling and two bullets lodged in a doorframe, which the LAPD destroyed, along with the ceiling tiles.\n\nAccording to the medical examiner and coroner, Thomas Noguchi, the bullet that hit Kennedy behind his right ear was fired from a distance of one inch (2.54cm) to one and a half inches (3.81cm).\n\nYet, according to witnesses, Sirhan was no closer than 18 inches (46cm) to him. Some posited that he had turned his head at that moment and so Sirhan might have hit him. There have been suggestions that one of the security guards could have shot him.\n\nSirhan\u2019s attorneys William Pepper and Laurie Dusek maintain in a 2011 filing that led to another appeal for Sirhan, that the bullet hitting Kennedy\u2019s neck was not from Sirhan\u2019s gun and the bullet in evidence was switched for another.\n\nNot incidentally, William Pepper was the lawyer for James Earl Ray in the trial for the murder of Martin Luther King and argues that a conspiracy took place then.\n\nA \u2018lone wolf\u2019 or a conspiracy?\n\nSirhan claims to remember nothing beyond parking, going inside the hotel, being angry and drinking. A clipping was found in his pocket which quoted Kennedy: \u201cThe United States should without delay sell Israel the 50 Phantom jets she has so long been promised.\u201d\n\nMore damning, a notebook was found in his home that contained repetitive scribblings of \u201cRFK must die\u201d. His demeanour was, however, not of a drunk man. He appeared calm, but also not \u201cin complete control of his mind\u201d.\n\nTo Americans reading about the radical Palestinian political groups that emerged in the wake of Black September 1970, it seemed a no-brainer that an Arab would become an assassin.\n\nAs recently as May 24, 2018, an article in Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper tried to characterise Sirhan as the first \u201clone wolf\u201d killer. As someone who writes on \u201cterrorism\u201d, I\u2019ve learned that most \u201clone wolves\u201d are, in fact, not alone \u2013 they are assisted or instructed.\n\nSirhan\u2019s notebook also contained a sentence that Kennedy must die by June 5th. It was suggested this was because it was the anniversary of the 1967 war, although the Sirhan family\u2019s trauma and displacement were in 1948. He and his defence and psychological experts have argued this writing and the shooting were done under hypnosis.\n\nWhy might others have wanted to kill Robert F Kennedy? To prevent him from becoming president, or perhaps to end the war in Vietnam sooner.\n\nOthers held that RFK might have succeeded in uncovering who killed his brother, John. He reportedly never accepted the official version of the JFK assassination.\n\nIn any case, RFK\u2019s death was a huge loss for the liberals and the left in the US; he was charismatic, bore the Kennedy name and had been expected to win the presidency and carry on his brother John\u2019s legacy.\n\nDue to Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Hubert Humphrey ran for president and lost to Richard Nixon, which ended any hope of returning to the policies John F Kennedy had initiated.\n\nPolitical perceptions\n\nSirhan\u2019s testimony could not help him. Either he was politically motivated, or he was insane in the eyes of the public, except for those who began to believe that a conspiracy was at work. The idea of \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d was too novel a concept in 1968. Furthermore, many Americans didn\u2019t understand Sirhan\u2019s Palestinian identity, since many newspapers simply identified him as Jordanian. If they did know who the Palestinians were, they were unsympathetic.\n\nSirhan explained that he admired RFK but felt betrayed by his staunch support of Israel and intent to send it 50 bombers. His defence attorneys argued that he had been hypnotised and that due to his prior traumatic experiences, was not wholly responsible due to diminished capacity.\n\nThis defence was discounted. Some aspects of the evidence were never satisfactorily explained, and elements of the evidence were omitted or improperly recorded or destroyed when controlled by the Special Unit Senator, rather than the Los Angeles Police Department. Others were suspiciously lost or \u201cstolen\u201d.\n\nSirhan was sentenced to death in the gas chamber. However, the California Supreme Court ruled all capital cases to be a violation of California\u2019s Constitution and his sentence was commuted to life in prison.\n\nSirhan was housed in San Quentin Prison. His brother, Adel, and his mother, Mary, would travel to San Francisco to see him. There they stayed with a Palestinian friend who remembered Adel\u2019s assertions that Sirhan wasn\u2019t responsible for the assassination, even though he opened fire. Sirhan was later transferred to a correctional training facility in Soledad until 1992, and then to the state prison in Corcoran.\n\nOn March 1, 1973, while Sirhan was in San Quentin, armed members of the Black September group burst into the embassy of Saudi Arabia in Khartoum and took 10 hostages, including the US ambassador to Sudan, Cleo A Noel; Deputy Chief of Mission George Curtis Moore; Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Sheikh Abdullah al-Malhouk; his wife and children; and the Belgian and Jordanian charges d\u2019affaires to Sudan.\n\nFirst, the attackers demanded the release of some members of the Baader-Meinhoff group (a far-left West German organisation) and Sirhan Sirhan. Then they asked for the release of 90 Arabs being held by the Jordanian government, including Abu Daoud (said to have planned the 1972 Munich attacks).\n\nPresident Nixon refused to negotiate, and the gunmen killed their three Western hostages before they were captured by the Sudanese authorities. The US believed that Yasser Arafat was involved in directing this operation and that the Palestinian Liberation Organization gave the order to kill the three hostages.\n\nThis incident did nothing to help Sirhan with his legal efforts at a reversal, a new trial or parole. He also could not improve his chances by showing remorse for his crime, as he claimed not to remember it.\n\nCalls for a reinvestigation\n\nIn the early 2000s Sirhan\u2019s lawyer, Larry Teeter, argued that his first lawyer, Grant Cooper had been compromised by a conflict of interest and Sirhan won the right to a new trial.\n\nTeeter tried to have the venue for this new trial moved to Fresno, California but the motion was denied. Meanwhile, Sirhan\u2019s brother Adel, who had handled his affairs, died in the spring of 2001.\n\nA few months later, after the September 11 attacks, Sirhan was bizarrely accused of a connection to the suicide bombers because he had suddenly shaved his head and acquired a television just two days earlier.\n\nHis brother Munir explained to me that Sirhan was watching television during the attacks and had covered his head with a towel because he was cold. Apparently, the guards were suspicious of his mail, and that he was reading the Qur\u2019an.\n\nAlthough Christian, he was trying to retain his knowledge of the Arabic language. The warden placed special restrictions on him; he was questioned by the FBI and was unable to see visitors for an extended period.\n\nTeeter died in 2005, and Sirhan had no counsel for some years. In 2011, Sirhan\u2019s new defence team, Pepper and Dusek filed a motion for a new trial based on evidentiary claims.\n\nThese were supposed to include the testimony of Nina Rhodes-Hughes, a witness in the pantry, who said that despite her claim that there were two shooters, the authorities had altered her account of the events. Beside Rhodes-Hughes, four other witnesses heard more than eight shots, and the team highlighted other problematic details in evidence. However, the US District Court rejected their motion.\n\nSirhan had also shot Paul Schrade, a Kennedy confidant, the director of the United Auto Workers union, who recovered. At the age of 91, he testified at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing.\n\nHe has long believed there was a second shooter. He called for Sirhan\u2019s release and said \u201cthe evidence clearly shows that you [Sirhan Sirhan] were not the gunman who shot Robert Kennedy,\u201d but his testimony was disregarded by the parole commissioner.\n\nIn November 2013, Sirhan was moved to the Richard J Donovan prison in San Diego. Earlier last month, Robert F Kennedy, Jr visited him there and afterwards told the press that he supported the call for a reinvestigation of the assassination.\n\nSirhan\u2019s father, mother, and brothers, except for one, have all died. While his mother was still alive, she said that she prayed that he would be released, forgiven, as in the Biblical story of the prodigal son.\n\nThis petite woman, whose only valuables on arrival to the US were two mother-of-pearl brooches marked \u201cJerusalem\u201d, never saw that day. His brother Adel said the family never celebrated Christmas after 1968; \u201cwhat\u2019s the point when your family member is in jail?\u201d Unspoken was the word, \u201cforever\u201d.\n\nSirhan has always articulated distress at his people\u2019s treatment. Palestinians may see him as a casualty of their condition and an affirmation of their criminalisation in the justice systems. He, like many in Israel\u2019s jails, is a forever prisoner.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance."}, {"url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/27/sirhan-sirhan-who-killed-robert-f-kennedy-granted-parole", "page_content": "Two of Kennedy\u2019s sons favour the release of Sirhan, who assassinated the then-presidential candidate in 1968.\n\nUS Senator Robert F Kennedy\u2019s assassin has been recommended for parole after two of Kennedy\u2019s sons spoke in favour of Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s release and prosecutors declined to argue he should be kept behind bars.\n\nThe decision was a major victory for the 77-year-old Sirhan, a Christian Palestinian from Jordan, though it does not assure his release.\n\nThe ruling by the two-person panel on Friday at Sirhan\u2019s 16th parole hearing will be reviewed during the next 90 days by the California Parole Board\u2019s staff. Then, it will be sent to the governor, who will have 30 days to decide whether to grant it, reverse it or modify it.\n\nDouglas Kennedy, who was a toddler when his father was gunned down in 1968, said he was moved to tears by Sirhan\u2019s remorse and he should be released if he is not a threat to others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr Sirhan face to face,\u201d he said at Sirhan\u2019s parole hearing. \u201cI think I\u2019ve lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another.

I will always look to safety and peace and non-violence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKennedy, the New York senator and brother of slain President John F Kennedy, was a Democratic presidential candidate when he was shot dead June 6, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after delivering a victory speech in the pivotal California primary.\n\nSirhan, who was convicted of first-degree murder, has said he does not remember the killing.\n\nHis lawyer, Angela Berry, argued that the board should base its decision on who Sirhan is today.\n\nProsecutors declined to participate or oppose his release under a policy by Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon, a former police officer who took office last year after running on a reform platform.\n\nGascon, who said he idolised the Kennedys and mourned Robert Kennedy\u2019s assassination, believes the prosecutors\u2019 role ends at sentencing and they should not influence decisions to release prisoners.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Kennedy family members, Los Angeles law enforcement officers and the public submitted letters opposing Sirhan\u2019s release, Parole Board Commissioner Robert Barton said at the start of the proceeding held virtually Friday, where Sirhan appeared from San Diego County prison.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a DA here, but I have to consider all sides,\u201d Barton said, noting it would consider arguments made in the past by prosecutors opposing his release, depending on their relevance.\n\nSirhan, has served 53 years for the murder and has acknowledged he was angry at Kennedy for his support of Israel.\n\nWhen asked about how he feels about the Middle East conflict today, Sirhan broke down crying and temporarily could not speak.\n\n\u201cTake a few deep breaths,\u201d said Barton, who noted the conflict had not gone away and still touched a nerve.\n\nSirhan said he does not follow what is going on in the region but thinks about the suffering of refugees.\n\n\u201cThe misery that those people are experiencing. It\u2019s painful,\u201d Sirhan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf released, Sirhan could be deported to Jordan, and Barton said he was concerned he might become a \u201csymbol or lightning rod to foment more violence\u201d.\n\nSirhan said he was too old to be involved in the Middle East conflict and would detach himself from it.\n\n\u201cThe same argument can be said or made that I can be a peacemaker, and a contributor to a friendly nonviolent way of resolving the issue,\u201d Sirhan said.\n\nSirhan, who was 24 at the time of the assassination, was sentenced to death after his conviction, but that sentence was commuted to life when the California Supreme Court briefly outlawed capital punishment in 1972.\n\nSirhan has in the past stuck to his account that he does not remember the killing. However, he has recalled events before the crime in detail \u2014 going to a shooting range that day, visiting the hotel in search of a party and returning after realising he was too drunk to drive after downing Tom Collins cocktails.\n\nJust before the assassination, he drank coffee in a hotel pantry with a woman to whom he was attracted. The next thing he has said he remembered was being choked and unable to breathe as he was taken into custody. At his 2016 hearing, he said he felt remorse for any crime victim but could not take responsibility for the shooting.\n\nSirhan told the panel then that if released, he hoped he would be deported to Jordan or live with his brother in Pasadena, California."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/08/27/1031507957/sirhan-sirhan-robert-f-kennedy-parole-hearing", "page_content": "Sirhan Sirhan Has Served 53 Years For Killing Robert F. Kennedy. Soon He May Be Free\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Donaldson Collection/Getty Images Donaldson Collection/Getty Images\n\nSirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy during a Los Angeles presidential campaign stop in 1968, was recommended for parole Friday in San Diego.\n\nTwo commissioners of the California Board of Parole made their recommendation after a review of Sirhan's record while in prison and hearing from two of Kennedy's sons, according to The Associated Press. Here's what we know.\n\nIt could take months to have a final decision\n\nThe commissioners' decision is still subject to further review and, ultimately, final approval by the governor of California. That process could take up to 120 days.\n\nSirhan, 77, was convicted of the murder in 1969 and sentenced to death. In 1972 the California Supreme Court ruled capital punishment to be unconstitutional, and Sirhan was resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\n\nThe shooting occurred in the kitchen area of the Ambassador Hotel. Kennedy had just given a victory speech after winning California's Democratic presidential primary and looked likely to win the party's nomination. He and five other people were shot as they made their way through the hotel kitchen.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Harry Benson/Daily Express/Getty Images Harry Benson/Daily Express/Getty Images\n\nSirhan was tackled to the ground, gun in hand, moments after the shooting. But there have long been some people who have advanced alternate versions of what happened that night.\n\nKennedys divided over Sirhan's release\n\nOne theory holds that Sirhan had been hypnotized or programmed to shoot Kennedy. Others think there were other shooters. Kennedy's son Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told The Washington Post he doesn't think Sirhan killed his father.\n\nPaul Schrade, a labor leader who'd worked with the senator, was also shot by Sirhan that night, but he believes Sirhan should be released.\n\n\"Sirhan did not shoot Robert Kennedy,\" Schrade, now 96, maintains. \"I got the first shot, the second shot missed Kennedy.\"\n\nSchrade said unreliable ballistics evidence by the Los Angeles Police Department muddied the case, and as long as Sirhan is in prison, it will make it harder to identify the person who, in Schrade's opinion, really killed Kennedy.\n\n\"Getting him out of the picture means that we have a better chance of making the case,\" Schrade said. \"We can get the second gunman identified and convicted \u2014 the second gunman killed Robert Kennedy!\"\n\nBut the parole board ruling is not intended as an endorsement of the second gunman theory.\n\nAt the hearing, the AP reported that Douglas Kennedy spoke about being moved by the remorse shown by Sirhan over his father's killing.\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr. Sirhan face to face,\" he said. \"I think I've lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.\"\n\nBut most of Robert Kennedy's nine surviving children oppose parole. A few hours after the hearing, six of them, including former Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II, sent NPR a statement saying they were \"devastated\" by the parole recommendation.\n\nThe ruling \"ignores the standards for parole of a confessed, first-degree murderer in the state of California,\" the statement says.\n\n\"Our father's death impacted our family in ways that can never adequately be articulated and today's decision by a two-member parole board has inflicted enormous additional pain,\" the statement said, and called for a reversal of the recommendation by the full parole board or the governor.\n\nThis was his 16th time trying to get parole\n\nSirhan tried and failed to get parole 15 times earlier, with the last hearing in 2016. But this time around, there was no opposition from the new Los Angeles district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, whose office has a policy of not weighing in against parole.\n\nAlso working in Sirhan's favor this time were changes to California law in recent years that make it easier for a prisoner to get parole for a crime committed at a young age. Sirhan was 24 when he shot Kennedy.\n\nIf Sirhan is released, he may face deportation to Jordan. A Palestinian refugee from Israel, he immigrated to the U.S. as a child and never obtained U.S. citizenship."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sirhan-sirhan-receives-death-penalty", "page_content": "On April 23, 1969, Sirhan Sirhan is sentenced to the death penalty after being convicted in the assassination of politician Robert F. Kennedy. In 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty.\n\nIn the early morning hours of June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy, a U.S. senator from New York who had just won California\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, gave a victory speech in the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After the speech, Kennedy was making his way toward the hotel kitchen to greet supporters when he was shot three times at close range by Sirhan Sirhan with a .22 caliber revolver; a fourth bullet went through Kennedy\u2019s jacket. Five other people were shot as well, none fatally. Several of the senator\u2019s friends and aides subdued Sirhan on the scene.\n\nKennedy died at the hospital the next day, June 6, at age 42.

He later stated he killed Robert Kennedy because the senator had supported Israel in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Following a three-month trial, during which Sirhan\u2019s lawyers argued he was mentally unstable at the time of the murder, he was convicted on April 17, 1969. On April 23, he was given the death penalty. However, in 1972, the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty and Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison.
