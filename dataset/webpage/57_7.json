Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013. She has been part of four straight CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\u2026\n\nFamily: Parents Harry and Sharon Van Beilen\u2026 Older brother Nathan\u2026 Younger sister Marya\u2026 Uncle Wayne Van Dorp is a former NHL player\u2026 Cousin Joel Reinders is a CFL offensive lineman\u2026 Getting into the Sport: Learned to swim at age 5 in the backyard pool because she was a chubby child\u2026 Started swimming competitively at age 9\u2026 Was disqualified from her first meet for moving her toes\u2026 Outside Interests: Kinesiology major at the University of British Columbia\u2026 Enjoys baking and cooking\u2026 Played piano for 10 years\u2026 Odds and Ends: Nicknames: Teddy, TVB\u2026 Athlete ambassador for KidSport\u2026 Collects magnets during her travels\u2026 Favourite motto: Do my best, let God do the rest\u2026 Likes to eat yogurt-covered raisings before competing\u2026 Has a maple leaf tattoo on her toe, making it the last thing she sees before diving off the blocks\u2026\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESULTS\n\nFINA World Championships: 2013 \u2013 28th (100m breaststroke), 21st (200m breaststroke)\n\nYouth Olympic Games: 2010 \u2013 GOLD (100m breaststroke), SILVER (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m freestyle relay), 4th (4x100m medley relay)\n\nPan Pacific Championships: 2014 \u2013 12th (100m breaststroke), 12th (200m breaststroke)\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2014 \u2013 6th (100m breaststroke), 9th (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m medley relay)"}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/tera-van-beilen", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1993\n\nFirst Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games London 2012"}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2012/07/16/london_2012_tera_van_beilen_challenging_in_olympic_100m_and_200m_breaststroke.html", "page_content": "When Tera Van Beilen was 9 years old, she did what most 9-year-olds do when left to their own devices.\n\nNothing.\n\nOakville\u2019s Van Beilen was a hyperactive, sporadically sporty kid, but her parents thought she could use some athletic direction.\n\n\u201cI was sort of going through a chubby phase,\u201d Van Beilen says, chin tucked in to her chest and smiling shyly.\n\nThey took Tera to a local club for swimming lessons, half-hoping she\u2019d like it. She was the family\u2019s most enthusiastic user of the backyard pool (she remembers summer days with her sister, Marya, dropping marbles into the deep end, seeing who could come up with the most).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a Eureka moment. Tera liked swimming enough to make it a regular thing. She got pretty good at it pretty fast. The coaches on hand pressed the Van Beilens to intensify Tera\u2019s twice-a-week training schedule.\n\nBut through grade school it remained a hobby and a physical outlet, rather than an obsession.\n\nToday, Van Beilen, a distinctly unchubby 18-year-old, is headed to the London Olympics, a surprise medal contender in the 100m and 200m breaststroke.\n\nGenetics must have something to do with this. Her uncle, Wayne Van Dorp, played for the Blackhawks and the Penguins. Her cousin, Joel Reinders, is an offensive tackle with the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one protecting Eli Manning. Or is it Peyton Manning? I\u2019m not sure. One of the Mannings,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThe illusion of athletic effortlessness is also a family thing. Reinders played only eight games of football at any level before being signed by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLike her gargantuan cousin, Van Beilen\u2019s progression is proof to parents everywhere that a child can master a sport without sacrificing every other thing it means to be a child.\n\n\u201cThey let me have swimming and still have school. I had both worlds,\u201d Van Beilen says.\n\nRight into high school, Van Beilen played other sports. It wasn\u2019t until age 15 that she made swimming her focus.\n\nA great many athletic stories \u2014 both amateur and pro \u2014 start precociously early and are filled with nothing from then on but practice and competition. In an extreme example, 10-year-old Alexander Ovechkin played in a hockey tournament the day after his brother died.\n\nVan Beilen went to a regular school \u2014 Oakville\u2019s Kings Christian Collegiate \u2014 rather than a sporting academy. On Friday nights, she watched Say Yes to the Dress with her mom. She went out with friends on Saturdays. She attended the birthright of all typical teens \u2014 the prom.\n\nEven after swimming became her job, she treated it like one \u2014 a Monday-to-Friday thing. However, it was an exhausting Monday to Friday thing.\n\nShe was cut a few breaks at school. Teachers would occasionally let her go out to her car and sleep through a class. Her mother, Sharon, an administrator at the school, set up a quiet room for Van Beilen to nap through her spares.\n\nShe graduated last year. She now attends Swimming Canada\u2019s branch office in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia. Five of Canada\u2019s pool Olympians were studying and training at UBC last year.\n\nA year ago, the Olympics were a dream for Van Beilen. Literally. She began having dreams about touching the wall, looking up at the clock and seeing herself qualified. She has a picture of the rings pasted over her bed at home and at school.\n\nBut that\u2019s all they were. At that point Van Beilen was ranked 18th in the world in the 100-metre event, and 23rd in the 200-metre. That put her 5th and 3rd, respectively, on Canada\u2019s depth chart in events where only two competitors qualify.\n\nIn February, hope began to turn to belief when she finished first in the 100-metre at the CIS Championships and a narrow second to UBC teammate and fellow Olympian Martha McCabe in the 200.\n\n\u201cThat was when I began to say to myself, \u2018I know I can do this\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn March, she went to the Olympic trials in Montreal. She first qualified in the 100-metre by placing second, a mild surprise. But it was her performance in the 200-metre that brought her to global attention.\n\nVan Beilen finished first in the 200-metre final, pushing third-place finisher and current world record holder Annamay Pierse off Canada\u2019s Olympic team. Her time of 2:24:03 was, at that point, the second fastest in the world this year.\n\nThe day after qualifying, she flew back to Vancouver to sit a physiology exam she had very purposely put out of her mind while she concentrated on the trials. She got a 57.\n\n\u201cMom, I got a 57!\u201d Van Beilen excitedly told her mother. Sharon was less excited.\n\nShe looks pretty excited now, snapping pictures of Star photographer Steve Russell while he takes pictures of Tera sitting on the diving board of that family pool. Sharon\u2019s wearing a Team Van Beilen t-shirt. Tera\u2019s childhood trophies are piled up in boxes in the hallway of their Oakville cottage. They\u2019ve just returned from display at Tera\u2019s grade school.\n\nFather Harry, an executive with Tim Hortons, drifts in on his lunch hour to take in the scene. The Van Beilens didn\u2019t push their daughter into sport, but they\u2019re enjoying watching her flower in that world.\n\n\u201cI think Tera likes it, too,\u201d Harry says, in that teasing way a father says things within earshot of his children.\n\n\u201cLikes what?\u201d Tera says.\n\n\u201cThe attention,\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u201cRight, dad,\u201d Tera drawls sarcastically, 18 going on 13 for just a moment. They catch each other\u2019s eye and smile. This has the feel of a family routine that\u2019s been perfected over many years.\n\nNobody made Tera Van Beilen do anything. Left to her own youthful devices, she has put herself on the cusp of something that will last long after youth has faded.\n\nRELATED\n\nProfile: Diver Jennifer Abel\n\nProfile: Swimmer Julia Wilkinson\n\nProfile: Mountain biker Catharine Pendrel\n\nProfile: Rowing\u2019s Lesley Thompson-Willie\n\nLondon Olympic quiz\n\nKEY COMPETITORS\n\nRebecca Soni, U.S.A.100 and 200 No woman in the world dominates a single stroke the way Soni dominates breaststroke. She has three Olympic medals, has held four world records and is the defending world champion at both the 100m and 200m distance. Soni is the clear favourite in both of Van Beilen\u2019s events.\n\nJessica Hardy, U.S.A.100 The world\u2019s dominant breaststroker until a doping suspension cost her an appearance in Beijing, where Soni eclipsed her. She\u2019s the defending U.S. champion at this distance and the current world record holder.\n\n\u201cOther than those two, it\u2019s pretty close afterward. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s game,\u201d says Van Beilen. \u201cWhoever can deal with the pressure at that moment can succeed. And that\u2019s one thing I think I\u2019m pretty good at.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/tera-van-beilen", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nTera van Beilen was born on 30 March, 1993 in Mississauga, Canada, is a Canadian swimmer.

The swim has won a total of five medals so far in the competition.\n\nLindsay Delmar of Calgary was fifth in the women\u2019s 50 butterfly Wednesday.\n\nThe Youth Olympics are for athletes 14-18 and have attracted more than 3,000 athletes in the same sports program that is set for the 2012 London Games.\n\nRussia has nine golds and 19 medals overall, while China has nine golds and 15 medals overall. Azerbaijan is third with five golds, while Italy has four. Canada has a total of eight medals so far, including three gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s 100 breaststroke, Van Beilen nailed her second length to emerge with the gold in one minute 8.95 seconds. Emily Selig of Australia was second in 1:09.06 and Nicol, first at the turn, followed in third in 1:09.18.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing to win gold,\u201d said the 17-year-old Van Beilen. \u201cI came into this meet wanting to win a medal, and after the prelims and semis I felt I had a shot at the gold. I didn\u2019t realize I was second at the turn, but I saw Rachel beside me and my strength in this race has always been my second half.\u201d\n\nNicol was at a personal best pace on the first length Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI had never gone out that fast before,\u201d Nicol said. \u201cOn the second length I got a bit tired and my stroke shortened a bit. Still I\u2019m not disappointed especially that Tera also got on the podium. It was a really close race and exciting for all of us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Britain\u2019s David Bolarinwa and Jamaica\u2019s Odane Skeen won their qualifying heats in the 100 metres, setting up a much anticipated final between two sprinters touted as the next Usain Bolt.\n\nBolarinwa blew away the field in his heat, finishing in 10.62 seconds. Skeen got out slowly but surged to run 10.63 seconds to beat Thailand\u2019s Jirapong Meenapra.\n\nThe 17-year-old Bolarinwa has the fastest time this year among 16- and 17-year-olds \u2014 a 10.39 in London this month. Skeen, a 16-year-old whose lanky style has some likening him to his compatriot Bolt, ran a 10.46 in Jamaica.\n\n\u201cI thought let me go there, go hard and see if anyone can go faster,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was a good performance overall.\u201d\n\nSkeen was less thrilled with his performance, blaming his slower time on two false starts by other competitors. But he said come Saturday\u2019s final, he would win.\n\nBolarinwa and Skeen will face each other for the first time and are still sizing one another up. Skeen, for example, was surprised to hear that it was Bolarinwa and not himself who has run the fastest 100 this year. Marvin Bracy of the United States ran the second fastest but is not at the Games.\n\nOrganizers of the first Youth Olympics have emphasized participation rather than winning, but that was lost on Bolarinwa and Skeen, who both predicted they would win Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big showdown,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a quick starter. We know that already,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHis pick up is fantastic and so is mine. If I get a good start, he\u2019ll have to take me.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa\u2019s coach John Powell chimed in later: \u201cBring it on.\u201d\n\nBoth boys seemed to relish the comparison to Bolt and their budding rivalry to that of Bolt and Tyson Gay. Told he has been compared to a miniature Bolt, Skeen just smiled and said he one day dreams of surpassing his idol.\n\n\u201cI want to be better than Bolt,\u201d said Skeen, whose goal it is to win gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. \u201cI want to be much more faster.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa enjoyed being likened to the two sprinting greats, but wants to surpass them.\n\n\u201cThese guys are fantastic. You look at what they have done. You want to be better than them,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have them in the back your mind to look up to.\u201d\n\nWatching Skeen\u2019s heat, Powell said he saw some of Bolt in Skeen. But he was quick to point out that a lot can change with an athlete by the time they reach adulthood. He noted that Bolt, for example, started out running 200- and 400-metre before exploding on the stage in the 100.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how they will develop, this is the thing,\u201d Powell said of Skeen. \u201cHe\u2019s about 16 and that is two or three years of formative years as an athlete. He could broaden out. He obviously has a good stride. If I looked at him \u2014 not that you can stereotype athletes these days \u2014 I\u2019d say he is a typical 200-metre runner.\u201d\n\nIn other action Wednesday, Lithuania rower Rolandas Mascinskas upset Germany\u2019s two-time world junior champion German Felix Bach to win the junior men\u2019s single sculls gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s single sculls, Judith Sievers of Germany beat Nataliia Kovalova of Ukraine. Britain beat out Australia for the women\u2019s pair final to claim its second gold in two days and Slovenia edged Greece in the men\u2019s final.\n\nIn men\u2019s 77-kilogram weightlifting, Russia\u2019s Artem Okulov took gold ahead of Thailand\u2019s Chatuphum Chinnawong and Russian lifters won another gold and a silver Wednesday.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/canadian-breaststroker-already-ahead-of-schedule/article4209744/", "page_content": "Swimmer Tera van Beilen, of Oakville, Ont. trains at the UBC Aquatic Centre in Vancouver, B.C., on Thursday May 24, 2012.DARRYL DYCK Share\n\nOutside the Aquatic Centre at the University of British Columbia, a large promotional poster for the school features the face of swimmer Annamay Pierse, who in 2009 set, and still holds, the women's world record in the 200-metre breaststroke.\n\nPierse, however, won't swim at the Olympics in London this summer. At 28, she fell short at Canada's Olympic trials two months ago. It was the gutting end to two years of struggle after having been felled by a bout of Dengue fever, contracted in India during the Commonwealth Games.\n\nAs Pierse failed to reach the Olympics, a bright, young potential star is in ascent. In the 200-metre breaststroke qualifying final in Montreal, in which Pierse finished fifth, the victor was Tera Van Beilen, swimming one of the fastest times in the world this year.\n\nTwo days earlier, the day before her 19th birthday, Van Beilen's joy burst forth in tears as she finished second in the 100-metre breaststroke, scoring her ticket to London, before wowing the Canadian swimming world with her victory in the 200.\n\nVan Beilen attends and swims for UBC, after growing up in Oakville west of Toronto. She's the first big-time swimmer in her athletic family, whose members include uncle Wayne van Dorp, who played in the NHL in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Van Beilen, 5 feet 10 inches, had had the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro among her goals. Now, given her speed at the trials, a medal in London is on the hastily revised list of goals \u2013 or, at least, making the finals of one of her events.\n\n\"It's still a bit of a shock when people say, 'Are you excited to go to London for the Olympics?'\" Van Beilen said in an interview at the UBC pool on Thursday, her eyes alight, smiling, clad in a pink shirt, blue jeans and pink Nike high-tops at poolside. \"It's been crazy having to sign autographs, like, 'For real?'\"\n\nThis weekend at UBC, starting Friday, Van Beilen is among the Olympians in the water as Canada prepares in the pool for London Games at the annual Mel Zajac Jr. International meet.\n\nAfter zero medals in the water in Athens eight years ago \u2013 the first zero in a half-century for Canada \u2013 the national program has been on a years-long rebuild under the watch of Pierre Lafontaine, Swimming Canada CEO and national coach. The country managed one medal, a bronze, in Beijing and aims for three podiums in London.\n\nCompetition at UBC will be significant. On the men's side, South Korean star Tae-Hwan Park is among the attractions. Many top Canadian names, including London medal contender Brent Hayden from Mission near Vancouver, will swim.\n\nFor Van Beilen, the meet is a chance to refine her race pacing, but also to gauge herself. A teammate and rival is fellow Canadian and UBCer Martha McCabe, a 22-year-old who won bronze in the 200-metre breaststroke at the world championships last year, and was second to Van Beilen at the Olympic trials.\n\nAmong international talent, Leisel Jones from Australia will be a considerable force, a 26-year-old who has held the world record in both the 100- and 200-metre breaststroke.\n\nWhile Pierse won't swim at London, her presence in the pool will be felt. She set a rare swimming standard for a Canadian, and as a veteran of UBC, she has been a guiding light for Van Beilen and McCabe. And all three women have benefitted from the top-tier coaching of Jozsef Nagy, the legendary Hungarian breaststroke guru, brought on by Swimming Canada in 2006, a year after Lafontaine arrived to resuscitate the sport in the country.\n\nPierse was among the first to emerge in the new wave of Canadian swimmers. Van Beilen and McCabe are on the starting blocks to be next.\n\n\"Annamay set the tone of what great can be,\" Lafontaine said. \"We don't have enough of those in Canada.\""}, {"url": "https://www.swimontario.com/news/canada-games-legacy-series-tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "April 12, 2022\n\nTera Van Beilen\n\nOver the next few weeks, Swim Ontario is presenting the Canada Games Legacy Series, where we take a look back at swimmers who represented Team Ontario at past Canada Summer Games.\n\nThere is something to be said about inspiring girls to become confident in sport, and believe that greatness is possible.\n\nTera (Van Beilen) Maloney knows that feeling because she has experienced it.

Tap your foot to the music, even sing along if you know the lyrics when you read more about Van Beilen.\n\n\u201cI had a dream so big and loud\n\nI jumped so high I touched the clouds\n\nWo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh\n\nI stretched my hands out to the sky.\u201d\n\nBest Days of My Life, American Authors\n\nIt might be a tune that she may consider attaching to her prosperous swim career.\n\nWhen mentioning the real inauguration to competitive swimming, this might surprise many. It wasn\u2019t any of the events she competed in - the Commonwealth Games, FINA World championships or even the Summer Olympics.\n\nIt all started in 2009, in Charlottetown, P.E.I., at the Canada Summer Games.\n\nCanada\u2019s national spotlight on amateur sport was where Van Beilen would begin to relish fame with a remarkable performance and go on to win six gold medals.\n\n\u201cI remember it very well and asking myself \u2013 how did I do this,\u201d she said in a recent telephone conversation. \u201cAlso, medalling at the Canadian Nationals and realizing that I was able to do more than just the breaststroke, but also compete in the relays and help my team. That was the year that started my competitive swim career.\u201d\n\nWith the beautiful Niagara Region of Ontario hosting the 2022 Canada Summer Games in August, an event that brings together some 5,000 promising athletes, a mere mention of those days brings back fond memories for Van Beilen, who has a Maple Leaf tattoo on one of her toes.\n\n\u201cThe Canada Summer Games were an incredible experience, a special time in my life and a glimpse at top level athletes in many sports,\u201d she said, while also confirming a rumour that she liked to eat yoghurt-covered raisins before competing.\n\n\u201cThings were different in my day, as you could be a National calibre athlete in those Games. But now, it\u2019s really focussed for younger kids with potential \u2013 more of a stepping stone for success, to experience and cherish the moment. It could very well be the start of something big for many.\u201d\n\nWhile she graduated from King\u2019s Christian Collegiate in Oakville, a school that now has the \u201cVan Beilen Endeavour Award\u201d given to a student who excels in arts, music, or sports outside of school, her swim keys to success started with the Oakville Aquatic Club.\n\nChoosing post-secondary education in Canada, over numerous athletic scholarship offers from schools throughout the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Van Beilen picked the University of British Columbia.\n\nNot only did she continue her academic honors success, and left UBC with a Degree in Kinesiology, but she was on the Thunderbirds incredible swim team that won four consecutive Canadian Interuniversity Sports (now re-branded to USports) championships.\n\nThere was also the Swim Youth Olympics in Singapore, where she won three medals, that would come a year after the Canada Summer Games. One who excelled in the breaststroke, Van Beilen would add one major event after another. Then came the electrifying and emotional time in her life that she will never forget.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian Olympic Trials in Montreal, I knew when I had touched the wall that made the qualifying time needed to make Canada\u2019s team for the 2012 Games in London (England),\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the feeling of representing your country at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThat was the same Van Beilen, who didn\u2019t like wearing swim goggles or a bathing cap as a youngster, and preferred to sleep in on mornings devoted to swim practices. That is, until her parents asked her to make a choice between sticking with swimming and its challenges, or packing it in. Judgment time, and she picked swimming and has never looked back.\n\nBoth her parents had been athletes, an uncle played in the National Hockey League and a cousin in the Canadian and National Football Leagues, the genes were in the family.\n\nWith her competitive days eventually now having come to a close, she really hasn\u2019t bid adieu to the sport. She\u2019s now Marketing Manager for Speedo Canada, a company that inspires swimmers by offering up a brand of stylish merchandise.\n\n\u201cSwimming helped me in life and brought me so much joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were many times when I could laugh, cry through my goggles, release so much energy, and allow me to make friends for life.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Grossman is a veteran multi award-winning Journalist and Broadcaster with some of Canada\u2019s major media, including the Toronto Star and SPORTSNET 590 THE FAN, and a Public Relations professional for 45+ years in Canadian sports and Government relations."}]}
