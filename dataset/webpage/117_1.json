Find out about the Stereophonics right here...\n\nWho are Stereophonics?\n\nStarting off as a trio made up of Kelly Jones - who announced a solo album back in October 2020 - Richard Jones and Stuart Cable, the band has transformed over the years with various personnel changes. Richard and Kelly remain, now joined by Adam Zindani on rhythm guitar and Jamie Morrison on drums, with Tony Kirkham as a touring member.\n\nWhen did Stereophonics form?\n\nA teenaged Kelly Jones and Richard Jones began jamming together in around 1989, but the band officially started performing together in 1992.\n\nStereophonics: Who is in the band?\n\nKelly Jones and Richard Jones started the band, and are still in it today. Despite various line-up changes, they've stayed together. Kelly sings main vocals and guitar, and Richard plays bass guitar. Original drummer Stuart Cable was part of the group from the start until he left in 2003; he sadly passed away in 2010.\n\nJavier Weyler took over as drummer in 2004 until 2012, when he was replaced by former The Noisettes drummer Jamie Morrison. Adam Zindani joined as rhythm guitarist in 2007, and Tony Kirkham has been a touring member on the keyboard since 1999.\n\nWhere are Stereophonics from?\n\nThe band originated in the village of Cwmaman in the Cynon Valley in South Wales.\n\nHow did Stereophonics get their band name?\n\nThe band were originally called Tragic Love Company, which was taken from each members' favourite band - the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company. However, promoter Wayne Coleman convinced them to change it in 1992, telling the band they would not perform under the current name.\n\nHe then spotted a gramophone made by Falcon Stereophonic, and told Kelly about it, who - along with the rest of the band - agreed to change the name to The Stereophonics. When they signed their first record deal with V2 in 1996, they dropped 'The' to simply become Stereophonics.\n\nStereophonics: Their career so far\n\n1992: The band is born Kelly and Stuart lived on the same street in Cwmaman, Wales, and began jamming together as teenagers, recording a demo under the name Zephyr. After going their separate ways, Kelly and Stuart reunited a few years later, bringing in Richard Jones as bass guitarist - and thus, the line-up was complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, the trio - then known as Tragic Love Company - began to write together, performing in working men's clubs before landing a gig at the Borderline Club in London. They were spotted by producers Marshall Bird and Steve Bush, and recorded demo 'A Thousand Trees'.\n\n1992 - 1996: Career beginnings and name change Promoter Wayne Coleman organised gigs in South Wales after hearing their demo, and whilst he loved the music - he hated the band name, and said they wouldn't play if they kept it. He then spotted a gramophone manufacturer called Falcon Stereophonic, and the band became The Stereophonics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played the Coliseum Theatre in nearby Aberdare with Catatonia, and were approached by John brand afterwards who immediately became their manager. Just two months later, they were the first artists to sign to label V2, dropping 'The' from the band name.\n\n1997: Debut album and BRIT Award The band's debut album 'Word Gets Around' was released in August 1997, spawning singles 'A Thousand Trees', 'Local Boy in the Photograph' and 'Traffic' to name but a few. In 1998, they won the Best New Group BRIT Award, and released 'The Bartender and the Thief' - the first single from their follow-up, 'Performance and Cocktails', which in turn was released in March 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band played to 50,000 people at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea that year, and also collaborated with Welsh legend Tom Jones on a cover of 'Mama Told Me Not To Come'. They toured Europe, Australia and America in 1999, and performed at Cardiff Castle - later released on DVD.\n\n2001: 'Have A Nice Day' After headlining Reading and Leeds in 2000, third album 'Just Enough Education to Perform' was released in 2001, featuring two of their most famous songs: 'Have a Nice Day' and a cover of 'Handbags and Gladrags', which was included in the re-release in 2002. The band performed a two-day festival, 'A Day at the Races', at Donington Park and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to promote the album, and also headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2002, as well as V Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band put out their fourth album 'You Gotta Go There to Come Back' in 2003, spawning singles 'Maybe Tomorrow', 'Madame Helga' and 'Since I Told You It's Over'. This was the last album to feature drummer Stuart Cable, who was let go from the band in September 2003. They also had their first headline slot at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2004, which they returned to in 2009.\n\n2005: A new line-up Stereophonics released their fifth album 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' in 2005, the first to feature new drummer, Javier Weyler. The album's single 'Dakota' became their first UK Number 1, and they performed that year at Live 8 in Hyde Park, London.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly pictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009.\n\n2007: Kelly goes it alone Kelly also released his first solo album, 'Only the Names Have Been Changed', in 2007. He explained how it came about, \"We were recording the sixth Stereophonics album... And in-between takes I started doing these songs off the cuff. Three or four tracks in I realised that this could actually be something... Strange how it's always little things that makes big things happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly is pictured performing at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2007 - 2010: \u2018Pull The Pin\u2019 'Pull the Pin' was released in October 2007, spawning single 'It Means Nothing' which was written about the London 7/7 attack. Kelly told The Guardian it was \"about the feeling of unease in the city and people realising what was important in their lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey performed at the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver, and released seventh album 'Keep Calm and Carry On', playing a UK tour throughout 2010 to promote it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band are pictured here at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2010: Stuart Cable's death Sadly, former member Stuart Cable passed away in June 2010, and Kelly decided to take a break from writing and releasing albums every two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band released song 'Before Anyone Knew Our Name' in 2017 in memory of Stuart. Kelly said of the song, \"I think, you know, Stuart left the band and we were still friends for seven years. And then he passed away tragically, and of course people have opinions about what happened and all this sort of stuff. We kept it very private because we were like brothers.\"\n\n2009: Isle of Wight Festival We met the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009, where they kindly signed a guitar for us. It's still up on the wall.\n\n2011: New music and another personnel change The band announced on Facebook in 2011 that they were back in the studio, but in 2012 announced that Javier had left the group. Jamie Morrison of The Noisettes replaced him, and they released eighth album 'Graffiti on the Train' in March 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at Hyde Park in 2012 at the Olympics Opening Ceremony concert.\n\n2012: Isle of Wight Festival Our presenter Sarah Champion caught up with Kelly backstage at the Isle of Wight festival 2012 and the pair chatted away in our camper van. As you do.\n\n2015: 'Keep the Village Alive' Stereophonics impressively released a ninth album in September 2015, entitled 'Keep the Village Alive' which topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained singles 'C'est la Vie' and 'I Wanna Get Lost with You'. They also performed a set for us at the Dingwalls venue in Camden (pictured).\n\n2016: Backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival We had a chat with the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016 - but there was a slight mishap when guitarist Adam Zindani fell through the deck chair...\n\n2016: Backstage at Isle of Wight Festival take two Thankfully, we were able to get Adam a different chair and complete the interview... Oops!\n\n2017: 'Scream Above the Sounds' The band made their 10th album in 2017, releasing 'Scream Above the Sounds' in October. This realised Kelly's dream that they would put out their 10th studio album in the 20th anniversary year of their debut, instead of releasing a Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016.\n\n2019: 'Kind' But they didn't stop there, getting straight back in the studio to record their eleventh album, 'Kind', which was released in October 2019 and reached Number 1 in the UK. They also embarked on their tour to promote the album, kicking off in Liverpool on 18th January and concluding in Cardiff on 15th March.\n\n2020: Kelly Jones 'Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day' 2020 saw frontman Kelly Jones release his album 'Don't Let The Devil Take Another Day'. The work contained 21 reworked tracks from throughout the Stereophonics' career, and even had its own documentary! The 90-minute feature tells the heartfelt story of the Stereophonics frontman/songwriter, following his personal uphill battle as he rediscovered his voice.\n\n2022: Stereophonics release 12th album 'Oochya!' and UK tour On 6th September 2021, Stereophonics announced that their 12th studio album will be titled 'Oochya!', and released it on Friday 4th March 2022! They later went on a huge tour to support the album's release throughout March and April.\n\n2023: Far From Saints Kelly teamed up with Austin's Patty Lynn and Dwight Baker to create new band Far From Saints, who released their debut single 'Let's Turn This Back Around' in January 2023. They're planning to release their album later this year and also preparing to tour the new music.\n\n\n\nWhat is Far From Saints?\n\nFar From Saints is lead singer Kelly Jones' new band with Austin\u2019s Patty Lynn and Dwight Baker (aka The Wind and The Wave). According to the band's publicist, they first started jamming together when Patty and Dwight performed as the support acts to Kelly's solo UK tour in 2019.\n\n\"The three found themselves jamming and co-writing songs in backstage hallways, dressing rooms, soundchecks and hotels,\" a press release explains. \"Each songwriter subconsciously merging their influences to nourish the alchemy between two formidable singers.\"\n\nAfter releasing their debut single 'Let\u2019s Turn This Back Around' in January 2023, the trio are preparing to put out an album in the summer of 2023 and tour the record.\n\nDavid Bowie inspired Stereophonics\u2019 biggest hit \u2018Dakota\u2019\n\nSpeaking on stage at The O2 in London during Stereophonics\u2019 February/March 2020 UK arena tour, Kelly Jones said David Bowie inspired him to write the smash hit \u2018Dakota\u2019. Stereophonics supported David Bowie on his 2003/2004 North American tour and struck up an immediate friendship.\n\nExplaining that Bowie often watched their soundchecks, Kelly said: \"David Bowie would be watching, so we didn\u2019t want to waste too much of his time. So, we\u2019d play a song for maybe 45 seconds, and then another song for like a minute, and then maybe another song for a minute, and then maybe 30 seconds of a song.\n\nHe continued: \"Then I would walk off the stage and I would walk towards the dressing room, and (Bowie) would put his arm on my shoulder and he would walk with me and say, 'You know, if you extended a few of those songs, you might be f---ing onto something'. So, I wrote this song, this is called \u2018Dakota\u2019.\"\n\nWATCH: Kelly Jones on the history of Stereophonics\n\nWhen was Stereophonics' latest album released?\n\nStereophonics' 12th studio album, 'Oochya!', was released on Friday 4th March 2022.

Violins and Tambourines (Graffiti on the Train, 2013)\n\n\u201cThis track is excellent. I love the moodiness of it. A real story teller song, amazing lyrics. Great build up too, reminds me of Fleetwood Mac and their build up with the track \u2018The Chain\u2019 BUT BETTER\u201d\n\n14. Indian Summer (Graffiti on the Train 2013)\n\n\u201cThe lyrics is just mesmerizing. The tune is so catchy and an epic song for their new drummer to introduce himself to the Stereophonics fans.\u201d\n\n13. Have a Nice Day (Just Enough Education to Perform, 2001)\n\n\u201cWith notorious influences from the Baroque pop mesenteron, some very obvious ba-ba-ba-ba and a touch of optimism too typical of the beginning of the century, this single does not seem to dazzle on its own merits.\u201d\n\n12. Superman (Language. Sex. Violence. Other?, 2005)\n\n\u201cThis is a really catchy song. It has a different vibe from the rest of their songs and really stands out for me. I always hum to the tune.\u201d\n\n11. Graffiti on the Train (Graffiti on the Train 2013)\n\n\u201cI have been a fan of the Stereophonics for years. I just stumbled across this track, It is so haunting! Kelly Jones sings with such emotion, can\u2019t stop listening to it!\u201d\n\n10. Just Looking (Performance And Cocktails, 1999)\n\n\u201cBrilliant. The way Kelly sings this song in that inimitable style of his is, makes you want to sing out loud wherever you are.\u201d\n\n9. Mr. Writer (Just Enough Education to Perform, 2001)\n\n\u201cThis song is about a journalist who was with Stereophonics on tour. He had fun, spend time and had launch with Stereophonics. After the tour, he left for work, he wrote a humiliating article about the band. A few days later Kelly Jones (lead singer) composed this song about him.\u201d\n\n8. Handbags and Gladrags (Just Enough Education to Perform, 2001)\n\n\u201cInstant classic! Those that don\u2019t like this song don\u2019t appreciate good music.. This song was redone \u2013 yes however it was redone with so much class and style it outdid the original and its artists. It was so good you might even think that it\u2019s a young and more polished Rod Stewart singing this\u201d\n\n7. Traffic (Word Gets Around, 1997)\n\n\u201cAn absolute classic, list to one of the live performances and the crowd getting behind the band A belter. Builds to an amazing chorus. Classic Stereophonics track that I have always loved.\u201d\n\n6. More Life In a Tramps Vest (Word Gets Around, 1997)\n\n\u201cThis is such a funky song. The vocals and guitar riffs are superb. Firm favorite of many early Phonics tracks for me. Uplifting.\u201d\n\nSee more: The Killers Albums Ranked\n\n5. The Bartender and the Thief (Live at Cardiff Castle, 1998)\n\n\u201cThe song is about meeting a couple in a bar \u2013 the bartender and the thief. They fall in love and end up moving to Spain to start a new life \u2013 not an entirely honest one by the last line!\u201d\n\n4. A Thousand Trees (Word Gets Around, 1997)\n\n\u201cLove this song it always brings back fond memories and always great atmosphere when played! Love this track it is a Phonics classic for me that I will always play.\u201d\n\n3. Local Boy in the Photograph (Word Gets Around, 1997)\n\n\u201cNot only my favorite phonics song, but my favorite song ever! Great lyrics, which hold unbelievable memories from most certainly the greatest album ever! Also a great atmosphere when this song is played live.\u201d\n\n2. Maybe Tomorrow (You Gotta Go There to Come Back, 2003)\n\n\u201cThis song holds all of the characteristics that allow it to stand out as one of the best songs ever. The meaning of the lyrics, guitar playing, tune, and overall quality is just amazing. Also, it\u2019s something that almost every person that hears it can relate to at some point in their life.\u201d\n\n1. Dakota (Language. Sex. Violence.

I loved all the funky James Brown stuff from the '70s, even the disco stuff when I was a kid growing up in the '80s. I already knew I wanted to be in a band, but as soon as I heard Andy Fraser from Free - y\u2019know, All Right Now and Mr Big - it was like, \u2018That\u2019s my place.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was heavily competitive to play guitar around where we grew up, but there were only two or three bass players in the town. Kelly [Jones, guitar/vocals] and Stuart [Cable, late drummer] were already in a band, so I took over while the bass player was on holiday\u2026 and he\u2019s been on holiday ever since!\u201d\n\nWhat was your first bass?\n\n\u201cWhen I was 13, I had a milk round, so I saved up a couple of hundred quid and went down to Cranes Music in Cardiff. For some reason, my eyes settled on a Hohner fretless bass, haha! But it was a good starting point for getting good ears, because to play along, you had to be in the right places.\n\n\u201cMy first bassline was Peter Gunn. I\u2019d keep on playing that over and over. I remember being up in my bedroom with my parents shouting up at me: \u2018Learn something else\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nDo you play five- or six-string bass?\n\n\u201cI play mainly four, but I do have a five-string and whenever a producer goes, \u2018We need something really low,\u2019 I\u2019ll chuck it on there because it\u2019s far easier than detuning and what have you. There\u2019s been tracks like Superman and Devil - and I used the five-string on the track Sunny, too. That\u2019s got a real down-low feel.\u201d\n\nDo you play slap bass?\n\n\u201cI have a muck-around when we\u2019re jamming. I loved Flea growing up - so I like trying to emulate him and Les Claypool. But I\u2019m not the best at it. When you\u2019re a musician, it\u2019s easy to overplay things - but it\u2019s really about listening to the vocals, the melody the drums and the rhythm - and finding something in between so they all complement each other.\u201d\n\nWhat gear do you use?\n\nAndy Fraser did a lot of the filling in - and that [approach] kind of helped me when I joined Kelly and Stuart\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the Stereophonics, I had to do jury service with the local courts - and the good thing about jury service is that you can tell them you earn \u00a3500 a week and they pay your wages. I was there for three weeks and they gave me about \u00a31,600, so I borrowed \u00a3300 off my brother and bought a Wine Red Fender Jazz from about \u201992.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in New York for the first time, I bought a lovely \u201974 P-Bass too - because me and Kelly wanted to get a guitar from the year we were born. But my Yamaha BB P34 has the sound I\u2019ve been after for God knows how long.\u201d\n\nWho are your influences?\n\n\u201cNumber one would be Andy Fraser. Free were basically a three-piece with a vocalist who didn\u2019t play, and everything worked really well. He did a lot of the filling in and that kind of helped me when I joined Kelly and Stuart. That\u2019s what I had to do, too - fill in a lot of the spaces, because we were only a three-piece.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I loved Andy Fraser\u2019s groove - and he looked so cool in that Isle Of Wight footage. Numbers two and three would be a fight between Flea and John Entwistle. I like the way that Robert DeLeo from Stone Temple Pilots plays, too. He\u2019s a real stylish player - he\u2019s very good with melodies.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/kelly-jones-of-stereophonics-im-just-so-proud-of-my-trans-son-colby/41360528.html", "page_content": "The singer/songwriter opens up about his family, Keith Richards\u2019s strict backstage rule about shepherd\u2019s pie, the wise advice he got from David Bowie, and his wife\u2019s Irish roots\n\nStereophonics in HMV on Grafton Street, Dublin, in 2001. From left, the late Stuart Cable, Kelly Jones and Richard Jones\n\nThree years ago, Stereophonics singer Kelly Jones wrote \u2018Fly Like an Eagle\u2019 about what he believed was his teenage daughter Bootsy Lolita\u2019s coming-out as a lesbian. It transpired he was wrong.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a sexuality thing at first,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it turned out to be a gender thing.\u201d Bootsy was transitioning into Colby. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing story. It was a very hard thing for a family to deal with, because we didn\u2019t really know much about that, or what that was,\u201d says the singer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of him. Colby was in an all-girls school. Now he is in sixth form college in the BRIT School [a British performing arts and technology college in Croydon] doing digital design with lots of like-minded people.\n\n\"He is getting on really well. He\u2019s 17. So I\u2019m sure when he gets to 18 or 19 the story will evolve even more. The family is all behind him.\u201d\n\nJones has two children, Colby and Misty, by his ex-partner, fashion designer Rebecca Walters, and two children, Riley and Marley, with his wife, MTV producer Jakki Healy. \u201cEvery kid in our house has got a different story. We have a 17-year-old, a 15-year-old, a six-year-old, and another child who\u2019s almost two. There is a lot of drama.\n\n\u201cWe are not the type of family that goes around saying how great dad is,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAll they want to know is, \u2018What\u2019s for f**king dinner?\u2019 They had a laugh when our last album Kind came out and it went to Number 1 and Kanye West was Number 2, because they know Kanye West.\u201d\n\nWhatever about laughs, the release of the new Stereophonics album Oochya! in a fortnight\u2019s time should give the Jones household in London some insight into their father. On \u2018Made a Mess of Me\u2019, he reflects on \u201cwhen you get into a relationship first, and they bend your head\u201d.\n\nElsewhere on what is the band\u2019s 12th studio album, the song \u2018All I Have is You\u2019 concerns itself with serendipity and destiny. \u201cIt is about realising stuff about life, and about hope, and chance encounters in life,\u201d says the rock star \u2013 who is worth an estimated \u00a321.8m and whose band have sold over 10 million albums.\n\nKelly Jones was born in 1974, in Cwmaman, Wales. His father Arwyn, a singer in Oscar and the Kingfishers, was a major influence. The film tastes of Kelly\u2019s three older brothers had a big effect on him, too. At seven, he\u2019d be sent down to the local pub in his PJs (by his brothers who were supposed to be babysitting him) to pick up pirate video copies of movies like The Deer Hunter and The French Connection.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew my dad,\u201d he says, \u201cso I was allowed in the pub. The owner, Cliff Chips, would let me go in the back to pick a film. It was OK once I picked from the bottom drawer, where all the cool films were \u2013 and not from the top drawer. That\u2019s where the blue films were.\u201d\n\nFrom the age of 10, he played guitar and sang with his friend Stuart Cable, who lived eight doors up the street and played drums. In 1986, they played together at the local working men\u2019s club. In 1991, they formed Tragic Love Company with Richard Jones (no relation) on bass. In time, the name was changed to Stereophonics.\n\nThey were in earnest about what they did. People noticed that. They would jokingly refer to Kelly and Stuart as Bono and The Edge. But the seriousness paid off, and in 1996, they signed to Richard Branson\u2019s V2 label, releasing their debut album Word Gets Around a year later.\n\nIn March 1997, they released their first single \u2018Local Boy in the Photograph\u2019. Kelly has bittersweet memories of the local boy he immortalised in song. His name was Paul David Boggis.\n\n\u201cI met the kid first when I was playing under-14s for my county football side. He played full-back. Then, when I was about 16 and working in a fruit and veg stall, I\u2019d meet him. He was a good kid.\n\n\"I think he was having some trouble at home. He came in the market one day and was asking about the trains. Then I found out what happened.\u201d\n\nPaul died when he was struck by a train travelling between Cwmbach and Aberdare. Kelly read about it on the front of the local newspaper, with a picture of Paul, captioned: \u2018Local boy in the photograph.\u2019\n\n\"I was 18. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor writing words into a book. I didn\u2019t know that anyone would ever hear them.\u201d\n\nMany people heard them. In 1998, Stereophonics received a Brit Award for best new band.\n\n\u201cI was very intense about songwriting and what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nIn 2003 they supported The Rolling Stones on their European tour. It was not without incident.\n\nStereophonics in HMV on Grafton Street, Dublin, in 2001. From left, the late Stuart Cable, Kelly Jones and Richard Jones\n\n\u201cThe rule was that Keith Richards is the only person allowed to bust the crust on Keith Richards\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie in his dressing room. And of course the first thing Stuart did after he had a few beers was bust the crust on Keith\u2019s pie. They had to send it back and get another one, before Keith saw it.\u201d\n\nLater that year Stuart was sacked from the band for \u2018commitment\u2019 issues. He and Kelly would later patch up their differences, but he never returned to the band he co-founded as a kid.\n\nIn 2004, David Bowie asked Stereophonics to open for him on his Reality tour in America.\n\n\u201cHe would read some of the ideas I had written for lyrics and stories and watch us rehearse. There was one time we were playing a minute of one song and a minute of another song. He came up to me and put his arm around me and said: \u2018If you extended a few of those songs you might be on to something!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was as a result of that advice that he wrote \u2018Datoka\u2019. In March 2005, when it went to the top of the charts in the UK, Noel Gallagher contacted him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your first Number 1,\u201d texted the Oasis rock god. Then he added in capital letters: \u201cBUT YOU USED A F***ING SYNTHESIZER!\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Kelly released his solo album Only the Names Have Been Changed.\n\nOn June 7, 2010, Stuart was found dead on his kitchen floor by his girlfriend at home in Llwydcoed. He had vomited and choked after a drinking session of whiskey and vodka that started three days earlier.\n\n\u201cI remember the size of his mouth and his laugh,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cAnd him walking around dressing rooms naked \u2013 slapping people with a towel. He was f***ing crazy. But he was my best mate.\n\n\"We started this whole thing together when I was very young. He was probably the first fan of my lyrics. He would be the one who would encourage me the most when I was writing. We would take the piss out of each other and have scrapes. But we were very close.\u201d\n\nKelly Jones and Jakki Healy outside St Senan's Church, Kilrush, Co Clare. Picture by Eamon Ward\n\nIn 2013, Kelly married girlfriend Jakki in St Senan\u2019s Church, Kilrush, Co Clare. \u201cShe was born in Acton in London, but her mum and dad are from Clare. So we got married there. It was a brilliant weekend.\u201d\n\nThe weekend earlier this month, when Wales were beaten by Ireland 29-7 in the Six Nations rugby, was not so brilliant.\n\n\u201cI was winding my brother-in-law up about the score, because he\u2019s Irish. I said to him, \u2018You sound like a bloody Englishman gloating today.\u2019 Wales are in transition. We will recover.\u201d\n\nHe is less hopeful for Britain as a whole, because of Brexit. \"It\u2019s going to take a long time for the country to find its feet again. Talk to people in Wales. You had people in the same house who voted differently.\u201d\n\nWas his family home a Labour household?\n\n\u201cBack in the day it was. That\u2019s what made sense in Wales then. People are changing now because politics is not what it was when we were younger. There were two parties \u2013 Labour and the Tories \u2013 who clearly had two different arguments. Nobody is saying anything different now.\n\n\"When you watched Arthur Scargill or Margaret Thatcher on the telly in the 1980s, they were fighting for something.\u201d\n\nHe was nine when the miners\u2019 strike began in March 1984. \u201cI remember it very clearly. I was in school. We had all gas fires and I remember some guy on our street was referred to as a \u2018scab\u2019 at the time. There was a lot of that going on, abuse.\n\n\"My father\u2019s father was a miner, and Thatcher was terrible for the miners. My wife\u2019s mother was a nurse. So her version of Thatcher is different, because Thatcher did all right for the nurses.\n\n\u201cIt was a clear argument down the middle. Today\u2019s politicians aren\u2019t like that. You can\u2019t f***ing read one from the other. They just want to get to the top.\u201d\n\nAs will Kelly when Stereophonics release their new album Oochya! on March 4."}, {"url": "https://peopleai.com/fame/identities/stereophonics", "page_content": "How about Stereophonics's origin?\n\nStereophonics Origin: Cwmaman, United Kingdom\n\nHow about Stereophonics's skos genre?\n\nStereophonics Skos genre: Rock, Tropipop\n\nWhat is Stereophonics biggest hit?\n\n\"Dakota\" was the first and to date only Stereophonics single to reach number one and the last to reach the top ten on the UK Singles Chart and to chart on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nHow big are Stereophonics?\n\nWith over 30 years under their belt, not to mention eight Number 1 albums and 11 Top 10 singles, it's no wonder that Stereophonics are one of the biggest bands to ever come out of the UK.\n\nWhat are the Stereophonics doing now?\n\nWe're still playing arenas, we're still playing stadiums, and the songs are still on the radio.
