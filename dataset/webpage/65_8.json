The Sounders are 3-0 with their full complement of international stars (8-2-1 over all), outscoring opponents 9-1 in those games.\n\nAfter signing Michelle French as the head coach, the club obtained the Mexican midfielder Veronica Perez and the U.S. national team players Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Sydney Leroux and Stephanie Cox.\n\n\u201cSeattle is just a great soccer city,\u201d Morgan said after a recent game. \u201cYou can just tell, with the fans that come out to the women\u2019s game, the fans that come out to the men\u2019s game. It\u2019s been really exciting, being able to play in front of such a large crowd for a semiprofessional team.\u201d\n\nThe foundation to support a star-studded roster was started in 2001 by the current team\u2019s co-owner Mike Jennings. Adrian Hanauer, the majority shareholder and general manager of the club when it was in the United Soccer Leagues, and local coach Teddy Mitalas joined Jennings in starting a women\u2019s team to complement the men\u2019s club, which is now in Major League Soccer (with Hanauer remaining as the acting general manager).\n\nWhen the Sounders entered M.L.S. in 2009, the women\u2019s club was sold to Jennings, who also owned the Tacoma Tide, a local Premier Development League men\u2019s club. The Tide struggled financially in recent years, playing in empty stadiums for its final two seasons before being absorbed by the Sounders.\n\nThe Tide is now known as the Sounders\u2019 under-23 team, and the women\u2019s team also now plays under the Sounders\u2019 banner. The new incarnation of the Sounders Women wears the same rave green uniforms as the big club when it plays on the artificial turf at CenturyLink Field.\n\nIt is no secret that the collapse of Women\u2019s Professional Soccer, the three-year-old Division I league, gave clubs like the Sounders Women a chance to sign the national team stars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that we have the W-League,\u201d Cox said. \u201cBut I know it was hard. The announcement came pretty quick, with the transfer window, so a lot of players who were maybe looking to go overseas or had other plans, it was hard for them to kind of transition.\u201d\n\nEvery year, W.P.S. and its predecessor, W.U.S.A., struggled to stay afloat. Only a handful of clubs managed to make ends meet and stay in business, while the West Coast was left out of the equation after teams in Los Angeles and the Bay Area came and went.\n\n\u201cI think you kind of just get used to it,\u201d Cox said of the uncertain situation. \u201cEvery year with the league was like, O.K., somebody\u2019s folding \u2014 is it going to come back? Especially the last two years.\u201d\n\nOf the former W.P.S. clubs, the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars and Western New York Flash are the only three left. They play in the Women\u2019s Premier Soccer League, which like the W-League, is considered semiprofessional and a rung below a first division.\n\nPlayers and fans eternally hope for the return of a Division I women\u2019s league. And Seattle certainly makes a strong case for inclusion as it keeps attracting impressive crowds. Even when the Sounders men\u2019s team played at home on June 20, the women still managed to attract 3,500 fans to the 4,500-seat Starfire Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re attracting a lot of fans and supporters,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a really good job of marketing us.\u201d\n\nMorgan added, \u201cThe organization of this team has been tremendous, and I really hope that they do come together as a professional team.\u201d\n\nThat would have to happen quickly, however, or more of the elite American players will go overseas, players like Keelin Winters, a former Sounders midfielder and uncapped national team player who now plays for the German Bundesliga champion and UEFA Champions League semifinalist Turbine Potsdam. After the W-League season, Sounders forward Megan Manthey is going overseas to play for Saint-Etienne in France.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of an option because with a semiprofessional league here in the States, it\u2019s only a three- or four-month league, and for me personally, it\u2019s not enough to play four months out of the year,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI need to be in a league that\u2019s somewhere from 8 to 10 months, and that\u2019s what overseas gives you.\u201d\n\nCox said players would rather stay home if they have the opportunity and the salaries are comparable. What the European teams usually have going for them are closer working relationships with clubs that sponsor both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams.\n\n\u201cAs far as pay goes, I think that some of the American players over there, especially national team players, are kind of rare, so the pay is a little bit more,\u201d Cox said. \u201cAs far as the level goes, I know that the W.P.S. \u2014 even though there were only five or six teams \u2014 the disparity between the teams was so small. Every game was a challenge, and that\u2019s not true of other leagues. They have more teams, but from top to bottom, it\u2019s not as strong compared to the W.P.S.\u201d\n\nFor now, the W-League will have to do, but the real test will come in the next two years, Cox said, both for the Sounders and the women\u2019s game in the United States.\n\n\u201cNext year will be real interesting, to see what happens,\u201d she said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a World Cup. It will kind of be an off year for the national team. So it will be interesting to see what all of the national team players decide to do.\u201d\n\nLiviu Bird reports on all things Cascadia for Prost Amerika (prostamerika.com).

The London Olympics were coming up that summer, where the U.S. women\u2019s national team was a frontrunner for gold, although maybe not if all of its players were suddenly without clubs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeelin Winters felt a mixture of dread and surprise when she heard of the WPS\u2019s demise. She\u2019d been a finalist for the league\u2019s rookie of the year award the season prior with the Boston Breakers. That hardly mattered now. She was a standout for the U.S. U-23 team, with a realistic shot of making the Olympic roster.\n\nOn top of everything else, the European transfer window shut at the end of that dreadful January, leaving players with basically no time to scramble abroad to one of the couple of pro leagues still going at that time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018Well shit,\u2019\u201d Winters said. \u201c\u2018How am I going to get the training? How am I going to get games in?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the players reeled, freshly installed Seattle Sounders Women general manager Amy Carnell sensed an opportunity.\n\nHer club played in the W-League, which then was fully amateur, an unpaid mix of prep prospects, college players and older vets not quite ready to give up the dream. Winters had played in the W-League as a high schooler in Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience for me in high school, but like as a competitive high schooler,\u201d Winters said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a difference between a pro player who was 23, 24, 25 years old. versus a 17- or 18-year-old high school player, and I don\u2019t mean that in any kind of disrespectful way.\u201d\n\nBut look, the USWNT players need somewhere to play, to stay even reasonably sharp. And Carnell had a friend of a friend who was close to Hope Solo, so the GM picked up her phone and took a shot.\n\nThat\u2019s how some of the biggest stars in women\u2019s soccer ended up playing in a minor league, in front of capacity crowds who were just as stunned to see them there as they were to be there. It was a historical quirk that happened less than a decade ago, but already feels like the realm of fiction.\n\nDespite sharing a name with a club that was then the darling upstart of Major League Soccer, the Sounders Women were a loose relation, and something of a bare-bones operation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe only affiliation between the W-League Sounders Women and Sounders FC was a very simple licensing agreement that the Sounders arranged with the owners of the Sounders Women,\u201d Carnell said. \u201cThat was really it: \u2018Hey, you can use the name, follow these guidelines.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nCarnell\u2019s first task as the team\u2019s general manager, then, was to build some buzz and create their own identity.\n\n\u201cI think it was shocking to everyone when we heard about the (WPS) folding,\u201d Carnell said. \u201cBut once that happened, immediately I started thinking, where are these players going to play? We figured we could take a shot in the dark and just see.\u201d\n\nSolo was the most obvious fit: a native of Richland, WA, she was also a four-year starter at the University of Washington on Seattle\u2019s north side.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing that could happen is that Hope just says no,\u201d Carnell said. \u201cI reached out to Hope and then it escalated from there.\u201d\n\nSolo didn\u2019t require much of a pitch. She was in. Carnell grew more ambitious: \u201cSo then I asked her, \u2018How many other players can we sign?\u2019\u201d\n\nSydney Leroux shared an agent with Solo, and having grown up just over the border in Surrey, British Columbia, knew the region well. Alex Morgan\u2019s then-boyfriend and now-husband, Servando Carrasco, was a midfielder for the Sounders, so she was also an easy sell. Morgan\u2019s agent also represented Megan Rapinoe, who went to school down the road at the University of Portland and was also intrigued.\n\nUSWNT outside back Steph Cox grew up with Rapinoe and was a teammate of her\u2019s at UP, and her husband worked in the Seattle area. Cox reached out to Carnell asking for a roster spot. A team that, as an amateur club, couldn\u2019t even pay its players suddenly didn\u2019t even have to actively recruit U.S. internationals. The squad grew steadily more formidable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth the players and team were clear-eyed about the fact that this was a short-term arrangement. The U.S. stars were only going to be there for the first half of the season before departing for pre-Olympic camp, then the Games themselves.\n\n\u201cYou kind of just take one year at a time, and take advantage of your opportunities,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ever feel too set on the future. Try to enjoy the moment, and enjoy the team environment as much as you can. So yeah, the Sounders definitely didn\u2019t seem like a forever thing. I don\u2019t think we thought the W-League was going to become pro or something. But it was nice, for the first time, to be back at home, living with my husband while I was playing.\u201d\n\nAnd Rapinoe, too. The situation was so tentative that Rapinoe didn\u2019t even bother shopping for an apartment in Seattle. She just moved in with the Coxes, crashing in a spare room, the pair of former Portland Pilots carpooling to every game.\n\n\u201cObviously she has a big personality and is a lot of fun,\u201d Cox said. \u201cBut at home she\u2019s pretty chill and relaxed. I remember one time her mom and her aunt came up and made us fried chicken, and one night Megan made a big pot of Rapinoe red sauce. I still have that recipe and make it every once in a while. Some really good memories.\u201d\n\nStar-studded roster complete, capacity crowds began to follow \u2014 a portent of things to come, a sign that the women\u2019s game might have been in a rough patch but that there was still a bright future ahead.\n\nStarfire Stadium in Tukwila, a southern suburb of Seattle, has hosted some wild matches over the years. The pre-MLS Sounders won the 2007 USL Championship there. And it became the defacto home for U.S. Open Cup matches for much of the team\u2019s MLS era \u2014 it was there that Marcus Hahnemann chugged a beer, shirtless, in front of the supporters\u2019 section after triumphing in a penalty shootout, and where Clint Dempsey was ejected for tearing up a referee\u2019s notebook.\n\nYou can make a case that the venue is even more intimidating than a sold-out CenturyLink Field, with 4,500 fans in close proximity to the field and the liquid encouragement of a beer garden right there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who were there swear Starfire has rarely been louder than that afternoon in the early spring of 2012 when the USWNT-infused Sounders Women made their debut. Their first game was a friendly against the University of Washington, and it sold out more than three weeks in advance.\n\n\u201cIn the W-League, we went from barely having anybody there for the first preseason game to all of a sudden needing walkways for the players to walk through, walkways that would be lined with hundreds of little kids and their families,\u201d head coach Michelle French said. \u201cThe posters, selling out Starfire, with a packed beer garden in one of the corners every single game. It was one of the most exciting, memorable crowds for a lot of people, I think. And not just because of the national team players \u2014 it was the beginning of a movement that really started to signal what kind of success women\u2019s soccer could have in the city of Seattle.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s national team had played in the city before, but those were fleeting glimpses. This time, the country\u2019s stars were wearing home colors, and here on a weekly basis. They belonged to Seattle, even if only for a few months.\n\n\u201cThe thing that stood out to me the most was the energy of the crowd, and how it really brought the women\u2019s soccer community together,\u201d Carnell said. \u201c\u2026 I remember seeing 10-, 11-, 12-year-old girls out there holding signs and screaming for their heroes. At that point, I realized we had created something special.\u201d\n\nThose who had played in the Pacific Northwest before knew how important that level of excitement was for the club and for the women\u2019s game, in general. But they weren\u2019t necessarily surprised by it.\n\nThe University of Portland set the national attendance record while Cox and Rapinoe were there, and during their run to the 2005 national championship, they sold out their home quarterfinal against Notre Dame in less than five minutes, according to Cox. A few years later, Winters also played collegiately at UP. The match she attended on her recruiting visit was standing-room only, students wrapped around the outside of Merlo Field waiting to get in. That\u2019s what sold her on the school.\n\n\u201cI got the vibe on campus that the women\u2019s soccer team was like a men\u2019s football team in terms of being the big deal on campus,\u201d Winters said. \u201cIt was unlike any other experience, still, that I ever had in my life. There\u2019s something special about the northwest, in terms of the soccer culture and the fandom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early 2012, in the aftermath of the demise of the WPS and unsure of where her career would go from there, the validation of Northwest soccer fans was precisely what she needed.\n\n\u201cI remember the players\u2019 faces being all over \u2014 in the city, on the banners at Starfire, everywhere,\u201d Winters said. \u201cIt was kind of cool to walk in on game day and feel like that complex was for you. It made us feel a little more important, and more professional, and that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThere are highlights from that season that all of the coaches and players look back on fondly, snapshots that illustrate how odd of a setup all of this was.\n\n\u201cThere were moments when Pinoe would make something look so exceptionally easy that was so difficult for every other soccer player, and there was always the flair and the personality that she played with,\u201d French said. \u201cThis was even before she hit the big scene. You look up and see Alex and Syd playing together up front, you could always expect something to happen. They all made everything look exceptionally easy.\u201d\n\nThe 2012 Sounders Women team was far from the USWNTers plus a bunch of scrubs, though.\n\nWinters would fall short of making that Olympic team, but she would go on to become the long-time captain of the Seattle Reign in the NWSL. Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez made 84 appearances for the Mexico national team and Kate Deines was four-time All-Pac 12 at the University of Washington.\n\n\u201cThere was this collection of players on this semi-pro team who, as a coach, all you had to do was put them on the field and let them do their thing \u2014 and that\u2019s from the national team players to all of the others who were exceptional in their own right,\u201d French said.\n\nAs much excitement as the superstars generated \u2014 and taken as a given that no team in the world would willingly turn away prime Hope Solo, Alex Morgan and/or Megan Rapinoe if they showed up wanting to play \u2014 the arrangement did make for some roster complications.\n\nThe U.S. players did not travel to away games, nor did they regularly practice with the rest of the team, preferring to keep up with their national team regiments in individual sessions. They were only there for game action, and even then just about five home matches before they headed out for good.\n\n\u201cIt was an interesting dynamic, for sure, having all these all-stars coming in and essentially bumping players from their spots,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was awkward, but it was a given: yeah these players are coming in and taking spots, and when they\u2019re not there, the other players get their spots back.\u201d\n\nSo not only did the Sounders Women front office have to make sure they had capable replacements to fill in when the big names were gone, it was up to the coaching staff to manage what could have been a delicate locker room chemistry.\n\n\u201cThe attitude and mentality of the other players was that they all wanted to be successful on their own right \u2014 either individually or as a team,\u201d French said. \u201cThey just looked at it as a great opportunity to be a part of a really cool one-off. It really wasn\u2019t that complicated. It was a conversation up front with the national team players, and a conversation up front with those who were going to be there for the whole season. This is something that you can 100 percent buy in to and enjoy. The transparency and honesty up front was the biggest thing.\u201d\n\nFor French, who went on to coach the U.S. U-20s and is now the head coach at UP, that spring and summer was an invaluable learning experience. This was her first real coaching job after an accomplished playing career that included 14 U.S. caps. She got to work with the elite of the elite while simultaneously getting the best out of role players and developing up-and-coming prospects.\n\nIt seems wild, in retrospect, that a W-League team that not only included that A-list of U.S. stars, but also the likes of Winters, P\u00e9rez and Deines would fail to win the league. But that\u2019s only if you overlook the limited availability of those top players \u2014 and only if you\u2019ve never heard of the four-time W League champion Pali Blues.\n\n\u201cFor us, the Pali Blues were always the team,\u201d said French of the L.A.-based powerhouse who were annually stocked with the very best college players throughout California. Alumni include: Tobin Heath, Lauren Holiday, Kelley O\u2019Hara and Christen Press, among others.\n\nFor the Sounders Women, this was something of a one-off, with the exception of 2015, when Wisconsin undergrad Rose Lavelle repped the rave green for a summer. The Pali Blues and Seattle finished one/two in the Western Division, with the Blues also prevailing in the 2012 conference final thanks to a goal from future NWSL MVP and golden boot winner Lynn Williams.\n\n\u201cYes, if you put each roster side-by-side, we had the national team players, but not for the playoffs,\u201d French said. \u201cAnd even if we had, who knows? They still could have beaten us. They were always, for us, that one team we knew we needed to get by. It was always a battle. I don\u2019t know if we ever got the best of them, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, it was over. It was a Sounders Women season that hardly felt real, even while it was happening.\n\nIn August of 2012, the U.S. won the gold medal in London, having overcome Canada 4-3 in an all-time classic of a semifinal where Rapinoe netted a brace and Morgan scored the winner in the 123rd minute.\n\nIn November, it was announced that a new, yet-to-be named professional league was to launch in 2013 as a successor to the WPS.\n\nIt is likely not a coincidence that Seattle was awarded a founding franchise of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League \u2014 Portland, too \u2014 despite the fact that there hadn\u2019t been a Pacific Northwest team in either the WPS or the original WUSA back in the day.\n\nThe Sounders Women worked closely with U.S. Soccer on keeping the national teamers fit throughout 2012, and that helped, given the federation\u2019s influence in launching the NWSL. But it was also that the level of fan interest was difficult to ignore.\n\n\u201cI think what the success of the Sounders Women did was that it put the spotlight on Seattle, the fan base and the support that was possible,\u201d Carnell said. \u201cAbsolutely I think it was a part of them saying that this would be a fantastic place for the next women\u2019s pro franchise.\u201d\n\nFrench agrees, and she would know, having grown up in the Seattle area and who is now a pillar of the Portland soccer community.\n\n\u201cYou look at the Reign and maybe they don\u2019t have as much support as one would hope from Seattle, but you can go all the way back to Michelle Akers and Amy Griffin, all of these national team players from this area,\u201d French said. \u201cThat\u2019s where it all started, but when you look at the Sounders Women in particular, that summer did kind of put Seattle women\u2019s soccer back on the map.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, a sense that the potential glimpsed that summer has not been fully realized \u2014 at least not on the women\u2019s side, and not the way it has down the road in Portland. Whereas the Thorns averaged more than 20,000 fans per match last season at Providence Park, the Reign have bounced between three stadiums around the Seattle/Tacoma area and barely cracked 5,000.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was the Sounders name, or the Sounders marketing team, that generated all of those ticket sales, because we still have some of those big name players playing for the Reign, but I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s much of a difference from then to now, sadly,\u201d Winters said. \u201cIf we could be more like Portland \u2026 people are going to hate that (laughs). I mean the Sounders sell out. For whatever reason the support hasn\u2019t really transferred over like it has in Portland.\u201d\n\nLast August, Rapinoe told The Athletic: \u201cWhy does everyone love the Sounders so much? Do they just love soccer? Because if they love soccer, then they would have come to watch us (the Reign) play. We were basically undefeated for two years and had five of the top 20 players in the world. Everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, what are we gonna do?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know!\u2019 We\u2019re doing everything we can. I\u2019m not sure what else needs to be the selling point in the league. The quality is already there.\u201d\n\nDespite those qualms, for many players, the lasting legacy of that season is a sense that the Sounders Women provided a safe harbor \u2014 and a kind of bridge to the future \u2014 when they needed one the most.\n\n\u201cJust having that consistency is crucial,\u201d Winters said. \u201cWhen I was playing, one of the things that just wore on me was the instability of the leagues. \u2026 Just having the next six months of your life planned out, and not having to go searching for places to train and play and improve every day, having a home is huge \u2014 especially just for your peace of mind.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t talk enough about the mental side of playing professionally, and part of that is just being financially stable, feeling like you\u2019re in a good environment where you\u2019re being challenged and taken care of. The Sounders offered that for a lot of us who had kind of had the rug taken out from underneath us.\u201d\n\nThe moment might have been fleeting, and the team didn\u2019t win any hardware, but it\u2019s not hyperbolic to say that the team\u2019s impact is still being felt today: in the superstardom of Megan Rapinoe after last year\u2019s World Cup triumph, in Morgan\u2019s recent move to Tottenham Hotspur \u2014 the kind of opportunity denied by the bad WPS timing eight years ago \u2014 and in the continued growth of the sport in Cascadia and beyond.\n\n\u201cIt was just a really frickin\u2019 fun summer,\u201d French said. \u201cIt was such a fun thing to be a part of. What I most took away from it was that there really is a want, a desire and a thirst for women\u2019s soccer to be a part of these communities. We\u2019ve seen that as the NWSL has continued to flourish and grow. It was a jumping-off point and a signal for what was to come.\u201d\n\n(All photos: Jane Gershovich; courtesy of Amy Carnell)"}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/kate-deines/biography", "page_content": "Kate Deines Biography\n\nAmerican soccer midfielder-defender\n\nKathleen Ann Deines (born September 17, 1989) is an American soccer midfielder\u2013defender. She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014 but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015, before the 2015 season began.\n\nEarly life\n\nDeines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989, to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first *le ever. Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state *le games, winning three of them. Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer *ociation Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Florida following the semifinal. Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup.\n\nDeines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1\u20130 victory over Seattle Prep.\n\nDeines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams.\n\nDeines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDeines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals. She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American.\n\nAs a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence. She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. She made 12 appearances for the club, scoring one goal. Following the conclusion of the W-League season, Deines and her Sounders teammate and fellow University of Washington alum, Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez, played for Stjarnan Women in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur. Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression. Playing professionally in Iceland also allowed me an opportunity to keep practicing and playing games on a daily basis which would not have been the case if I would have stayed in the United States.\"\n\nSeattle Reign FC, 2013\u201314\n\nIn February 2013, Deines signed with the Seattle Reign FC as a free agent for the inaugural season of the NWSL. Deines made 17 appearances for the club with 11 starts, tallying a total of 979 minutes.\n\nPotsdam, 2014\u201315\n\nIn September 2014, Deines signed a one-year contract with Germany's Turbine Potsdam in the Bundesliga.\n\nInternational\n\nDeines was a member of the United States U-23 women's national soccer team and traveled to Sweden in June 2011.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDeines' younger brother Jay is an offensive lineman on the football team at Eastern Washington University.\n\nSee also\n\nWomen's *ociation football portal\n\nSports portal\n\n*ociation football portal\n\nBiography portal\n\nList of University of Washington people\n\nList of people from Portland, Oregon\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nWashington player profile\n\nSeattle Sounders Women player profile\n\nKate Deines at Soccerway\n\nKate Deines on Twitter\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Kate Deines."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/kate-deines", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nKate Deines was born on 17 September, 1989 in Portland, OR, is an American soccer midfielder-defender.

Wales captain Jess Fishlock, former Seattle Sounders Women defender Kate Deines, and forwards Tiffany Cameron and Lindsay Taylor will play for Seattle in 2013.\n\nReign FC general manager Amy Carnell said the club would not be using its fifth allotted free-agent slot. By the time it received word that a fifth slot had been made available, Carnell said the club would rather keep the spot open.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple prospects (at the last minute), but nobody that really, really stood out to us,\u201d she said in a phone interview following the club announcement.\n\nReign FC was allotted the extra slot after forward Amy Rodriguez announced she is pregnant and will miss the entire 2013 NWSL season. Megan Rapinoe and Teresa Noyola will also miss the start of the season because of short-term contracts in Europe, for Lyon of France and the Netherlands\u2019 ADO Den Haag, respectively.\n\nOf the signed players, midfielder Fishlock carries the most professional accolades into her new team. She was the Wales Player of the Year in 2011 and 2012, as well as an English Women\u2019s Premier League all-star selection last season.\n\nFishlock\u2019s signing is the first recognizable moment of head coach Laura Harvey\u2019s influence, as she comes to Reign FC from her post as Arsenal Ladies manager.\n\n\u201cJess is a great player who I know a lot about from her time in the English league,\u201d Harvey said in a club release. \u201cShe is used to playing overseas, having played in Holland (with AZ Alkmaar) and Australia (with Melbourne Victory). Her experience and ability, I feel, will be crucial to the development of this team.\u201d\n\nFormer Husky Deines grew up in Issaquah, Wash., across the I-90 Bridge from downtown Seattle. She is in the U.S. women\u2019s under-23 player pool.\n\nDeines most recently played for the Stjarnan Women in Iceland after completing a stint with the W-League Seattle Sounders Women. She was the Atlanta Beat\u2019s fourth-round pick in the 2012 WPS Draft before the league cancelled the season and later folded.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t begin to describe how excited I am to play professionally in Seattle, (in front of) my family and friends,\u201d Deines said. \u201cThe support in this city is awesome, and now to have a professional team in Seattle, I can\u2019t even imagine the atmosphere for our home matches.\u201d\n\nShe and fellow Washington graduate Veronica Perez \u2014 who was allocated to the Western New York Flash \u2014 left for Iceland after playing for the Sounders Women in 2012. They won the Icelandic Women\u2019s Cup while playing for the club based in Gar\u00f0ab\u00e6r, just outside the capital city of Reykjavik.\n\nDeines\u2019 signing comes as no surprise, as she alluded to her desire to sign with Reign FC repeatedly on Twitter.\n\nCanadian international Cameron received her first caps during Canada\u2019s recent participation in the Yongchuan Cup in China. She entered around the hour mark in all three of Canada\u2019s matches in the tournament.\n\nCameron played collegiately at Ohio State, earning Second Team All-American and First Team All-Big Ten honors in her 2012 senior season. She led her team (and the tied for the conference lead) with 21 goals in 22 games.\n\n\u201cWe want forwards who have pace and something special, and I feel Tiffany has these qualities,\u201d head coach Harvey said.\n\nFellow forward Taylor also fits that bill. As a two-time First Team All-American in 2008 and 2011, as well as Soccer America\u2019s National Player of the Year and the Pac-12 Player of the Year in 2011, she scored 53 goals in her four years for 2011 national champion Stanford.\n\n\u201cShe has pace and power,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe will be looking to play a way which suits Lindsay\u2019s strengths.\u201d\n\nTaylor played for Arna-Bj\u00f8rnar of Norway\u2019s Toppserien in 2012, and she was chosen sixth overall in the 2012 WPS Draft.\n\nReign FC\u2019s next move will be to select six players in Thursday\u2019s NWSL Supplemental Draft, which will be conducted via conference call.\n\nFollow @liviubird\n\n"}, {"url": "https://equalizersoccer.com/2012/05/22/sounders-women-expect-to-play-exciting-attractive-soccer-in-2012/", "page_content": "TUKWILA, Wash. \u2014 With 11 national-team players on the roster, anything less than a W-League title for the Seattle Sounders Women will be unacceptable.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d be selling ourselves short if we weren\u2019t trying to win a W-League championship,\u201d head coach Michelle French said after the team\u2019s final open tryout Saturday.\n\nWhile a group of mostly college players competed for the final remaining roster spots, six women who already signed were at the U.S. national team camp in Princeton, N.J., preparing for a May 27 friendly against China.\n\nDefender Stephanie Cox, forwards Sydney Leroux and Alex Morgan, midfielders Megan Rapinoe and Keelin Winters and goalkeeper Hope Solo headline this year\u2019s roster, and they are expected to be at the London Olympics July 25 to August 9.\n\n\u201cWe can do as much as we can when they\u2019re not here to be successful, but obviously, when they are here, they bring a whole new level to our team,\u201d French said.\n\nHowever, five of their teammates have also seen national team play at various levels: Defender Kate Deines has U.S. Under-23 experience, midfielders Lindsay Elston and Julia Roberts have U.S. Under-20 experience, midfielder Isabell Farrell has U.S. Under-18 experience and forward Veronica Perez plays for the Mexican national team.\n\nAdd in some role players, and French believes her team is solid all the way through the roster.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s backs, midfielders or forwards, we\u2019ve got at least two or three players that I think are going to play a big role for us,\u201d she said. \u201cSeattle is going to be surprised at what great talent we have when the national team players aren\u2019t here, so hopefully the support will continue when they have taken off.\u201d\n\nAbout 4,500 fans went to each of the three preseason games, which the Sounders won. After defeating Seattle Pacific University and Seattle University 5-0 each, the Sounders beat University of Washington 3-1 to cap off an unblemished exhibition run.\n\nIn those three games, the Sounders scored 13 goals and allowed one. Forward Lyndsey Patterson scored twice, Leroux had a hat trick against Seattle University, Morgan scored twice and Perez scored once in each game.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously going to play a huge role,\u201d French said of the Mexican national team forward.\n\nDeines played at center back in each game, keeping Solo from having too much to do. She is expected to make major contributions to the team, especially when the bigger names are missing from the game-day roster, French said.\n\nThe full roster has yet to be announced, but the Sounders Women have 17 players listed on the roster on their website, including Sophie Reiser, who was added on Monday along with three other players.\n\nFrench was confident that her team will entertain its fans this summer.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep the ball, want to keep it moving and play some exciting, attractive soccer,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, with the personalities that we have, with and without the national team players, I think we\u2019re going to be able to do that. Being sound and organized defensively with a little bit of attacking flair is going to be the biggest thing for us.\u201d\n\nThose players not jetting off to training camps and the Olympics will get their chance to shine this season, too. With three more USA friendlies scheduled after Sunday\u2019s China match-up leading into London 2012, Seattle\u2019s better-known players will be gone often.\n\n\u201cWhen (the national-team players) are not here, when it\u2019s going to be the most important part of our season, (the other players) are going to have to train hard the entire time leading up to those games that they\u2019re actually going to play,\u201d French said.\n\nWhen the U.S. internationals are in town, they will go right into the starting lineup. However, every player on the roster will expect that, and they were told from the start that it would be that way, French said.\n\n\u201cFrom Day 1, we explained that entire situation and said, \u2018Listen, you have a choice. You can either choose to be a part of it, or you don\u2019t have to be.\u2019 You can either say, \u2018OK, yeah, I\u2019m all right with those six amazing players coming in and playing,\u2019 or not,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if they decided to sign on for this season, there\u2019s an understanding that in those five other spots or four other spots, they\u2019re fighting to get playing time on the field.\u201d\n\nReiser is one of those players who will be competing for a chance to play all season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all great people and players, and we understand that it\u2019s great for us as a team and the game in Seattle to have such high representation for women\u2019s soccer here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really strong sign of respect that we all can play as a team together.\u201d\n\nThe Sounders Women kick off their season Sunday, on the road against the Vancouver Whitecaps. Seattle\u2019s first home game is against the Colorado Rush on May 31. Home games will be played at Starfire Stadium in Tukwila.\n\n\u2014\n\nLiviu Bird covers the Seattle Sounders Women for Equalizer Soccer.

She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014 but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015 before the 2015 season began."}, {"url": "https://www.plu.edu/resolute/fall-2016/kate-deines/", "page_content": "Deines said she has always loved soccer. She grew up playing in the Seattle area, joining the Seattle Sounders Women when she was still in high school. She played for the University of Washington while completing her undergraduate degree in communication and media.\n\nIn 2012, she was named UW\u2019s Female Athlete of the Year and awarded the Tom Hansen Pac-12 Conference Medal \u2013 for the student athlete who displays performance and achievement in leadership, academics and athleticism.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cI always wanted to play professionally,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter graduating from UW, Deines found herself with nowhere to play because the United States Women\u2019s Professional Soccer League disbanded. \u201cIt was a sad time for women\u2019s soccer,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, like many others in that situation, Deines played abroad. She joined Stjarnan FC in Iceland, helping her team win the Icelandic Cup, among other accomplishments.\n\nDeines later joined the Seattle Reign FC in 2013, after the formation of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL), and played two seasons before retiring in 2015.\n\nDuring that time she continued to play abroad in the offseasons, playing for FFC Turbine Potsdam located just outside Berlin, Germany. They became the top team in the Frauen-Bundesliga, the country\u2019s women\u2019s soccer league.\n\n\u201cFinance was never even on my radar,\u201d Deines said. She said she felt she had already achieved everything she wanted to achieve in soccer, and she was drawn to finance because it focuses on long-term goals. She said soccer, on the other hand, focused on what needed to happen each day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a competitive person, and I was ready for something else,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I near graduation and get ready to work for a firm, the idea that I am hopefully working my way up to the top motivates me. I enjoy thinking about what climbing that next rung looks like and how there\u2019s no ceiling to what you can accomplish.\n\n\u201cThe fact that finance has no limits \u2013 that in and of itself is definitely a big motive.\u201d\n\nAn old family friend and PLU alumna, Darcy Johnson, referred her to the MSF program.\n\n\u201cWhen I visited PLU I had a really good feeling and I could envision myself here,\u201d Deines said. \u201cI always wanted to achieve financial security and I had a really good gut feeling that PLU would be a good fit.\u201d\n\nDeines said she likes the opportunity to help others reach their financial goals. As far as the Women of Influence Award, she said she was pleasantly surprised with the honor. In some ways, she said, the award is a sort of validation, or a sign of heading in the right direction.\n\nMSF program director Cynthia Smith said she was not at all surprised that Deines got the award."}, {"url": "https://www.sounderatheart.com/2012/4/9/2935417/sounders-women-roster", "page_content": "Pull on your Rave Green gear, and head out to Starfire this evening to support the Sounders Women as they take on the Seattle Pacific University team in preseason action at 7:30 PM. It should be a nice but chilly evening, with an almost sold out crowd. The SPU team has several returning players that should make them competitive against the Sounders. Two All-American players to watch are defender Taylor Sawyer and forward Megan Lindsay. The defensive line is anchored by Josie Graybeal and Sawyer. They had eleven shutouts last year, and allowed only 13 goals all season. Coach Chuck Sekyra said in a recent interview that this game against the Sounders Women should be \"a challenge, but fun.\" He also said that his team is up for the challenge, and are looking forward to the game.\n\n\n\nTwo of their forwards are coming back from injury, but will undoubtedly suit up against our Sounders. Ali Martin is further along in her recovery and is almost 100%. Heather Young is right behind her in recovery, and will be at full strength once their regular season starts. After Senior Kelsey Jenkins completed her time with SPU, Kellie Zakrzewski became the team\u2019s leading scorer with 10 goals and four assists.\n\nNow that you know who to watch on their team, let\u2019s look at our Sounders Women.\n\nThe official roster is not yet been released . There are still a couple of players coming in from college that may shift others off the team. So some of the players that you watch in the game may be trialists, or girls that are filling spots until the other members can come in with the team. We do know of 12 members of the Sounders Women that have been formally signed. Let\u2019s meet them, shall we?\n\nThe first player that you really need to get to know is a Husky by the name of Kate (@katedeines2) Deines (pronounced DINE-us). She is a midfielder that loves to score. She has played with the USA U-23 team, and is a four time All Pac-10/12 player. Look for her to link up with fellow Husky Alum Veronica Perez. She was drafted by the WPS Atlanta Beat this past January along with Leroux. Their loss is definitely our gain. She is a natural leader, and will be one to watch when the National Team players are not available.\n\nNext up is Veronica (@VeronicaPerez17) Perez, a 5\u20192\" firecracker that plays with speed and heart. Before she joined the Mexican National team, she played for the Saint Louis Athletica. She\u2019s a forward that adapts well, and can score. As a Husky she had 83 appearances, 70 starts, 21 goals and 11 assists. She scored the winning goal for the Mexican National team in their upset of the USA in the 2010 World Cup Qualifier. Since Canada knocked Mexico out of the Olympic qualifier this winter, Veronica was free to play back here with the Sounders, and will continue to hone her skills.\n\nAnother midfielder to watch is Keelin Winters. Keelin (pronounced KEE-lin), was talked into playing for the Sounders Women by none other than Alex (@alexmorgan13) Morgan. They were teammates on the USA U-23 team. The 5\u20199\" Winters graduated from the University of Portland, and went on the play for the WPS Boston Breakers. She is a defensive midfielder, but she also knows how to score. She was nominated as the 2011 WPS rookie of the year.\n\nA versatile forward/midfielder to get to know is a Ferndale, WA product by the name of Megan Manthey. When the National Team members are out, she\u2019ll be one to watch as well. She\u2019s been in Denmark for the past seven years, and that experience will bring fast paced one touch passing through the midfield.\n\nLindsay Elston was a Husky teammate of Kate Deines, and that bodes well for our midfield play when the National Team members are unable to play. I keep pointing that out, because although they will be available for most of the home games, they are restricted from travel. The only game that the National Team members may make is the Victoria, Canada game. So this team will show its depth during the late season games and all of the road games. Sure, we can win at home with this loaded team, but to win the championship and reach the future with this team, we have to win on the road. Coach Michelle French and GM Amy Carnell are putting together a well rounded, solid team that should be able to do just that. The 5\u20198\" Elston also played for the USA U-20 team.\n\nJulia Roberts, no, not that one\u2026 is out of the University of Virginia. She\u2019s new to the area, so let\u2019s give her that big old Sounder welcome tonight. She is a 5\u20199\" midfielder that is looking to improve her game by playing in a competitive league.\n\nLindsey Patterson is a returning Sounder player. This 5\u20192\" Puyallup native has also spent time with the WPS Atlanta Beat. She brings great experience and a solid skill set to the forward/midfield positions. She joined the Sounders Women mid-way through the season last year and scored one goal and added three assists.\n\nHope Solo, Alex Morgan, Sydney (@sydneyleroux) Leroux, Stephanie Cox and Megan (@mPinoe) Rapinoe round out the contracted players so far. Everyone except Rapinoe should be at the game tonight. Now that you know who is officially signed to the Sounders Women, you will be ready to cheer for your favorites. The mock jerseys won\u2019t be available in the pro shop yet, but they are coming. You should be able to purchase a scarf though. Until then, wear your Sounders FC gear. The women will be sporting the Rave Green this season.\n\nLook to the Ladies\u2019 Auxilary from the ECS to lead the chants from their designated section of the stands.
