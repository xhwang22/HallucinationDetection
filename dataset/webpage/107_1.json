United on Wednesday night in a move it says reflects the political, geographical, social and cultural diversity within the party.\n\n\"What an incredible moment,\" B.C. United Leader Kevin Falcon said during a launch event in Surrey, B.C.\n\n\"United, we are forging a new path not just for this party but for this province. United, we are going to tackle the tough challenges and deliver results for British Columbians. And united, we are going to seize on the incredible future that is British Columbia.\"\n\nDuring the event, Falcon criticized the ruling NDP and Premier David Eby for the provincial debt, for stifling investment and eroding prosperity. Falcon also pointed to what he called Eby's \"catch and release policy\" for repeat offenders and to a health-care system struggling to keep up with demand.\n\n\"Now the NDP want us to accept as British Columbians this as our new status quo,\" Falcon said. \"They want people to just get used to things not working the way that they should, or in fact once did. But as B.C. United, we're here to say it doesn't have to stay this way.\"\n\nEby could not be reached for comment on Wednesday night.\n\nFalcon said B.C. United will be bringing forward \"innovative policies that show that, working together, we can tackle the tough issues that we face in this province.\"\n\nKevin Falcon, leader of what was then-known as the B.C. Liberal Party, is pictured during a media conference at the Legislature in Victoria in May 2022. Earlier this week, the party said changing its name at this point in time gives voters 18 months to become familiar with the new name before the 2024 fixed election date. (Chad Hipolito/The Canadian Press)\n\nEarlier this week, the then-Liberal party said changing its name at this point in time gives voters 18 months to become familiar with the new name before the 2024 fixed election date.\n\nParty vice-president Caroline Elliott said Monday the name change would be going ahead, with confidence that Eby will not call an early election this year.\n\n\"David Eby, the premier, has sworn up and down he will not be calling an election sooner than the fixed election date and he will not be breaking the fixed election date law as his predecessor did,\" she said in an interview.\n\n\"We're going to be taking him at his word,\" said Elliott. \"We're going to hope he keeps that promise but at the same time we're going to be ready.\"\n\nFormer NDP premier John Horgan called a snap election in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, winning a majority and reducing the Liberals to 28 seats in the 87-seat legislature.\n\nDebate about name change had been ongoing\n\nThe party announced in November that 80 per cent of members who voted on the name change were in favour of the change.\n\nFalcon said reconsidering the party's name was a priority during his leadership campaign. He was elected leader of the party in February 2022.\n\nDebate about the name change has been around for decades as some members worry about a perceived \u2014 but inaccurate \u2014 connection to the federal Liberal party, Elliott said.\n\n\"Many of our members are, true, federal Liberals,\" she said. \"Some of them are federal Conservatives. Some of them, most of them probably, are no federal affiliation whatsoever.\"\n\nThe B.C. United name will represent the party's common purpose of improving people's lives, said Elliott.\n\nThe Early Edition 8:07 B.C. Liberals to become known as B.C. United from Wednesday. Party leader Kevin Falcon will be in Surrey on Wednesday at a launch event for the newly-rebranded B.C. United party. We discuss the name change strategy with political scientist, Stewart Prest.\n\nThe B.C. Liberals have traditionally been a centre-right coalition, rising to Opposition in the early 1990s and forming government for 16 years starting in 2001.\n\nElliott said the name change has party members anticipating new strength and renewal for the party.\n\n\"I think it is a big moment in our history,\" she said. \"Really, it's because we've all sort of agreed that what's important to us is coming together for the purpose we share, and that's building a bright future for B.C.\"\n\nName change risks\n\nOn CBC's The Early Edition on Tuesday, Vancouver-based political scientist Stewart Prest said when it comes to identity, the party is taking a certain degree of risk in changing its name.\n\n\"They have a long runway, it seems like, before the election expected in 2024 to really make clear the connection in voters' minds that the B.C. United party is going to be the continuation of that B.C. Liberal brand,\" Prest said.\n\n\"But yeah, it's certainly a risk. This [Liberal name] is something that worked quite well for the party. It was the dominant party of the early 2000s, and so now they are really trying to show that they're turning a page on that history and moving in a new direction.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Stewart Prest, seen here in June 2022, says there's a certain amount of risk in the B.C. Liberal Party changing its name to B.C. United. (Jon Hernandez/CBC)\n\nPrest said the switch to B.C. United may eliminate some confusion between the federal Liberals and provincial Liberals. But he also pointed out \"a certain irony\" about the name change.\n\n\"The B.C. NDP has done well by picking up some of those centrist voters \u2014 those voters who might be voting Liberal federally but are now taking a long look and casting a ballot for the B.C. NDP,\" Prest said.\n\n\"So while the new name may eliminate some of the confusion, they are, in a sense, moving away from the name that is associated with that centre part of the political spectrum that the B.C. Liberals or the B.C. United party will need to recapture if they are to form government again.\"\n\nPrest said B.C. United will have to show it is maintaining its link to the centre for the rebranding to be successful.\n\n\"It's going to have to be accompanied by a really clear statement of what this party stands for, and we will judge the success or the failure of the rebranding on the accompanying policies and how they resonate with British Columbians.\""}, {"url": "http://dictionary.sensagent.com/john%20les/en-en/", "page_content": "John Les is a Canadian politician and member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for British Columbia.

Since first being elected to public office as an alderman in Chilliwack in 1983, there have been countless rewarding and fulfilling experiences\u201d Les said. \u201cI would particularly like to pay tribute to the two Premiers with whom I have had the pleasure to serve, Gordon Campbell and Christy Clark. Both are incredible people and both have made great contributions to British Columbia.\u201d\n\nLes is currently serving as Parliamentary Secretary to Premier Christy Clark, and since being elected as MLA in 2001 has served as Minister of Small Business and Economic Development and Public Safety and Solicitor General. Les was Mayor of Chilliwack for four terms between 1987 and 1999, having been first elected to City Council in 1983.\n\nLes said leaving politics is bittersweet. He\u2019s looking forward to new challenges and exploring new opportunities. But he\u2019s going to miss all of the dedicated people \u2013 fellow MLAs, cabinet ministers, and staff members, who have worked so hard to build a better British Columbia for the last 11 years.\n\n\u201cIt was an honour working with such dedicated people over the years. While we didn\u2019t always agree on all issues, there was always a unity of purpose and direction that sustained us,\u201d Les said.\n\n\u201cMost especially, I wish to thank my family for joining me on this extended journey. Political life is demanding and exacting, but it is with amazement I can say I have never lacked for complete support every step of the way. Many thanks are due to my wife Mattie and our six children. As well, my constituency assistant since 2001, Pam White, has provided loyal and dedicated service, for which I am grateful.\u201d\n\nLes also offered his thanks to the people of Chilliwack who have repeatedly placed their confidence in him \u2013 whether it was to elect him to city hall or to the provincial legislature.\n\n\u201cI trust I have been able to represent the people of Chilliwack well and hope they will forgive any shortcomings on my part,\u201d Les said. \u201cI am grateful that Chilliwack is a thriving and growing community. Our city is now home to the University of the Fraser Valley, the Pacific Regional Training Center of the RCMP, Canada Border Services Agency, and the Justice Institute, all in the Canada Education Park, as well as many new private sector businesses. Our future is on the right track.\n\nAnd what holds for Chilliwack, Les said, holds for the entire province.\n\n\u201cOur province went from worst to first and is now one of the leading jurisdictions in Canada, a remarkable achievement largely made possible by former Premier Campbell\u2019s focus on economic opportunity and growth as well as investment in schools, universities, hospitals, highways, airports, and ports,\u201d Les added. \u201cGoing forward, I am confident that Premier Clark will continue to build on these achievements with her \u2018Jobs Agenda\u2019, in particular her focus on LNG and resource development with the huge economic opportunities that can flow from those initiatives.\n\nLes said British Columbia\u2019s economic performance today is remarkably good, particularly in light of a fragile economic environment globally. Les will serve out his term as Chilliwack MLA and will continue to do everything he can to work for a prosperous future for all British Columbians.\n\n\u201cIt is more important now than ever to stay the course on our economic plans,\u201d Les said. \u201cI will do everything I can to ensure Premier Clark and the BC Liberal government is re-elected in May 2013. Then, it will be time for me to think about other interesting opportunities I may want to explore.\u201d\n\nThe BC Liberals will now be looking for candidates to run in both Chilliwack and Chilliwack-Hope, represented by Barry Penner until he decided to resign from politics altogether."}, {"url": "https://elections.bc.ca/voting/outreach-and-education/electoral-history-of-bc/", "page_content": "Year Event\n\n1871 British Columbia becomes a province of Canada on July 20, 1871.

Known as the father of the Quiet Revolution, he led his province during that modernizing period of profound change in the collective life of Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nEarly Life\n\nLesage was born in Montr\u00e9al, one of five children born to C\u00e9cile C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Xaveri Lesage. In 1921 the family moved to Qu\u00e9bec City, where Xaveri, a teacher and civil servant, took up a managerial position with an insurance company. Lesage attended the private school Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague and the Quebec Seminary before enrolling in law at Laval University. A talented student, he became active in Liberal Party politics in university, and graduated in 1934.\n\nAdmitted to the Bar that same year, Lesage practiced in private law with various Qu\u00e9bec City firms, and served as Crown attorney for the Wartime Prices and Trade Board for most of the Second World War. In 1938, he married Corinne Lagarde, a singer. He also served in the army reserve from 1939\u20131945.\n\nFederal Politics\n\nLesage ran for public office in the federal election of 1945 and was elected the Member of Parliament for Montmagny-L'Islet, sitting with the Liberals under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Lesage was re-elected in 1949, 1953, 1957 and 1958. In his early years in the House of Commons he served as parliamentary secretary to various government ministers before joining the Cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent from 1953\u20131957. He served as minister of resources and development, and then as minister of northern affairs and national resources.\n\nAlthough the St-Laurent government was defeated in 1957, Lesage re-captured his own seat both that year and in 1958, when John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives won their huge majority. Slumping Liberal fortunes in Ottawa convinced him to seek the leadership of the Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party, which he won on 31 May 1958. He completely rebuilt the party by attracting dynamic new people and by preparing a program \u2014 radical for its time \u2014 of social and political reform.\n\n1960 Election\n\nIn the provincial election of 1960 Lesage fought to unseat the Union Nationale (UN), which under Maurice Duplessis and his successors Paul Sauv\u00e9 and Antonio Barrette had ruled Qu\u00e9bec continuously, and with an iron fist, for the past 16 years. Not only was the UN considered corrupt, overseeing a wide system of political patronage, it was also socially conservative, isolationist, and closely allied with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nLesage's Liberals, on the other hand, put themselves forward as leaders of the new Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 progressive, urban and modern \u2014 a message that resonated in a province on the cusp of the Quiet Revolution. Lesage campaigned with the slogan \"C\u2019est le temps que \u00e7a change,\" It's time for a change. The election was boisterous and ugly, with personal attacks on both sides, and hot tempers among voters, as Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois debated the merits of change. On 22 June 1960 Lesage's Liberals won a narrow but historic victory, pushing the UN from power and capturing 51 of 95 legislature seats. Lesage himself was elected in the riding of Qu\u00e9bec West. He became the province's 19th premier, also taking on the posts of minister of finance and later, minister of revenue and minister of federal-provincial affairs.\n\nLesage Government\n\nWhether or not Lesage led the Quiet Revolution, his reform-minded government created the social, political and economic conditions and structures that allowed it to flourish. As historian Claude B\u00e9langer has written, \"the government of Jean Lesage became the symbol and the tool of a whole people on the road to self-assertion.\"\n\nModernizing Qu\u00e9bec society and secularizing it \u2014 pulling it out from under the thumb of the Catholic church \u2014 were Lesage's main goals. But the premier was also pushed, often faster than he liked, by activists within his own Cabinet, including Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, Pierre Laporte and Eric Kierans. With them he pursued an ambitious agenda of eliminating patronage and corruption, and building up a skilled provincial bureaucracy to govern newly created ministries of cultural affairs, federal-provincial relations, and education.\n\nEducation reform was perhaps the greatest example of Lesage's secularizing measures. The public school system, previously controlled by the church, was instead placed under the new Ministry of Education, whose aim was to produce a skilled labour force and instill Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois values. School districts were reorganized, schools were merged, and plans were laid for the creation of Coll\u00e8ges d\u2019Enseignement G\u00e9n\u00e9ral et Professionnel (CEGEPs).\n\nHydro-Qu\u00e9bec\n\nLesage's most ambitious project, and arguably his greatest legacy, was the nationalization of 11 privately-owned electricity companies. With L\u00e9vesque as its point-man on the project, the government secured $300-million in financing from New York banks (after being denied loans in Montr\u00e9al and Toronto) and bought-out the private companies, folding them into the public utility Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. The province's vast hydro-electric resources, the government claimed, would be used to fuel the province's development and the growing, nationalist aspirations of its people.\n\nLesage called a snap election in 1962, which became an effective referendum on the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec plan. The Lesage slogan this time was \"Ma\u00eetres chez nous,\" Masters in our own house. His government was rewarded with a larger majority.\n\nCostly Reforms\n\nLesage continued his government's program of change after 1962. There was ongoing reform in education, and the creation of new enterprises such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de financement (to raise capital for francophone business), the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Montage Automobile (which assembled French cars) andthe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise d\u2019Exploration Mini\u00e8re (which oversaw the development of mining and royalties).\n\nInsisting that Ottawa pay for, but not control social programs in the provinces, Lesage's government ensured that the national medicare system would develop not as a federally-imposed insurance scheme but as a shared, federal-provincial program. Lesage also created the Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan, becoming the only premier to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan.\n\nWhatever the merits of these changes, they were expensive. To pay for them Lesage raised taxes and borrowed heavily, increasing the provincial net debt by more than 300 per cent between 1960 and 1966. Many of the government's reforms, particularly in education, were also deeply unpopular in rural areas (heavily represented in the legislature) where the Quiet Revolution had not yet reached. Lesage would pay a price for neglecting these tradition-bound voters.\n\nDefeat\n\nFor six years Lesage had capitalized on \u2014 and crested \u2014 a growing nationalist wave that was increasingly at odds with the rest of Canada and the federal government. Separatist terrorists had by then started bombing mailboxes and armouries in the name of \"independence.\" By 1966, Lesage was finding nationalist sentiment difficult to contain; the Union Nationale, under the new leadership of Daniel Johnson, had also climbed on the same bandwagon. In the provincial election that year \u2014 which few expected Lesage to lose \u2014the UN defeated him, winning 56 seats to the Liberals' 50.\n\n\"I have been at the disposal of my province,\" were among Lesage's last words on election night.\n\nLesage remained on as Liberal leader, and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, until he was replaced as party leader by Robert Bourassa in 1970. After retiring from politics, he served as a board member for numerous corporations, until his death in 1980. Lesage was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honour, in 1970. Qu\u00e9bec City's international airport is named in his memory."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/perth-wellington-ontario-election-2022-results-1.6474223", "page_content": "Perth-Wellington has remained Progressive Conservative, as newcomer Matthew Rae has won the riding.\n\nThere was no incumbent in this constituency.
