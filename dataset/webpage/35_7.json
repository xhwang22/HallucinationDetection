The Senate Minority Leader is responsible for: developing the minority position, negotiating with the majority party, directing minority caucus activities on the chamber floor, and leading debate for the minority.\n\nMr. McConnell graduated with honors from the University of Louisville College of Arts and Sciences and is also a graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law. First elected to the Senate in 1984, he was elected Majority Leader in the US Senate by his Republican colleagues first in 2014 and again in 2016. Mr. McConnell previously served as the Republican Leader from the 110th through the 113th Congresses, as the Majority Whip in the 108th and 109th Congresses, and as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the 1998 and 2000 election cycles. Mr. McConnell worked as an intern on Capitol Hill for Senator John Sherman Cooper before serving as chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook and as Deputy Assistant Attorney General to President Gerald Ford. Before his election to the Senate, he served as judge-executive of Jefferson County, Kentucky, from 1978 until he commenced his Senate term on January 3, 1985.\n\nChief Justice\n\nThe Chief Justice of the US is the head of the US federal court system, is the highest judicial officer in the country, and acts as a chief administrative officer for the federal courts. As head of the Judicial Conference of the US, the Chief Justice appoints the director of the Administrative Office of the US Courts. The Chief Justice also serves as a spokesperson for the judicial branch. The Chief Justice leads the business of the Supreme Court and presides over oral arguments. When the court renders an opinion, the Chief Justice, when in the majority, decides who writes the court\u2019s opinion. The Chief Justice also has significant agenda-setting power over the court\u2019s meetings. In modern tradition, the Chief Justice also has the ceremonial duty of administering the oath of office of the President of the US.\n\nMr. Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, January 27, 1955. He received an A.B. from Harvard College in 1976 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1979. He served as a law clerk for Judge Henry J. Friendly of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 \u2013 1980 and as a law clerk for then-Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist of the Supreme Court of the US during the 1980 Term. He was Special Assistant to the Attorney General, US Department of Justice from 1981 \u2013 1982, Associate Counsel to President Ronald Reagan, White House Counsel\u2019s Office from 1982 \u2013 1986, and Principal Deputy Solicitor General, US Department of Justice from 1989 \u2013 1993. From 1986 \u2013 1989 and 1993 \u2013 2003, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. He was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2003. President George W. Bush nominated him as Chief Justice of the US, and he took his seat September 29, 2005.\n\nState and local29\n\nIn each state and territory, the chief executive is the governor, who serves as both head of state and head of government. As state managers, governors are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing the operation of the state executive branch. As state leaders, governors advance and pursue new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools, among them executive orders, executive budgets, and legislative proposals and vetoes. Governors play two broad roles in relation to state legislatures. First, they may be empowered to call special legislative sessions, provided in most cases that the purpose and agenda for the sessions are set in advance. Second, governors coordinate and work with state legislatures in: approval of state budgets and appropriations; enactment of state legislation; confirmation of executive and judicial appointments; and legislative oversight of executive branch functions.\n\nOur state governors as of March 1, 2021 were as follows:"}, {"url": "https://www.wamc.org/new-york-news/2020-06-16/nys-senate-minority-leader-flanagan-retiring-june-28", "page_content": "New York state Senate Minority Leader John Flanagan has announced he will retire early on June 28.

Flanagan received a J.D. degree from Touro Law Center in 1990 and was admitted to practice law in New York State in 1991.\n\nPolitical career\n\nFlanagan was elected to the New York State Assembly at age 25 in 1986 following the sudden death of his father, John J. Flanagan, Sr.; Flanagan ran for the assembly seat that was vacated due to his father's death. In 2002, Flanagan sought the assembly minority leader post, and was defeated 27-26 by fellow Republican Charles H. Nesbitt. Flanagan was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1987 until 2002, when he was elected to the State Senate.\n\nBefore becoming temporary president and majority leader of the New York state senate, Flanagan served as the chairman of the senate standing committee on education and as a member of the committees on codes; corporations, authorities and commissions; finance; higher education; insurance; judiciary; rules and veterans, homeland security and military affairs. In 2011, Flanagan voted against allowing same-sex marriage in New York during the Senate roll-call vote on the Marriage Equality Act, which legally recognized same-sex marriages performed in the state; the bill passed in a closely divided Senate vote of 33\u201329 and was signed into law. In 2013, he voted in favor of the firearm law known as the NY SAFE Act, but he later expressed willingness to reconsider or modify that legislation.\n\nAs chair of the New York Senate Education Committee, Flanagan held hearings across the state to examine several major issues including state assessments, the implementation of common core state standards and the protection of student privacy. The hearing series was called \"The Regents Reform Agenda: 'Assessing' Our Progress\" and was held on Long Island and in New York City, Syracuse, Buffalo and Albany.\n\nOn May 11, 2015, Flanagan was elected senate majority leader and Temporary President of the New York State Senate following Dean Skelos's resignation from the post. As senate majority leader, Flanagan pushed back on efforts to extend the statute of limitations for victims of child sexual abuse in New York state. He did not allow the Child Victims Act, a bill that had already passed the New York Assembly, to come up for a vote in the senate in the 2017 spring session.\n\nFlanagan also opposed the Reproductive Health Act, an abortion rights bill supported by Governor Andrew Cuomo and Senate Democrats that Senate Republicans blocked from a senate floor vote in 2018; Flanagan described the bill as a \"radical expansion of abortion\" that would allow certain non-physicians to perform abortion procedures.\n\nIn 2018, EPL/Environmental Advocates gave Flanagan an Oil Slick Award in their annual Environmental Scorecard.\n\nIn November 2018, fellow Republican Catharine Young attempted to oust Flanagan from his leadership post; however, Flanagan defeated her by a vote of 14 to nine. In January 2020, Flanagan announced that he would be unavailable for the beginning of the 2019 session because he was seeking treatment for alcoholism in a residential program.\n\nAfter announcing in March 2020 that he would not seek re-election, Flanagan announced his resignation from the Senate (effective June 28, 2020) to become a lobbyist for Northwell Health, a network of hospitals in the New York City metropolitan area.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFlanagan married Lisa Perez, and the couple had three children.

Most recently, Senator Larkin sponsored the Veterans\u2019 Equality Act, which was signed into law by Governor Cuomo just last year. He continues to serve on the Senate\u2019s Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs Committee where he has sponsored numerous laws to assist veterans.\n\nSenator Larkin has led two national campaigns to ensure that our nation does not forget the servicemen and women who have been awarded the Purple Heart Medal for being killed or wounded in combat. His efforts resulted in the United States Postal Service\u2019s first issuance of a Purple Heart postage stamp in 2003. The stamp continues to be circulated today.\n\nSenator Larkin also spearheaded the establishment of the Purple Heart Hall of Honor. The Hall collects and preserves the stories of over 100,000 Purple Heart recipients from all branches of service, and includes educational exhibits related to military history and the Purple Heart, which dates back to George Washington.\n\nIn 2014, the United States Army presented Senator Larkin with its highest civilian award, the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service, in recognition of his decades of service on behalf of veterans. The Certificate from the Department of the Army recognizes Senator Larkin for his extraordinary contributions to the well-being of soldiers, veterans, Army civilians and their families.

Typically he spends a \u201ctremendous amount of time on the phone,\u201d as he puts it, but there were two reasons to be out on the Senate floor that Monday. The first was a bipartisan resolution before the chamber recognizing the life and work of Leonard Spano, a prominent Republican politician in Westchester County who died this year. A resolution on the floor in Spano\u2019s honor presented an occasion for Flanagan to speak about his own outlook toward public life.\n\n\u201cMy mother a number of years ago gave me a picture of my father, when my father first started in the Legislature, and the poem is about your name,\u201d said Flanagan, referring to a poem printed below a framed photo of his father, former Assemblyman John J. Flanagan. \u201cIt\u2019s basically how a father in this case passes his name to his son and the name was in good stead and it was intact at the time it was given to you and that the best thing you could do is continue that legacy.\u201d\n\nAs that day\u2019s session wound down, the Republican conference attempted a parliamentary maneuver with a bill on the floor that would require that death certificates list any specific opioids responsible for fatal overdoses. Republicans supported the uncontroversial legislation, but they wanted to make a political statement.\n\nThe GOP senators tried to tack on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors\u2019 Protection Act, which has no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled chamber. After an attempt to attach it to the opioid legislation was rejected, Deputy Minority Leader Joseph Griffo requested that state Sen. Pamela Helming have a chance to speak. If the bill on the floor required more reporting on opioid deaths, Helming said, why not about babies who died soon after being born alive during an abortion? \u201cThe goal with both bills is to sustain life,\u201d Helming said. Helming\u2019s amendment was swiftly voted down on a party line vote and the unamended opioid legislation passed 60-0. \u201cNot a single member of the @NYSenDems voted to protect a baby born alive during abortion,\u201d GOP Senate spokeswoman Candice Giove tweeted.\n\nIn past years, when Republicans controlled the chamber, they could have used such an amendment as leverage in negotiations with the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But the balance of power shifted dramatically after the 2018 elections, when Republicans lost the state Senate, their last hold on statewide power in New York. That it happened on Flanagan\u2019s watch was a blow to his legacy, and it was compounded by a string of political and personal challenges, including the embarrassing intraparty effort to oust him from the leadership and his personal battle with alcohol.\n\nWhile he ultimately held on to his post as conference leader, it\u2019s not clear how he can return his party to power in Albany. Democrats are becoming increasingly dominant in state politics, and the Republicans\u2019 downstate political base has shrunk. Interviews with a dozen GOP senators and party insiders suggest that Flanagan\u2019s position as leader remains secure. But the prospects of him ever becoming majority leader again appear remote. The presidential race will likely boost turnout in 2020, and higher turnout historically benefits Democratic candidates. President Donald Trump could energize some Republican voters, but anti-Trump backlash is likely to spur Democrats to show up at the polls as well. And if the state Senate GOP falls short next year, they\u2019ll have little say in the next round of redistricting \u2013 and could be gerrymandered into minority status for years, if not decades.\n\n\u201cFlanagan is not situated to rebuild the Republican strength in New York in the current environment. The best he can do is hold on where he\u2019s at \u2026 then there\u2019s going to be a battle to the death in 2020.\u201d \u2013 Gerald Benjamin, political science professor at SUNY New Paltz\n\nDemocrats already have a massive statewide voter registration advantage and the long-term demographic trends are in their favor, according to Gerald Benjamin, a political science professor at SUNY New Paltz. \u201cFlanagan is not situated to rebuild the Republican strength in New York in the current environment,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cThe best he can do is hold on where he\u2019s at \u2026 then there\u2019s going to be a battle to the death in the year 2020. It\u2019s the so-called battle to the death for the future of a Republican Senate. But it\u2019s occurring in a presidential year with higher turnout in a mobilized anti-Trump constituency.\u201d\n\nFlanagan has not given up, despite the odds against him. \u201cI believe we are in a situation that\u2019s not going to be much different than it was in 2009 and 2010,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen the Democrats took over the state Senate and ran the state into fiscal ruin within less than two years.\u201d\n\nZach Williams\n\nFollowing their shellacking in 2018, Republicans have ruminated over their losses and reflected on how to win again in New York, a state where they have not won a statewide election since 2002. Incoming state Republican Party Chairman Nicholas Langworthy has talked about garnering more small-dollar donations, winning local races, recruiting more female candidates, attracting younger voters and, eventually, electing a Republican governor. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t happened in the past is take a game plan to our contributors,\u201d Langworthy told the New York Post. \u201cWe\u2019ll reengage, reinvest to find a way forward and have a plan and change the culture in the state of New York.\u201d\n\nWhile the state party is altering its approach, the most visible efforts by GOP senators to regain the majority have largely consisted of opposing what the Democrats are doing. Does the Senate Republican conference\u2019s chances hinge on the other party screwing up? \u201cWe should never assume a position that they\u2019re bad, or they\u2019re not doing things right or properly,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cWe\u2019re different than the people who are in the majority now. \u2026 We stand for things that are different than the majority stands for now.\u201d\n\nYet Flanagan argued that it\u2019s just a matter of time before the Democratic majority falls apart. \u201cYou see the infighting and the rift within the Democratic conference,\u201d he said. Flanagan argued that disorder will break out among the rank-and-file Democrats, and progressive policies will turn off swing voters on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley who have largely decided control of the Senate in recent years. Republicans are depending on Democratic overreach and division to once again bring the GOP back into the majority, as happened in 2010 when Democrats last ran the Senate. Democrats had won a narrow margin in the 2008 election, but their brief time in power was marked by a chaotic Senate coup and the passage of controversial legislation that ultimately doomed the party\u2019s chances of keeping the majority in 2010. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nToday, it\u2019s the Senate GOP that is in disarray. Veteran senators like John DeFrancisco, William Larkin and John Bonacic retired in 2018, a year when opposition to Trump propelled Democrats to victory. Republicans Kemp Hannon, Elaine Phillips and Carl Marcellino were ousted, decimating the once vaunted \u201cLong Island Nine\u201d that had dominated the state Senate. More defections appear likely. State Sen. Chris Jacobs launched a primary campaign against Rep. Chris Collins, who narrowly won reelection last year despite being charged with securities fraud, and another Republican senator, Robert Ortt, is also among those rumored to be potential primary challengers to Collins. There have also been calls for state Sen. Fred Akshar to resign following a sex scandal, though Flanagan has said that he stands behind him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively recruiting candidates right now,\u201d Flanagan said. Though he did not offer any new names of who might run for the state Senate, he confirmed at least one potential comeback candidate \u2013 former state Sen. Martin Golden of Brooklyn. \u201cOur options are open,\u201d said Golden, who has not made a final decision about seeking his old seat. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe elephant in the room is Trump, who could bolster some down-ballot Republicans in New York while hurting others. Flanagan has had an uneasy relationship with the president, whom he endorsed in 2016 only after Trump became the Republican nominee. Flanagan praises Trump for a good economy but distances himself from other parts of Trump\u2019s record. \u201cThe stock market is essentially at an all-time high; unemployment, that\u2019s essentially an all-time low,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cI get the things that are being said about the president. I don\u2019t have to agree with them.\u201d\n\nIn early May, the Republican leader staged a press conference in the hallway outside his office to go on the attack over two high-profile bills that Democrats planned to pass. One was an effort to allow convicted felons to serve on juries, which gave Flanagan a pretext to talk about Judith Clark, the recently paroled 69-year-old driver in a deadly 1981 robbery of a Brink\u2019s armored truck. Law enforcement groups and the families of people killed in the robbery had protested her parole, and Senate Republicans were eager to channel the frustration by touting their \u201cvictims\u2019 justice agenda,\u201d a package of bills that Republicans released in response to Democrats criminal justice reforms, such as ending cash bail.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing more pro-criminal bill of rights bills that are out there,\u201d Flanagan told City & State separately in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s day after day after day after day. I could give you chapter and verse on things that were wrong with the budget.\u201d\n\nThe second piece of legislation on the agenda that day aimed to change state law so that individual tax returns could be sent to congressional committees that requested them \u2013 essentially an effort to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the only discussion about taxes by the Democratic majority is to try and get the president\u2019s taxes,\u201d Flanagan told reporters gathered outside his office. \u201cWe should be spending our time worrying about what we can do for New Yorkers.\u201d With just 22 seats in the 63-seat Senate, GOP senators could not stop the bills, but they did make some noise.\n\nSarah Blesener\n\nThe walls of Flanagan\u2019s office pay tribute to his father, a genial and physically imposing assemblyman who represented Long Island in the 1970s and 1980s. One photo on the wall shows a middle-aged father and a preteen son sitting next to each other in the Assembly chamber. On the opposite wall is a frame filled with campaign literature, including a pamphlet where the elder Flanagan\u2019s name reads proudly next to the name of President Richard Nixon.\n\nThe older Flanagan, a former high school biology teacher, was first elected to the Assembly in 1972, in part on a platform touting his commitment to environmental issues. He earned a reputation as a policy wonk on issues like education. His brand of politics placed him more toward the political center at a time when the GOP was moving in a more conservative direction nationwide. \u201cI don\u2019t like this term per se, but my father was very forward-thinking,\u201d the younger Flanagan said. \u201cHe would have been considered progressive in what I consider a good sense.\u201d\n\nFlanagan, who would tag along on trips to the state Capitol, said that his father was one of the most formidable debaters in the Republican conference at that time. \u201cPeople would tell me when I got here, \u2018Your father\u2019s a legendary debater, my God, he always knew his stuff,\u2019\u201d Flanagan recalled. \u201cI would joke around like, \u2018Listen, I was on the receiving end on that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA 1979 battle over funding for what would become the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan was one of many times where Flanagan used his intelligence and wit against the Democrats. \u201cHe was someone you would never welcome having to debate because he could be very effective and very sharp,\u201d said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who was first elected in 1970. While the bill passed the Assembly by a comfortable margin, Republicans scored political points by asserting that the convention center would place undue burdens on residents outside New York City because state money would be used to fund it.\n\nThe elder Flanagan\u2019s promising legislative career ended in tragedy on Sept. 27, 1986, while the 50-year-old was out jogging with his wife and son at the track at Old Field Junior High School in Greenlawn. He collapsed and was pronounced dead at Huntington Hospital. His son was working at International Paper, a paper manufacturer, at the time while finishing his law degree at Touro Law Center. After he gave a eulogy at his father\u2019s funeral, Republican leaders saw his political potential. \u201cIt was very eloquent, heartfelt, not a dry eye in the house,\u201d said Gyory, who heard accounts of the funeral from others. \u201cThey all felt that if it was him on the ballot, with the feelings towards the father and the family, he\u2019d be almost impossible to beat in a special election \u2013 and in fact he was.\u201d\n\nThe younger Flanagan entered the Assembly in the 1987 freshman class that included several future leaders in state politics, including Thomas DiNapoli, who went on to become state comptroller, and Joseph Crowley, who rose through the ranks in Congress. Flanagan followed in his father\u2019s footsteps by rising through the state ranks and cultivating a reputation as an education policy wonk. But after his first attempt at leading a conference fell short by one vote to Assemblyman Charles Nesbitt in 2002, his ambitions turned toward the Senate, where he won a seat later that year.\n\n\u201cHe took his time, rising slowly through the steps until lightning struck. He had the long relationships that in some cases spanned two generations of Flanagans (and) his positioning to be a consensus choice was the result of a long service in the Legislature.\u201d \u2013 Lawrence Levy, former Newsday political columnist\n\nAt the time, Joseph Bruno was Senate majority leader, but the upstate lawmaker would resign in 2008 after being indicted on federal corruption charges. Though he would eventually be acquitted, Bruno was replaced by then-Sen. Dean Skelos of Long Island, giving the downstate GOP contingent the upper hand in the historical geographical divide within the party. Following the Democrats\u2019 tumultuous, two-year period controlling the chamber in 2009-10, downstate Republicans were further empowered when the party resumed control. Republicans eventually needed the Independent Democratic Conference \u2013 a breakaway group of mostly downstate Democrats \u2013 to form a majority in 2013.\n\nWhen Skelos was hit with federal corruption charges of his own in 2015, Flanagan had the chance that he had been waiting for his whole career: leading a legislative conference. The years he spent cultivating relationships throughout the state as an assemblyman and state senator paid off. \u201cHe took his time, rising slowly through the steps until lightning struck,\u201d said Lawrence Levy, the executive dean at the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. \u201cHe had the long relationships that in some cases spanned two generations of Flanagans (and) his positioning to be a consensus choice not just on Long Island but around the state was the result of a long service in the Legislature.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn was around Long Island and all the politics for a very long time. But he only got a chance to make his mark in the last few years \u2013 and that was cut short by the loss of the majority.\u201d \u2013 Bruce Gyory, a political science professor at the University at Albany\n\nYet once Flanagan finally reached the pinnacle, he wasn\u2019t able to hold on for long. \u201cJohn was around Long Island, and all the politics for a very long time,\u201d said Bruce Gyory, an political science professor at the University at Albany and a Democratic political consultant. \u201cBut he only got a chance to make his mark in the last few years \u2013 and that was cut short by the loss of the majority.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of John Flanagan\n\nGun control activists were swarming Flanagan\u2019s office. He was on their list of elected officials to target on their lobbying visit to the state Capitol on a recent Tuesday afternoon. Yet no one seemed to recognize the lanky Long Islander as he slipped out the front door to his office down the hall from the Senate chamber. It was just minutes until the annual Police Officers Memorial begins across the street, and Flanagan was eager to keep up appearances. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pay my respects,\u201d he said.\n\nIn past years, Flanagan had a prime speaking slot at the annual event, which memorializes law enforcement personnel who died in the past year. Sixty-three names will be etched into a black granite memorial wall in Empire State Plaza. Their names will be read before an audience of elected officials, union leaders and police officers and their families. It is a full house this year as everyone crams into The Egg, an event space on Empire State Plaza.\n\nAfter Flanagan entered, Griffo, his top lieutenant, nodded from the stairs to the left where he stood alongside other Republican legislators in a room filled with hundreds of local law enforcement officers and their families.\n\nThere were 31 chairs at the front for the likes of Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, state Sen. John Brooks \u2013 a Long Island Democrat representing Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins \u2013 and Patrick Lynch, the president of the New York City Police Benevolent Association. But there was no seat for Flanagan. He heads up the stairs, mingles with members of the police color guard and tried to find a place to stand.\n\nIt was another reminder of how things have changed for Flanagan over the course of the past year. There was the loss of the Senate majority. There was the post-election leadership challenge from Catharine Young that revealed dissent among the ranks. And then there was the drinking the led him to check into rehab a few days before Christmas last year. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t isolate it to any one thing,\u201d he told City & State when asked why he decided to seek treatment. Considering that his own father had died young, the 58-year-old Flanagan said it became more obvious after the election that the time had come to take better care of himself. \u201cSomebody finds himself at a point where you\u2019re just breathing a little harder, I feel like I put on 15 or 20 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you may have a colleague or a friend that says, \u2018How you feeling. What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nFlanagan would miss the first month of the session, and returned to a very different state Senate. New York Republicans had hit rock bottom as a party and there is no easy path out of the political wilderness. With the menacing prospect of Democratic-led redistricting on the horizon, Flanagan is leaning on the one source of strength that his political rivals could never take away from him: his father. The former assemblyman continues to be a \u201crole model, hero, all that kind of stuff,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cThat\u2019s never changed.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/john-j-flanagan/flanagan-assigned-senate-duties", "page_content": "New York State Senate Majority Leader Joseph L.
