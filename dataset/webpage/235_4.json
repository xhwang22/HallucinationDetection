{"Billy Burke was the first golfer to win the PGA Championship in match play since Jim Barnes in 1916.": [{"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2020/01/billy-burke-golfer.html", "page_content": "Billy Burke was a PGA Tour winner from the 1920s into the 1940s. He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://thealbatross.substack.com/p/billy-burkes-singular-achievement", "page_content": "Despite the big differences between the generations in most areas of golf, achievements of one era often can be repeated at a subsequent time if talent and circumstances align. Someone could do what Bobby Jones did in 1930 (calendar year Grand Slam) or what Tiger Woods did in 2000-01 (four consecutive major wins). But the 1931 U.S. Open is a stubborn exception.\n\nNobody will ever win the national championship in the manner of Billy Burke 90 years ago this week.\n\nTournaments aren\u2019t even decided by 18-hole playoffs anymore\u2014it\u2019s either sudden death or an aggregate format of a couple of holes\u2014so the fact that Burke had to go through two 36-hole playoffs following 72 holes of medal play to defeat George Von Elm at Inverness Club in Toledo makes his achievement the ultimate outlier.\n\n\u201cApparently they are going on forever,\u201d Grantland Rice wrote in his syndicated column after the first playoff. \u201cAfter the most sensational 36-hole playoff in the history of golf, they are still tied up in a two-ply Gordian Knot at 149 strokes each. There were enough fireworks in this contest to make the fall of Pompeii look like a single Roman candle.\u201d\n\nHyperbolic to be sure, but Rice had a point. There were 25 lead changes over the 72 playoff holes. After making a birdie putt on the 72nd hole of regulation, Von Elm did it again on the 36th playoff hole to force another long day.\n\nBurke\u2019s count that early July week in Ohio: 144 holes, 589 strokes, 32 cigars, a one-stroke margin over Von Elm. The winner did it in scorching heat\u2014there a number of heat-related deaths in the area\u2014and on the heels of 72 holes of Ryder Cup qualifying and 72 holes of match-play competition in late June as . When Burke set out for Niagara Falls and a delayed honeymoon with his wife, Marguerite, after being the last man standing at Inverness, he had played 288 holes in 16 days.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that Burke was the first golfer to win a major title with steel shafts in his clubs (Von Elm was still using hickory), but he also did it with a lighter, 1.55 ounce ball that the USGA had mandated for that season to put more challenge into the game. Like the 36-hole playoff format, the lighter ball was gone after 1931.\n\nBurke was born in 1902, the same year as Jones and Gene Sarazen. William John Burkowski grew up in Naugatuck, Conn., and like Eugenio Saraceni came from a working-class family. \u201cHe impresses me as a player who has learned his game through a lot of hard work,\" Jones wrote in the The American Golfer, \"as contrasted to one who has come by it easily and naturally.\" John Kiernan of The New York Times observed that Burke was \u201ca square-shouldered stalwart who might pass as pugilist or a heavy-hitting second baseman.\u201d\n\nBurke succeeded at golf despite a disability from an accident in an iron foundry. (The New York Daily News)\n\nBurke did wear a small glove on his left hand, an accommodation for a disability after an accident at an iron foundry as a teenager cost him parts of two fingers. Having gotten exposed to golf as a young caddie at Naugatuck Golf Club (now Hop Brook Golf Course), Burke also toiled at other jobs including an office janitor and at factories making boots and safety pins before becoming a golf pro. For Burke, playing a sport for a living\u2014even a marathon championship in the heat\u2014really was a \u201cgolden grind,\u201d to use Al Barkow\u2019s wonderful term from his important 1974 history of the tour.\n\nFollowing his U.S. Open victory, Golf Illustrated predicted Burke was \u201ca new star who is destined long to shine.\u201d Credited with 11 PGA Tour victories, Burke didn\u2019t win another major title but had two third-place finishes in the Masters (1934 and 1939) and put up an admirable defense of his U.S. Open victory in 1932, tying for seventh.\n\nThe man who prevailed in a 72-hole playoff died in 1972, at age 69."}, {"url": "https://www.liveabout.com/pga-championship-winners-1561098", "page_content": "The PGA Championship tournament was first played in 1916, making it the third-oldest of the professional men's majors.

Run by the Professional Golfers\u2019 Association of America (PGA of America), it is a major media event played on a different American course each year and routinely features the best players in the world. It has been held, with some exceptions, each year since 1916. In addition to sizable prize money, the winner of the tournament receives a lifetime invitation to participate in all future PGA Championships, five-year allowances for participation in the three other major tournaments, and points toward the PGA Player of the Year Award and toward the next Ryder Cup team.\n\nThe PGA Championship shifted from being a fall event to being a summer one in the 1930s and then adopted the 72-hole stroke-play format in 1958. In the 1960s Arnold Palmer established himself as the finest golfer never to win this coveted tournament, the only one of the four majors to elude him. Jack Nicklaus , on the other hand, won the tournament five times between 1963 and 1980 and finished in the top five a record 14 times. Tiger Woods \u2019s series of PGA championships began in 1999, when he, then 23 years old, became the fifth youngest champion in history. He repeated as champion in 2000 and again amassed back-to-back championships in 2006 and 2007.\n\nSeveral tournament records were set in the 1920s. In 1922, 20-year-old Gene Sarazen became the youngest golfer to win the championship, and his defense of his title the following year, in which he defeated Hagen in a play-off on the 38th hole, is considered one of the classic matches in tournament history. When Sarazen played in the 1972 PGA Championship, he also became the oldest golfer ever to play the tournament. Hagen\u2019s play in the 1920s, however, eclipsed all others and included four straight championships from 1924 through 1927.\n\nThe new association, believing that it needed a signature annual event, launched the PGA Championship later the same year. The first event was not the 72-hole stroke-play competition that the PGA Championship is today but instead a 36-hole elimination match-play tournament. Held at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York , the inaugural event featured an Englishman, James Barnes, and a Scot, Jock Hutchison, battling it out in the final round. For his victory, Barnes won $500, the Wanamaker Trophy (given to all subsequent winners of the tournament), and a diamond-studded medal contributed by Wanamaker, who was also a master jeweler, collector, and designer. The nascent tournament was then postponed for two years as a result of World War I , whereupon Barnes returned as reigning champion and won the tournament again in 1919.\n\nThe PGA Championship was the brainchild of merchandising magnate Rodman Wanamaker. At a luncheon at the Taplow Club in New York City on January 17, 1916, before 35 enthusiasts including legendary golfers Walter Hagen and Francis Ouimet along with golf course designer A.W. Tillinghast, Wanamaker aired his vision of what golfing could be. The following month the PGA of America was formed.\n\nPadraig Harrington\u2019s personal reflections on the PGA Championship\n\nMy victory at the 90th PGA Championship at Oakland Hills Country Club on August 10, 2008, in Bloomfield Township, Michigan\u2014when I became the first European to win the tournament since Scotland\u2019s Tommy Armour in 1930\u2014is one of the highlights of my career. My chief competitors that day were Sergio Garc\u00eda, whom I had defeated in a play-off the year before at the Open Championship to win my first major, and Ben Curtis.\n\nThe 2008 PGA Championship occurred just three weeks after I successfully defended my Open Championship, and it was hard for me to believe that I was so quickly in contention for a third major. Fatigue and dehydration, however, were my enemies that week, and for logical reasons. First, I was still struggling to get over the excitement and events surrounding my second Open Championship win. Second, the course was exceptionally difficult, leading several competitors that week to complain about the length of the rough and \u201cunfair\u201d pin placements. Winning championships in golf is often more of a mental feat than a physical accomplishment, and the PGA Championship that year would prove no different.\n\nAfter the second round I was six shots off the lead and felt awful. I was mentally fried, and my coordination had gone. I spoke to my trainer, and, after a few questions, he decided that I must be dehydrated. This actually made me feel better, as hydration was something I could control. I immediately drank more liquids and rested as much as possible.\n\nThe third round was tough, and, due to thunderstorms, play was stopped after nine holes and delayed until Sunday morning. This was fine by me, as I could get more rest and everyone would be playing in similar conditions the next morning. I ended up shooting 66 for my third round, making me one over par for the tournament. I returned home and slept for a few hours while the leaders were still playing, and by the time I got up the leaders had finished. I was now four strokes off the lead and positioned in the second-to-last group, with Sergio and Charlie Wi, for our final round. I was in a good position to get into contention.\n\nIn the major championships, the real tournament begins on the final nine holes on Sunday. Due to my group\u2019s finishing the third round earlier that morning, our final round did not begin until the afternoon. I started out well, making a par on the first hole and then a birdie on the second. In my mind Sergio, my playing partner, was the man to chase. On the eighth hole I hit the green in two with a good five wood, and on the ninth I made a par from the right bunker. But it still seemed like Sergio\u2019s tournament to win, as he had played well on the front nine and made several good saves. However, the back nine was still to come.\n\nI birdied the 10th hole after hitting an eight iron to within about 15 feet (4.6 metres) of the pin to get me to one under par. I then parred the 11th but had a bad drive on the par-five 12th. I had a risky second shot but felt at this stage that I needed to make some birdies, so I hit a big hook with a five wood around a tree. The ball hit the middle of the green and ran over the back, from where I got up and down for a birdie. This got me to one behind Sergio as he made a par. I finally caught him on the 13th but then bogeyed the next hole. Sergio hit the flagstick with his second shot on the 15th, and I hit my second shot to within about 12 feet (3.6 metres) from the pin, just beyond Sergio\u2019s placement; we both missed and tapped in for pars, leaving me still one shot behind.\n\nThe tournament reached a critical stage on the 16th hole. After two good drives, Sergio was first to play. He was farther back than me, and his second shot landed in the water. It was a critical opening, yet in trying to play safe I pulled my eight-iron second shot into the bunker. I hit a good bunker shot, but a stone got between the clubface and the ball, causing my ball to not spin and check, which meant I was left with a long 14-foot (4.3-metre) putt for par. Sergio made a 4-foot (1.2-metre) putt for bogey. I knew this was the opportunity I had to seize. I hit a great putt and saved par, drawing even with Sergio with two holes to play.\n\nAs I walked to the 17th tee, I finally felt that the tournament was there for the taking. I hit a five iron at the pin, as did Sergio. In fact, when we walked onto the green, there were two balls close to the hole, and neither of us knew which ball was whose. In fact, mine was farthest away, which meant that I would putt first. I holed it for a birdie, while Sergio missed his putt. I now had a one-stroke lead, and I felt victory would be mine if I could simply make par on the 18th, one of the most difficult and demanding holes on the course.\n\nClosing out a victory on the 72nd hole of a major tournament is seldom easy, and I did myself no favours as I pushed my drive and landed in a bunker. My ball was close to the bunker\u2019s face, and I was forced into an awkward stance, so shooting for the green was out of the question. I hit an eight iron but caught it fat and landed in the rough. Fortunately, I was left with a good lie and was able to get a club on the ball. I hit a good seven iron just right of the pin to about 18 feet (5.5 metres) from the hole. Sergio had hit his drive to the right and his second stroke into the greenside bunker, from where he played to within 9 feet (2.7 metres) of the hole. As I lined up my putt, I felt this was the stroke to win the coveted Wanamaker Trophy. It was a nice putt to have, as I saw the line immediately, but it was a double breaker and one I knew would come back from the left at the very end. I hit an excellent putt, and I felt I had holed it as soon as it left the club. Watching the ball roll in is a memory for a lifetime.\n\nSergio bogeyed the 18th, leaving him two strokes behind me, and from the reporters\u2019 hut I watched Ben Curtis bogey the 17th, which meant he needed an eagle on the 18th hole to catch me. Once his second shot came to a stop on the green, a third victory in a major tournament was mine. I was PGA Champion, and the exhilaration I felt is still hard to describe."}, {"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2018/11/1964-pga-championship.html", "page_content": "The 1964 PGA Championship was the 46th edition of this major, staged by the PGA of America. Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer staged a duel, fighting neck-and-neck all the way. But they were fighting for second place. The winner was the less-heralded Bobby Nichols.\n\nWinner: Bobby Nichols, 271\n\nWhere it was played: Columbus Country Club in Columbus, Ohio\n\nTournament dates: July 16-19, 1964\n\nLeader after first round: Bobby Nichols, 64\n\nLeader after second round: Bobby Nichols, 135\n\nLeader after third round: Bobby Nichols, 204\n\nWhat Happened at the 1964 PGA Championship\n\nSixty-four in '64, that's how Bobby Nichols started the 1964 PGA Championship. The 64 he scored in the first round was the very first 64 ever recorded in the PGA Championship.\n\nAnd Nichols never stopped, winning wire-to-wire with a total of 271. The 271 was also a new record for this event, and it was so good that it took 30 years for anyone to better it. Not until Nick Price won with a 269 at the 1994 PGA Championship was Nichols' 72-hole PGA Championship scoring record broken.\n\nNichols led by one over Arnold Palmer after three rounds. Palmer was solid in Round 4 with a 69, but Nichols carded a 67. That left Palmer tied for runner-up with defending champion Jack Nicklaus, who closed by matching the 18-hole record of 64 that Nichols had established a few days earlier. For Nicklaus, it was his third runner-up finish in a major in 1964.\n\nIt was the first of three runner-up finishes in the PGA for Palmer, who never won this championship. But in shooting 68-68-69-69, Palmer became the first golfer to score four rounds in the 60s at a major. For Nichols, it was the fourth PGA Tour win of his career. Nichols eventually finished with 11 wins on the PGA Tour, but this remained his only win in a major.\n\nFifty-one-year-old Ben Hogan was tied for fifth place following the third round, and finished tied for ninth. He played this major only once more, and Hogan had one more Top 10 finish in a major after this (at the 1967 Masters).\n\n1964 PGA Championship Final Scores\n\nBobby Nichols 64-71-69-67\u2014271 Jack Nicklaus 67-73-70-64\u2014274 Arnold Palmer 68-68-69-69\u2014274 Mason Rudolph 73-66-68-69\u2014276 Tom Nieporte 68-71-68-72\u2014279 Ken Venturi 72-65-73-69\u2014279 Bo Wininger 69-68-73-70\u2014280 Gay Brewer 72-71-71-67\u2014281 Billy Casper 68-72-70-72\u2014282 Jon Gustin 69-76-71-66\u2014282 Ben Hogan 70-72-68-72\u2014282 Tony Lema 71-68-72-71\u2014282 Ed Furgol 71-69-72-71\u2014283 Billy Maxwell 72-71-70-70\u2014283 Gary Player 70-71-71-71\u2014283 Mike Souchak 67-73-71-72\u2014283 Walter Burkemo 70-71-72-71\u2014284 Jacky Cupit 72-71-72-69\u2014284 Bob Charles 68-71-73-73\u2014285 Al Geiberger 73-72-72-68\u2014285 Tommy Aaron 72-74-70-70\u2014286 Julius Boros 70-73-71-72\u2014286 Gardner Dickinson 74-74-68-71\u2014287 Mike Fetchick 74-73-74-66\u2014287 Ted Kroll 72-73-72-70\u2014287 Ed Kroll 75-72-72-68\u2014287 Dick Rhyan 71-72-71-73\u2014287 Bill Bisdorf 73-72-73-70\u2014288 Jim Ferree 70-72-75-71\u2014288 Dick Hart 73-73-72-70\u2014288 George Knudson 76-69-72-71\u2014288 Doug Sanders 71-73-76-68\u2014288 Frank Beard 72-72-71-74\u2014289 Al Besselink 71-73-72-73\u2014289 Pete Brown 71-75-73-70\u2014289 Paul Haviland 68-73-73-75\u2014289 Gene Littler 75-72-74-68\u2014289 Dave Ragan 73-71-74-71\u2014289 Don Bies 76-66-76-72\u2014290 Joe Campbell 73-72-71-74\u2014290 Bruce Devlin 70-73-76-71\u2014290 Bob Keller 69-75-72-74\u2014290 Jack Rule 74-71-72-73\u2014290 George Bayer 71-74-76-70\u2014291 Jack Burke Jr. 74-72-73-72\u2014291 Chi Chi Rodriguez 71-74-71-75\u2014291 Joe Conrad 69-72-74-76\u2014291 John Cook 75-72-70-74\u2014291 Chick Harbert 74-75-68-74\u2014291 Babe Lichardus 72-74-73-72\u2014291 Fred Wampler 74-73-71-73\u2014291 Pete Cooper 77-71-73-71\u2014292 J.C.

And that made him the first golfer to win all four of the professional majors at least twice each. In other words, his win here made Nicklaus the first-ever to win the double career grand slam.\n\nNicklaus opened with a 69, took the lead with another 69 in the second round, then cruised to the win. Nicklaus led by four strokes after a third-round 70, with Gary Player pursuing. But in the final round, Player could do no better than match Nicklaus' 73 and finished tied for fourth. The golfers who finished 2-3 \u2014 Billy Casper and Tommy Bolt \u2014 started the final round well back of Nicklaus and never threatened his lead.\n\nBolt was 55 years old at the time of the 1971 PGA Championship, and hadn't posted a Top 10 finish in a major since 1965. His third-place showing here was his last Top 10 in a major. For Casper, it was his third time finishing as runner-up in a PGA Championship, a tournament he never won.\n\nThis was Nicklaus' ninth career win in a professional major, tying Ben Hogan on the all-time list for second at the time, behind only Walter Hagen's 11 wins in the pro majors. It was the 34th overall win for Nicklaus on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe PGA was played in February this year, making it the first major of the year rather than the last. Sixty-nine-year-old Gene Sarazen completed the first two rounds and missed the cut, nearly 50 years after his win in the 1922 PGA Championship (he also won this major in 1923 and 1933). He entered in 1972, but withdrew, so the 1971 PGA is the last one in which he completed play. Walter Burkemo, winner of the 1953 PGA Championship, played in his final major here and missed the cut. And Chandler Harper, winner of the 1950 PGA Championship, also made his final start in any major here. At age 56, he made the cut but withdrew following the third round.\n\n1971 PGA Championship Final Scores\n\nJack Nicklaus 69-69-70-73\u2014281 Billy Casper 71-73-71-68\u2014283 Tommy Bolt 72-74-69-69\u2014284 Gary Player 71-73-68-73\u2014285 Miller Barber 72-68-75-70\u2014285 Jim Jamieson 72-72-72-70\u2014286 Gibby Gilbert 74-67-72-73\u2014286 Dave Hill 74-71-71-70\u2014286 Bob Lunn 72-70-73-72\u2014287 Jerry Heard 73-71-72-71\u2014287 Fred Marti 72-71-74-70\u2014287 Bob Rosburg 74-72-70-71\u2014287 Larry Hinson 71-73-73-71\u2014288 Bruce Devlin 71-71-74-72\u2014288 Frank Beard 74-71-73-70\u2014288 Bob Charles 70-75-70-73\u2014288 Lee Trevino 71-73-75-69\u2014288 Herb Hooper 74-71-73-71\u2014289 Arnold Palmer 75-71-70-73\u2014289 Bob E.

The PGA of America, meanwhile, maintained ownership of two events: the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup matches.\n\nWith that as the table setter, here\u2019s a look at the winningest players of the \u201ctour\u201d over the last ten (10) decades, beginning with the first full 10-year stretch: the 1920s.\n\nPGA Tour Decade: 1920s\n\nNo surprise here: Walter Hagen compiled 31 of his 45 career wins in the \u201cRoaring 20s.\u201d Nine of those victories were majors \u2013 5 PGAs, 4 British Opens. (The dapperly-dressed golfer had already won a pair of U.S. Opens in 1914 and 1919. The Masters was not founded until 1934.)\n\nHagen was followed by the underrated Leo Diegel, who won 22 times, including back-to-back PGAs at the end of the decade (1928-29) \u2013 which ended Hagen\u2019s four-year winning streak.\n\nThe decade\u2019s most celebrated golfer, though, was amateur Bobby Jones, who won five of his seven credited pro majors, along with what was then considered the \u201cGrand Slam\u201d in 1930 \u2013 all four major championships in the same calendar year (U.S. and British Opens and U.S. and British Amateurs).\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1920s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

He then parred Nos. 16, 17, and 18 to preserve the tie.\n\n\u201cIt was the greatest thrill I\u2019ve ever known in golf, or ever expect to get again,\u201d Sarazen told famed sports writer Grantland Rice after his final round.\n\nThe following day, the pair played a 36-hole playoff, with Sarazen winning by five shots.\n\nWhile less known than Sarazen, Paul Runyan claimed the most PGA titles in this decade, racking up 29 victories, including 16 in a two-season span (1934-35). He also won a pair of PGA Championships (1934 and 1939) during this time period.\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1930s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1. Paul Runyan (29/30)\n\n2.

Craig Wood (2/2)\n\nPGA Tour Decade: 1950s\n\nFollowing a serious car accident in 1949, Ben Hogan\u2018s playing career was limited to major championships, and a handful of elite events.\n\nFor example, in 1951, Hogan entered just five events, but won three of them: the Masters, U.S. Open, and World Championship of Golf. (He finished second and fourth in his other two starts.)\n\nHogan\u2019s 1953 season was even more impressive, and is considered one of the greatest in history: the then 40-year-old won five of the six tournaments he entered, including all three major championships (Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open). To this day, Hogan remains the only player to have won all three in the same calendar year.\n\nIt was Sam Snead, though, who hoisted the most trophies in the 1950s. \u201cThe Slammer\u201d chased 32 wins in the 40s with 29 titles in the 50s, including three more majors.\n\nSnead and Jack Nicklaus are the only PGA Tour members to have won more than 25 times in two different decades.\n\nThe unheralded Cary Middlecoff won 28 times in the 50s, including back-to-back majors in 1955 and 1956, while the Lloyd Mangrum appeared once again on the decade-ending list, adding 17 to the 19 he\u2019d recorded in the 40s.\n\nFinally, Australian legend Peter Thompson won four of his five British Opens in the 1950s. Although, they were captured in an era (mid 1950s) when very few of the leading U.S. tour pros played in the event. At that time, The Open\u2019s prize money was such that it did not cover the expenses to travel \u201cacross the pond.\u201d For instance, Thompson earned just $750 for his 1955 Open Championship title, while Cary Middlecoff was awarded $5,000 for winning the 1955 Masters. (Thomson, though, cemented his legacy with a fifth Open title in 1965 against a strong field which included the likes of Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player.)\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1950s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

With the advent of TV, the charismatic star transcended golf and became a pitchman for corporate America. \u201cThe King\u201d won 43 times in the 60s, including 29 tour titles over a four-season span (1960-1963), five of which were majors (2 Masters, 2 British Opens, 1 U.S. Open).\n\nPalmer\u2019s participation (and wins) at The Open Championship in the early 60s is widely credited with restoring the status of the British Major among U.S. players.\n\nA young Jack Nicklaus became Palmer\u2019s main rival during this period. Nicklaus would win 30 of his 73 titles in the 60s, and go on to become the greatest golfer of all time, while Palmer would become its most beloved.\n\nBilly Casper, one of the most underrated golfers in PGA Tour history, would win 33 times in the 60s against icons such as Palmer, Nicklaus, and Gary Player.\n\nTony Lema won a dozen times too, including the 1964 British Open. He seemed destined to win so many more, but two months after winning his 12th PGA Tour title (in less than four years), Lema died in a plane crash at the age of 32.\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1960s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

Multiple 1-major winners\n\nPGA Tour Decade: 1970s\n\nJack Nicklaus followed up his 30-win decade of the 60s with 38 more titles in the 70s including eight (8) majors. The Golden Bear was particularly dominate for the first six seasons \u2013 between 1970 and 1975, when he won seven majors, while finishing inside the top-10 in 22 of 24 major starts, including 14 top-3s.\n\nWith Palmer now in his 40s, Nicklaus\u2019 main rivals included Lee Trevino, Johnny Miller, and Tom Watson.\n\nTrevino won 21 times during the decade, highlighted by 14 titles in a four-season span (1971-1974), including four majors (1971 U.S. Open and British Open, 1972 British Open, 1974 PGA).\n\nPart of Trevino\u2019s epic run included a 20-day span in the summer of 1971 when he defeated Nicklaus in an 18-hole playoff to win the 1971 U.S. Open. Two weeks later, he captured the Canadian Open, and the following week claimed The British Open, becoming the first player to win those three Open titles in the same year. These three Opens were one time called the Triple Crown.\n\nFor a three-year period, in the middle of the decade, Johnny Miller also threatened Nicklaus\u2019 reign. The California native won 18 times in the 70s, with 15 of those wins coming in a three-season blitz (1974 \u2013 1976). Following his second major at the 1976 British Open, Miller came down with a putting affliction known as the \u201cyips.\u201d He was never the same.\n\nWatson would be Nicklaus\u2019 third rival of the decade. The Kansas City native racked up 15 wins during the final three seasons of the 70s, including three majors.\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1970s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

The game became more global as well, with some of its biggest stars \u2013 such as Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Seve Ballesteros, and Bernhard Langer \u2013 competing part-time on the PGA Tour. It marked the first time a decade\u2019s win leader failed to earn 20 titles.\n\nTom Watson cashed 19 first-place checks, including five majors, while Curtis Strange won 16 times, highlighted by back-to-back U.S. Opens. After that it was a mixed bag of parity\u2026 but a lot of money.\n\nSpain\u2019s Ballesteros won seven times on the PGA Tour, but four of those were majors, including a matching pair of Green Jackets and Claret Jugs. Faldo won three times \u2013 two of which were major titles.\n\nSimilarly, Jack Nicklaus, now in his 40s, won only five more times, but three were majors, highlighted by his iconic victory at the 1986 Masters.\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1980s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

Sandy Lyle (2/2)\n\nPGA Tour Decade: 1990s\n\nThe 90s were more of the same with lots of cash but no dominant force\u2026 until the arrival of a young man named Tiger.\n\nEnglishman Nick Faldo, who played primarily on the European Tour, continued his dominance on the big stage, with four more major titles, three between 1990 and 1992.\n\nOn the tour, Zimbabwean Nick Price won 16 times, with 12 of those coming in a three-season span (1992-94), including three majors.\n\nThe end of the decade was dominated by a young Tiger Woods, who won 15 times, bookended by a blowout victory at the 1997 Masters and an eight-win 1999 campaign, which included a second major (PGA).\n\nCo-starring, alongside the two Nicks (Faldo/Price) and Woods, were Hall of Famers such as Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, Mark O\u2019Meara, and Greg Norman, who each earned a dozen or more victories, including a major (or two).\n\nFinally, David Duval, who just missed the list with 11 titles, at one point seemed like Woods\u2019 most natural rival. His three-season run, from 1997 to 1999, included 11 wins, a world No. 1 ranking, and season-ending finishes of 2nd-1st-2nd on the PGA Tour Money List. He won again in each of the next two seasons, including the 2001 British Open. At just 29, he was a major champion with 13 PGA Tour titles, and considered a surefire Hall of Famer. Yet, the following season, Duval completely lost his form, and by 2004 he was essentially finished.\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 1990s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1. Nick Price (16/18)\n\n2.

During this span, he also won 12 more majors, including a record four straight, stretching over two seasons: 2000 (U.S. Open, British Open, PGA) and 2001 (Masters), which is known as the \u201cTiger Slam.\u201d (The reigning champion of all four majors at the same time.)\n\nWoods\u2019 rivals during the 2000s were mainly Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson, who each won over 20 titles and multiple majors.\n\nErnie Els, who split time between the tours in Europe and the U.S., won nine times, as did Jim Furyk and David Toms.\n\nIrishman Padraig Harrington won five PGA tour titles in the decade, including three majors in a two-season span (2007 and 2008 British Open, 2008 PGA).\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 2000s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

Just 35 years-old when the 2010 decade started, Woods was a shell of his former self.\n\nInstead the decade was headlined by a batch of younger stars who grew up idolizing the golf icon.\n\nRory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson each won 18 times during the decade with Bubba Watson and Jason Day picking up 12 wins each.

Woods also hoisted 11 trophies, punctuated by a long-awaited 15th major at the 2019 Masters.\n\nIn terms of majors, it was McIlroy, Spieth and Brooks Koepka, with each dominating one-third of the decade. McIlroy owned the early part, with four majors between 2011 and 2014, including consecutive titles in the summer of 2014 (The Open and PGA), while Spieth reigned in the middle portion, highlighted by an historic 2015 campaign. Koepka became something of a major specialist, claiming four titles at the end of the decade, featuring back-to-back U.S. Opens (2017 and 2018) and PGAs (2018 and 2019).\n\nPGA Tour Wins: 2010s\n\nRank-Player (Decade Wins/Career Wins)\n\n1.

He was supremely influential in raising the stature of the golf professional. His flair and style helped bring the first wave of golf popularity in America. Hagen was an integral part of the early years of the Ryder Cup. He earned 11 major championships, the 3rd most in PGA Tour history, and was the first American-born golfer to win the Open Championship. Learn about the legacy of the Haig.\n\nWalter Hagen was born December 21, 1892 in Rochester, New York. Hagen began developing his golf game as a pre-teen working at the Country Club of Rochester as a caddie. His skills improved into expert level by his mid-teens, soon after he was hired to give lessons and work at the pro shop at the club. Hagen\u2019s sports talent wasn\u2019t limited to golf; he was also a skilled baseball player, usually playing pitcher or shortstop. He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and offered a position on the team. However, Hagen ended up choosing the path of golf because he could control his own fate and not have to rely on teammates. His baseball background lead to Hagen having one of the widest stance in golf history.\n\nSir Walter went professional at the age of 19 in 1912 at the Canadian Open where he finished 11th. Hagen, as an unknown, competed at the 1913 U.S. Open arriving with the statement \u201cI\u2019m here to help you beat the Brits.\u201d He finished in 4th place. In 1914 Hagen returned to the U.S. Open and emerged victorious, winning his first major championship with a course record first round of 68. Starting in 1918 Hagen became the first club professional at the Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he worked until 1919. He then became the first touring professional golfer that was not associated with a club.\n\nIn 1919 the Haig won his second U.S. Open championship. He then saw his greatest period of success in the 1920\u2019s with 9 major championships. Winning the Open Championship four times and the PGA Championship five times, four of which were consecutive wins. This was quite an accomplishment considering Hagen\u2019s career coincided with the first big wave of highly talented golfers on the American scene. He had plenty of great rivals like Gene Sarazen and Bobby Jones; Jones bested Hagen when they met in the majors but Hagen badly beat Jones in an exhibition match in 1926.\n\nWalter Hagen made an impression at his first Open Championship at Royal Cinque Ports in 1920. He wasn\u2019t allowed in the clubhouse, so Hagen rented a limo and parked it in front of the course to use as his private changing room. He won in 1922 becoming the first American-born golfer to capture the Claret Jug. Hagen loved the Open Championship, it was one of his favorite tournaments to compete in. He once lost an exhibition match in England the week prior to the Open by a tremendous margin, critics thought he had no chance that year. However, always the recovery artist, Hagen proved the doubters wrong by winning the Claret Jug that year.\n\nWhile the Open was one of Hagen\u2019s favorite, he excelled the most at the PGA Championship. Walter Hagen was one of the earliest golf psychologists and he used this to his advantage at the PGA Championship. The PGA Championship at the time was played as match-play. Hagen utilized every trick in the book to defeat his opponents. He\u2019d play psychological tricks on them like using a choke down 4-wood shot when it was really a short iron shot, so as his opponent saw him use a 4-wood they would also use a wood but overshoot the green. Another trick Hagen used was inspecting his opponent\u2019s lie and shake his head in disapproval.\n\nIn 1924, Hagen won his second PGA Championship and went on a four-year winning streak. When he lost in 1928, Hagen had to turn over the Wanamaker Trophy to the new champion Leo Diegel. However, three-years prior, in 1925, Hagen lost the trophy in Chicago. When cruising the town in a taxi, Hagen hopped out to join a friend heading to a club. He gave the cabbie $5 to bring the trophy to his hotel, which was the last time he saw it. In 1926, when asked about the trophy, Hagen joked he didn\u2019t bring it because he didn\u2019t intend to lose it. He finally had to admit he\u2019d lost the trophy in 1928. A replica was made, which is now what the PGA Champion receives. In 1930, the original Wanamaker trophy was found in the basement of L.A. Young & Company, a firm which produced Walter Hagen golf clubs. It\u2019s a mystery of how it arrived in that location, but it has since been retired and resides on display in the PGA Historical Center in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nWalter Hagen wasn\u2019t the most accurate off the tee box; he anticipated that he\u2019d make at least seven mistakes a match. He never attempted to fix his game, he simply accepted his setbacks and focused on the next shot or round. What set Hagen apart was his excellent recovery skills and stellar putting. His short game was superb as he often made sensational shots. Interestingly over his near 30 years of competing he never three-putted on the 18th green.\n\nHis flare didn\u2019t stop at his golf game; he was known for colorful outfits and was the first athlete to be named on the Best Dressed Americans list. He played to the crowds and helped fans get excited about golf. Sir Walter would often show up to tournaments in limousines, sometimes pulling right up to the first tee. Hagen would occasional arrive to the tee box in dinner coats or tuxedos to give the impression he\u2019d been out all night. His flamboyant style and personality made him one of the first big superstars and ambassador for the game.\n\nHagen helped change the dynamic of the golf professional. When he entered the golfing world, the golf professional was below the amateur. It was looked down upon to earn money from sport. Hagen rallied fellow professionals and played a vital role in the formation of the Professional Golfers Association of America, the PGA. He changed the landscape and brought golfers from outside to inside the clubhouse. He became the first golfer to earn a million dollars.\n\nHagen played a critical role in the early days of the Ryder Cup, being the captain of the U.S. team for the first six Cups played. The Haig\u2019s illustrious career began winding down in the late 1930s, with his last victory on the PGA Tour coming in 1936 at the Inverness Invitational Four-Ball. He played in his final major championship at the 1942 PGA Championship. Hagen didn\u2019t capture the career Grand Slam because the Masters Tournament began after his prime, his best Masters finish was tying for 11th place.\n\nHagen passed away in 1969 in Traverse City, Michigan, at the age of 76. His legacy and impact on the game lives on as he\u2019s considered one of the greatest golfers of all time. In 1974 he was an inaugural inductee into the World Golf Hall of Fame."}]}
