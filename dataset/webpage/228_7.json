During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/john-vallely/", "page_content": "John Vallely (born October 3, 1948) is a retired American basketball player from Balboa Island, Newport Beach, California.

His death was attributed to a heart attack.\n\nMaravich, in town to discuss plans for a movie about his life, was stricken during a half-court game in a gym at Pasadena\u2019s First Church of the Nazarene, where he also was going to tape an interview for a religious radio show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGary Lydick, one of the players, said: \u201cMaravich turned to walk away and immediately fell to the floor. He wasn\u2019t playing hard at all, and then the next thing, he just fell.\n\n\u201cWe could tell immediately that it was very severe. I\u2019m sure he probably went into a seizure. His eyes started to roll and he became very jaundiced almost within a minute or two.\u201d\n\nMaravich\u2019s sudden death shocked the basketball world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely shocked--it threw me back,\u201d said UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard, a National Basketball Assn. teammate of Maravich\u2019s at Atlanta in the early 1970s. \u201cHe had unbelievable skills, a tremendously gifted athlete. I can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cRemember, they didn\u2019t have the three-point line when Maravich played. I figure if he\u2019d played with the three-point shot, you could add one-third more to his career scoring total.\u201d\n\nCalvin Murphy, a rival NBA guard who became a close friend, was all but speechless when informed of Maravich\u2019s death early Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too tough to talk now. I can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d he said, hanging up.\n\nJerry West, the Lakers\u2019 general manager and a fellow NBA Hall of Fame guard, remembered Maravich, who played 10 years in the NBA until he retired in 1980, as bringing much-needed showmanship to the NBA.\n\n\u201cHe was a really unique player who brought excitement and flair to the league at a time when the NBA really needed it,\u201d West said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy. He was such a religious guy . . . and he was very health conscious.\u201d\n\nJohn Wooden, former UCLA coach, used to room with Maravich\u2019s father, Press, at a North Carolina boys\u2019 basketball camp, where Wooden first saw Pete.\n\n\u201cEven then, as a little boy, he could do things with a basketball that were amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember Press telling me: \u2018I\u2019m going to turn that boy into the first million-dollar pro basketball player.\u2019\n\n\u201cPete was a tremendous scorer, an outstanding shooter--but he never had an outstanding percentage because he took so many crazy shots. As an offensive player, I wouldn\u2019t consider him as being in the class of Oscar Robertson or Jerry West, but he certainly was the best ballhandler I ever saw. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad. He was so young.\u201d\n\nNews of Maravich\u2019s death shocked many at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La., where Maravich scored 3,667 points, an all-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record, in his three seasons, ending in 1970. Maravich\u2019s 44.5 and 44.2 one-season and career scoring averages are still NCAA records.\n\nPress Maravich, Pete\u2019s coach at LSU, died at 71 last April.\n\n\u201cI got a call from a Pasadena sportswriter this morning, who told me Pete had died suddenly,\u201d said Jamie Kimbrough, LSU sports information director. \u201cMy first reaction was one of anger, because I thought it was a very bad joke. Pete was here just a month ago and seemed fine.\n\n\u201cThen when it registered with me that he was serious, the shock set in. Within 15 minutes, we were bombarded with calls from TV and radio stations, and newspapers.\u201d\n\nMaravich, known as Pistol Pete throughout his career, became embittered toward his alma mater after his father was fired by LSU in 1971. He severed relations with the school and only recently rejoined the LSU family.\n\nJoe Dean, now LSU\u2019s athletic director and a friend of Maravich in his college years, summed up LSU feelings Tuesday:\n\n\u201cTo say we\u2019re shocked would be the understatement of the year. We\u2019re all deeply saddened. That young man had gone through so much, his mother\u2019s suicide years ago, and Press\u2019 death (last April).\n\n\u201cI can only say we\u2019re happy he came back into the LSU family before he died. We unveiled a portrait of Pete and Press last month, and he came here for that.\n\n\u201cHe has to be one of the greatest athletes to play any sport, anywhere in the world. I said when I introduced him here last month that, inch for inch and pound for pound, he was the greatest basketball player ever to step onto a court.\u201d\n\nSportswriter Mike McKenzie of the Kansas City Star and Times, who knew Maravich well when he covered the Atlanta Hawks in the early 1970s, recalled Tuesday the depths of Maravich\u2019s former bitterness toward LSU.\n\n\u201cIn 1973, when he was with the Hawks, Atlanta was to play an exhibition game at the new LSU arena, the so-called House that Pete Built,\u201d McKenzie recalled.\n\n\u201cI remember Pete saying to me before the game: \u2018They\u2019ve got my jersey hanging in a trophy case in there, and it has a hole in it--right in the back, where they stuck the knife into my father.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhile widely acknowledged as one of basketball\u2019s greatest offensive performers, the 6-foot 5-inch Maravich certainly never looked the part. He looked like a skinny, scruffy refugee from a YMCA league, with his trademark droopy socks flopping about his ankles, always a baggy, stretched-out jersey and a mop-style haircut.\n\nBut he had hands like Van Cliburn, a sprinter\u2019s speed and ballhandling and passing skills that hadn\u2019t been seen in the sport since the days of Goose Tatum, Bob Cousy and Meadowlark Lemon.\n\nHis game was a bewildering panorama of 25-foot feather-touch jump shots; behind-the-back, between-the-legs and around-the-neck bull\u2019s-eye passes. One night, as an LSU sophomore, he scored 69 points against Alabama.\n\nHe had 28 50-point games at LSU. As a collegian, he scored more points than anyone else, more than Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson or Frank Selvy.\n\nOn the night he scored 69 against Alabama, he sank a half-court hook shot at the halftime buzzer.\n\nIn a 1969 interview with The Times, Maravich told of an unfulfilled dream, one that revealed the showman in the 22-year-old athlete.\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve always wanted to do is spin a ball on my finger, then, with one second left on the clock, bounce the ball off my head and into the basket, and win a game.\u201d\n\nFormer USC coach Bob Boyd once pointed out that Maravich was a master at drawing fouls.\n\n\u201cAll you had to do was just brush him when he was shooting, and he\u2019d flop to the floor like a wet mackerel,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nMaravich made 893 free throws in three seasons, still the NCAA record.\n\nHe was born into the sport. For years, Maravich\u2019s father told the story of a wager he made with the doctor on the June night in 1947 that Pete was born, in Aliquippa, Pa.\n\n\u201cI told the doctor at the hospital: \u2018Doc, I want a son. If it\u2019s a boy, I\u2019ll pay you. If it\u2019s a girl, you pay me.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe doctor agreed. Later, he emerged from the delivery room with a smile and said: \u2018You pay.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf Maravich was steered into basketball by his father, though, he went willingly.\n\n\u201cI even took a basketball to bed with me until I was 14,\u201d he said in his NBA Hall of Fame induction speech in 1986. \u201cI would just lie there in bed, throwing it up and doing fingertip drills.\u201d\n\nHis father. a former pro basketball player with the Pittsburgh Ironmen, maintained that hard work, not genes, turned his son into an outstanding player.\n\n\u201cWhen he was 7, I got him a basketball for Christmas, but he wasn\u2019t interested--not until I shot a few baskets with it and made a few. It looked easy to him, and he took his first shot and missed. When I saw how angry he got at missing, I knew I had him hooked.\u201d\n\nMaravich was drafted by the NBA\u2019s Atlanta Hawks in 1970 and immediately had problems with his teammates after signing a $1.9-million contract. During his pro career, Maravich also played with the New Orleans/Utah Jazz and the Boston Celtics.\n\nAn Atlanta teammate, John Vallely, remembered Maravich\u2019s foot speed as much as his passing and shooting.\n\n\u201cHis speed always impressed me as much as anything,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom one end of the court to the other, he was a step faster than anyone else in the league.\n\n\u201cAs a pure shooter, he wasn\u2019t a fundamentally good shooter, not in the way Jerry West was. Pete shot the ball differently every time he put it up. Sometimes he lobbed it up like a shotput. He was a great scorer, but not a great shooter.\n\n\u201cHe was socially friendly with everyone on the team in Atlanta, but he was basically a loner. He hated the whole scene of dealing with the press, for example. He needed a lot of alone time. But when he was on the court, in front of a big crowd, he loved every bit of that. To Pete, that was showtime.\u201d\n\nIn his New Orleans years, 1974-79, it was showtime in the Superdome, where Maravich sometimes attracted crowds of more than 30,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d said Butch van Breda Kolff, Maravich\u2019s coach in New Orleans and now coach at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to believe.\n\n\u201cA lot of people remember the fancy passes, all those long jump shots. But I\u2019ll always remember Pete\u2019s great heart.\n\n\u201cOne time I took him to a New Orleans health club and beat him in a racquetball game. He was furious. I mean, he wouldn\u2019t speak to me. He got in his car and drove home at 75 m.p.h. The next day, he demanded another game, and beat me.\n\n\u201cOne year the (team) gave our players an off-season conditioning program, and they told me it was so tough that probably no one would stick with it for the whole off-season. Pete did, and he was the only one.\u201d\n\nIn the NBA, although Maravich was considered by some the game\u2019s best ballhandler and scorer, some others called him a ball hog, hotdog, hothead and a loser.\n\n\u201cI play the way I\u2019m told to play,\u201d Maravich told The Times, in 1975. \u201cI can play any kind of style anyone wants. Management wants me to shoot a lot and make a lot of good passes and they\u2019re paying me, so that\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nMaravich led the NBA in scoring one season, 1976-77.

John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin.

Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}], "John Vallely returned to UCLA to complete his degree in sociology.": [{"url": "https://vallely.com/johnvallely.htm", "page_content": "John Vallely:\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nBy Tom Vallely\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely was an All American basketball player at UCLA and was a first round draft choice of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA in 1971.

In his three seasons, UCLA was 86-4.\n\n\u201cIt was the best of times,\u201d says Wicks, who will be honored along with other members of the Bruins\u2019 1969 championship team Saturday at Pauley Pavilion. \u201cMy experience there as a player, as a student, as a person . . . was unbelievable -- topped by being around the greatest coach in the history of athletics.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Wicks was never able to replicate the experience during 10 seasons in the NBA.\n\nThe No. 2 pick in the 1971 draft, he was rookie of the year in his first season with the fledgling Portland Trail Blazers and made the All-Star game in each of his first four. But after averaging 24.5 points and 11.5 rebounds as a rookie, Wicks saw his scoring average decline in each of his next nine seasons, the last five with the Boston Celtics and then-San Diego Clippers.\n\nWhen he retired in 1981, he had appeared in only nine playoff games -- only one of his teams made the playoffs and just two even had winning records -- and was generally regarded as having fallen short of living up to his enormous potential. As the late Stu Inman, a former Trail Blazers executive, later told the Portland Tribune, \u201cI would have drawn the conclusion he would have had a much better career.\u201d\n\nWicks calls the criticism unfair, \u201cbut that\u2019s not for me to say,\u201d he notes. He averaged 16.8 points and 8.7 rebounds.\n\n\u201cI think I did as well as I could,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Portland, I think I did extremely well. And then when I went to the Celtics, we did extremely well as a team; we went to the [semifinals] in the Eastern Conference. In San Diego, we were a building franchise that didn\u2019t get its wings and still hasn\u2019t gotten its wings. . . .\n\n\u201cI think my career may have gotten cut short a little bit, but besides that, I have no regrets.\u201d\n\nAt UCLA, of course, there was no denying his brilliance. John Vallely, Wicks\u2019 teammate for two seasons in Westwood, calls the dynamic forward \u201cone of the most talented players to ever come through UCLA\u201d and \u201ca tremendous college player.\u201d\n\nWicks, who will turn 60 in September, later returned to UCLA as a volunteer assistant coach to Walt Hazzard, a four-year stint that ended when Hazzard and his staff were fired in 1988.\n\nAfter that, Wicks retreated from public life, living for years in Atlanta before settling in North Carolina. Divorced, the Hamilton High graduate makes frequent trips to Los Angeles, where he owns a home and his daughter works in the film industry.\n\n\u201cThe only place I wanted to coach was UCLA,\u201d says Wicks, who makes his living as a real estate investor. \u201cI felt really happy there. It was familiar surroundings, making my university hopefully do better . . . and being around these young guys and seeing them grow as people as well as athletes.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool . . . and so gratifying to me. But once that was over, I didn\u2019t want to do it anywhere else.\n\n\u201cI just wish we\u2019d done better and been able to stay.\u201d\n\nIn North Carolina, Wicks says, \u201cI\u2019m just living my life. I haven\u2019t disappeared or anything like that.\u201d\n\nHis passions include sports and travel.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m very into the arts,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m into people; people are my thing. I was a sociology major, and I\u2019m a people person.\u201d\n\nHis only health issue, Wicks says, is a balky back, the aftereffect of a serious traffic accident in which a car he was driving was broadsided by a cement truck about 20 years ago. Suffering a ruptured spleen, broken ribs and other injuries, Wicks was unconscious for a week and hospitalized for three.\n\n\u201cIt was touch and go,\u201d he says.\n\nMore recently, Wicks says, he suffered a \u201cfamily tragedy,\u201d politely declining to offer specifics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into it,\u201d he says, \u201cbut up until that time, everything was sweet. It couldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d\n\nThis Saturday, he hopes to reconnect with old friends.\n\n\u201cI sometimes see guys when I\u2019m out in L.A.,\u201d he says of his former teammates, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have a lot of contact.\u201d\n\n--\n\njerome.crowe@latimes.com"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-xpm-2006-11-28-dpt-vallely28-story.html", "page_content": "Corona del Mar High will retire John Vallely\u2019s No. 21, making the 1966 Sea King graduate, who went on to star at Orange Coast College and UCLA, the first player to have his jersey retired in school history.\n\nVallely, 58, will be honored at halftime of CdM\u2019s season opener against Newport Harbor on Thursday at 7 p.m. There will also be a two-minute video tribute to Vallely by his former UCLA coach, legendary John Wooden.

Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft muscle tissue.\n\n\u201cAs a result of losing Erin that day, we\u2019ve been giving our time and funds and effort to try to change the world for these children that fight cancer,\u201d Vallely said.\n\nThe UCLA Hall of Famer fought a long battle of non-Hodgkins lymphoma himself in 2003, pulling inspiration from his daughter\u2019s perseverance in his long journey to remission.\n\nAfter undergoing multiple rounds of stem cell treatment, Vallely decided that serving as a longtime member on the board of directors for the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201c(Vallely) had this idea,\u201d said Ashley Armstrong, an associate athletic director. \u201cAnd so he brought it to me and (Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero) and talked about wanting to partner with the basketball programs.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Dribble for the Cure debuted as an annual event hosted by UCLA. PCRF, the Cancer Research Program at Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital and UCLA Athletics put on the event for kids, students and families.\n\n\u201c(Guerrero) kind of left it up to me to decide how we wanted to do the event,\u201d Armstrong said. She was the director of student-athlete development at the time.\n\nParticipants receive pledges to raise money for pediatric cancer by dribbling a 1-mile course from Drake Stadium to Pauley Pavilion.\n\nDribble for the Cure has brought in $1,464,350 from 7,425 participants over the past 10 years. Participants raised just over $80,000 in the event\u2019s inaugural year, but has since increased in proceeds each year.\n\nSt. John\u2019s University \u2013 the only other institution that currently hosts the event \u2013 held its eighth Dribble for the Cure on Sept. 22 and has raised over $500,000 since it first ran the event in 2011.\n\nThe money raised is split evenly between PCRF and the Cancer Research Program at Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nUCLA\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball players have also played an integral role in the event, dribbling the course with the participants and signing autographs at the end.\n\n\u201cOver the last 11 years, we\u2019ve had different coaches (both men\u2019s and women\u2019s),\u201d said Ric Coy, the current director of student-athlete development. \u201cEach coach that we have brought in has totally been happily involved in this event because they see the purpose of it.\u201d\n\nCoy has been assisting Armstrong in Dribble for the Cure since 2008, but took over coordinating duties in 2016. This will be Coy\u2019s third year leading the event.\n\nStudent-athlete participation has also grown. About 100 student-athletes from men\u2019s volleyball, women\u2019s water polo and gymnastics participated in 2017. \u201cThey may not be fundraising,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cBut they\u2019re there to help out with registration, they\u2019re painting faces, they\u2019re handing out goodies, they\u2019re hanging out with the kids and participating some way in the event.\u201d\n\nOther student groups including Bruins Fighting Pediatric Cancer as well as fraternities and sororities have participated in previous years. Armstrong said local middle schools and high schools have also been participating.\n\nUCLA\u2019s 11th annual Dribble for the Cure will be held on Sunday, coincidentally falling on what would have been coach John Wooden\u2019s 108th birthday.\n\nVallely, who came to UCLA as a junior transfer out of Orange Coast College, played on Wooden\u2019s 1969 and 1970 championship teams, and was picked by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA Draft.\n\n\u201cCoach (Wooden) taught us that finding the true meaning of success in our lives would be more important than probably anything we would ever do on the basketball court,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo I think he would be thrilled that anything was happening in relationship to him as it relates to giving others.\u201d\n\nKids will be given backpacks with the words \u201cHappy Birthday, Coach Wooden\u201d on them to honor the former UCLA coach Sunday.\n\nAs 12 year olds dribble toward Pauley Pavilion this weekend, their efforts will make strides in the fight against pediatric cancer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to help improve the survival rate in children,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of cool to know that we\u2019ve had a hand in that.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2020/jan/ucla-in-the-1980s/default.htm", "page_content": "In celebration of UCLA\u2019s first 100 years, we\u2019re traveling back in time to visit some of the people, places and moments in time that have had a lasting impression on who we are as a university.\n\nUCLA was center stage for the big events of the 1980s as the world watched the Olympic gymnastics competition broadcasting from Pauley Pavilion; the Los Angeles Lakers, with Bruin Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the starting line-up, took home five NBA championships; and UCLA became the first college to license its name as Bearwear became the top-selling college brand around the globe. By the Eighties, UCLA had been established as a leader in education with its faculty, programs and students ranked second in the nation among public universities and 17 academic departments ranked in the top 10 in the country by the Conference Board of Associated Research Councils.\n\nCAMPUS HOSTS THE OLYMPICS\n\nUCLA embraced a welcoming spirit as Bruins hosted athletes and visitors from around the world. Campus was transformed into an international Olympic Village, housing more than 4,000 athletes, coaches and trainers from 62 countries, with athletes training in campus athletic facilities. More than 160,000 spectators came to Pauley Pavilion to witness the gymnastics competitions while the Tennis Center, built for the games, held a demonstration tournament. The Alumni Association\u2019s new home, the James West Alumni Center (JWAC), was headquarters for the Olympic Organizing Committee. JWAC became the official entryway to the Olympic Village \u2014 a main street overlooking the 142 Flags of Nations. James Easton \u201959 served as mayor, greeting athletes and ensuring things went as planned. UCLA students made memories to last a lifetime as Olympic volunteers Along with being home for athletes and events, the behind-the-scenes work to produce and televise the Olympic experience also took place on campus. ABC television, which had the rights to air the games, used Spaulding Field; the press corps set up in Ackerman Student Union; and the Peter V. Ueberroth building on Le Conte housed the Los Angeles Olympic Committee. UCLA was represented by 60 athletes and coaches, the largest number from any university, who won 37 medals: 17 gold, 14 silver and six bronze for the United States and 10 other countries. Three of the six members of the first gold-medal-winning U.S. Men\u2019s Gymnastics team were Bruins: Peter Vidmar \u201983, Mitch Gaylord and Tim Daggett \u201986. Vidmar won gold on the pommel horse and Gaylord earned three additional medals, contributing to the team gold with his signature move, the Gaylord II. Sprinter Jackie Joyner-Kersee \u201985 was a student when she won silver in the heptathlon. As a young athlete, she admired two of the first women to receive UCLA athletic scholarships, track\u2019s Evelyn Ashford and basketball\u2019s Nancy Meyers \u201978. In her lifetime, Joyner-Kersee won three gold, one silver and two bronze Olympic medals and set records that still exist today. In 2001, she was named the Edward A. Dickson Alumnus of the Year by the Alumni Association. Florence Griffith Joyner \u201983, known as FloJo, is called the fastest woman of all time with records in the 100- and 200- meter races that still stand. In 1984, she won silver in the 200-meter race, and has earned a total of five career Olympic medals. The Watts native put her Cal State Northridge education on hold to help her family, transferring to UCLA when her coach, Bob Kersee, joined UCLA\u2019s staff. Two Olympic champions who did not compete in the 1984 Olympics were enrolled at UCLA during the games \u2014 Gail Devers \u201989 is an eight-time World Champion with three Olympic gold medals and Donna de Varona \u201986 was the youngest competitor at the 1960 Olympics, with two Olympic golds and an unprecedented 18 world records. De Varona retired from swimming at 17 to become the youngest, and one of the first female sportscasters for a national network. An activist for youth sports, equality in sports and expanding opportunities for women, she received the Olympic Order, the International Olympic Committee\u2019s highest honor. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley \u201941, ran track at UCLA and recalls watching the 1932 Olympic races from outside the Los Angeles Coliseum. The city\u2019s first African American mayor, Bradley had the vision and leadership to bring the games to Los Angeles. The Tom Bradley Terminal at LAX opened in conjunction with the Olympic Games and UCLA\u2019s Tom Bradley International Hall is also named after the beloved mayor. Los Angeles will host the Olympics again in 2028 , becoming only the third city in the world to host the games three times. UCLA will take part in the historic occasion, welcoming athletes, fans and volunteers to campus and introducing them to the True Bruin spirit. The summer of 1984 was a watershed moment, propelling the university onto the world stage. Los Angeles hosted the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, becoming the only city in the United States to host the summer games twice. UCLA legend and Olympic decathlete Rafer Johnson \u201959 carried the torch into the LA Coliseum to light the Olympic flame.\n\nALUMNI STAY INVOLVED The Eighties were a decade of growth for the Alumni Association, increasing and integrating its programming to recognize the critical importance of a strong alumni network. UCLA External Affairs (then called Public Affairs) incorporated Alumni Relations, along with Development, Public Communications, Finance and Administration, and Government and Community Relations was later added in 1990.\n\nAlumni have supported students who demonstrate academic excellence, powerful leadership and a desire to effect positive change through Alumni also made their commitment to student relations a priority, spearheading the return of traditions such as the Homecoming Parade and Spring Sing. The Student Alumni Association (SAA) was established in 1984 to strengthen the student-alumni bond. SAA is a 100-member volunteer group that enhances the student experience through social, career and school-unifying events.Alumni have supported students who demonstrate academic excellence, powerful leadership and a desire to effect positive change through scholarship support since 1936, with Distinguished Scholar Awards added in 1980, and Community College Transfer Scholarships in 1981. Volunteers play a vital role in the program, participating in the selection process and giving back to the University in a tangible way.\n\nThe UCLA Latino Alumni Association (ULAA) was founded in 1989 as a way for Latino alumni to stay connected, get involved and support future generations of Bruins. With a mission to \u201cenrich the lives of Latino alumni and involve them in the exciting future of UCLA,\u201d this dedicated group provides opportunities to stay involved. ULAA\u2019s scholarship program has awarded more than 800 students with over $1.5 million in support since 1991. ULAA was named Network of the Year in 2019. The UCLA Lambda (LGBTQ) Alumni Association was established by Doug Walters and Corinne Lightweaver in 1989. It is one of the oldest and most well-established LGBTQ alumni organizations in the country. UCLA Lambda sustains a network of LGBTQ+ alumni and friends to support one another, UCLA students, and the greater LGBTQ+ community through social and professional networking, student support and community outreach.\n\nThe recession of the 1980s led to cuts in state and federal funding for public education. California voters passed Proposition 13 in 1978, cutting property taxes, and leading to fewer funds for public services. Chancellor Young implemented cost-saving measures, and UCLA launched a drive in 1982 to raise private funds for academic programs. Jim Collins \u201950, executive committee member for the UCLA Centennial Campaign , chaired the campaign and students made more than 30,000 phone calls to potential donors. In 2016, Jim and Carol Collins were awarded the UCLA Medal , the university\u2019s highest honor, for their more than six decades of philanthropy and leadership. By 1988, the campaign exceeded its $300 million goal by $73 million. Among the gifts was $15 million from John \u201940 and Marion Anderson for the Graduate School of Management, which at the time was the largest gift to the University of California.\n\nPERFORMING ARTS ON CAMPUS\n\nUCLA has been committed to music and the arts since its early days on the Vermont campus. By 1960, the College of Fine Arts was home to classes in art, dance, music and theater arts. The programs began separating into distinct departments in the 1980s, with art history and musicology moving to the College of Letters and Science, while design and ethnomusicology remained in Fine Arts. By the late 1980s, the UC Regents formally approved the establishment of the School of the Arts and the School of Theater, Film and Television under founding dean Gilbert Cates. Cates envisioned a professional conservatory environment, expanding the curriculum and strengthening industry connections.\n\nStudents faced an expanding technological landscape in the 1980s. Many film students used both video and film, using new technology to take risks and experiment. These students went on to make an impact on the creative landscape, bringing the skills they learned at UCLA to the mainstream.\n\nStudents Jonathan Dayton \u201980 and Valerie Faris \u201980 met at UCLA, where she was studying dance and he directing, and built a company, Bob Industries, making music videos. The pair co-directed the Oscar-winning \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d about a family road-trip which earned over $100 million at the box office. Critically acclaimed actor, writer and director Tim Robbins \u201982 co-founded the Actors\u2019 Gang, the respected Los Angeles theatre ensemble, while still a student. The theater group supports diverse artists as they present unconventional and uncompromising plays.\n\nTFT Theater alumnus John Rando , M.F.A. \u201988, winner of the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical for \"Urinetown\", directed his first musical while still a student at UCLA. He describes UCLA as \u201can intensive opportunity to direct,\u201d saying, \u201cI directed essentially one production per quarter for two years. It was also really fascinating that they had this amazing pool of talent among the undergraduate students. In fact, when I was going to school, one of the undergraduates was Jack Black, and he was just one among many.\u201d UCLA students John Ramirez and Stuart Timmons \u201981 founded a gay film festival on campus in 1979. Known as the \"Gay and Lesbian Media Festival and Conference,\" the name was changed to Outfest in 1994. A group of graduate students in the UCLA Motion Picture/ Television Studies Program created the UCLA Gay & Lesbian Media Coalition in 1981. The Coalition members organized a conference, hosted by the UCLA Department of Theater Arts, to address the status of gay and lesbian representation in film and television studies. A new Bruin tradition began when UCLA students organized the first Pow Wow in 1985. Nearly every spring since, UCLA\u2019s American Indian Student Association hosts a two-day festival to celebrate American Indian Culture. The campus welcomes Native Americans from Southern California and beyond to express themselves in traditional and contemporary dance, songs and social activities. POLITICS AND ACTIVISM While there were fewer large protests on campus in the Eighties, students took on more responsibility in student government. Student activism focused on the South African government's apartheid politics, Central American policy and affirmative action. The voice of Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright \u201981, discovered her talent for voices at an early age. She moved to Los Angeles to work with her mentor Daws Butler, voice of Yogi Bear among many others, and enrolled in UCLA\u2019s theater program. The multi-talented actor and philanthropist landed the part of Bart on \"The Simpsons\" in 1987, in what would become television\u2019s longest-running show.\n\nIn 1985, 2,000 protesters boycotted classes and gathered on campus for a rally to demand that the University of California divest funds from companies that did business with South Africa. About two dozen students moved into Murphy Hall. When removed by police, the students, along with 30 faculty members, set up tents in the Schoenberg Quad, calling it Mandela City.\n\nIn 1988, Pauley Pavilion was transformed to host the second and final debate of the presidential campaign. President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis took center stage for a nationally televised event, viewed by more than 67 million. UCLA had only six days to prepare, after the event planned at the Shrine Auditorium was cancelled following allegations of interference by the campaigns. Pauley became a television studio, with miles of cable, 412 telephones and approximately 40 UCLA student-ushers. Following the debate, Bush went on to win the election, while Dukakis became a visiting professor at UCLA\u2019s School of Public Affairs.\n\nMichelle King \u201984, the 2017 Edward A. Dickson Alumnus of the Year, was superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District schools, the second-largest district in the nation. A leader in education, King led reforms to increase graduation rates, particularly among traditionally under-represented populations, and championed Restorative Justice programs.\n\nUCLA law professor Eugene Volokh \u201983, J.D. \u201992, graduated from UCLA with a degree in math-computer science at age 15 after starting his own software company. The professor of First Amendment law clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and his law review articles have been cited by opinions in eight Supreme Court cases. Volokh specializes in free speech, religious freedom, gun control and gun rights, cyberspace law, and copyright law.\n\nWendy Greuel \u201983 became the second woman elected to citywide office in Los Angeles history. A housing and homelessness policy expert, she served as the field operations officer for Southern California for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) during the Clinton administration. After graduation, she began her career in public service working for Mayor Tom Bradley as the mayor\u2019s liaison to the City Council, city departments and the community.\n\nADVANCES IN MEDICINE Throughout the decade, UCLA physicians and researchers remained on the forefront of medical advances. In 1981, the UCLA Medical Center made history when assistant professor Michael Gottlieb wrote the first articles identifying AIDS as a new disease. In 1984, as the world watched, Rock Hudson entered the UCLA medical center to be treated for the disease. UCLA went on to establish the UCLA AIDS Institute in 1988, supporting the understanding, prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS.\n\nMajor breakthroughs in chemotherapy treatments came from the discovery by faculty member Owen Witte of protein activity in leukemia in 1983. These advances led to the development of the targeted chemotherapy treatment, Gleevec. Witte went on to become the founding director of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center bringing research discoveries from laboratory to patient.\n\nUCLA doctors became the first in the western United States to remove kidney stones without surgery. The procedure, lithotripsy, sits patients in water baths as shock waves break up the stones.\n\nThe Heart Transplant Program was founded in 1984, now one of the largest such programs in the world, with more than 2,000 transplants. Dr. Hillel Laks founded the program, the lung and heart-lung program in 1986 and the alternate heart program in 1992, pairing patients not normally considered for transplant with hearts that would otherwise not be used.\n\nMartine Rothblatt \u201977, M.B.A. \u201981, J.D. \u201981, co-founded satellite radio and launched Sirius. An entrepreneur who believes in the power of technology to propel possibility, she founded United Therapeutics and delved into the field of biology to develop a lifesaving drug for her daughter\u2019s rare lung disease. Rothblatt, a champion of gender freedom who came out as transgender in the early 1990s, is currently researching the potential to 3-D print and transplant human organs.\n\nSCIENCE AT THE FOREFRONT Professor of biological chemistry Professor of biological chemistry Michael Grunstein proved details about histones, a key element in gene regulation in 1988. The study of histones founded on Grunstein and his team's research is helping to understand the biology of disease. Colleague Dr. Kelsey Martin, dean of the Geffen School of Medicine, says, \u201cHis pioneering work fundamentally changed our understanding of one of the most basic aspects of biology...and opened the door for new therapeutic approaches to disease.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, professor and computer scientist Leonard Kleinrock, who contributed to the foundation of computer networking, chaired a group that produced the report \u201cToward a National Research Network.\u201d These findings led to the development of a national networking infrastructure when they were presented to Congress and used by Senator Al Gore as the foundation for the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991. Professor Donald Cram received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1987 for his work on host\u2013guest chemistry, a field he helped to create. M. Frederick Hawthorne, UCLA chemistry professor says, \u201cDon's brilliant creativity, integrity and enthusiasm for life and science have forever changed teaching in organic chemistry, and altered the shape and substance of the chemical research frontier.\u201d\n\nHALL OF FAMERS AND A NEW HOME\n\nFor the 1982 football season, the Bruins football team faced the loss of their home stadium. UCLA, and local rival USC, had called the Los Angeles Coliseum home since the 1920s, sharing it with NFL\u2019s Los Angeles Rams from 1946 to 1979. Following negotiations with the Oakland Raiders and their impending move to Los Angeles, Chancellor Charles E. Young, M.A. \u201957, Ph.D. \u201960, began negotiations with Pasadena to relocate UCLA\u2019s home games to the Rose Bowl.\n\nThat season, the Rose Bowl became the UCLA Bruins official home stadium in a ceremony attended by more than 1,000 fans. Head Coach Terry Donahue \u201967, M.A. \u201977, introduced the team, who went on to a great season, winning the Rose Bowl with a 24-14 victory over Michigan on New Year\u2019s Day. The team would win three Rose Bowl games over the next four years: 1983 vs. Michigan; 1984 vs. Illinois; 1986 vs. Iowa.\n\nAll-American Troy Aikman \u201908 led UCLA to a 20-4 record during his career, and was the first UCLA player to win the Davey O\u2019Brien Award as the nation\u2019s top quarterback. In the NFL Aikman won three Super Bowls and was elected to the Hall of Fame. A successful sportscaster, Aikman returned to UCLA in 2008 to complete his degree in sociology.\n\nOther UCLA sports thrived during the 1980s. Longtime head coach of the UCLA Women\u2019s Gymnastics team Valorie Kondos Field \u201987 is known for her passion for excellence and ability to connect with people. The UCLA Hall of Fame coach was a friend of legendary Bruin coach John Wooden. Named Pac-12 Coach of the Century and known by her student-athletes as \u201cMiss Val,\u201d she retired in 2019 with six NCAA team championships. Reggie Miller helped the Bruins win their only National Invitation Tournament Championship (NIT) in 1985. Known as one of basketball\u2019s best three-point shooters, in his final year at UCLA the three-point field goal was instituted in college basketball. Miller\u2019s jersey was retired by the Bruins in 2013, and hangs in the rafters of Pauley Pavilion.\n\nUCLA Hall of Famer and All-American basketball star Anita Ortega \u201982 joined the women\u2019s basketball team as a walk-on and helped lead them to their first National Championship in 1978 on a team with Ann Meyers \u201979, Denise Curry \u201982 and coach Billie Moore. First in her family to go to college, Ortega went on to become the first black, female Area Commanding Officer in LAPD history, attaining the rank of area captain. She delivered the 2017 UCLA College commencement address stating, \u201cI hope to impress upon all of you that living a fulfilling life is multifaceted. Yet through hard work and persistence, regardless of your aspirations and background, Bruins can make great things happen.\u201d She was the recipient of the 2015 UCLA Award for Public Service.\n\nMIGHTY BRUINS In 1984, to commemorate their 50th anniversary, the Alumni Association unveiled two gifts to campus. The iconic bronze statue known as In 1984, to commemorate their 50th anniversary, the Alumni Association unveiled two gifts to campus. The iconic bronze statue known as The Bruin was given a permanent home on Bruin Plaza and has become a campus gathering spot, photo location and landmark. The ferocious looking grizzly, unlike friendly Joe Bruin, was designed to be \u201cformidable,\u201d according to Alumni Association founding member Alexander Hamilton \u201924. At 10 feet long, six feet tall and weighing more than two tons, it is believed to be the largest bear statue in the United States. Created by artist Billy Fitzgerald, the giant figure symbolizes the strength and progress of UCLA.\n\nThe second gift was the UCLA fight song Mighty Bruins, written to replace one shared with UC Berkeley. Judy Postley \u201945, chair of the Association\u2019s 50th anniversary committee said, \u201cAfter 20 years of playing a fight song borrowed from UC Berkeley, it\u2019s time for UCLA to add a song of its own.\u201d The Alumni Association sponsored a lyrics contest and Academy Award winner Bill Conti, who wanted the fight song to \u201cstand the test of time,\u201d wrote the music and combined lyrics submitted by Barbara Lamb \u201966 and Don Holley \u201984. The UCLA fight song debuted before a crowd of nearly 1,000, with Conti conducting the UCLA Marching Band. The song was first performed game-side at the Oct. 6, 1984, game against Stanford and is played at all UCLA sporting events, ending with a rousing 8-Clap.\n\nIn the next decade, UCLA would be rocked by the Northridge quake, the L.A. Riots, the retirement of Chancellor Young and protests over the expansion of the Chicano Studies Center, and Propositions 187 and 209. And in one shining moment, UCLA celebrated another NCAA Basketball National Championship, continuing a proud legacy of Bruin excellence."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jun-05-la-sp-0606-wooden-titles-20100606-story.html", "page_content": "1963-64 (30-0)\n\nChampionship game: UCLA 98, Duke 83, at Kansas City, Mo.\n\nThe team: Steve Brucker, Fred Slaughter, Doug McIntosh, Vaughn Hoffman, Keith Erickson, Kim Stewart, Kenny Washington, Gail Goodrich, Jack Hirsch, Rich Levin, Walt Hazzard, Kent Graham, Mike Huggins, Chuck Darrow.\n\nThe season: At the beginning of the season, this team wasn\u2019t even ranked in the national top 50.

This field exam is designed for students to demonstrate competence and expertise in the emerging methodologies that fall under the umbrella term \u201ccomputational sociology.\u201d To accommodate the breadth of approaches, students have the option of pursuing two default recommended tracks, with substitutions at the discretion of the reading committee: social network analysis or data science.\n\nRequired courses: at least two courses from a three-course methods sequence: 208A-208B-208C.\n\nConversation Analysis. Conversation analysis is a field of inquiry addressed to talk and other forms of conduct in interaction studied through the detailed examination of naturally occurring instances or specimens of its occurrences. Talk-in-interaction is taken to be that primordial site of sociality in which much of what composes the life of a society and its institutions is realized. Although conversation has been the most intensively and extensively examined domain of talk-in-interaction, the field comprehends a broad range of settings and specialized genres of talk or speech-exchange systems, including talk in work settings.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 244A, 244B, 244C, and C258\n\nEconomic Sociology. This field provides an overview of the major debates in economic sociology, at both the macro and micro level. Topics include precapitalist economies and the development of capitalism; modernization, dependency, development and the world system; globalization; the economic institutions of advanced economies; labor, work, and entrepreneurship; and class, stratification, and inequality.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 260.\n\nEthnographic Methodology. Sociology in the U.S. was largely created through a series of ethnographic studies. Over the last twenty-five years, ethnographic research has been the focus of some of the most probing self-examination in social science as a whole, featuring debates over reflexivity, human subjects\u2019 consent in narrow and broad senses of the issue, the importance of context for understanding individual acts and items of culture, social constructionism and relativism, and bias (gender, cultural, and so forth) in research procedures and the conceptualization of data.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 217A, 217B and one substantive graduate course that uses ethnographic studies.\n\nEthnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is a field of sociology which studies the common sense resources, procedures and practices through which the members of a culture produce and recognize mutually intelligible objects, events and courses of action. Studies in the field are directed to the investigation of social processes underlying the construction of social phenomena ranging from factual knowledge, social organization, and attributes such as race and gender, through the acquisition of skills and management of memory.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 597 co-mentored by at least two of the field exam faculty members.\n\nInternational Migration. This field is concerned with the causes and consequences of international migration, that is, the movement of peoples from one territorially defined, self-consciously delimited nation-state to another. The actors include not just the migrants but also their descendants, as well as the states that seek to control (encourage, impede, constrain) their flows, and the domestic entities of various kinds that react to the immigrants\u2019 arrival in ways both positive and negative. The issues in play involve both migration and its aftermath. In particular, the field seeks to understand both those forms of social inequality that impinge immigrants and their descendants and the new identities and collectivities that the latter effect as settlement progresses. Thus, the field takes up a set of issues specifically associated with migration, denoted by the (contested) terms of integration or assimilation, while also engaging in a broader set of questions involved in the study of race, ethnicity, and nationalism.\n\nThe study of international migration is, perhaps, unique in its interdisciplinarity and methodologically pluralist nature: stretching from the demography and economics of migration, through political science, sociological and geographical approaches, to the ethnography and oral history of migrants. Migration is also a crucial research site for exploring the possibility of doing sociology beyond the bounded nation-state-society focus of most sociological research. And, while opening the door to a crucial dimension of globalization, the comparative study of immigration and immigrants opens up fresh perspectives on conceptions of nationhood, citizenship, and the state. While the examination and the related courses principally focus on two migration systems, the North American and the European, extension to other systems, such as the Persian Gulf or the East Asian, adds much to our understanding of the phenomenon. Students who previously have taken examinations in the related race and ethnicity or comparative ethnicity and nationalism fields must submit questions previously answered at the time when they declare the intent to take this examination; overlapping questions are not allowed.\n\nRequirements: Students who have previously taken examinations in the related race and ethnicity or comparative ethnicity and nationalism fields must submit questions previously answered at the time when they declare the intent to take this examination; overlapping questions are not allowed.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 236A, 236B and at least two quarters of Sociology 295.\n\nPolitical Sociology. This field examination is organized around a reading list in which the first section, foundations of political sociology, is required. Students are expected to read in five of the following sections: theories of the state; the development of modern states with special focus on democratization; welfare states and neo-liberalism; citizenship, nation-building and nationalism; collective action; revolution; political categorizations \u2013 class, race, ethnicity, and gender; and globalization and the nation-state.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 233.\n\nRace/Ethnicity. The race/ethnicity field examination focuses on the nature and persistence of ethnic and racial categories and groupings in contemporary societies, and on how these structures relate to social stratification systems and political and economic dynamics. The field includes a variety of perspectives and concerns including race relations, racism, ethnic, stratification, immigration, ethnic economies and ethnic politics. While race and ethnicity in the U.S. today are the central substantive concerns, the field is explicitly comparative historical, viewing contemporary ethnic and racial structures in the context of the spread of European colonialism and imperialism. Students who have previously taken examinations in the related comparative ethnicity and nationalism or international migration fields must submit questions previously answered at the time when they declare intent to take this examination; overlapping questions are not allowed.\n\nRequirements: Students who have previously taken examinations in the related comparative ethnicity and nationalism or international migration fields must submit questions previously answered at the time when they declare the intent to take this examination; overlapping questions are not allowed.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 235A, 235B.\n\nSocial Demography. Social demography examines key issues and debates related to the biological, economic, social, and environmental causes and consequences of trends and patterns in demographic behaviors such as fertility, marriage, divorce, migration, social stratification, health and mortality. Particular attention will be paid to the rapidly growing literature on racial and socioeconomic differentials in demographic behavior, aging, the causes and consequences of population growth, and family and household structure and composition.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology M213A-M213B or M213A-M213C, 226A-226B.\n\nSocial Stratification and Social Mobility. The major issues in stratification are the determinants of who gets greater and lesser amounts of scarce resources, in particular, the extent of which those resources are passed on from generation to generation within families, and the extent to which those answers depend on the organization of families, schools, labor markets, and other institutions.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 239A-239B.\n\nSociology of Culture. The domain of this field examination is social activity by which people negotiate meaning, express and interpret symbols, and construct the aesthetic dimension of societies. It addresses both the cultural dimension that permeates all social life and the specialized institutions that specifically engage in symbolic expression. The scope of study spans the broadly macrosociological comparison of entire societies to the more microsociological probing of small groups and individual minds. While insisting that all inquiry is theoretically informed, the emphasis is on empirically based analysis using a variety of methods. The field also emphasizes the continuity of culture to other sociological themes such as race, class, gender, institutions, interaction, language, power and change.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 245.\n\nSociology of Education. This field provides an overview of the major debates in the sociology of education, at the micro, macro, and meso levels. The field pays special attention to theoretical approaches and stratification, but students can also focus on a variety of other elements of the sociology of education, including higher education, secondary schools, primary schools, culture, race, gender and sexuality, immigration, measurement, organizations, neighborhoods, and the state.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology 239A, 240.\n\nSociology of the Family. Sociologists conceptualize the family as a social institution \u2013 meaning it involves a set of social roles (such as parent, partner, or child), with some shared understanding of expectations regarding how we should behave in these roles and what kinds of obligations are associated with them. As with any social institution, the family is malleable over time, across contexts, and can be difficult to define at its margins. Students who take this field examination are expected to be familiar with the wide variety of substantive topics and methodological approaches reflected in the work of family sociologists.\n\nRequired courses: At least two courses from: Sociology M238, 241, M252, M253.\n\nSociology of Gender and Sexuality. This field examination is concerned with gender inequality and gender differences and the social processes producing and reproducing them. It includes both macrosociological and microsociological perspectives on these processes. It also encompasses the growing scholarship on the intersection between race, class, and gender.\n\nRequired courses: Any two courses from: Sociology M238, 241, M252, M255.\n\nSociology of Medicine and Science. This topic-based field examination draws from the traditional fields of medical sociology and sociology of health and illness and the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies as it relates to knowledge production in health and other scientific fields.\n\nRequired courses: One course from Sociology 227, 250, or 283 and one Sociology 596 course focusing on an agreed upon topic related to the examination.\n\nUrban and Suburban Sociology. This field comprises the major topics in urban and suburban sociology. It addresses two main issues: (1) historical and comparative perspectives of urbanization, and (2) urbanization and suburbanization in the U.S.\n\nRequired courses: Sociology C297.\n\nN.B.: A student who fails a field examination may retake that examination only once."}, {"url": "https://soc.ucla.edu/undergraduate-study/", "page_content": "Sociology is the study of the organization, dynamics and consequences of social life. The scope of the discipline is as broad and diverse as social life itself. Sociologists study social interaction and relationships, organizations and institutions, communities and whole societies. The methods of sociological investigation are also varied: sociologists immerse themselves in the daily life of groups, interview group participants, examine recorded interaction, interpret historical documents, analyze census data, and conduct large surveys. The methods and concepts of sociology yield powerful insights into the social processes shaping lives, problems and possibilities in contemporary society. The capacity to identify and understand these processes \u2014 a capacity which C.W. Mills called the \u201csociological imagination\u201d \u2014 is valuable preparation for personal and professional participation in a changing and complex world.\n\nIn addition to contributing to a liberal arts education, the sociology major prepares individuals for a broad range of career options and graduate and professional studies. Employment opportunities available to the graduate with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in sociology include work in community service organizations and health agencies, government service, human resources, and many other fields. The major also provides a foundation for students planning careers in law, social welfare, urban planning, business, education and public health as well as for graduate work in sociology, social psychology, and related fields.\n\nThe Sociology faculty is widely regarded as among the best in the world and includes internationally renowned scholars addressing an amazingly broad range of topics from the dynamics of social interaction to the impact of globalization. The department boasts outstanding teachers. In the past two years alone, professors Vilma Ortiz and Megan Sweeney have received Distinguished Teaching Awards from the UCLA Academic Senate.
