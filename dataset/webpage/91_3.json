One particular line from the agent served as a flashing light. The Premier League\u2019s contract deadline of 23 June was fast approaching and Joorabchian believed there was plenty of work to do. \u201cThere are several issues within the whole structure that will be resolved,\u201d he said, before returning to the theme of his high-profile client.\n\nJoorabchian\u2019s working relationship with the Arsenal hierarchy is no secret, and he was perfectly entitled to provide a commentary. But for some who have harboured reservations about his influence it was, as one puts it, the final straw. However it was intended, the statement felt overly familiar with the club\u2019s internal concerns. The events that followed have shed light on the identity crisis evolving within Arsenal, which has caused dismay among former and existing staff.\n\nThe worry is that Arsenal, once famously resourceful, have entrusted too much responsibility for recruitment to a narrow list of associates that includes Joorabchian, a super-agent with a storied past in helping broker big deals and a long-time friend of the technical director, Edu.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing to stop them working together, and there are many ways to address squad-building requirements. But eyebrows were raised on Tuesday when the 33-year-old David Luiz, one of the club\u2019s highest earners at a time when Covid-19 and a poor season have forced some difficult financial decisions, was enlisted for a further year.\n\nPerhaps more jarring was the fact C\u00e9dric Soares, the 28-year-old who had been prevented by injury from making his debut since joining on loan from Southampton, was tied down on a long-term deal that effectively makes him the deputy right-back.\n\nBoth players are represented by Joorabchian and his company, Sports Invest UK.\n\nArsenal centre-back David Luiz. Photograph: Reuters\n\nTransfers of that nature would, while entirely legitimate, have been anathema under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. He generally shied away from deals with bigger-name agents and had little time for heavy investments in older players. But Joorabchian\u2019s hand has been evident in a clutch of moves involving Arsenal in the past year, the first being a move that was completed on 8 August, a month after Edu, a former player, returned to Arsenal. The Football Association\u2019s list of intermediary transactions, released this week, shows Sports Invest UK represented Arsenal in Alex Iwobi\u2019s \u00a335m move to Everton.\n\nIwobi\u2019s and Everton\u2019s side of the deal was, according to the list, overseen separately by the agency that represents the player. It is not unusual for different parties to work on the different ends of a transfer, even more so when involving moves from abroad, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Some experienced industry figures simply point out that given Arsenal and Everton are familiar rivals and worked together 18 months previously when Theo Walcott made the same move it appears a convoluted way to have done business.\n\nDavid Luiz arrived from Chelsea on the same day and Soares followed in January. Willian, another Joorabchian client, has been linked with a summer arrival although the Observer understands that while there is strong interest on Arsenal\u2019s part no final decision has been made on his future.\n\nThe fear in certain quarters is that Arsenal\u2019s executive team are wed to a select set of voices and marginalising those with an alternative view, particularly when it comes to transfers and planning. Nobody doubted the club\u2019s approach needed modernising in the post-Wenger era and that is why there was surprise when Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment, moved on in February 2019.\n\nSince then, the suggestion is that Arsenal have surrendered a coherent approach to player-spotting and handed too much power to the contacts books of Edu and the head of football, Ra\u00fal Sanllehi. Some members of staff are believed to feel frozen out and there is particular angst that Arsenal, who also conducted a revamp of their academy staff in November, may be losing ground in any chase for the best young players. One former employee claims the club\u2019s approach no longer fitted their values and the high-performance culture fostered under Wenger has been allowed to ebb away.\n\nThere is a view that Arsenal\u2019s hierarchy are awkward customers. It has not gone unnoticed among certain club personnel over the past two seasons that certain agents and contacts do not return calls as frequently. One player representative says he sighs inwardly when an Arsenal number shows up on his phone; another is strongly critical of their communication skills.\n\nIt goes without saying that everyone in the picture has their own agenda and that every agent has clients\u2019 interests to look after. That is all part of the game but it becomes more problematic when, as some suggest has occurred, potential deals begin to falter.\n\nFor all the structural issues the biggest problem is, another source says, a \u201clack of relevant brains\u201d. Arsenal are well known, as per the words of their director Josh Kroenke, to be operating a \u201cChampions League wage bill on a Europa League budget\u201d, and given their league position that will not change unless Mikel Arteta is given the squad clearout he desires this summer. That means they ideally require value \u2013 and preferably resale value \u2013 in the market, operating more like Borussia Dortmund or RB Salzburg than Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cFinally Arsenal have people who really understand football and are footballing people in the back-room staff,\u201d Joorabchian said in a separate TalkSport interview last July, referencing Sanllehi and Edu. \u201cBut the question is whether or not the finances will be made available.\u201d\n\nIf not, then what? The bigger issue appears to be whether Sanllehi, who helped bring Neymar to Barcelona, and the former Brazil general manager Edu have the expertise to run Arsenal in a lean, streamlined fashion according to those parameters. Another figure familiar with their way of working does not believe so, suggesting Arsenal risk being a \u201cmid-table team within three to four years\u201d if nothing changes.\n\nThere remains enough promise to remove such doomsday scenarios. The acquisitions of Gabriel Martinelli and William Saliba a year ago showed that elements are still in place for Arsenal to find players with a genuine chance of becoming high-class performers. Match-winning contributions by Eddie Nketiah and Joe Willock at Southampton on Thursday were reminders the academy, can still turn up wonders. To realise all that potential, though, the sense is that Arsenal need to remember exactly how those things became true."}, {"url": "https://thetilehurstend.sbnation.com/2022/2/8/22905320/reading-fans-fc-need-deserve-proper-answers-kia-joorabchian-royals", "page_content": "Trying to pinpoint Kia Joorabchian\u2019s exact level of influence at Reading leaves you with a lot of conjecture and little detail.\n\nWe know for sure though that he is at least a \u2018personal acquaintance\u2019 of Dai Yongge. That was accepted by CEO Dayong Pang in an October 2021 meeting with STAR, when finance director Bryan Stabler added that no money had been paid to Joorabchian as an agent. And last month Veljko Paunovic told the media:\n\n\u201d[Joorabchian is] friends with the owner. He\u2019s known as an advisor not only with our owner. He\u2019s been involved in football for a long time so that\u2019s all I can say. I do have conversations with him. \u201cI\u2019m open to everyone and picking up the phone to everyone. He\u2019s an advisor to the owner so the owner has to answer that [if he is a positive influence]. He definitely wants the best for the people he advises. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Joorabchian\u2019s position (via The Guardian) is as follows:\n\n\u201cJoorabchian said it was false to suggest he has influence at the club.\u201d\n\nHowever, fans have been concerned for a long time now about Joorabchian\u2019s possible involvement at Reading, which has been reported - but never officially confirmed - as being substantial. There\u2019s a real lack of clarity which hasn\u2019t been helped by the club\u2019s failure to publicly engage with the topic - you\u2019ll find no mention of Kia Joorabchian on official channels such as Reading FC\u2019s website or Twitter account.\n\nSTAR tried to get clarity in their most recent structured dialogue meeting (SDM) with the club, which was held on Friday January 21. The discussion on this topic went as follows:\n\nSTAR: Well, one name comes out regularly in press coverage and with our fans and that\u2019s Kia Joorabchian. What is the extent of his influence here? Two major articles in the Athletic and the Guardian have suggested his involvement. Reading FC: His company is Sports Invest and that company was involved with Lucas Joao coming here. He was also partly involved in the Matt Miazga deal when he came on loan from Chelsea as he was with Sports Invest US. STAR: So, why then, does he get mentioned so much? Do you have any idea why this is? Reading FC: Well, he is a friend of the owner, as we\u2019ve said before many times. He has attended games with the owner. Some of us have met him briefly, when he has been at the same event as the owner \u2013 usually along with a number of other agents too. But that\u2019s it. STAR: So, from your view, Kia has only been involved in Lucas Joao then and not involved in any other transfers? Reading FC: Yes, off the top of our head. And the Miazga loan as mentioned. But this is all available online so you can research it if you want.\n\nTo summarise, the club\u2019s official line is that Joorabchian is a friend of Dai Yongge, has attended games and has been involved or partly involved with just two players joining the club - \u201cbut that\u2019s it\u201d. For context, this answer was given at a time of mounting frustration in the fanbase - hence the SDM being brought forward to January 21 - so it can\u2019t be said that this question was sprung on the club or they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to fully consider their response.\n\nSo is Reading\u2019s answer sufficient?\n\nFor a start it doesn\u2019t quite match up with what would be said by Pauno a week or so later in those comments to the media mentioned above. He twice referred to Joorabchian as an \u201cadvisor\u201d to Dai Yongge - not merely a \u201cfriend\u201d. Furthermore, the articles mentioned by STAR (in The Athletic and The Guardian) make claims that go far beyond Joorabchian\u2019s personal relationship with the owner, attendance of games and the arrival of two players.\n\nThe Guardian said:\n\n\u201cAll of the club\u2019s recruitment seems to go through one person\u201d - according to an unnamed agent\n\nAnother agent\u2019s client was approached to be manager, \u201conly for Reading to lose interest when it became clear that Joorabchian would be sidelined\u201d\n\nWhile The Athletic added:\n\nJoorabchian is a \u201ccentral cog in the Reading machine\u201d - as per multiple sources\n\n\u201cKia is really, really close with the owner at Reading. He\u2019s the adviser, let\u2019s say, of the owner. It\u2019s Kia calling the shots all the time, and it won\u2019t change\u201d - according to a former employee\n\n9/10 deals have gone through Joorabchian - an estimate from an unnamed source\n\nReading is a \u201cclosed shop to a certain extent\u201d because of Joorabchian\u2019s involvement - according to an unnamed agent\n\nThe Athletic also cite the presence of Seb Ewen, who they say is now \u201cinstrumental in negotiating deals\u201d at Reading. The below screenshot of Ewen\u2019s LinkedIn account shows he was an employee of Joorabchian\u2019s agency Sports Invest UK until November 2018 before joining the Royals the following month. Reading\u2019s \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 information page lists Ewen as \u2018Scouting & Recruitment Coordinator\u2019.\n\nFor clarity, The Athletic does not outright say Ewen still has a link with Joorabchian, whether direct or indirect.\n\nA significant number of serious claims about Joorabchian\u2019s possible involvement at Reading were made in those two articles. The impression given by that reporting is that Joorabchian is not merely a minor figure behind the scenes, he\u2019s a \u201ccentral cog\u201d with significant influence over how Reading Football Club operates.\n\nThose are just two recent articles though. Reporting on Joorabchian\u2019s possible involvement at Reading goes back years and raises numerous specific points, including the following:\n\nFootball.London, December 2018\n\nJoorabchian\u2019s involvement at Reading began during the Thai ownership\n\nHe \u201cwas behind\u201d moves for Orlando Sa, Paolo Hurtado, Lucas Piazon and Ola John\n\nGianluca Nani, briefly sporting director, left as \u201che felt his position had become untenable\u201d due to Joorabchian\u2019s influence\n\nJoorabchian pushed for Luis Castro, said to be his client, to succeed Paul Clement as manager\n\nYahoo Sports Brazil (covered on TTE here), January 2020\n\nJoorabchian was considered the right-hand man of then-CEO Nigel Howe\n\nHe was behind the attempt to appoint Alexandre Mattos as director of football\n\nJoorabchian was also involved in the appointment of Jose Gomes as manager\n\nSo to summarise what was claimed in those last two pieces, Joorabchian has reportedly not only been involved in some way in numerous signings, but he\u2019s also had some kind of influence (direct or indirect) at managerial and director-of-football level. Those reports don\u2019t however give precise details on the nature of Joorabchian\u2019s involvement - unlike, for example, a Goal article which claimed Joorabchian was in line to receive \u20ac300,000 in commission for Rafael\u2019s recent transfer to Cruzeiro.\n\nIt\u2019s worth stressing at this point that some of the above may be true, some of it may not and other parts could be an unfair depiction of events. I\u2019m not in a position to independently verify anything from other publications - only to summarise and highlight noteworthy reporting.\n\nThe point of doing so isn\u2019t to just attack Joorabchian. External business people (whether best described as an agent, advisor or otherwise) having influence at a football club certainly wouldn\u2019t be unique to Reading and it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. For example, Joao is one of Reading\u2019s best strikers in recent years while Miazga added quality to the backline when it was desperately needed in 2019.\n\nThe problem that needs addressing is the lack of clarity, so my aim here is threefold:\n\nTo highlight the lack of clarity on Joorabchian\u2019s position at Reading To draw attention to the volume of reporting on his possible influence at Reading which, collectively, heavily suggests he\u2019s been majorly involved in the running of the club for years To argue that, in light of the volume of reporting, in my opinion the club\u2019s SDM answer isn\u2019t good enough because important questions are left either unaddressed or insufficiently answered\n\nThose questions being:\n\nVeljko Paunovic refers to Kia Joorabchian as an \u201cadvisor\u201d to the owner - in practice, how much influence does this give him at Reading?\n\nHow many signings has Joorabchian been involved in at Reading, whether directly or indirectly?\n\nHas Joorabchian been involved in any of Reading\u2019s managerial appointments, whether directly or indirectly?\n\nWas Joorabchian involved in the reported attempt to appoint Alexandre Mattos as director of football, whether directly or indirectly?\n\nDid Seb Ewen\u2019s previous work relationship with Kia Joorabchian have any bearing on Reading\u2019s decision to hire him?\n\nDoes Joorabchian retain any link with Ewen in Ewen\u2019s professional capacity at Reading, whether formal or informal?\n\nWhose responsibility at Reading is it to oversee and scrutinise Joorabchian\u2019s influence at the club if such influence exists?\n\nThese are all reasonable questions for supporters to want answered, given the level of concern over Joorabchian\u2019s reported involvement at Reading. That concern has become so strong as to contribute to a fan protest before the 150th anniversary game against Coventry City.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating that the club had the opportunity to address this issue convincingly in the SDM and failed to do so, but this can now be rectified with a public statement covering all points raised. Getting substantial, on-the-record answers is key to providing clarity on this topic and in the process restoring fans\u2019 trust. That, ultimately, is what we all want to happen.\n\nI appreciate that this is a sensitive area for the club and we can\u2019t necessarily expect extensive details on behind-the-scenes matters. Reading will want to keep a lot of information under wraps as part of basic in-house confidentiality; that\u2019s to be expected and entirely reasonable.\n\nHowever, between the two extremes of full opacity and full transparency on Joorabchian\u2019s possible involvement, there\u2019s plenty of room for the club to do more to openly communicate with the fans."}, {"url": "https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/01/06/kia-joorabchian-to-play-key-role-in-talks-for-38m-star-guimaraes-wanted-by-arsenal/", "page_content": "Photo by Marcio Machado/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nFootball agent Kia Joorabchian is set to play a key role in the future of Olympique Lyonnais midfielder and reported Arsenal target Bruno Guimaraes.\n\nAccording to Football London, the Iranian representative will act as an intermediary for the Brazilian international over the coming months as Premier League clubs eye a move for the 24-year-old.\n\nAs per the report, Arsenal are interested in Guimaraes and could make a move for the midfielder in the summer, with Lyon valuing their star asset at \u00a338m.

Yet there seems to be the very real prospect this morning that the Iranian-born, London-based 35-year-old businessman, a university drop-out and one-time car dealer, could soon become the owner of West Ham United, with resources to transform them into major Premiership players.\n\nHe has already had a key role in West Ham's signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. Quite where his finance will come from for any takeover is a mystery. He acknowledges he has backers with considerable means, but told The Independent yesterday: \"I absolutely, categorically deny the money is Russian.\"\n\nHe has been linked persistently to controversial Russian billionaire oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who now resides in London. The pair are \"friends\", Joorabchian said yesterday, and have known each other since 1999, more of which later. But Joorabchian maintains that Berezovsky is not, and never has been, his backer.\n\nRather, he says, he has been extremely fortunate to have built up an extensive network of influential business and social contacts during a nomadic and colourful life. He knows Pele. He knows the \"super agent\" Pini Zahavi. He got to know powerful people in the oil industry as a trader in his early 20s. He was involved in hedge funds in America when most people still thought that the profitable, high-risk sector had something to do with topiary.\n\nJoorabchian's story begins in Tehran in July 1971, when he was born the eldest child of Mohammed Joorabchian, a wealthy motor trader with a business empire across the Middle East. \"In 1979 we went on holiday to England,\" Kia Joorabchian said yesterday. \"While we were there the revolution happened back in Iran. My father lost everything, the lot. We had to start again from scratch in Britain.\"\n\nJoorabchian Snr set up a car dealership, which he subsequently sold as the family decided to try a new life in Canada. They opened a hot-dog and hamburger restaurant, which was successful, but when Kia was 12, his father moved the family back to England, and started a new car business, which became Medway Autos in Kent. Kia was sent to boarding school at Shiplake College in Henley. His O levels were \"so-so\" and he completed only the first year of his A levels before moving to a different school in Golders Green, north London. \"Not great,\" he says of results he now cannot remember, but he managed to gain a place at Queen Mary & Westfield College at the University of London, to study business and chemistry. \"But I couldn't get my head around the chemistry, and I dropped out after the second year. My dad wanted me to be a doctor, he wasn't too impressed.\"\n\nInstead he worked for his father, and then became a trader at London's International Petroleum Exchange, \"dealing Brent Crude in the pits\". He also got involved in the stock market and, after five years building contacts and experience, decided to chance his arm with his own investment company, American Capital, in the US. Though he and an associate, Reza Irani-Kermani, registered their firm in the British Virgin Islands, their sparse HQ was a room on the top floor of a midtown Manhattan office block, where the staff consisted of two secretaries.\n\nAC's first deal saw them buy 85 per cent of one of Russia's most influential newspapers, Kommersant, or rather they thought they had bought it. They even held a press conference to outline their plans.\n\nThe paper, like other planned investments in \"emerging markets\", would be restructured and then sold on for profit. \"Except we never completed the deal,\" Joorabchian said yesterday. \"The vendors agreed to sell it to someone else. We sued, and that's how I met Boris Berezovsky, because we ended up doing a deal, out of court, where he got the paper, and we got a settlement. I've known him ever since, but that was the first and last time I have done business with him. People can try to link us all the time, but I'm telling you there is no financial link.\"\n\nJoorabchian said that AC branched into hedge funds and became a \"boutique investment house\". Things went well until 9/11, when the markets \"became volatile and I wanted out\". He says he sold his company for \"between \u00a350m and \u00a360m\" and returned to England, to be closer to his sick father. Joorabchian then ran several low-key businesses, including a health spa in Camden, north London, and an investment company dealing with Iran that was not very successful.\n\nIt was after a chance meeting with Pele's agent that Pele convinced him to put his money into football, and Brazilian football in particular. Pini Zahavi, another contact, agreed. \"They said Brazilian football was the place to be.\"\n\nIn August 2004, he set up a company, Media Sports Investment, with a \"shell\" office in central London. He bought Corinthians in Brazil and, with assistance from anonymous backers, spent \u00a350m on club and players, including Tevez. The rest is recent history. Berezovsky, he said, had no investment in the club, and says reports to the contrary are \"untrue\".\n\nBerezovsky has lived in Britain since 2003, when he was granted political asylum after falling out with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Russian authorities charged Berezovsky in his absence with complicity to fraud, complicity not to return hard currency from abroad, and money laundering, charges he denies."}, {"url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-neto-kia-joorabchian-24747786", "page_content": "Arteta gives verdict on Arsenal's transfer dealings ahead of new season\n\nArteta gives verdict on Arsenal's transfer dealings ahead of new season\n\nArsenal worked with superagent Kia Joorabchian to complete the signings of Willian and David Luiz from London rivals Chelsea. He also represents Cedric, who signed from Southampton in 2020\n\nArsenal could work with Kia Joorabchian on fourth transfer as they target next signing\n\nArsenal could work with superagent Kia Joorabchian once again this summer, as they target Barcelona keeper Neto.\n\nNeto is represented by Joorabchian, who Arsenal worked with to complete the signings of David Luiz, Cedric and Willian, just a few clients under Joorabchian\u2019s massive portfolio.\n\nSports Invest UK LTD, owned by Kia Joorabchian, is one of the largest football agencies in Europe. The agency boasts clients such as Philippe Coutinho and Tottenham Hotspur full-back Sergio Reguilon.\n\nArsenal could make use of their positive relationship with Joorabchian to sign Neto, currently under contract to Barcelona until the summer of 2023.\n\nNeto was signed for a massive \u20ac26million in 2019 from fellow La Liga side Valencia but has only played for Barca in the league on nine occasions.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nAccording to The Athletic, due to Arsenal technical director Edu\u2019s previous encounters with Joorabchian, a deal could be quickly signed and sealed.\n\nAny permanent signing is expected to be significantly less than the \u00a310m fee West Bromwich Albion have quoted for Sam Johnstone.\n\nThere is also potential that Arsenal could complete the signing of Neto on a loan deal, in a similar vein to the capture of Mat Ryan on loan from Brighton and Hove Albion in January.\n\nWho should Arsenal sign before the end of the transfer window? Let us know in the comments below\n\nUnlike Aaron Ramsdale - who Sheffield United have valued at \u00a335m - Neto is not being signed as a long-term replacement for Bernd Leno but will come in and reprise a role as an understudy.\n\nInterest in Ramsdale was significant, and Mikel Arteta and his recruitment staff were encouraged by the quality of his distribution, as well as his determination to come for crosses, something they have identified as a significant weakness in Leno.\n\nHowever, the prospects of a transfer have significantly cooled, even after Arsenal had submitted a bid worth an initial \u00a320m. Reports have suggested that the proposal was supplemented with significant performance-based add-ons but did not come close to The Blades\u2019 valuation.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal remain in the hunt for a creative midfield player as discussions with Leicester City for James Maddison appear to have hit a wall.\n\nA move for Martin Odegaard was mooted, but it appears that he is in Carlo Ancelotti's plans ahead of Real Madrid's La Liga campaign.\n\nHowever, It is believed that Arsenal would be quick to pounce if they sensed discontent in the beginning weeks of the new season.\n\nIt is believed that one of their targets is Houssem Aouar, who was linked heavily with a move to the club in 2020.\n\nDue to the financial struggles in Ligue 1, the Lyon midfielder could be available for just \u20ac25m, a fraction of the \u20ac60m Arsenal were quoted for the Frenchman last summer.\n\nIt is expected that Arsenal will test the waters in the coming days, despite several significant figures at the club concerned about a perceived decline on the pitch within the last 12 months."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/kia-joorabchian", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nKia Joorabchian (Kiavash Joorabchian) was born on 14 July, 1971 in Tehran, Iran, is a Businessman.

He also has an extraordinary number of connections throughout the sport across the world, including Europe, the MLS and the Chinese Super League.\n\nJoorabchian first came to prominence back in 2004 when he founded Media Sports Investment - creating a partnership with Brazilian side Corinthians.\n\nHe stepped down as president of MSI in June 2006 just before Corinthians players Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano then signed for West Ham in August.\n\nA shock move at the time, it led to a Premier League investigation as their economic rights were part owned by a London-based fund, led by Joorabchian.\n\nWhile this third-party ownership was not illegal, West Ham were found guilty of acting improperly and withholding key documentation over the ownership of Tevez and Mascherano.\n\nThe Premier League concluded that the player's contracts meant that the third-party owners had the right to decide whether they would move to a new club, and for what fee. This was a breach of existing rules banning third parties from having influence over the transfers of players.\n\nThe club was hit with a \u00a35.5million fine, with third party ownership banned altogether in England at the start of the 2008-09 season.\n\nAway from the off-field controversy, Mascherano's spell at Upton Park was not as successful as his fellow countryman's and he eventually moved to Liverpool in 2007 after playing just five times.\n\nHe quickly flourished with the Reds under Rafa Benitez and went on to make 139 appearances for the Reds, scoring twice.\n\nThe Argentine became a favourite among fans and was part of a midfield trio with Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso.\n\nBut in the summer of 2010 Mascherano - with Joorabchian acting as his adviser - forced through a move to Barcelona.\n\nHe told then Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson that he wanted to leave the club and days later he became a Barcelona player, but history won't be repeating itself this summer."}, {"url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-joorabchian-arteta-edu-signings-24122803", "page_content": "The Gunners have worked closely with the super agent over the last few years, but how many of his clients have actually been a success since arriving at the Emirates?\n\nKia Joorabchian clearly has a good business relationship with those over at Arsenal, given a number of his clients have ended up plying their trade for the Gunners in the last few years.\n\nThe 49-year-old boasts a star-studded list of clientele that includes Champions League winners and Premier League veterans - though some members of the Emirates faithful may highlight the latter of those two as part of the problem.\n\nLong gone are the days when all recruitment decisions related to the playing staff were made by the manager, it is clear that over in the red half of North London, technical director Edu also has a large say in who comes in.\n\nGiven his close working ties with Joorabchian, it's little surprise only now, post- Wenger have these signings begin to flood in in their droves.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nSky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher launched an attack on the agent before the turn of the year, citing his clients as part of the problems that plague the Gunners.\n\n\"I really like (Mikel) Arteta,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a lot of nonsense around the club \u2013 bringing players, buying players. I think some signings were a joke. In terms of bringing Willian in, Luiz in, Cedric in.\n\n\"Is Kia Joorabchian making signings at the club? Mikel Arteta has brought in Thomas Partey and Gabriel. They look like Arsenal\u2019s two best players at this moment, certainly early stages this season.\"\n\nThe agent did not take those remarks lying down, and bit back with: \"I\u2019m very surprised because Jamie is one of the people that monopolises Sky Sports commentary. Sky Sports producers pay a lot of money to him, so I can\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t check his facts before he speaks.\n\n\"The fact is I had nothing to do with the signing of Willian. If Jamie had bothered to check with Mikel or Edu, they would have said Mikel presented three different times to convince Willian to be his number one signing at Arsenal.\"\n\nWillian is the most recent of Joorabchian's signings to join the Gunners, so as his debut season draws to a close, it seems as good a time as any to analyse how the super agent's clients have fared in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nDavid Luiz\n\nThere is an argument to be had that Luiz is the most successful of Joorabchian's Arsenal clients, with the 34-year-old proving to be a huge figure in the dressing room, one many of the Gunners array of young talent all claim to look up to.\n\nHe has proven he is the sides most comfortable defender on the ball, something Arteta's men had to learn the hard way in his absence at the tail-end of this season.\n\nImage: Arsenal FC via Getty Images) Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\nLuiz last featured for the Gunners away at Newcastle, playing a part in the first of two goals with a delightful pass into the channels, a trait Arsenal clearly missed as they struggled to mount any attack in their Europa League disaster against Villarreal the following game.\n\nHowever, for all of his technical quality, Luiz has displayed the kind of erratic on-pitch decision making that has plagued his entire career.\n\nLuiz has four red cards over the course of 213 Premier League appearances, the bulk of which came for Chelsea - yet three of his dismissals have come in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nAfter two seasons, three red cards and a number of penalties conceded - Luiz's time at Arsenal appears to be coming to an end, after it was reported that neither the club nor the player had any desire to extend his contract which expires at the end of the current campaign.\n\nWillian\n\nFew signings in the modern history of Arsenal have gone as badly for the club as the signing of former Chelsea winger Willian.\n\n1 goal in 37 appearances has made for a debut season full of criticism, so much so that recent speculation has suggested the Brazilian international could be keen on leaving the Emirates after just one season.\n\nImage: Pool via REUTERS) Pool via REUTERS)\n\nThe 32-year-old has attracted interest from a number of European clubs as well as newly-formed MLS outfit Inter Miami.\n\nThe signing of Willian has ben accused of stalling the development of a number of Arsenal's talented younger players, including Gabriel Martinelli and Reiss Nelson.\n\nCedric Soares\n\nCedric's arrival at the Emirates led to questions from the very beginning, given Arsenal were in no real desperate need for a right-back, boasting Hector Bellerin and Ainsley Maitland-Niles as well as Calum Chambers once he had recovered from injury.\n\nOriginally signed on loan, Cedric's deal was eventually offered a bumper new permanent contract despite having made ZERO appearances for the club at the time.\n\nImage: NurPhoto/PA Images) NurPhoto/PA Images)\n\nBizarrely, the bulk of Cedric's Arsenal features this season have come while playing left-back, filling in for the crocked Kieran Tierney.\n\nThe Portuguese defender enjoyed a brief decent run of form in the new role at the beginning of the year, before he eventually his flaws on the opposite flank were exposed and Arteta took the step of deploying midfielder Granit Xhaka in the left-back position instead."}]}
