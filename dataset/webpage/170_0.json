Tisch Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law. He is also an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute, the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law Emeritus and a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, and a policy advisor for The Heartland Institute. Epstein became a permanent faculty member at NYU School of Law in 2010.[1] Epstein was chosen in a poll as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times.[2] Contents [show] Biography[edit]\n\nEpstein was born in New York. He graduated summa cum laude from Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in 1964. He received a B.A. in jurisprudence from Oxford in 1966 (with first-class honours). He graduated cum laude from Yale Law School with an LL.B. in 1968. He began his teaching career at the University of Southern California Law School. Views[edit]\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work, arguing that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable however, according to Epstein, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if repealed. Consistent with the principles of Classical-Liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, DOMA, should be repealed,[3] stating: Under our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits. However, in the two cases under discussion (Gill and Massachusetts, both of which had been heard by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro), Epstein observed that: To strike down DOMA, Judge Tauro had to reject all state justifications for its definition of marriage. Congress advanced four such justifications for this statute: \"(1) encouraging responsible procreation and child-bearing, (2) defending and nurturing the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage, (3) defending traditional notions of morality, and (4) preserving scarce resources.\" The Justice Department disavowed them all. So much for tradition. Its sole defense of DOMA was that it was needed to preserve the status quo until matters were sorted out politically. Given that open invitation Judge Tauro concluded that all of the justifications offered in DOMA flunked even the lowest \"conceivable\" standard of rationality. Religious people will surely take umbrage at his one-sentence rebuttals of centuries of tradition. Epstein's criticism of these two decisions concluded: Now there is no reason for principle to yield to pragmatism. We don't need a judicial precedent that will spark a nation-wide rerun of California's Proposition 8. We need courts to back off to democratic processes, imperfect as they are. Epstein views market incentives against discrimination as sufficient to regulate the acknowledged evil, and attempting to give everyone a court hearing only encourages excessive litigation.[4] In Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (1985) Epstein argues the government should be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. Though then U.S. Senator Joseph Biden denounced the book during the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, the book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property.[5] The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights[6] and has been cited by the United States Supreme Court in four cases, including Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council from 1992.[5] Epstein's defense of tobacco companies during the 1990s was controversial. Epstein serves on the advisory board of the New York University Journal of Law and Liberty, and introduces the keynote speaker every year at the Journal of Law and Liberty sponsored Annual Friedrich A. von Hayek Lecture. Politics[edit]\n\nEpstein has said that when voting, he chooses \"anyone but the Big Two\" who are \"just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors\"; he has voted Libertarian.[7] Epstein says he is \"certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy\".[7] Epstein agreed to serve on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force in December 2010.[8][9][10] Personal life[edit]\n\nEpstein is the first cousin of comedian Paul Reiser.[11] Publications[edit]\n\n2013.

Epstein is currently the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and professor emeritus and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago.\n\nEpstein's writings have extensively influenced modern American legal thought. In 2000, a study published in The Journal of Legal Studies identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1985.\n\nLife and career\n\nRichard A. Epstein was born on April 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Bernard Epstein (1908\u20131978), was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine Epstein (n\u00e9e Reiser; 1908\u20132004), managed his father's medical office. He has two sisters. He attended elementary school at P.S. 161, a school that is now one of the Success Academy Charter Schools. Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and their family moved to Great Neck, Long Island.\n\nEpstein attended Columbia University as an undergraduate student in the early 1960s. Epstein had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a traditional single major, and obtained permission from Columbia to pursue an unusual self-selected program of study across the three areas of sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. He graduated with a B.A. degree summa cum laude in 1964. Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, studying at Oriel College and earning a first-class honours B.A. in jurisprudence in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the Yale Law School at Yale University, graduating with an LL.B. cum laude in 1968.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the University of Southern California. He taught there until 1972 when he moved to the University of Chicago, where he taught for 38 years and eventually held the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of New York University as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law, where he currently teaches. He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis. In 2013, New York University's School of Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.\n\nSince 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a prominent American public policy think tank located at Stanford University.\n\nEpstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards. In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical School, and in 1985 was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, and was editor of the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001. In 2003, Epstein received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent. In 2005 the College of William and Mary awarded him the Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize for his contributions to the field of property rights, and in 2011 was awarded a Bradley Prize by the Bradley Foundation.\n\nWritings\n\nEpstein's early scholarship focused primarily on tax law and torts. However, he became famous in the American legal community in 1985 with Harvard University Press' publication of his book Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain. In it, Epstein argued that the \"takings clause\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014which reads, \"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\", and is traditionally viewed as an enumeration of the power of eminent domain\u2014gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights, and so requires the government to be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \"takings clause\" after its publication. In 1991, during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings, Senator Joe Biden, \"in a dramatic movement,\" held the book up and \"repeatedly interrogated\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis.

Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, studying at Oriel College and earning a first-class honours B.A. in jurisprudence in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the Yale Law School at Yale University, graduating with an LL.B. cum laude in 1968.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the University of Southern California. He taught there until 1972 when he moved to the University of Chicago, where he taught for 38 years and eventually held the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of New York University as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law. He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis. In 2013, New York University's School of Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.\n\nSince 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a prominent American public policy think tank located at Stanford University.\n\nEpstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards. In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical School, and in 1985 was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, and was editor of the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001. In 2003, Epstein received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent. In 2005 the College of William & Mary awarded him the Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize for his contributions to the field of property rights, and in 2011 he was awarded a Bradley Prize by the Bradley Foundation.\n\nWritings\n\nEpstein's early scholarship focused primarily on tax law and torts. However, he became famous in the American legal community in 1985 with Harvard University Press' publication of his book Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain. In it, Epstein argued that the \"takings clause\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014which reads, \"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\", and is traditionally viewed as an enumeration of the power of eminent domain\u2014gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights, and so requires the government to be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \"takings clause\" after its publication. In 1991, during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings, Senator Joe Biden, \"in a dramatic movement,\" held the book up and \"repeatedly interrogated\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property. The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights and has been cited by the US Supreme Court in four cases, including Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council from 1992.\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if they were repealed. Consistent with the principles of classical liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, should be repealed, stating:\n\nInfluence\n\nUnder our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.\n\nIn 2006, the American scholar James W. Ely, Jr. wrote: \"It is a widely accepted premise that Professor Richard A. Epstein has exercised a pervasive influence on American legal thought.\" A study published in The Journal of Legal Studies in 2000 identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky.\n\nPolitics\n\nEpstein has said that when voting, he chooses \"anyone but the Big Two\" who are \"just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors\". He has voted Libertarian. Epstein says he is \"certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy\". Epstein served on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force.\n\nIn early 2015, Epstein commented on his relationship to the modern American political landscape, stating: \"I'm in this very strange position: I'm not a conservative when it comes to religious values and so forth, but I do believe, in effect, in a strong foreign policy and a relatively small domestic government, but that's not the same thing as saying I believe in no government at all.\" He has also been characterized as a libertarian conservative. During a debate with Chris Preble in December 2016, Epstein identified himself as being a \"libertarian hawk.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nEpstein's wife, Eileen W. Epstein, is a fundraiser and educator who is serves on the board of trustees for the philanthropic organization American Jewish World Service. They have three children: two sons, Benjamin M. and Elliot, and a daughter, Melissa. Epstein is a first cousin of the comedian and actor Paul Reiser.\n\nRegarding his religious views, Epstein has described himself as \"a rather weak, non-practicing Jew.\"\n\nSelected works\n\nEpstein, Richard A.; Gregory, Charles; Kalven, Harry (1977).

Shapiro, Epstein was the fifth most-cited legal scholar of all time.[2]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nEpstein was born on April 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York. His grandparents were Ashkenazi Jews who immigrated to the United States from Russia and Austria in the early 20th century. Epstein's father, Bernard Epstein (1908\u20131978), was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine Epstein (n\u00e9e Reiser; 1908\u20132004), managed his father's medical office.[3] He has two sisters. He attended elementary school at P.S. 161, a school that is now one of the Success Academy Charter Schools.[4] Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and their family moved to Great Neck, Long Island.[4]\n\nEpstein attended Columbia University as an undergraduate in the early 1960s. He had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a single major, obtaining special permission from the university to pursue a self-selected program of study across sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. He graduated with a B.A., summa cum laude, in 1964.[5]\n\nEpstein's undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University; Epstein chose Oxford, where he studied jurisprudence at Oriel College. He received a B.A. with first-class honours in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend Yale Law School; because he had an English law degree, Epstein entered Yale as a transfer student with second-year standing.[6] He graduated in 1968 with an LL.B., cum laude.\n\nAcademic career [ edit ]\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein became an assistant professor at the Gould School of Law of the University of Southern California (USC). He taught at USC for four years before moving to the University of Chicago Law School in 1972. Epstein taught at Chicago for 38 years, eventually holding the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of the New York University School of Law as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law.

South Carolina Coastal Council.[12]\n\nAt the height of the HIV pandemic in 1988, Epstein argued that companies ought to be able to discriminate against \"AIDS carriers\" and that anti-discrimination laws were unfair to employers. In place of such laws, Epstein argued that \"AIDS carriers\" ought to have their health insurance premiums subsidized via taxation so as to \"discipline the behavior of government and interests groups, here by requiring citizens to make choices about how much they individually are prepared to pay to subsidize AIDS carriers.\" Furthermore, he argued that \"[t]here is no reason to suppose that any public benefit obtained from having employers and their insurers care for AIDS victims will be at some level that matches the additional costs that are imposed.\" Instead, Epstein proposed that employers have the right to refuse to hire suspected \"AIDS carriers\".[14]\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his 1995 book Simple Rules for a Complex World, he consolidates much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs.

DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.\"\n\nEpstein has criticized the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.[16][17] In 2007, he defended the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies against the cheaper, generic production of AIDS drugs, writing that \"disregarding property rights in the name of human rights reduces human welfare around the globe\".[18]\n\nIn 2014, Epstein argued against reparations for African Americans in a piece published on the Hoover Institution's website.[19]\n\nContributing to the anthology Our American Story (2019), Epstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. Taking a decidedly skeptical approach, Epstein concluded that no new national narrative can be achieved \"unless we engage in what I call American minimalism\u2014a conscious reduction of the issues that we think are truly best handled as a nation and not better address by smaller subnational groups: states, local governments, and, most importantly, all sorts of small private organizations that are free to choose as they please in setting their own membership and mission.\"[20]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic [ edit ]\n\nIn March and April 2020, Epstein wrote several essays published by the Hoover Institution giving a contrarian account of the COVID-19 pandemic and warning against extensive containment and mitigative United States responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which he called an \"overreaction\".[21] In a piece published on March 16, he argued that the word \"pandemic\" is not to be used lightly and that the virus should be allowed to run its course, predicting there would be 500 U.S. deaths. In early June, the U.S. death total surpassed 100,000.[22] On March 24, when U.S. deaths had already exceeded 500, Epstein added a \"Correction & Addendum\", in which he changed his forecast to 5,000 deaths[23][24][25] without changing the underlying model that had led him to his first estimate.[26] On April 6, when the death toll had already far surpassed his earlier predictions, he again revised that figure, with the \"Correction & Addendum\" section declaring under the inaccurate date stamp \"March 24, 2020\" that the \"original erroneous estimate of 5,000 dead in the US [was] a number 10 times smaller than [he had] intended to state\", implying that both \"500\" and \"5,000\" had been misprints for \"50,000\".[27] After several news reports about Epstein's ever-increasing estimates, on April 21 an editor's note appeared on the website that explained the latest changes as an \"editing error\" and clarified that Epstein's original prediction had been 500 deaths.[28] In December 2020, when the death toll from COVID-19 in the U.S. was over 333,000, Politico named Epstein's predictions among \"the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year\".[29]\n\nEpstein compared COVID-19 to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and suggested that public health measures \"are done better at the level of plants, hotels, restaurants, and schools than remotely by political leaders.\" He argued that \"the response of the state governors to the coronavirus outbreak has become far more dangerous than the disease itself\", writing that the number of deaths had been exaggerated.[30] His essays, containing a number of factual errors and misconceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, circulated in conservative circles and in the Trump administration upon their publication.[31][32] In an article published on June 6, Epstein praised Republican-governed states like Florida for their crisis management, linking the then greater deaths in Democratic-governed states to their \"interventionist policies\".[33]\n\nInfluence [ edit ]\n\nIn 2006, the American scholar James W.

A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the third-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky; in a 2021 examination by Fred R. Shapiro, Epstein was the fifth most-cited legal scholar of all time.[2]"}, {"url": "https://acearchive.org/richard-epstein", "page_content": "Richard Allen Epstein is an eminent legal scholar in the United States, who is well-known for his contributions to the field of law and economics, classical liberalism, libertarianism, and property rights. He is a professor of law at New York University and the director of the Classical Liberal Institute, and has also served as a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago. Epstein's writings on torts, contracts, and property rights have had a far-reaching impact on American legal thought.\n\nEpstein's influence on legal scholarship is reflected in his high citation rate, with several studies ranking him among the most cited legal scholars of the 20th and 21st centuries. His reputation as a legal thinker is built on his commitment to classical liberalism, which emphasizes the primacy of individual rights and the rule of law. Epstein's writings on property rights, in particular, have been influential in shaping the debate around the power of eminent domain and the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nEpstein's scholarly contributions are characterized by their clarity, rigor, and originality. He is a proponent of the law and economics approach to legal analysis, which applies economic principles to legal issues. Epstein's work on the Coase Theorem, which shows that under certain conditions private parties can reach efficient outcomes without government intervention, is an example of his commitment to using economic analysis to understand legal issues.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Epstein has also been a prominent commentator on public policy issues. He is a frequent contributor to newspapers and magazines, and has written several books aimed at a broader audience. His work often takes a contrarian position, challenging conventional wisdom on issues such as healthcare reform, climate change, and income inequality.\n\nOverall, Richard Epstein is a towering figure in American legal thought, whose contributions have had a profound impact on the field of law and economics, property rights, and classical liberalism. His commitment to intellectual rigor, originality, and the rule of law has made him a valuable contributor to public discourse on legal and policy issues.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRichard Epstein, the celebrated legal scholar and libertarian thinker, was born into a family of immigrants in Brooklyn, New York, in 1943. His grandparents, who hailed from Russia and Austria, instilled in him the virtues of hard work and perseverance, which would serve him well throughout his life.\n\nEpstein's parents, Bernard and Catherine, were both successful professionals in their own right, with his father practicing as a radiologist and his mother managing his father's medical office. Epstein, who grew up with two sisters, attended P.S. 161 in Brooklyn before his family relocated to Great Neck, Long Island, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center.\n\nDespite his parents' professional success, Epstein's curiosity and academic interests were broad and far-ranging. When he enrolled at Columbia University in the early 1960s, he was given special permission to pursue a self-selected program of study that included sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. His academic prowess earned him a prestigious Kellett Fellowship, which allowed him to study jurisprudence at Oxford University's Oriel College.\n\nEpstein's time at Oxford was transformative, and he emerged with a first-class degree in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend Yale Law School, where he graduated cum laude in 1968 with an LL.B. Because of his English law degree, Epstein entered Yale as a transfer student with second-year standing.\n\nThroughout his early life and education, Epstein demonstrated a remarkable intellectual curiosity and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. His diverse interests and academic achievements would lay the foundation for a career that would make him one of the most influential legal scholars of his generation. From his immigrant roots in Brooklyn to his studies at Oxford and Yale, Epstein's journey is a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and intellectual curiosity.\n\nAcademic career\n\nRichard Epstein's academic career is nothing short of impressive. He started as an assistant professor at the USC Gould School of Law, where he honed his skills as a legal scholar for four years before moving to the University of Chicago Law School in 1972. At Chicago, Epstein spent an astounding 38 years teaching law, and he eventually became the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law.\n\nEpstein may have retired from Chicago in 2010, but he did not stop his academic pursuits there. He quickly joined the faculty of the New York University School of Law as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law. Currently, he remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, occasionally teaching courses there. His academic brilliance is not just limited to teaching as in 2013, NYU Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.\n\nIn addition to his teaching career, Epstein has also been affiliated with several academic and public organizations, showcasing his vast knowledge and experience in his field. For instance, he served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a renowned American public policy think tank at Stanford University, since 2001.\n\nEpstein has also received several awards throughout his career, highlighting his exceptional contribution to the field of law. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985 and was the editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, as well as the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001.\n\nFurthermore, Epstein has received numerous honorary degrees, with the most recent being an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Siegen in 2018. He also received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent in 2003. In 2005, he was awarded the Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize by the College of William & Mary for his contributions to the field of property rights. In 2011, he was the recipient of the Bradley Prize, awarded by the Bradley Foundation, for his outstanding achievements in the field of law.\n\nRichard Epstein's academic career is a testament to his passion for law and his dedication to scholarly pursuits. His many achievements in the field have cemented his status as a legal luminary, and his contributions will undoubtedly continue to inspire future generations of legal scholars.\n\nWritings\n\nRichard Epstein is an American legal scholar known for his writings on property rights, eminent domain, and minimal legal regulation. His book 'Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain' published in 1985, was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution. In the book, Epstein argued that the clause gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights and requires the government to be regarded the same as any other private entity in a property dispute. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property and has influenced how some courts view property rights.\n\nEpstein's views on the HIV pandemic in 1988 were also controversial, as he argued that companies ought to be able to discriminate against \"AIDS carriers\" and that anti-discrimination laws were unfair to employers. He proposed that \"AIDS carriers\" ought to have their health insurance premiums subsidized via taxation so as to \"discipline the behavior of government and interests groups, here by requiring citizens to make choices about how much they individually are prepared to pay to subsidize AIDS carriers.\" Furthermore, he argued that employers have the right to refuse to hire suspected \"AIDS carriers.\"\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation and believes that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. In his 1995 book 'Simple Rules for a Complex World', he consolidates much of his previous work and argues that complex rules are justifiable if they can be opted out of. He believes that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation ought to be repealed, stating that such legislation creates unnecessary complexity and costs.\n\nEpstein has also written about same-sex marriage, advocating for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and criticizing the Supreme Court ruling in 'Obergefell v. Hodges'. He argues that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage should be repealed as only the state may issue marriage licenses and the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors.\n\nEpstein's ideas have influenced legal thinking and have been cited by the US Supreme Court four times. His arguments have been controversial and have sparked a great deal of debate and discussion. Epstein's writings are known for their clarity and their ability to engage readers in complex legal and philosophical debates.\n\nInfluence\n\nIn the world of legal scholarship, there are few figures as influential as Richard Epstein. Over the course of his long and distinguished career, Epstein has managed to shape the way we think about some of the most complex legal issues of our time. From constitutional law to property rights, Epstein's insights have helped to shape the very fabric of our legal system.\n\nWhat makes Epstein's influence so remarkable is the breadth and depth of his reach. According to one study, he is the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. That's an incredible achievement by any measure, and it speaks to the enormous impact that Epstein has had on his field. But it's not just the number of citations that sets Epstein apart. It's the quality of his work, and the clarity of his ideas, that have made him such a respected figure.\n\nOne of the things that sets Epstein apart from other legal scholars is his ability to communicate complex ideas in a way that is accessible to everyone. Whether he is writing for a specialized legal audience or speaking to a general audience, Epstein has a way of breaking down complex legal concepts and making them understandable to everyone. It's a rare talent, and it's one that has helped to make Epstein one of the most influential legal thinkers of our time.\n\nAnother key factor in Epstein's success is his ability to inspire others. Over the years, he has mentored some of the most successful lawyers and judges in the country. His former students include a number of prominent judges, lawyers, and law professors, all of whom credit Epstein with helping to shape their careers. That kind of influence is hard to quantify, but it speaks to the profound impact that Epstein has had on the legal community.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing about Epstein is his sheer versatility. He has written about everything from constitutional law to property rights, and his insights have been applied to a wide range of legal issues. In a world where specialization is increasingly the norm, Epstein's ability to move seamlessly between different areas of the law is a rare and valuable skill.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees with Epstein's ideas. He has been a controversial figure at times, and his views on certain issues have been criticized by some. But even his critics would have to concede that Epstein has made a significant contribution to legal scholarship over the years.\n\nIn the end, what makes Richard Epstein such a remarkable figure is his ability to think deeply and creatively about some of the most complex legal issues of our time. His influence has been felt far and wide, and his ideas will continue to shape the way we think about the law for years to come. Whether you agree with him or not, there is no denying the impact that Epstein has had on the legal world.\n\nPolitics\n\nRichard Epstein is a legal scholar and commentator who has carved out a unique voice in the world of American politics. A self-proclaimed \u201clibertarian conservative,\u201d Epstein has never been afraid to criticize both the left and the right when he feels they are abandoning their principles.\n\nOne of Epstein's most noteworthy stances is his rejection of both the Democratic and Republican parties. He sees them as \u201cjust two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors.\u201d When it comes to voting, Epstein prefers the Libertarian party, which he feels better aligns with his small-government philosophy.\n\nEpstein is a firm believer in limited government and individual liberty. He has praised former President Calvin Coolidge for his small-government approach, though he also acknowledges that Coolidge made mistakes. Epstein\u2019s views on the role of government have made him a strong critic of both liberal and conservative policies.\n\nEpstein's commitment to individual liberty has also led him to be involved in discussions of detainee treatment. He served on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force, which studied how the US treats detainees. Epstein believes that individual liberty is a fundamental right, and that this should be balanced with the need for national security. In his view, the government has often overreached in its efforts to protect the country, infringing on the rights of individuals in the process.\n\nDespite his libertarian leanings, Epstein is not opposed to all forms of government intervention. He has argued, for example, that there is a role for the government in protecting the environment. However, he also believes that the government should be cautious about regulating businesses, as over-regulation can stifle innovation and economic growth.\n\nEpstein is a maverick voice in American politics. He does not fit neatly into any one political box, and his willingness to challenge the status quo has earned him both praise and criticism. He is not afraid to speak his mind, even when it means going against the conventional wisdom. His views on limited government and individual liberty have made him an important figure in American politics, and his commitment to these principles will likely continue to shape the conversation for years to come.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRichard Epstein is a legal scholar whose brilliance is matched only by his humility. While he may be a giant in the world of legal academia, he is surprisingly down-to-earth in his personal life. Epstein's wife, Eileen W. Epstein, is a respected fundraiser and educator who is a board member of the American Jewish World Service, a philanthropic organization dedicated to improving the lives of people in developing countries. Together, they have raised three children: two sons, Benjamin M. and Elliot, and a daughter, Melissa.\n\nDespite being raised in the Jewish faith and having a bar mitzvah, Epstein describes himself as a \"rather weak, non-practicing Jew.\" This is not uncommon in modern society, where people often have a tenuous connection to their religious roots. But it is a testament to Epstein's honesty that he admits his own ambivalence toward his faith.\n\nInterestingly, Epstein is also related to the famous comedian and actor, Paul Reiser. This familial connection may seem like a small detail, but it underscores the idea that even great minds like Epstein's are part of a larger tapestry of humanity.\n\nOverall, Epstein's personal life may not be the stuff of tabloid headlines, but it is a reflection of the complexities and contradictions of the human experience. In his professional life, Epstein is known for his sharp intellect and incisive legal analysis. But in his personal life, he is a loving husband and father who grapples with the same questions and challenges as the rest of us. And perhaps that is what makes him so relatable and so respected.\n\nSelected works\n\nRichard A. Epstein is an American legal scholar who has written extensively on topics ranging from law and economics to constitutional law, and his works have been influential in shaping legal thought in the United States. In this retrospective, we will take a closer look at some of his most notable works, both books, and journal articles, that have shaped legal scholarship in the past half-century.\n\nOne of Epstein's earliest works is his 1973 article \"A Theory of Strict Liability,\" which appeared in the Journal of Legal Studies. In this piece, Epstein argues that the traditional approach to tort law, which requires plaintiffs to prove negligence on the part of the defendant, is misguided. Instead, Epstein advocates for a strict liability regime that would make defendants liable for any harm they cause, regardless of whether they were negligent. He argues that this approach would lead to more efficient outcomes, as it would encourage defendants to take greater precautions to avoid causing harm.\n\nIn his 1975 article \"Unconscionability: A Critical Reappraisal,\" which appeared in the Journal of Law and Economics, Epstein takes on the doctrine of unconscionability in contract law. He argues that this doctrine is overbroad and should be replaced with a more limited set of defenses that protect parties from fraud, duress, and mistake. He argues that the current approach to unconscionability leads to uncertainty and unpredictability in contract law, which ultimately harms both parties.\n\nEpstein's 1979 article \"Nuisance Law: Corrective Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints,\" which appeared in the Journal of Legal Studies, is another important contribution to legal scholarship. In this article, Epstein argues that the traditional approach to nuisance law, which relies on the concept of \"corrective justice\" to determine liability, is flawed. He suggests that a utilitarian approach, which weighs the costs and benefits of different courses of action, would lead to more efficient outcomes. He argues that the corrective justice approach is overly focused on the individual harm suffered by the plaintiff, while the utilitarian approach takes into account the broader social costs and benefits of different outcomes.\n\nIn his 1983 article \"A Common Law for Labor Relations: A Critique of the New Deal Labor Legislation,\" which appeared in the Yale Law Journal, Epstein takes on the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which he argues is deeply flawed. He argues that the Act has been a failure, as it has led to increased conflict between employers and employees, rather than promoting cooperation. Epstein suggests that the common law approach to labor relations, which emphasizes individual bargaining and voluntary contracts, would be a more effective way to promote labor peace and prosperity.\n\nIn his 1984 article \"In Defense of the Contract at Will,\" which appeared in the University of Chicago Law Review, Epstein defends the concept of employment at will, which allows employers to terminate employees for any reason or no reason at all. He argues that this approach is essential to the efficient operation of labor markets, as it allows employers to make quick and flexible hiring and firing decisions. He also argues that efforts to restrict employment at will through legislation or court decisions are misguided and ultimately harm employees by reducing job opportunities and increasing the cost of labor.\n\nEpstein's 1987 article \"The Proper Scope of the Commerce Power,\" which appeared in the Virginia Law Review, is another important contribution to legal scholarship. In this article, Epstein argues that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce between the states, has been interpreted too broadly by the courts. He suggests that a narrower interpretation of the Commerce Clause would better protect individual rights and limit federal power. He argues that the current approach to the Commerce Clause has allowed the federal government to expand its power in ways that were"}, {"url": "https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Richard-Epstein-prolific", "page_content": "Richard Epstein\n\nGoogle \u201cRichard A. Epstein\u201d and \u201cprolific\u201d and you\u2019ll get plenty of hits. Other searches will produce multiple items documenting that Epstein, who is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law, has long been one of the country\u2019s most productive and influential legal scholars. On April 20, NYU Law and the University of Chicago Law School (Epstein\u2019s former academic home, where he is now a senior lecturer) will jointly sponsor an event in Chicago to honor Epstein\u2019s 50-year career. Even focusing just on the most recent quintile of his career\u2014since the fall of 2007, when he began teaching regularly at NYU\u2014there is plenty to celebrate, as his output and activity have continued at a brisk pace.\n\nScholarly productivity has long been assessed by quantifying traditional publications, and Epstein has no shortage of those. Between September 1, 2007, and March 1, 2018, he authored 123 academic journal articles and 30 book chapters; he also wrote or edited 10 books.\n\nTo focus only on Epstein\u2019s academic writing, though, is to miss a substantial portion of his oeuvre. A leading exponent of libertarian (or, in his preferred formulation, \u201cclassical liberal\u201d) thought, Epstein is a multiplatform threat, disseminating his ideas on myriad topics through online columns, podcasts, radio broadcasts, Twitter, and other outlets.\n\nThe conservative website Ricochet, which features Epstein on podcasts, referred to him in a tweet as \u201cThe Human Paragraph.\u201d Words, Epstein acknowledges, flow easily for him. \u201cIf you can get yourself to a topic sentence,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can usually see a problem through to the end.\u201d Credit Epstein with more than 450 topic sentences for the opinion pieces he has written since August 2008, primarily for Defining Ideas, an online journal of Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, where Epstein is a senior fellow. Based on their average length, these pieces total about 750,000 words. Under \"The Libertarian\" moniker, he's done hundreds of podcasts for Hoover, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy his own estimate, Epstein delivers between 75 and 100 lectures and talks a year. During a two-day visit to Philadelphia this February, he delivered four, all without notes, as is typical for his appearances. \u201cIf you like to talk, it\u2019s not a great burden,\u201d he explains. With material from a single five-hour recording session, the Federalist Society has produced a YouTube playlist featuring 14 brief videos of Epstein explaining the common law and plans to post nine more this summer on contracts as well as additional segments next year on torts.\n\n\u201cThey put me on a stool and said, \u2018Start talking,\u2019\u201d Epstein recalls. \u201cPretty soon it was like a rock rolling downhill.\u201d\n\nEmploying yet another medium, Epstein has done two \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d interviews on Reddit, the social news and media site.\n\nBeyond how much he produces, Epstein scores high on another metric for law professors: influence. The yardstick for this is law journal citations, and Epstein ranks in the upper echelons in a tally published in 2014 as well as in a current count in the HeinOnline database that includes citations over the past decade. Courts also cite his scholarship frequently.\n\nLess amenable to measurement, but still emblematic of Epstein\u2019s influence is the Classical Liberal Institute (CLI), which he co-founded at NYU Law in 2013 with Mario Rizzo, an economics professor at NYU. CLI shapes law, policy, and scholarship through its conferences, publications, and fellows program and works closely with its affiliate scholars even after they leave NYU.\n\nOf final note is the breadth of Epstein\u2019s scholarship and teaching. Among the topics he wrote about just in 2017, for example, are patents, right-to-work laws, takings law, Brexit, and Kantian moral theory. Over the course of his career, he has taught courses on 30 different subjects (16 since arriving at NYU Law), including Roman law, military law, and water law. \u201cI will write or teach about anything, and happily learn as I teach,\u201d he says.\n\nPosted April 17, 2018\n\nIllustration: Robert Neubecker"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/richard-allen-epstein/", "page_content": "Richard Allen Epstein (born April 17, 1943) is an American scholar, educator, lawyer, and author, best known for his writings and studies on classical liberalism, libertarianism, torts, and a wide variety of topics in law and economics. Epstein is currently the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and professor emeritus and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago.\n\nEpstein's writings have extensively influenced modern American legal thought. In 2000, a study published in The Journal of Legal Studies identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1985.\n\nLife and career\n\nRichard A. Epstein was born on April 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Bernard Epstein (1908\u20131978), was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine Epstein (n\u00e9e Reiser; 1908\u20132004), managed his father's medical office. He has two sisters. He attended elementary school at P.S. 161, a school that is now one of the Success Academy Charter Schools. Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and their family moved to Great Neck, Long Island.\n\nEpstein attended Columbia University as an undergraduate student in the early 1960s. Epstein had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a traditional single major, and obtained permission from Columbia to pursue an unusual self-selected program of study across the three areas of sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. He graduated with a B.A. degree summa cum laude in 1964. Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, studying at Oriel College and earning a first-class honours B.A. in jurisprudence in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the Yale Law School at Yale University, graduating with an LL.B. cum laude in 1968.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the University of Southern California. He taught there until 1972 when he moved to the University of Chicago, where he taught for 38 years and eventually held the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of New York University as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law, where he currently teaches. He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis. In 2013, New York University's School of Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.\n\nSince 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a prominent American public policy think tank located at Stanford University.\n\nEpstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards. In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical School, and in 1985 was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, and was editor of the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001. In 2003, Epstein received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent. In 2005 the College of William and Mary awarded him the Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize for his contributions to the field of property rights, and in 2011 was awarded a Bradley Prize by the Bradley Foundation.\n\nWritings\n\nEpstein's early scholarship focused primarily on tax law and torts. However, he became famous in the American legal community in 1985 with Harvard University Press' publication of his book Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain. In it, Epstein argued that the \"takings clause\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014which reads, \"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\", and is traditionally viewed as an enumeration of the power of eminent domain\u2014gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights, and so requires the government to be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \"takings clause\" after its publication. In 1991, during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings, Senator Joe Biden, \"in a dramatic movement,\" held the book up and \"repeatedly interrogated\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property. The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights and has been cited by the US Supreme Court in four cases, including Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council from 1992.\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if they were repealed. Consistent with the principles of classical liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, should be repealed, stating:\n\nInfluence\n\nIn 2006, the American scholar James W. Ely, Jr. wrote: \"It is a widely accepted premise that Professor Richard A. Epstein has exercised a pervasive influence on American legal thought.\" A study published in The Journal of Legal Studies in 2000 identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky.\n\nPolitics\n\nEpstein has said that when voting, he chooses \"anyone but the Big Two\" who are \"just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors\". He has voted Libertarian. Epstein says he is \"certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy\". Epstein served on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force.\n\nIn early 2015, Epstein commented on his relationship to the modern American political landscape, stating: \"I'm in this very strange position: I'm not a conservative when it comes to religious values and so forth, but I do believe, in effect, in a strong foreign policy and a relatively small domestic government, but that's not the same thing as saying I believe in no government at all.\" He has also been characterized as a libertarian conservative. During a debate with Chris Preble in December 2016, Epstein identified himself as being a \"libertarian hawk.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nEpstein's wife, Eileen W.

Epstein is currently the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law emeritus and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago.\n\nEpstein's writings have extensively influenced modern American legal thought. In 2000, a study published in The Journal of Legal Studies identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1985.\n\nLife and career\n\nRichard A. Epstein was born on April 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Bernard Epstein (1908\u20131978), was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine Epstein (n\u00e9e Reiser; 1908\u20132004), managed his father's medical office. He has two sisters. He attended elementary school at P.S. 161, a school that is now one of the Success Academy Charter Schools. Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and their family moved to Great Neck, Long Island.\n\nEpstein attended Columbia University as an undergraduate student in the early 1960s. Epstein had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a traditional single major, and obtained permission from Columbia to pursue an unusual self-selected program of study across the three areas of sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. He graduated with a B.A. degree summa cum laude in 1964. Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, studying at Oriel College and earning a first-class honours B.A. in jurisprudence in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the Yale Law School at Yale University, graduating with an LL.B. cum laude in 1968.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the University of Southern California. He taught there until 1972 when he moved to the University of Chicago, where he taught for 38 years and eventually held the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of New York University as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law. He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis. In 2013, New York University's School of Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.\n\nSince 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a prominent American public policy think tank located at Stanford University.\n\nEpstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards. In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical School, and in 1985 was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, and was editor of the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001. In 2003, Epstein received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent. In 2005 the College of William & Mary awarded him the Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize for his contributions to the field of property rights, and in 2011 he was awarded a Bradley Prize by the Bradley Foundation.\n\nWritings\n\nEpstein's early scholarship focused primarily on tax law and torts. However, he became famous in the American legal community in 1985 with Harvard University Press' publication of his book Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain. In it, Epstein argued that the \"takings clause\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014which reads, \"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\", and is traditionally viewed as an enumeration of the power of eminent domain\u2014gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights, and so requires the government to be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \"takings clause\" after its publication. In 1991, during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings, Senator Joe Biden, \"in a dramatic movement,\" held the book up and \"repeatedly interrogated\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property. The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights and has been cited by the US Supreme Court in four cases, including Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council from 1992.\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if they were repealed. Consistent with the principles of classical liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, should be repealed, stating:\n\nInfluence\n\nUnder our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.\n\nIn 2006, the American scholar James W. Ely, Jr. wrote: \"It is a widely accepted premise that Professor Richard A. Epstein has exercised a pervasive influence on American legal thought.\" A study published in The Journal of Legal Studies in 2000 identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky.\n\nPolitics\n\nEpstein has said that when voting, he chooses \"anyone but the Big Two\" who are \"just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors\". He has voted Libertarian. Epstein says he is \"certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy\". Epstein served on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force.\n\nIn early 2015, Epstein commented on his relationship to the modern American political landscape, stating: \"I'm in this very strange position: I'm not a conservative when it comes to religious values and so forth, but I do believe, in effect, in a strong foreign policy and a relatively small domestic government, but that's not the same thing as saying I believe in no government at all.\" He has also been characterized as a libertarian conservative. During a debate with Chris Preble in December 2016, Epstein identified himself as being a \"libertarian hawk.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nEpstein's wife, Eileen W. Epstein, is a fundraiser and educator who is serves on the board of trustees for the philanthropic organization American Jewish World Service. They have three children: two sons, Benjamin M. and Elliot, and a daughter, Melissa. Epstein is a first cousin of the comedian and actor Paul Reiser.\n\nRegarding his religious views, Epstein has described himself as \"a rather weak, non-practicing Jew.\"\n\nSelected works\n\nEpstein, Richard A.; Gregory, Charles; Kalven, Harry (1977).

Epstein has repeatedly argued\u2014with analytical rigor and astonishing erudition\u2014that governments govern best when they limit their actions to protecting liberty and property. He is perhaps best known for \"Takings,\" his 1995 book on the losses that regulations impose on property owners. Of late, he has exposed the flaws of a government-administered health system.\n\nIn \"The Classical Liberal Constitution,\" Mr. Epstein takes up the political logic of our fundamental law. The Constitution, he says, reflects above all John Locke's insistence on protecting natural rights\u2014rights that we possess simply by virtue of our humanity. Their protection takes concrete form in the Constitution by restricting the federal government to specific, freedom-advancing and property-protecting tasks, such as establishing a procedurally fair justice system, minting money as a stable repository of value, preserving a national trade zone among the states, and, not least, guarding the rights listed in the Bill of Rights.\n\nMr. Epstein believes that constitutional law lost its way when it began to embrace a Progressive vision, according to which rights are created by a supposedly benevolent state. Starting especially with the New Deal legislation of the 1930s, the federal government has passed laws that redistribute wealth, water-down procedural protections for property, and dictate the relations between employers and employees. The premise of such laws is that government should establish a pattern of social justice. By such logic, the government may declare rights that are in no way natural (like the right to an old-age pension) and remove others that are fundamental (like freedom of association).\n\nThe antidote, for Mr. Epstein, is a reassertion of liberal principle aimed at helping individuals realize joint prosperity through trade and contract. In \"The Classical Liberal Constitution,\" he interprets provisions that are often murky in their application, like the First Amendment's prohibition of laws \"respecting an Establishment of religion.\" Here he rejects a strict separation of church and state to make room for religion in the public sphere, on the grounds that accommodating many faiths provides mutual gains\u2014a hallmark of classical liberalism.\n\nHe also uses liberal principle to judge which Supreme Court precedents should be retained and which discarded. He would keep the precedents that vindicate liberty, like protecting a right to contraception, even if this particular right cannot be rooted in the Constitution's text. Similarly, he acknowledges that the Constitution did not foresee judicial supremacy\u2014the courts' power to bind the other branches of government by its precedents. But he applauds judicial supremacy because, in his view, it generally restrains the overweening state.\n\nIn its ambition and range, \"The Classical Liberal Constitution\" is comparable with John Hart Ely's magisterial \"Democracy and Distrust\" (1980). Just as Ely claimed that representative government is the objective that unlocks the meaning of the Constitution's disparate clauses and amendments, Mr. Epstein claims to discover the interpretive key in classical liberalism\u2014in the call for a limited government protecting natural rights.\n\nTo be sure, the Framers were very much aware of Locke, and liberalism is central to the Constitution's meaning. But Mr. Epstein never shows that Locke's liberalism tracks his own or that it was the dominant influence on the Framers. Other influences included Montesquieu, who stressed a balance of powers, and some of the Framers adhered to the civic-republican tradition, whereby one role of government was to cultivate virtue. What is more, the Constitution reflects the lived experience of Americans and their forebears. The Bill of Rights derives in part from quarrels among English religious sects and the abuses of the Star Chamber. The very wording of the Bill of Rights often expresses this long history.\n\nA case in point is the Second Amendment, which declares: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\" The Supreme Court recently declared that the amendment protects the right of citizens in the District of Columbia to possess a handgun in their home. Mr. Epstein rejects this decision on the grounds that the District is not a \"state.\" But the amendment's preamble, in which the phrase \"a free State\" appears, announces a political proposition. It thus likely refers to political entities in general, not specific jurisdictions, and Mr. Epstein provides no historical or scholarly support for his novel suggestion.\n\nMr. Epstein is at its strongest when he combines his analytical powers with the historical research of others, as he does when he discusses the clause that gives Congress the authority to make all laws \"necessary and proper\" to executing the powers enumerated in the Constitution. This clause has been used over and over again to expand the authority of the federal government. Mr. Epstein provides evidence that the Framers would not have considered legislation \"proper\" if it exercised an unenumerated power of substantial scope. It is one thing for the government to criminalize stealing the mail as part of its authority to establish post offices. It is quite another for it to penalize citizens for not participating in a market, as it did when it required individuals to buy insurance as part of its regulation of commerce under the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Epstein's argument here is based on historical understanding as well as principle.\n\nThe Constitution, as Mr. Epstein argues, provides us with rights to individual liberty and property, but it also gives us the right of collective self-government. While there will never be an easy synthesis of both inheritances, he vividly shows us how constitutional law would look if we gave priority to individual rights\u2014something that we have not done for almost a century.\n\nMr. McGinnis is a professor of law at Northwestern University."}, {"url": "https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975460", "page_content": "\u201c[An] important and learned book.\u201d\u2014Gary L.

Epstein laments this complacency which, he believes, explains America\u2019s current economic malaise and political gridlock. Steering clear of well-worn debates between defenders of originalism and proponents of a living Constitution, Epstein employs close textual reading, historical analysis, and political and economic theory to urge a return to the classical liberal theory of governance that animated the framers\u2019 original text, and to the limited government this theory supports.\n\nGrounded in the thought of Locke, Hume, Madison, and other Enlightenment figures, the classical liberal tradition emphasized federalism, restricted government, separation of powers, property rights, and economic liberties. The most serious challenge to this tradition, Epstein contends, has come from New Deal progressives and their intellectual defenders. Unlike Thomas Paine, who saw government as a necessary evil at best, the progressives embraced government as a force for administering social good. The Supreme Court has unwisely ratified the progressive program by sustaining an ever-lengthening list of legislative programs at odds with the classical liberal Constitution.\n\nEpstein\u2019s carefully considered analysis addresses both halves of the constitutional enterprise: its structural safeguards against excessive government power and its protection of individual rights. He illuminates contemporary disputes ranging from presidential prerogatives to health care legislation, while reexamining such enduring topics as the institution of judicial review, the federal government\u2019s role in regulating economic activity, freedom of speech and religion, and equal protection.\n\nThe central mission of The Classical Liberal Constitution is to go against the grain of modern Supreme Court jurisprudence and much of the legal scholarship that has grown up around that body of work. The motivation for this argument should be apparent from the major disarray that infects every area of modern American life: steady decline in the average standard of living; constant battles over debt limits and fiscal cliffs; uncertainty over key elements of the tax structure; massive overregulation of the most productive sources in society (health care and financial services); government-inspired brinksmanship in labor negotiations; and runaway redistribution programs that undercut the economic production that makes these programs viable. All of these major programs could not have happened under the original constitutional structure, faithfully interpreted in light of changed circumstances. The confluence of these events cannot be dismissed as the result of random noise or simple mistakes. Rather, they are the ultimate consequence of the profound progressive break with the classical liberal tradition that was the guiding genius in the drafting and interpretation of the Constitution.\n\n\u2014From the book"}, {"url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/117619/classical-liberal-constitution-richard-epstein-reviewed", "page_content": "When Epstein comes to constitutional law, he is, in a sense, a stranger in a strange land. That is a big risk, but it is also a potential advantage, because it allows a kind of independence and outsider\u2019s perspective\u2014in his case, the perspective of an outsider who has a particular view of the foundations of private law. When he contends that he aims to defend \u201cwith a passionate intensity the classical liberal vision of the Constitution,\u201d he should be understood to be proceeding not as a scholar of eighteenth-century constitutional debates but as an enthusiast for a certain understanding of Anglo-American common law, one that can be connected with important strands in eighteenth-century political thought.\n\nTo give content to what he calls (controversially) \u201cthe classical liberal vision,\u201d Epstein offers a foil, the villain of the piece, which he calls the \u201cmodern progressive\u201d or \u201csocial democratic\u201d approach. He identifies that approach with the 1930s, when, he urges, policymakers jettisoned \u201cthe traditional safeguards against excessive state power.\u201d As a matter of law, their ill-advised, and constitutionally illegitimate, reforms became possible for two reasons. First, the progressives saw ambiguity in the constitutional text, thus licensing those reforms. Second, the progressives insisted that unelected judges should recede in favor of We the People, acting through elected representatives. Epstein does not deny that the Constitution is sometimes ambiguous. Importantly, he acknowledges that \u201cour basic conception of the proper scope of government action will, and should, influence the resolution of key interpretive disputes.\u201d But he emphasizes that a \u201cdetailed textual analysis\u201d has priority over our preferred views about political theory.\n\nMuch of his book consists of comprehensive and exceptionally detailed accounts of how constitutional provisions ought to be understood. In many places his discussion is highly technical, but in some important respects\u2014of course not in all\u2014you can take it as a careful and sophisticated guide to Tea Party constitutionalism. He believes, for example, that in interpreting the Commerce Clause, courts should not allow Congress to exercise the broad authority that it now has to regulate private activity on the ground that interstate commerce might be involved. He believes that the Affordable Care Act does not fit with the original constitutional plan, and he has written that \u201cknocking out the individual mandate should be a piece of cake,\u201d but he would go much further. In his opinion, the National Labor Relations Act is unconstitutional insofar as it \u201cdid not solve any national problem.\u201d He contends that \u201cone should do everything possible to curtail or at least cut back the affirmative scope of the federal government under the Commerce Clause on the ground that the new powers are chiefly used to create national cartels that are antithetical to the basic provisions of classical liberal theory.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/Classical-Liberal-Institute-Richard-Epstein-Mario-Rizzo-NYU-Law-Hayek-Lecture-economics-libertarianism", "page_content": "In 2015 alone, 20 articles written or co-written by famously prolific Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law Richard Epstein, long known as an intellectual standard-bearer of libertarian conservatism, saw print. The year before, he had published what he considers to be his magnum opus\u2014to date, at least. The Classical Liberal Constitution: The Uncertain Quest for Limited Government, a 700-page tome, is, in his articulation, \u201cthe culmination of my lifetime project of developing a distinctive synthesis of constitutional law that does not fall squarely within either the conservative or progressive camp.\u201d Classical liberalism, which sprang from the economic theories of Adam Smith and the philosophies of thinkers such as John Locke and David Hume, argues for smaller government, private property rights, and individual liberty, in contrast to modern liberalism\u2019s more frequent advocacy of economic regulation.\n\nRichard Epstein (left) and Mario Rizzo (right)\n\nEpstein\u2019s scholarship helped inspire the creation of NYU Law\u2019s Classical Liberal Institute (CLI), which Epstein co-directs with Mario Rizzo, an associate professor of economics with an interdisciplinary outlook who also directs NYU\u2019s Program on the Foundations of the Market Economy. Launched in September 2013 with a daylong conference on the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, CLI aims, per its mission statement, \u201cto examine how systems of property rights and contracts work to advance human welfare within a framework of limited government.\u201d\n\nCLI, like Epstein, is a locus of eclectic productivity. Epstein has taught on subjects as far-ranging as health care law, Roman law, and workers\u2019 compensation. CLI, for its part, has organized panels, symposia, and conferences on topics including digital currencies, the Affordable Care Act, market-based reforms for public education, tech entrepreneurs and the regulatory state, and the origins and prospects of Brexit. This week, CLI will co-host a conference on tax reform and protectionism; later this academic year, it will hold events on the rise of American populism as well as religion\u2019s role in free society. Says Epstein, \u201cYou name it, we\u2019ll write about it. The name \u2018Classical Liberal Institute\u2019 is not subject matter-specific. It\u2019s methodologically intellectual.\u201d\n\nThe wide-ranging CLI scholarship, Rizzo says, benefits his own considerable body of work. \u201cIt\u2019s broadened my intellectual scope and perhaps competence beyond what it was previously. I\u2019ve also had the pleasure of seeing more people being informed and educated in the classical liberal tradition, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nRizzo\u2019s forthcoming book Puppets and Puppet Masters: Rationality, Behavioral Economics, and New Paternalism draws on his most recent research; he is also organizing the CLI conference \u201cBehavioral Economics and New Paternalism\u201d for next spring. An earlier symposium he put together, \u201cThe Ends of Capitalism,\u201d looked at a sweeping array of philosophical, legal, social, and economic issues in evaluating capitalist systems; papers from the two-day event later appeared in the Supreme Court Economic Review.\n\nIn the service of its ambitious agenda, CLI collaborates with NYU Law students connected to the NYU Journal of Law & Business, the NYU Journal of Law and Liberty, and the NYU Federalist Society. An ongoing faculty lunch series has most recently featured discussions between Epstein and University Professor Jeremy Waldron on the ideas of Locke, Hume, Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and other philosophers.\n\nMany events yield multiple papers, resulting in dozens of published articles in the institute\u2019s relatively brief history. The scholarship is produced by those invited from elsewhere to share their work as well as CLI\u2019s fellows and affiliate scholars.\n\n\u201cMost of us are here because in some way we gravitated toward the scholarship that was coming out of the main scholars at CLI, either in the present or sometime in the past,\u201d says Shruti Rajagopalan, an assistant professor of economics at State University of New York, Purchase College, and a fellow since 2014. \u201cBecause they write so broadly, we all seem like odd ducks who have nothing to do with each other, but that\u2019s really what we do.\u201d\n\nFellows often spearhead CLI events. After mentioning to Epstein the upcoming 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, Rajagopalan organized a major conference on it in November 2015. Discussion among historians, legal scholars, economists, and political theorists was capped off by keynote speaker Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England and a professor of economics and law at NYU. The International Review of Law and Economics published the proceedings and invited Rajagopalan to edit that volume: \u201cIt was a series of opportunities that I probably would have not had anything to do with if I weren\u2019t at the Classical Liberal Institute.\u201d\n\nOne of CLI\u2019s most important events is the annual Friedrich A. von Hayek Lecture, named for a Nobel Prize-winning, classically liberal economist and philosopher. First delivered in 2005 by Epstein himself, the lecture series has hosted prominent academics and judges, including Viet Dinh, former assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration; Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; and Professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA School of Law. Next month, Judge William Pryor Jr. of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit will give the annual lecture.\n\nWhile CLI casts a wide net to attract high-profile visitors, its core mission is best embodied by the interaction among its fellows and faculty, who bounce their thoughts off one another constantly. Rizzo believes that CLI may well be the only law school-based institute focused on the broad, multidisciplinary application of classical liberalism through a legal lens.\n\nNick Cowen, now in the second year of his fellowship, stresses the practical takeaways that the institute aims to extract from academic work: \u201cThe overall idea is to enrich our very abstract kind of political theoretic ideas with a little bit more realism, with the actual practice of reconciling conflicts in civil society, which is what the process of law is.\u201d\n\nPosted October 10, 2017"}, {"url": "https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ECM_PRO_059743", "page_content": "Professor Richard Epstein, the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago, will join NYU School of Law as a permanent member of the faculty in Fall 2010.\n\nEpstein, who is currently visiting the Law School for the fourth time, is considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in legal academia.

He is a professor of law at New York University and the director of the Classical Liberal Institute, and has also served as a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago. Epstein's writings on torts, contracts, and property rights have had a far-reaching impact on American legal thought.\n\nEpstein's influence on legal scholarship is reflected in his high citation rate, with several studies ranking him among the most cited legal scholars of the 20th and 21st centuries. His reputation as a legal thinker is built on his commitment to classical liberalism, which emphasizes the primacy of individual rights and the rule of law. Epstein's writings on property rights, in particular, have been influential in shaping the debate around the power of eminent domain and the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nEpstein's scholarly contributions are characterized by their clarity, rigor, and originality. He is a proponent of the law and economics approach to legal analysis, which applies economic principles to legal issues. Epstein's work on the Coase Theorem, which shows that under certain conditions private parties can reach efficient outcomes without government intervention, is an example of his commitment to using economic analysis to understand legal issues.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Epstein has also been a prominent commentator on public policy issues. He is a frequent contributor to newspapers and magazines, and has written several books aimed at a broader audience. His work often takes a contrarian position, challenging conventional wisdom on issues such as healthcare reform, climate change, and income inequality.\n\nOverall, Richard Epstein is a towering figure in American legal thought, whose contributions have had a profound impact on the field of law and economics, property rights, and classical liberalism. His commitment to intellectual rigor, originality, and the rule of law has made him a valuable contributor to public discourse on legal and policy issues.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRichard Epstein, the celebrated legal scholar and libertarian thinker, was born into a family of immigrants in Brooklyn, New York, in 1943. His grandparents, who hailed from Russia and Austria, instilled in him the virtues of hard work and perseverance, which would serve him well throughout his life.\n\nEpstein's parents, Bernard and Catherine, were both successful professionals in their own right, with his father practicing as a radiologist and his mother managing his father's medical office. Epstein, who grew up with two sisters, attended P.S. 161 in Brooklyn before his family relocated to Great Neck, Long Island, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center.\n\nDespite his parents' professional success, Epstein's curiosity and academic interests were broad and far-ranging. When he enrolled at Columbia University in the early 1960s, he was given special permission to pursue a self-selected program of study that included sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. His academic prowess earned him a prestigious Kellett Fellowship, which allowed him to study jurisprudence at Oxford University's Oriel College.\n\nEpstein's time at Oxford was transformative, and he emerged with a first-class degree in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend Yale Law School, where he graduated cum laude in 1968 with an LL.B. Because of his English law degree, Epstein entered Yale as a transfer student with second-year standing.\n\nThroughout his early life and education, Epstein demonstrated a remarkable intellectual curiosity and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. His diverse interests and academic achievements would lay the foundation for a career that would make him one of the most influential legal scholars of his generation. From his immigrant roots in Brooklyn to his studies at Oxford and Yale, Epstein's journey is a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and intellectual curiosity.\n\nAcademic career\n\nRichard Epstein's academic career is nothing short of impressive. He started as an assistant professor at the USC Gould School of Law, where he honed his skills as a legal scholar for four years before moving to the University of Chicago Law School in 1972. At Chicago, Epstein spent an astounding 38 years teaching law, and he eventually became the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law.\n\nEpstein may have retired from Chicago in 2010, but he did not stop his academic pursuits there. He quickly joined the faculty of the New York University School of Law as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law. Currently, he remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, occasionally teaching courses there. His academic brilliance is not just limited to teaching as in 2013, NYU Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.\n\nIn addition to his teaching career, Epstein has also been affiliated with several academic and public organizations, showcasing his vast knowledge and experience in his field. For instance, he served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a renowned American public policy think tank at Stanford University, since 2001.\n\nEpstein has also received several awards throughout his career, highlighting his exceptional contribution to the field of law. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985 and was the editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, as well as the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001.\n\nFurthermore, Epstein has received numerous honorary degrees, with the most recent being an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Siegen in 2018. He also received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent in 2003. In 2005, he was awarded the Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize by the College of William & Mary for his contributions to the field of property rights. In 2011, he was the recipient of the Bradley Prize, awarded by the Bradley Foundation, for his outstanding achievements in the field of law.\n\nRichard Epstein's academic career is a testament to his passion for law and his dedication to scholarly pursuits. His many achievements in the field have cemented his status as a legal luminary, and his contributions will undoubtedly continue to inspire future generations of legal scholars.\n\nWritings\n\nRichard Epstein is an American legal scholar known for his writings on property rights, eminent domain, and minimal legal regulation. His book 'Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain' published in 1985, was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution. In the book, Epstein argued that the clause gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights and requires the government to be regarded the same as any other private entity in a property dispute. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property and has influenced how some courts view property rights.\n\nEpstein's views on the HIV pandemic in 1988 were also controversial, as he argued that companies ought to be able to discriminate against \"AIDS carriers\" and that anti-discrimination laws were unfair to employers. He proposed that \"AIDS carriers\" ought to have their health insurance premiums subsidized via taxation so as to \"discipline the behavior of government and interests groups, here by requiring citizens to make choices about how much they individually are prepared to pay to subsidize AIDS carriers.\" Furthermore, he argued that employers have the right to refuse to hire suspected \"AIDS carriers.\"\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation and believes that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. In his 1995 book 'Simple Rules for a Complex World', he consolidates much of his previous work and argues that complex rules are justifiable if they can be opted out of. He believes that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation ought to be repealed, stating that such legislation creates unnecessary complexity and costs.\n\nEpstein has also written about same-sex marriage, advocating for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and criticizing the Supreme Court ruling in 'Obergefell v. Hodges'. He argues that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage should be repealed as only the state may issue marriage licenses and the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors.\n\nEpstein's ideas have influenced legal thinking and have been cited by the US Supreme Court four times. His arguments have been controversial and have sparked a great deal of debate and discussion. Epstein's writings are known for their clarity and their ability to engage readers in complex legal and philosophical debates.\n\nInfluence\n\nIn the world of legal scholarship, there are few figures as influential as Richard Epstein. Over the course of his long and distinguished career, Epstein has managed to shape the way we think about some of the most complex legal issues of our time. From constitutional law to property rights, Epstein's insights have helped to shape the very fabric of our legal system.\n\nWhat makes Epstein's influence so remarkable is the breadth and depth of his reach. According to one study, he is the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. That's an incredible achievement by any measure, and it speaks to the enormous impact that Epstein has had on his field. But it's not just the number of citations that sets Epstein apart. It's the quality of his work, and the clarity of his ideas, that have made him such a respected figure.\n\nOne of the things that sets Epstein apart from other legal scholars is his ability to communicate complex ideas in a way that is accessible to everyone. Whether he is writing for a specialized legal audience or speaking to a general audience, Epstein has a way of breaking down complex legal concepts and making them understandable to everyone. It's a rare talent, and it's one that has helped to make Epstein one of the most influential legal thinkers of our time.\n\nAnother key factor in Epstein's success is his ability to inspire others. Over the years, he has mentored some of the most successful lawyers and judges in the country. His former students include a number of prominent judges, lawyers, and law professors, all of whom credit Epstein with helping to shape their careers. That kind of influence is hard to quantify, but it speaks to the profound impact that Epstein has had on the legal community.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing about Epstein is his sheer versatility. He has written about everything from constitutional law to property rights, and his insights have been applied to a wide range of legal issues. In a world where specialization is increasingly the norm, Epstein's ability to move seamlessly between different areas of the law is a rare and valuable skill.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees with Epstein's ideas. He has been a controversial figure at times, and his views on certain issues have been criticized by some. But even his critics would have to concede that Epstein has made a significant contribution to legal scholarship over the years.\n\nIn the end, what makes Richard Epstein such a remarkable figure is his ability to think deeply and creatively about some of the most complex legal issues of our time. His influence has been felt far and wide, and his ideas will continue to shape the way we think about the law for years to come. Whether you agree with him or not, there is no denying the impact that Epstein has had on the legal world.\n\nPolitics\n\nRichard Epstein is a legal scholar and commentator who has carved out a unique voice in the world of American politics. A self-proclaimed \u201clibertarian conservative,\u201d Epstein has never been afraid to criticize both the left and the right when he feels they are abandoning their principles.\n\nOne of Epstein's most noteworthy stances is his rejection of both the Democratic and Republican parties. He sees them as \u201cjust two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors.\u201d When it comes to voting, Epstein prefers the Libertarian party, which he feels better aligns with his small-government philosophy.\n\nEpstein is a firm believer in limited government and individual liberty. He has praised former President Calvin Coolidge for his small-government approach, though he also acknowledges that Coolidge made mistakes. Epstein\u2019s views on the role of government have made him a strong critic of both liberal and conservative policies.\n\nEpstein's commitment to individual liberty has also led him to be involved in discussions of detainee treatment. He served on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force, which studied how the US treats detainees. Epstein believes that individual liberty is a fundamental right, and that this should be balanced with the need for national security. In his view, the government has often overreached in its efforts to protect the country, infringing on the rights of individuals in the process.\n\nDespite his libertarian leanings, Epstein is not opposed to all forms of government intervention. He has argued, for example, that there is a role for the government in protecting the environment. However, he also believes that the government should be cautious about regulating businesses, as over-regulation can stifle innovation and economic growth.\n\nEpstein is a maverick voice in American politics. He does not fit neatly into any one political box, and his willingness to challenge the status quo has earned him both praise and criticism. He is not afraid to speak his mind, even when it means going against the conventional wisdom. His views on limited government and individual liberty have made him an important figure in American politics, and his commitment to these principles will likely continue to shape the conversation for years to come.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRichard Epstein is a legal scholar whose brilliance is matched only by his humility. While he may be a giant in the world of legal academia, he is surprisingly down-to-earth in his personal life. Epstein's wife, Eileen W. Epstein, is a respected fundraiser and educator who is a board member of the American Jewish World Service, a philanthropic organization dedicated to improving the lives of people in developing countries. Together, they have raised three children: two sons, Benjamin M. and Elliot, and a daughter, Melissa.\n\nDespite being raised in the Jewish faith and having a bar mitzvah, Epstein describes himself as a \"rather weak, non-practicing Jew.\" This is not uncommon in modern society, where people often have a tenuous connection to their religious roots. But it is a testament to Epstein's honesty that he admits his own ambivalence toward his faith.\n\nInterestingly, Epstein is also related to the famous comedian and actor, Paul Reiser. This familial connection may seem like a small detail, but it underscores the idea that even great minds like Epstein's are part of a larger tapestry of humanity.\n\nOverall, Epstein's personal life may not be the stuff of tabloid headlines, but it is a reflection of the complexities and contradictions of the human experience. In his professional life, Epstein is known for his sharp intellect and incisive legal analysis. But in his personal life, he is a loving husband and father who grapples with the same questions and challenges as the rest of us. And perhaps that is what makes him so relatable and so respected.\n\nSelected works\n\nRichard A. Epstein is an American legal scholar who has written extensively on topics ranging from law and economics to constitutional law, and his works have been influential in shaping legal thought in the United States. In this retrospective, we will take a closer look at some of his most notable works, both books, and journal articles, that have shaped legal scholarship in the past half-century.\n\nOne of Epstein's earliest works is his 1973 article \"A Theory of Strict Liability,\" which appeared in the Journal of Legal Studies. In this piece, Epstein argues that the traditional approach to tort law, which requires plaintiffs to prove negligence on the part of the defendant, is misguided. Instead, Epstein advocates for a strict liability regime that would make defendants liable for any harm they cause, regardless of whether they were negligent. He argues that this approach would lead to more efficient outcomes, as it would encourage defendants to take greater precautions to avoid causing harm.\n\nIn his 1975 article \"Unconscionability: A Critical Reappraisal,\" which appeared in the Journal of Law and Economics, Epstein takes on the doctrine of unconscionability in contract law. He argues that this doctrine is overbroad and should be replaced with a more limited set of defenses that protect parties from fraud, duress, and mistake. He argues that the current approach to unconscionability leads to uncertainty and unpredictability in contract law, which ultimately harms both parties.\n\nEpstein's 1979 article \"Nuisance Law: Corrective Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints,\" which appeared in the Journal of Legal Studies, is another important contribution to legal scholarship. In this article, Epstein argues that the traditional approach to nuisance law, which relies on the concept of \"corrective justice\" to determine liability, is flawed. He suggests that a utilitarian approach, which weighs the costs and benefits of different courses of action, would lead to more efficient outcomes. He argues that the corrective justice approach is overly focused on the individual harm suffered by the plaintiff, while the utilitarian approach takes into account the broader social costs and benefits of different outcomes.\n\nIn his 1983 article \"A Common Law for Labor Relations: A Critique of the New Deal Labor Legislation,\" which appeared in the Yale Law Journal, Epstein takes on the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which he argues is deeply flawed. He argues that the Act has been a failure, as it has led to increased conflict between employers and employees, rather than promoting cooperation. Epstein suggests that the common law approach to labor relations, which emphasizes individual bargaining and voluntary contracts, would be a more effective way to promote labor peace and prosperity.\n\nIn his 1984 article \"In Defense of the Contract at Will,\" which appeared in the University of Chicago Law Review, Epstein defends the concept of employment at will, which allows employers to terminate employees for any reason or no reason at all. He argues that this approach is essential to the efficient operation of labor markets, as it allows employers to make quick and flexible hiring and firing decisions. He also argues that efforts to restrict employment at will through legislation or court decisions are misguided and ultimately harm employees by reducing job opportunities and increasing the cost of labor.\n\nEpstein's 1987 article \"The Proper Scope of the Commerce Power,\" which appeared in the Virginia Law Review, is another important contribution to legal scholarship. In this article, Epstein argues that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce between the states, has been interpreted too broadly by the courts. He suggests that a narrower interpretation of the Commerce Clause would better protect individual rights and limit federal power. He argues that the current approach to the Commerce Clause has allowed the federal government to expand its power in ways that were"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/richard.epstein/3741609", "page_content": "Richard Epstein\n\nlaw professor author\n\nApril 17, 1943 Brooklyn, New York, United States\n\nIn 1969 Richard was admitted to the State Bar of California.
