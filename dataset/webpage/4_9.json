That total compensation included a bonus of $10,611,113, which included distributions over a \u201cthree-year bonus cycle based on long-term objectives achieved over 2014, 2015 and 2016,\u201d according to a PGA Tour spokeswoman.

That prize money figure did not include the majors.\n\nIn 2016, Finchem was paid $4.47 million, which included a base salary of $1.19 million and bonus pay of $3 million. He received another $4.7 million from related organizations, according to tax records. His total compensation from the Tour was $3.99 million in 2015, including bonus pay of $2.7 million. He received another $2 million from related organizations that year.\n\nThe former commissioner was by far the highest-paid person listed on the Tour\u2019s tax filings for 2017. Current commissioner Jay Monahan received total compensation of $4.78 million that included a base salary of $998,077 plus bonus and incentive pay of $2.8 million.\n\nOutside of Finchem and Monahan, there were 14 others among the Tour\u2019s officers and highest paid employees who made more than $1 million in 2017. Thomas E. Wade, the PGA Tour\u2019s chief commercial officer, received $3.1 million, according to the tax records.\n\nPlayers who earned the most prize money were listed as independent contractors. Justin Thomas, the season\u2019s FedEx Cup winner, led the way in 2017 with $17.1 million followed by Jordan Spieth ($11.8 million) and Dustin Johnson ($10.5 million).\n\nWorth W. Calfee, who is the former president of the Web.com Tour, received $1.5 million in compensation, which included a bonus of $784,293.\n\nThe PGA Tour has non-profit status that lawmakers have unsuccessfully challenged in the past. To compare the Tour to other pro sports, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made $31.7 million in 2015, the last year for which his salary was reported.\n\nIn 2017, the Tour paid $28.9 million in compensation to current officers, directors, trustees and key employees, compared to $20.5 million in 2016.\n\nTotal revenue increased to $1.47 billion, up by about 15 percent over the previous year. Total expenses also grew to $1.41 billion compared to $1.2 billion the previous year. The Tour says its organization and its tournaments generated more than $180 million in charitable donations in 2017.\n\nIn revenue, the Tour reported $458 million in TV rights, up from $433 million in 2016.

Finchem received his degree of law from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. He had a paper route and used to perform other off jobs.\n\nRather than spending his money on purchasing candy and other small toys, Finchem was interested since childhood to play golf. So he used to spend his money only on playing golf. Finchem was brought by Harold (father) who was a career marine and used to permit his 8 years old young child to play golf with his buddies.

Finchem remained the president of the television broadcasting deals for at least three years in 1997, 2001, and 2005. Back in 2006, Finchem helped the PGA tour to meet the hike from $56.4 million in 1994 to $256.8 million in 2006. It was one of the most remarkable growth of the organization which had a lot of things to do with the golf player Tiger Woods, as he also received the credit for the same.\n\nTim Finchem Biography Real Name Timothy W.

That much is assured, because Tim Finchem is not hesitant to use the \u201cretirement\u201d word.\n\nAs for when the \u201cR\u201d business officially starts \u2026 well, Finchem wasn\u2019t about to announce it. \u201cMore on that later,\u201d is all that he would say, though he did talk quite a bit Tuesday about his tenure, which began June 1, 1994, and will come to a close either later this year or early in 2017 when Jay Monahan succeeds him as just the fourth commissioner in PGA Tour history.\n\n\u201cNot being able to walk in my office and ask me how to do something,\u201d Finchem quipped, when asked what the biggest challenge Monahan, presently the deputy commissioner, will face.\n\nGood humor on a light-hearted day, because Finchem, 69, clearly is not sliding into retirement unwillingly. Golf is not only his job but his passion in life, and now is the time to split his time differently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to reverse the ratio of practicing golf and playing golf,\u201d Finchem said \u201cI get a fair amount of practice in. I don\u2019t get to play very much.\u201d\n\nMostly, he cited an incentive that is heard often by those putting work behind them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the focus on my kids,\u201d he said. \u201cMy kids are all in their 20s. They didn\u2019t see much of me. They grew up with me being on the road all the time. So more time with them and (wife) Holly. So those things are natural.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a far different landscape that Finchem is leaving when compared with his arrival \u2014 purses in 1994 totaled $56 million, and in 2015-16 they will approach $320 million \u2014 he brushed aside questions about his legacy.\n\n\u201cWhen you use the word \u2018legacy,\u2019 I think you have to stick with Deane Beman (the PGA Tour\u2019s second commissioner and Finchem\u2019s predecessor). Deane Beman left a legacy,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cWhen Deane Beman became commissioner in \u201974, the net worth of the PGA Tour was $150,000.\u201d\n\nToday, there would be a longer string of zeroes after the \u201915,\u2019 but Finchem didn\u2019t focus on that aspect of his job. Instead, he said simply that the two things he is most proud of are:\n\n1. \u201cThe relationship our team has had with players.\u201d\n\n2. That he is surrounded by \u201ca really great team.\u201d\n\nFinchem joined the PGA Tour in 1987 and held titles of chief operating officer, vice president of business affairs, and deputy commissioner. He will step aside just as the game continues to grow globally and adjust to an ever-changing television landscape. Those points seemed to excite him, and Finchem contends that the \u201cnext 25 years will be awesome.\u201d Although he still will be involved with The First Tee program and the World Golf Foundation and likely consult on some PGA Tour matters, Finchem is quite prepared for retirement. Further, he\u2019s adamant that Monahan is the right man and that the environment helps, too.\n\n\u201cI honestly think the biggest challenge is taking advantage of the opportunities,\u201d Finchem said."}, {"url": "https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/tim-finchem/", "page_content": "When Tim Finchem retired in 2017 after 22 years as PGA TOUR commissioner, he had transformed the game and its relationship with fans on the course, watching on TV, watching on portable devices, and, yes, the computer at the office for the diehards who want to watch golf play from sunrise to sunset.\n\nHe introduced the FedEx Cup Playoffs, offering the sport a greater sense of an actual season. The Presidents Cup gave the sport another great international competition. And the World Golf Championships created greater opportunities for international golfers to compete together beyond the majors. And the 1997 rights deal he negotiated changed the relationship between TV and golf forever as it required every round of every tournament be carried on TV.\n\n\u201cThe most impressive thing about Tim is he was a remarkable consensus builder,\u201d says Sean McManus, CBS Sports, chairman. \u201cHis relationships with the players, with the tournaments, with the sponsors, and TV networks were all first rate where everyone felt like they were getting full value.\u201d\n\nHe also spearheaded efforts to coordinate the bid for golf\u2019s return to the Olympics, which became a reality in the 2016 Games after a 112-year absence and gave NBC a chance to bring one of its most important rest-of-the-year properties to its Olympic programming schedule.\n\n\u201cTim Finchem super-charged the PGA TOUR during his tenure as commissioner by adding World Golf Championships, the Presidents Cup, and the FedEx Playoffs,\u201d says Molly Solomon, executive producer/president, NBC Olympics Production, and executive producer, Golf Channel. \u201cWhat the PGA TOUR looks like today is due in large part to his big ideas and creative leadership.\u201d\n\nAdds Tommy Roy, NBC Sports, lead golf producer, credits Finchem with allowing NBC to have more than a dozen cameras on the island green for THE PLAYERS Championship, allowing the network to capture shots from almost any angle.\n\n\u201cHe gave us the ability to put a camera six feet away from Tiger Woods when he was about to execute a magical, game winning shot,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd he also gave us the ability to put microphones three feet away from Phil Mickelson and [caddie] Bones when they were discussing the execution of a great shot.\u201d\n\nSports Broadcasting Hall of Famer Dick Ebersol says he was lucky enough to have a front row seat to Finchem\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cTim built the PGA Tour into one of the most important franchises in all of American TV sports,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, he helped oversee First Tee\u2019s growth into a great youth-development organization, reaching more than 15 million youngsters (during his tenure as commissioner, the PGA TOUR and its tournaments raised more than $2 billion in charitable contributions).\n\n\u201cTim Finchem\u2019s vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\u201d said Jay Monahan, PGA TOUR commissioner and World Golf Foundation board chairman, when Finchem was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame last year. \u201cHis enshrinement in the World Golf Hall of Fame will forever stand as a testament to his tireless dedication and contributions, but, more important, so will the countless lives \u2014 whether those are the players on the PGA TOUR and beyond, millions of First Tee participants, or charitable organizations around the world \u2014 impacted by his life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nFinchem became commissioner in 1994 when then-Commissioner Deane Beman, just 55 years old, retired to resume his playing career, this time as a member of the then-Senior PGA TOUR.\n\n\u201cMy history is one of just being in the right place at the right time,\u201d says Finchem. \u201cSo much of where you\u2019re headed is based on the individuals that you\u2019re interfacing with.\u201d\n\nFor example, prior to joining the PGA TOUR, Finchem was in the Jimmy Carter Administration, working with the president and his staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a great run with regard to being around people who are extremely successful and thoughtful and committed to making this place a better place to live,\u201d he says. \u201cI look back at all those people I met and the players that I interfaced with, and I was very, very fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d One example: he became commissioner only a few weeks before a player named Tiger Woods turned professional.\n\nAnd the beginning of the Woods era and the beginning of Finchem\u2019s tenure as commissioner coincided with a time when some of the greats of the game had retired but were still an active part of the PGA efforts.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d Finchem says, \u201cbecause I came into the PGA TOUR at a time when I had the opportunity to meet Sam Snead and Byron Nelson and all these great players and spend a fair amount of time with them. In some ways, many of those players were similar to working with the president because of their knowledge of the sport, their intensity about transferring that information to fans and to people like myself.\u201d\n\nFinchem always had a passion for golf and freely admits to using his paper-route money to support his golf habit.\n\n\u201cMy dad was in the Marine Corps for 30 years, and I started playing golf when I was 8 or 10,\u201d he says. \u201cHe took me to the Azalea Open in North Carolina; Arnold Palmer won, and I was mesmerized by him. Years later, I\u2019d call him up from time to time and say, Take me through one of your wins. He\u2019d say, Which one? and I\u2019d tell him that one.\u201d\n\nAlthough nearly half his adult life has been spent at the PGA TOUR, Finchem didn\u2019t set out to work in sports administration. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship and graduated in 1969, then received his law degree from Virginia four years later. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the Carter White House as deputy advisor to the president in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979.\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s leadership was invaluable for the growth of the game,\u201d says Sports Broadcasting Hall of Famer and CBS Sports Lead Play-by-Play Announcer Jim Nantz. \u201cHis thoughtful decision-making helped the PGA TOUR soar to incredible heights. He led his global partners in promoting and implementing a World Golf Championship series, and, here at home, he brought life to the PGA TOUR\u2019s end of the season. Lastly, Tim saw the value of nurturing and respecting his television relationships. He has been viewed by all as a great partner.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/29070837/tim-finchem-former-pga-tour-commissioner-elected-world-golf-hall-fame", "page_content": "Tim Finchem, who expanded the PGA Tour's footprint around the world and negotiated TV contracts that more than tripled prize money during his two decades as commissioner, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nFinchem was elected through the contributor category and will become the 10th administrator to be inducted, joining predecessor Deane Beman. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, also was elected as a contributor.\n\nFinchem was PGA Tour commissioner when the World Golf Hall of Fame opened in 1998 in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n\"One of the great things about that is to get know the inductees who I didn't know in other aspects of my job,'' Finchem said Monday. \"It's a tremendous list of people. To be included in that group is very powerful. I want to thank those who thought I was deserving of it. In many ways, I didn't feel I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long.''\n\nFinchem found it fitting that he joins the induction class of 2021 with Tiger Woods, whom he first saw at a college tournament his first year as commissioner in 1994. Later that year, Finchem noticed players finishing up their rounds at the World Series of Golf at Firestone and watching an 18-year-old Woods win the first of three straight U.S. Amateurs.\n\nWoods was elected through the male player category a month ago. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, was elected as a contributor.\n\n\"It is the greatest honor to be elected to join golf's most legendary players and contributors in the World Golf Hall of Fame,\" Finchem said. \"I am especially proud to stand alongside one of the world's all-time greats, Tiger Woods, in the Class of 2021 and look forward to what will be an exciting year ahead.\"\n\nWoods joined the PGA Tour in 1996 after two years at Stanford and brought enormous attention to himself and to the tour. Along with winning twice in seven starts, Woods won the Masters in his first attempt as a pro by setting 20 records, including a 12-shot victory that set off the first wave of \"Tigermania.''\n\nFinchem seized on it.\n\nHe was in the middle of negotiating a new network television contract, and prize money spiked. More deals followed in 2001, 2006 and 2012. PGA Tour prize money went from under $100 million on three tours in 1994 when Finchem was appointed commissioner to more than $400 million over six tours when he retired at the end of 2016.\n\nFormer PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, left, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame. He'll be part of a 2021 class that will also include Tiger Woods. AP Photo/Phil Long\n\nFinchem laughed Monday when asked what his job would have been like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\"It would have been a much more difficult job,'' he said. \"Tiger coming on the scene ... took our sport to another level. It continues on today. As a sport, we were blessed he didn't like tennis.''\n\nIt wasn't just money, however.\n\nFinchem created The First Tee program shortly after Woods won the Masters. Turning back Greg Norman's proposal for a world tour, Finchem came up with the World Golf Championships series in 1999 that led to three events for players from the leading six tours around the world. He also took advantage of a growing class of international players from outside Europe -- Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh among those -- by starting the Presidents Cup in 1994.\n\nAt the heart of Finchem's work was making the PGA Tour logo recognizable around the world, a symbol of strength.\n\nThe PGA Tour had a development circuit (now called the Korn Ferry Tour) and a senior tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) for players 50 and older. Now it has circuits in Canada (Mackenzie Tour), Latin America and China.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" said Jay Monahan, whom Finchem groomed as his successor.\n\nMonahan delivered the news to Finchem during The Players Championship, two days before golf joined so many other sports in shutting down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome of Finchem's best work came during tough times. He kept the PGA Tour fully sponsored during the recession in 2008 and, as a show of strength, kept prize money from shrinking.\n\nThe Hall of Fame is expected to announce a fourth inductee later this week."}, {"url": "https://golf.com/news/phil-mickelson-questions-best-guess-answers/", "page_content": "15 pressing Phil Mickelson questions, and our best-guess answers\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare by Email\n\nPhil Mickelson has been in the shadows. When will he reemerge? getty images\n\nThis is a special edition of Lefty-Righty, in which your right-handed correspondent answers a host of questions about the world\u2019s most famous left-handed golfer, Phil Mickelson. The questions are the author\u2019s, and the responses are nothing more than his best-guess answers based on reporting, idle chat and tea-leaf reading.\n\nQ1. Did the PGA Tour suspend Phil?\n\nA. Short answer: My opinion is, yes, the Tour did.\n\nBut there\u2019s a longer answer.\n\nOn Feb. 17, Alan Shipnuck, author of a new biography of Mickelson, reported incendiary comments that Mickelson made to the writer. The comments themselves were made last November, as Mickelson talked about his interest in LIV Golf, a Saudi-funded golf company run by Greg Norman. LIV Golf was then seeking to start an ambitious world golf tour with massive payouts that would feature, its organizers hoped, the game\u2019s biggest names.\n\nYou likely have heard that Mickelson described certain members of the Saudi ruling class as \u201cscary mother\u2014-ers.\u201d That would be an example of speaking truth to power. That comment would certainly not get Mickelson suspended by the PGA Tour, and likely not even fined. That remark was bad for Greg Norman and LIV, which meant it was actually good for Jay Monahan, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, and the PGA Tour.\n\nThen there is this comment that Mickelson made to Shipnuck, regarding PGA Tour officials:\n\n\u201cThey are sitting on an $800 million cash stockpile. How do you think they\u2019re funding the PIP? Or investing $200 million in the European Tour? The Tour is supposed to be a nonprofit that distributes money to charity. How the f\u2014 is it legal for them to have that much cash on hand? The answer is, it\u2019s not. But they always want more and more. They have to control everything.\u201d\n\nThat comment would likely result in a fine for Mickelson, for degrading the PGA Tour while being a member of the Tour. By long tradition, Tour members are supposed to support the Tour. But those are not comments that would get you suspended.\n\nThen there is this seemingly less explosive sentence, written by Shipnuck and containing just one two-word quote from Mickelson:\n\n\u201cMickelson told me he had enlisted three other \u2018top players\u2019 he declined to name and that they paid for attorneys to write the [LIV Golf] operating agreement, codifying that the players would have control of all the details.\u201c\n\nNow that surely gets you suspended. Not the sentence. The details and the actions behind it. Those actions are acts of rebellion and disloyalty and actions of rebellion and disloyalty could get you a long suspension, if not worse. LIV\u2019s success could come at the expense of hundreds of current and future PGA Tour players. By that logic, any supporter, founder, backer or organizer of LIV Golf would be the sworn enemy of the PGA Tour, and by extension its supporters. That\u2019s why Fred Ridley, the Augusta National chairman, has been unwilling to even talk to Greg Norman about LIV Golf and its plans. This is war. In war, you take sides.\n\nThe obvious implication is that Mickelson, as a member of the Tour, was doing work, including recruitment, that would undermine the basic health of the Tour. No organization would tolerate such acts. You could get suspended for life for that. The two sides could have lawyered this out for months but that would not have served either side. More likely, it went like this:\n\nPGA Tour official:\n\nThis was an act of conspiracy that undermines the PGA Tour. We are going to conduct an investigation and are considering a lifetime ban.\n\nMickelson representative:\n\nWe get it, we get it \u2014 this time you\u2019re really mad. Phil will take a leave and he won\u2019t come back until you guys say it\u2019s OK to do so.\n\nOn Feb. 22, only five days after Shipnuck made Mickelson\u2019s November comments public, Mickelson said this in a written statement on social media, white lettering, black background:\n\n\u201cI know I have not been my best and I desperately need some time away to prioritize the ones I love the most and work being the man I want to be.\u201d\n\nYou can read that as a leave. Or as, I\u2019m suspending myself before you do it for me.\n\nYes, a long answer. For all intents and purposes, as I read the tea leaves, Mickelson is suspended.\n\nQ2. Could Mickelson have played in the Masters?\n\nA. No.\n\nLet\u2019s say I\u2019m correct, that in the PGA Tour\u2019s view, Mickelson is suspended. Fred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, is always going to back the PGA Tour, just as the PGA Tour has always backed the Masters and Augusta National. Ridley is always going to put institutional needs ahead of any individual player\u2019s needs. The PGA Tour is going to do the same for Augusta, and has.\n\nFor instance, Masters earnings and victories were official in the PGA Tour books even in the years when Augusta National had no women members, in violation of PGA Tour requirements for nondiscriminatory practices for its venues. The Tour said the Masters was an invitational and a private club event. In other words, it created a semantical loophole.\n\nIt was not surprising that shortly after Tim Finchem retired as PGA Tour commissioner in 2016 he became a member of Augusta National. In the wake of the LIV and Mickelson news, Finchem\u2019s successor, Jay Monahan, said that the PGA Tour is about \u201clegacy, not leverage,\u201d the latter a word he borrowed from Mickelson, only to mock it.\n\nYou probably know the phrase \u201ccircling the wagons.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of that going around.\n\nQ3. Could Mickelson show up at the Tuesday-night Champions Dinner?\n\nA. Stranger things have happened.\n\nQ4. Will Mickelson play in the PGA Championship in mid-May at Southern Hills, the tournament he won last year at age 50?\n\nA. Highly unlikely. The PGA of America, like Augusta National, will back the PGA Tour. Best guess here is that Mickelson will not resurface on Tour until he repudiates all involvement with Greg Norman\u2019s LIV series of eight invitational events, backed by an enormous Saudi investment fund. And Mickelson is unlikely to do that.\n\nNorman, by the way, has said LIV had to reconfigure its world golf tour plans for 2022 after Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau announced their loyalty to the PGA Tour.\n\nQ5. Isn\u2019t Rahm, like Mickelson, represented by Steve Loy?\n\nA. He is.\n\nQ6. Isn\u2019t that awkward for Loy?\n\nA. It\u2019s not tea at Tiffany\u2019s.\n\nQ7. So of the eight, big-bucks announced LIV events, how many do you think Rahm will play?\n\nA. Zero.\n\nQ8. How many do you think Mickelson will play?\n\nA. Eight.\n\nQ9. Really? Why would Mickelson still want to be aligned with that tour after the nasty things he has said about the Saudis?\n\nA. Follow the money. Mickelson has lost huge amounts of income when he was dropped, temporarily or otherwise, by Callaway, KPMG, American Express and Workday. He can make a large sum over the course of 2022 with the LIV league \u2014 $10 million would be a conservative estimate. He leads an expensive life, even if he doesn\u2019t have his own jet anymore.\n\nQ10. Right, right. Also, there\u2019s got to be collateral damage in this whole thing, right?\n\nA. I assume you are thinking about Phil\u2019s brother and caddie, Tim Mickelson. Yes, Phil needs to play for Tim to caddie. Another reason to think Mickelson will play these eight LIV events.\n\nQ11. Even the LIV event at the Trump course in New Jersey?\n\nA. You mean Trump Bedminster, the course where the PGA was supposed to be in May? That one might give him some pause. Or not.\n\nQ12. Will Mickelson play in the 2022 U.S. Open?\n\nA. It is hard to imagine Phil not playing in the U.S. Open, the missing piece in his quest for the career grand slam. If he could somehow recapture the magic from last year\u2019s PGA, he could contend at Brookline. By its very nature \u2014 as an open event \u2014 it would be hard to keep Mickelson out of the field.\n\nQ13. How about the British Open in St. Andrews?\n\nA. I think he plays.\n\nQ14. Broadly, what is Phil\u2019s path back to being Phil again?\n\nA. Phil, over time, will double-down on being Phil. Great talker. An expert in golf, the NFL, talking trash, talking period, telling stories, living large, being Phil. He has an enormous fanbase. That base will always support him. He\u2019ll sell coffee. He\u2019ll talk on TV, or on his own YouTube channel. He\u2019ll have his own line of clubs, sunglasses. He\u2019ll ink a huge sponsorship deal with DraftKings or bet365. He\u2019ll be OK.\n\nQ15. Will Phil ever be a Ryder Cup captain?\n\nA. Only if he forsakes, disavows, etc., etc. Or if the balance of power in the game undergoes a sea change.\n\nMichael Bamberger welcomes your comments at Michael.Bamberger@Golf.com"}], "Jay Monahan succeeded Tim Finchem as Commissioner.": [{"url": "https://www.pgatour.com/pages/company/about-the-commissioner", "page_content": "JAY MONAHAN\n\nJay Monahan took office as the fourth commissioner of the PGA TOUR on January 1, 2017, having been appointed by the PGA TOUR Policy Board on November 7, 2016.

Ganzi, chairman of the Tour\u2019s Policy Board.\n\nMonahan always has been driven to achieve success. Upon taking over as the Tour\u2019s chief marketing officer, he described his aspirations to CMO.com in 2013: \u201cOne simple goal: to be the best sports marketing operation among any league or property,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means the best people, ideas and resources. If we achieve that, the business results will follow.\u201d\n\nMonahan is a man of thick New England heritage, having grown up in Belmont, a Boston suburb. It took a good deal to pull him away from a dream job with the Fenway Sports Group, which had allowed him to work daily with his beloved Boston Red Sox. But in 2008 he would be pried away, and only because a game he loves, and a special brand, came calling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I could leave the Red Sox for,\u201d Monahan, who played golf at Div. III Trinity College, told writer Jim McCabe in a 2014 interview with Golfweek, \u201cand that\u2019s golf.\u201d\n\nSo at Tour headquarters, the familiar face in the big office may change, but many of the challenges will not. Monahan will inherit an organization that is enjoying a significant amount of momentum. It has pretty much a fully sponsored tournament lineup, will play for $339 million in prize money in 2016-17 and is a highly tuned charitable-giving machine (crossing $2.3 billion total in the Tour\u2019s lifetime). Sure, there is much work ahead, but mainly Monahan and the team he assembles will be charged with keeping things speeding along.\n\n\u201cUnder Tim\u2019s leadership, the PGA Tour has made remarkable progress, even in the most difficult economic times,\u201d Monahan said in a statement released Monday evening. \u201cWe are now entering a very important time in our organization\u2019s history, and I know our executive team and I will draw upon and be inspired by the invaluable experience of working with Tim as we take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities, as well as face the challenges, that are ahead for the Tour.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Mark Steinberg, now a partner at Excel Sports Management and Tiger Woods\u2019 longtime agent, worked for IMG and convinced Deutsche Bank to come onboard to start a late-summer PGA Tour event outside Boston. One huge challenge: He needed just the right man to lead it. Monahan, who was director of global sponsorships at EMC, was handpicked by Steinberg to be that guy.\n\n\u201cJay really didn\u2019t have experience in running a golf tournament, but he wasn\u2019t necessarily the tournament director \u2026 we needed a face of Boston,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cWhen you can get that, which he was, and you get all the other benefits of just the type of businessman \u2013 the type of man \u2013 he is, it was a no-brainer for me. I had to do everything I could to get him.\u201d\n\nIn the tournament\u2019s first three years the fledgling Deutsche Bank Championship raised $4.5 million for its main charity, the Tiger Woods Foundation. The Tour thought so much of the event and how smoothly it was run that when it looked to start up the FedEx Cup in 2007, DBC became one of four playoff events.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Sternberg added of Monahan. \u201cHe became a friend over the years, somebody I grew to admire.\u201d\n\nMonahan was the first executive director of the Deutsche Bank Championship, which began in 2003, and after a stint with Fenway Sports he joined the PGA Tour in 2008 as executive director at The Players Championship. He has filled roles as senior vice-president of business development, chief marketing officer and, more recently, deputy commissioner and chief operating officer.\n\nMonahan was a four-year member of the golf team at Div. III Trinity College, where in 1993 he was an All-American. He received a masters degree in sports management from the University of Massachusetts in 1995. He and his wife, Susan, have two daughters.\n\nMonahan will officially take over as commissioner on Jan. 1, 2017, upon the retirement of Finchem.\n\nPeople who know Monahan marvel at his depth of quality relationships, his work ethic and his ability to get things done. Finchem\u2019s recommendation that Monahan succeed him carried considerable weight with the PGA Tour Policy Board. Monahan always was his five-tool player. When he would take over? That was always a little hazy. But in identifying Monahan as the one to succeed him, Finchem had no doubts.\n\n\u201cWhat was prime in my mind was that he was the guy,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cAnd the question became, what was the right time frame? We didn\u2019t even think that much about it for the first year, and then we started honing in on it. There are a variety of factors that led to the track that he currently was on.\n\n\u201cBut I knew it needed to be him.\u201d\n\nThere were other quality candidates. Why Monahan?\n\nSaid Finchem, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a negative moment in his day. I mean, he is a total glass-is-half-full individual, and I think you\u2019ll see that as we go forward. \u2026 Fifteen years from now, we will look back and say, \u2018Wow, look what the PGA Tour has done.\u2019 \u201d"}, {"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/tim-finchem-steps-down-jay-monahan-named-new-pga-tour-commissione-4363463/", "page_content": "Tim Finchem officially retires at the end of the year as PGA Tour commissioner, ending more than two decades during which he expanded the tour\u2019s footprint around the world and saw prize money grow to nearly $300 million.\n\nThe PGA Tour\u2019s board of directors accepted Finchem\u2019s resignation Monday and unanimously approved Jay Monahan as his replacement.\n\nMonahan, who has served as Finchem\u2019s deputy commissioner since April 2014, becomes the fourth commissioner on Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cI have the highest regard for Jay and have total confidence in his ability to lead the PGA Tour well into the future,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cHe has been a key member of the executive team since joining the tour and has worked closely with me on all business matters since becoming deputy commissioner. Jay is well respected throughout the PGA Tour family and the golf industry. I know he will do a tremendous job for the players and all constituents of the PGA Tour.\u201d\n\nNeither development was a surprise. Monday was the final quarterly meeting of the board this year, and Finchem had indicated he would not seek another extension.\n\nMonahan, 46, was executive vice president at Fenway Sports Group when he joined the PGA Tour in 2008, first as executive director of The Players Championship, and quickly moving his way through other business functions, including the key role of chief marketing officer. He was appointed chief operating officer earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with him closely now for a good period of time, and he\u2019s absolutely the right guy,\u201d Finchem said at the Tour Championship in September. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a negative moment in his day. He is a total glass-is-half-full individual, and I think you\u2019ll see that as we go forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinchem also was a deputy commissioner under Deane Beman when he was appointed in 1994, and he leaves behind a legacy of growth and new programs.\n\nTotal prize money in 1994 was $52.4 million for 40 official tournaments. As the 69-year-old Finchem retires, he leaves a fully sponsored schedule of 43 tournaments with prize money this season at just under $300 million. That doesn\u2019t include the four majors.\n\nFinchem used the arrival of Tiger Woods to negotiate massive television deals that drove prize money, and his finest work might have been the last one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe steered the tour through a severe economic downturn in 2009, keeping it fully sponsored with prize money slightly increasing. And with Woods on the sidelines coping with injuries and a scandal in his personal life, the tour negotiated a nine-year television contract through 2021.\n\n\u201cUnder Tim\u2019s leadership, the PGA Tour has made remarkable progress, even in the most difficult economic times,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cWe are now entering a very important time in our organization\u2019s history, and I know our executive team and I will draw upon and be inspired by the invaluable experience of working with Tim as we take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities, as well as face the challenges, that are ahead for the tour.\u201d\n\nThe first big challenge is likely to be the next television contract. Finchem and Monahan already have been meeting this summer with media executive to prepare for the next negotiations and figure out where advancements in media fit into the future.\n\nFinchem also used the arrival of Woods to launch The First Tee, an education program geared around golf.\n\nThe Presidents Cup began in his first year as commissioner, and he was behind the World Golf Championships that began in 1999 and have been played in America, Spain, Ireland, England, Australia and China. Another one is schedule for Mexico City next March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinchem also tried to provide structure to the sprawling golf season with the FedEx Cup, which pays $35 million in bonus money to the players and $10 million to the winner. He also emphasized the Web.com Tour as the pathway to the PGA Tour. That also led the tour to create satellite circuits in China, Canada and Latin America.\n\nMonahan comes from a rich New England golf heritage, playing at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He previously worked at EMC Corp. in branding and global sponsorships, then spent three years at IMG where he ran the Deutsche Bank Championship until leaving for Fenway Sports Management, and then the tour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJay has proven himself to be an outstanding leader who has developed an intimate knowledge and understanding of the PGA Tour and a clear vision for the future of the organization,\u201d board chairman Victor Ganzi said."}, {"url": "https://www.skysports.com/golf/news/12232/10649642/jay-monahan-will-become-pga-tour-commissioner-when-tim-finchem-retires-on-january-1", "page_content": "Jay Monahan will become PGA Tour commissioner when Tim Finchem retires on January 1\n\nJay Monahan will move up from his role as deputy commissioner\n\nJay Monahan will take over as PGA Tour commissioner on January 1, 2017, after Tim Finchem confirmed his decision to step down.\n\nFinchem's retirement had been expected for some time and the PGA Tour's policy board said current deputy Monahan had been unanimously approved as his replacement at a meeting on Monday.\n\nThe 69-year-old has overseen a major increase in tournament purses since he took over the role from Deane Beman in 1994, with the total prize money on offer for the 2016-17 season in excess of $300m (\u00a3242m).\n\nAnd he expects the tour to continue to grow under Monahan's leadership, saying: \"I have the highest regard for Jay and have total confidence in his ability to lead the PGA Tour well into the future\n\n\"He has been a key member of the executive team since joining the tour and has worked closely with me on all business matters since becoming deputy commissioner.\n\n\"Jay is well respected throughout the PGA Tour family and the golf industry.
