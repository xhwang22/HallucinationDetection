Steinhardt was the original violinist and vocalist on \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d and \u201cCarry on Wayward Son.\u201d Steinhardt, who was working on a solo album, was 71. The following interview with guitarist Rich Williams was conducted May 14, 2021.\n\nClassic rock bands have always experienced a revolving door of musicians. Kansas has seen its share of upheaval, but guitarist Rich Williams and drummer Phil Ehart have been with the band since its debut album. \u201cWe have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThings get tough, you stick with it.\u201d\n\nAfter years of false starts, the band signed with producer Don Kirshner\u2019s label and released Kansas in 1974. Its mix of progressive rock and symphonic arrangements with the work of violinist Robby Steinhardt produced the band\u2019s signature sound \u2014 a sound that has allowed the group to still maintain a steady presence today.\n\nThe band\u2019s breakout LP was 1976\u2019s Leftoverture, which featured the hit single \u201cCarry On Wayward Son.\u201d Point of Know Return followed in 1977. The success of the title track and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d secured the band\u2019s spot as a major arena headliner.\n\nIn July 2020, Kansas released its 16th studio album, The Absence of Presence. The album introduced the band\u2019s newest member, Tom Breslin, a vocalist who contributed music and lyrics.\n\nKansas in concert delivers performances that remain true to the original studio cuts. In 2016\u20132017 Kansas launched the Leftoverture 40th Anniversary Tour, which became the 2017 live album Leftoverture Live & Beyond. Kansas followed with its Point of Know Return Anniversary Tour. The band recorded every show and on May 28, 2021, released Point of Know Return Live & Beyond.\n\nClick here to pick up Point Of Know Return Live & Beyond on 2-CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pick up Point Of Know Return Live & Beyond on 3-LP/2-CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\n\u201cWe thought maybe one day we would release this,\u201d says Williams. \u201cAnd then with the pandemic, we figured, \u2018we have the time, let\u2019s put this together.\u2019\u201d\n\nRock Cellar talked with the guitarist shortly before the live album\u2019s release, and it was made evident that decades of success have not changed his intensity and work ethic.\n\nWilliams explains how the band\u2019s music \u2014 and members \u2014 evolved over more than four decades. It\u2019s an object lesson that every musician should read before putting pen to contract.\n\nRock Cellar: Why was Point of No Return the focus of the new live album?\n\nRich Williams: We had previously released the Leftoverture Live & Beyond album. To have a recording done in its entirety, in its original running order, it had never been done. Until this tour, we\u2019d never played all these songs ever. It also gave us the opportunity to go deeper into a lot of other albums. Like \u201cLonely Wind,\u201d we hadn\u2019t played it forever. If we played it, we didn\u2019t play it for long. To bring certain songs back from the dead was just smart to do.\n\nWe recorded every night from out front, so we probably had 100 shows taped. That process becomes a lot easier, it\u2019s almost like a studio at that point. You\u2019ve got everything mic\u2019d just right.\n\nRock Cellar: Kansas recently played its first live show in 14 months. What went into preparing for the show after such a long layoff?\n\nRich Williams: As far as the group, we showed up, we did the show. But fortunately we have the live album. And almost everything we\u2019re playing at the moment comes off of that album. So we just compiled the setlist and then a playlist and everybody just did their homework.\n\nFor the last two months I\u2019ve played that set twice a day. At home, I have the same setup as my live setup. So I can just stand there and go through all the motions of what I have to do and play along with the same guys, just through my studio speakers.\n\nThat\u2019s really what everybody did. We just continued doing the show. We had a real brief hotel room rehearsal the night before. And then we jumped on stage and did it. The weirdest part was walking out on stage. It\u2019s like another day. It didn\u2019t seem like that much time had passed. The lights went on and we did the show.\n\nWe were just glad to see each other. That part was exciting, but everybody was very prepared. There was a bit of adrenaline, some nerves, it\u2019s like, \u201chow\u2019s this going to go?\u201d Normally, if we\u2019re on the road, and we go three weeks without shows, one of us will put together a rehearsal. We probably won\u2019t do that anymore now because we know we can do it without that. It\u2019s six responsible guys that kept up on it.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you approach improvisation when performing live, especially on the best-known songs?\n\nRich Williams: For me, there are certain things I want to play not quite note-for-note, but I stick to the theme at least. There are other things I just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, \u201chere comes a part, what are you going to play?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Then I just start playing.\n\nI\u2019m just going to play in the moment, kind of the way I do it in the studio. I hate to over-rehearse. What moves me at the moment is what I usually tend to go for. There\u2019s been so many times where, in the studio, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to play here. Just roll the tape.\u201d\n\nFor example, in the song \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen\u201d on The Prelude Implicit, I had no idea what I was going to play in the solo. I just knew I wanted to get this big, out of control-kind of a sound. Usually, I record in the control room but for this I went out and had the amp right next to me, just crankin\u2019. I said, \u201cjust run it by, let me get a feel for this.\u201d\n\nSo it went by, I was just kind of holding on, I didn\u2019t know what I was gonna do exactly. And they said, \u201cyou\u2019re done.\u201d I said, \u201cwhat?\u201d That was great.\n\nI had no idea what I was doing whatsoever. I was just trying to get a feel for where the feedback points were and just get a general feel of it all. And it\u2019s one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever done. That\u2019s my approach to a lot of solos. \u201cI have no idea, here it comes.\u201d It\u2019s the shotgun approach. I just aim it in the general direction and pull the trigger and see what happens.\n\nKANSAS will be extending the popular Point of Know Return Tour starting with new shows starting November 13, 2021. Before that, the band will be performing sets of KANSAS Classics later this summer & early fall.

It\u2019s one thing to sit down and practice it but then you\u2019ve got the lights and the crowd and so many distractions. To keep a constant focus on what you\u2019re doing [can be tough], because if your mind wanders, you\u2019re in the weeds really quickly. It\u2019s mentally exhausting staying focused. But then on the other hand, there are some simpler songs that my mind will tend to wander and I will get lost. It\u2019s like, pay attention! It\u2019s funny how that works.\n\nMany bands of our era sit around and party before they go out and get half drunk and go out. We just have too much to do. There\u2019s no way to do that and go out there and play. It\u2019s too hard.\n\nRock Cellar: You\u2019ve said that the success of Leftoverture and Point of Know Return changed the internal workings of the band. What did you mean?\n\nRich Williams: When we first started, we were young men. It\u2019s not like we were from poor families, but leaving home, we all played in different bar bands, some together, some with other people, you\u2019re not successful in any way. People living in band houses, you have kind of an all-for-one, one-for-all, you\u2019re like pirates out on the open sea. It\u2019s teamwork. And it goes like that. And time goes on.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a complaint, it\u2019s an observation. It\u2019s just the way things go.\n\nThe way the money works with records, etc. is we did not sign a good deal with Don Kirshner. He was our benefactor, it was the only offer we got. Without him, nothing would have ever happened. But the first thing he did was say, \u201cI am a publisher. I want to publish or go somewhere else.\u201d So right away, we threw a third of the pie away. Another third of the pie is writer\u2019s royalties. And the last part of it is the royalties that the band would bank.\n\nThat part has to pay for every possible recording cost of everything. It takes a long time to pay off recording debts. So no money comes to the band. But the songwriters, and rightfully so, they get paid from the first record sold. They get money from that. So after Leftoverture went gold, we paid off all of our previous debt. The songwriters had already made a small fortune. That starts to change the dynamic.\n\nAt that point in the band, we\u2019re getting a little older, we\u2019ve been together for a while, people are buying houses, cars, getting married. So that all-for-one, one-for-all mentality has taken its natural course and starts to change the dynamic within the band.\n\nThen Point of Know Return, some people have made a lot of money and they don\u2019t want to work as much. Others are, \u201cI\u2019d like to get mine now.\u201d So things just changed. People were going from young, dumb guys to maturing a bit.\n\nAnd money does change people. So people will wander in all sorts of directions.\n\nThings just take their natural course. People naturally drifted apart because it wasn\u2019t really working anymore. But we\u2019re all good friends to this day. No animosity towards anybody through all of that.\n\nThat\u2019s just the dynamic of what happens within a band that\u2019s been around for a little while.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you maintain the classic Kansas sound despite so many personnel changes?\n\nRich Williams: For the first album, everyone was involved in arranging things, in editing things, saying this works, this doesn\u2019t work. Identifying what we\u2019re comfortable with, what parts we like, which parts we don\u2019t. My input is recognizing what fits within a quintessential Kansas part. Or what can we do to this to make it more Kansas-esque? I just have an ear for that.\n\nWe\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with people who have done it for quite a while with us, people who came in very familiar.\n\nWe know who we are and we know who we were and what we want to continue to be, so it\u2019s really not that difficult. Tom Breslin, the newest addition, brought in a lot of material and it wasn\u2019t difficult for us to turn this into what sounds like Kansas.\n\nRock Cellar: The title, The Absence of Presence, is a reference of modern technology?\n\nRich Williams: Yes, but it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. It tends to mean different things to different people. I like things that are ambiguous. The original concept of it was people are so out of touch with what\u2019s around because of the technology in their hand or what they\u2019re watching or computers, whatever.\n\nRock Cellar: The album continues the use of the band\u2019s trademark violin. Explain the violin\u2019s importance in the Kansas sound.\n\nRich Williams: We did a couple of albums, Steve Morse on guitar [Power and In the Spirit of Things], good albums but they sound like a different band. They just do. It is a signature sound, it does set us apart. I think it made us do something. What that is is the violinist needs something to do besides stand around and play fiddle parts. It changes my parts, it changes keyboard parts, because suddenly you find yourself in more of an orchestral sense.\n\nIt creates a more symphonic sound. If you take the violin away, all of a sudden the guitarist is just flashing, the keyboards are just playing away. You add that other dimension and suddenly you become more artistic in your approach.\n\nRock Cellar: You and Phil have been together since the first album. What\u2019s the secret of your longevity together?\n\nRich Williams: The top of the list would be tenacity. We grew up in the Midwest, family life. My dad met my mother in England during World War II. They married and remained married until their death. He had a job at a place called Baker Truck Rental before the war. He came back, Baker Truck Rental became Ryder Truck Rental. He remained with them until he retired. Phil\u2019s dad, he was a colonel in the Air Force. They travelled all over the world. His family life was very similar. He had one job, married until their death.\n\nWhat I learned was that sticking to a commitment is in my nature by birth and by example. We have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it. Things get tough, you stick with it. Things get good, you stick with it. I started at a certain age to take the next step: when something shitty happens, OK, fine, fuck it. Next step. I\u2019ve never quit anything. So that part isn\u2019t an effort. It\u2019s my nature.\n\nPeople ask, when are you going to retire, Rich? I go, what would you have me do? Play more golf? Stamp collecting? I\u2019ve got the best job on earth. And someone says, what do you do in your spare time? I practice. I\u2019ve got a guitar room with 30 guitars in it, a wall of amplifiers and my computer is all set up so I can prepare for the next show. That\u2019s what I do. And that\u2019s true for both of us.\n\nWe talked about it recently. It comes up once in awhile, after the pandemic especially. It\u2019s like, what do you think? Hey, I\u2019m in. Good, I\u2019m glad to hear that \u2019cause I am too. We will do this until we can\u2019t. Because we love to do it.\n\nRock Cellar: Let\u2019s do a Lightning Round. A Kansas song more people should have listened to.\n\nRich Williams: \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen.\u201d\n\nRock Cellar: What would be a great song for Kansas to cover?\n\nRich Williams: We have done some in the past. We did \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d with the London Symphony Orchestra. We did \u201cBringing It Back\u201d by J. J. Cale on the first album. A song that I always thought we\u2019d do great is \u201cSolsbury Hill\u201d by Peter Gabriel.\n\nRock Cellar: Favorite guitarist.\n\nRich Williams: Jeff Beck.\n\nRock Cellar: If you weren\u2019t in Kansas, what band, past or present, do you think you would have been a good fit for?\n\nRich Williams: AC/DC."}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/features/kansas-rich-williams-another-fork-in-the-road", "page_content": "One of America\u2019s preeminent progressive rock outfits, Kansas, are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year, with the band set to hit the road in June for an extensive tour. Kansas also recently released a three-CD, career-spanning collection titled Another Fork in the Road \u2013 50 Years of Kansas.\n\nGuitar World recently sat down with the band's longtime guitarist, Rich Williams, to discuss the guitars he connects with (and the ones he doesn't jive with), the making of Dust in the Wind, and the importance of keeping to a learning mindset.\n\nKansas\u2019 blending of violin, synths and guitars was a much more orchestral approach than the usual straightforward rock and roll format of many bands of the time. How did you approach arrangements in that context?\n\n\"With the violin, we didn\u2019t want it to be fiddle. We wanted it to be part of the sound. Robby [Steinhardt] would be playing a violin part and I'd be playing a harmony with him and maybe a synthesizer would be playing the third part of the harmony, too. So, we\u2019d be creating like a string section of sorts \u2013 as if we were writing it for an orchestra \u2013 but we were still bashing the crap out of it. So, it was that approach to orchestrating with a violin.\n\n\"Had we not had [just] one, we might not have done it that way and we would have sounded different. Jethro Tull was a good example of showing you that you could add a delicate instrument to a really cool band and make it work.\"\n\nThe interaction between those instruments really gave the music a harder edge. Was that something that evolved naturally or something that you purposely set out to do?\n\n\"Prior to Kansas, Dave Hope [bass], and I had played together previously in a band. And we were playing the rock hits of the days and because none of us were trained, we didn\u2019t understand a delicate approach to anything. Phil [Ehart] would beat the crap out of the drums, while Dave was an aggressive bass player and for me it was crank it up and play it aggressively! That was our approach to it.\n\n\"We had grown up with Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels and bands like that, American blue eyed soul rock and roll. So those were our roots. But the progressive movement coming out of Europe and England was very eye-opening to us. And what we learned from that was to think outside of the box.\"\n\nDuring the band\u2019s mid-1970s period, you mainly played a Gibson L6-S.\n\n\"The guitar was straight out the box, too. I did do a little work to it eventually where I moved the input jack to the bottom instead of the front, sort of vice-versa. I still had the six-way switch on it, and I think I might have added a tone control, too, where there was a switch. It's been that way for so long, and I still have it.\n\n\"Those guitars have such small necks. I had another one, too, but I didn\u2019t like it. Kerry [Livgren, Kansas's former singer/guitarist] tried one and he didn't like it either. The one I have has very large inlays \u2013 big square ones, the same as the size of the Les Pauls inlays. Instead of the round shape, the ones on mine are square though. I\u2019ve never seen another like it, so it might have been a prototype.\"\n\nDo you favor five-way switching on your guitars?\n\n\"Yes, I do, though I do have a PRS McCarty that has a three-way switch on it \u2013 I\u2019m more comfortable with a five-way on PRS guitars. I really like [five-way switches] because it\u2019s like going back to using the L6-S, but with the sound choices that are more like the Les Paul. Having said that, sometimes I do like the Les Paul better because of the ease of the switch.\"\n\nHave you ever tried switching over to a Strat?\n\n\"After the Gibson, I did buy a Strat, but I've never been a Strat guy. They\u2019re such a mystery to me. I\u2019d watch guys like Eric Johnson play a Strat and it's got such a beautiful sound, yet when I pick it up, it just sounds horrible! It truly was not designed for me, but I did use it on a few things.\n\n\"The Les Paul-style setup \u2013 from a PRS to a Les Paul to my Dean guitars, all of those, that's where I feel more at home.\"\n\n(Image credit: R. Diamond/Getty Images)\n\nYou have also played Dean guitars.\n\n\"After the L6-S, I started using Dean guitars. Prior to the L6-S, I was using an ES-335 but the band thought it was a cowboy guitar. And because we were not a cowboy band, they made me trade it for that L6-S. The L6-S was probably worth $500, while the ES-335 was probably worth $25,000! [laughs]\"\n\nYou first started using PRS guitars back in the 1980s, and you've played them ever since \u2013 what prompted the switch?\n\nWhen Paul Reed Smith was first getting started, I convinced him to put his pickups into my original series Dean Cadillac\u2026 Finally, one day Paul said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just get one of my guitars?\u2019\n\n\"When Paul Reed Smith was first getting started, I convinced him to put his pickups into my original series Dean Cadillac. So, I used that for a while. I had another red Dean which I had as a spare, yet never used it. Finally, one day Paul said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just get one of my guitars?\u2019, and so I did.\n\n\"I have the first year Dragon model, No. 36. My PRS is my go-to guitar. I also have two 2012 Les Pauls, the Lee Roy Parnell models with the classic pickups in them. I love those guitars.\"\n\nIn the early days of the band, you hardly used any effect pedals \u2013 it was mostly guitar into amp.\n\n\"Yes, that\u2019s correct. My guitar went into my 100-watt Marshall, which I still have today. I did incorporate a volume pedal at one point too because there were so many quick changes, I needed a quick volume change, too. I also had a Mu-Tron Phasor at one point, but apart from that, there were never any effects used in the early days at all \u2013 my guitar never went into any distortion boxes of any kind.\n\n\"Eventually, I started going into a Furman PL Plus Power Conditioner and slamming the front end of the Marshall, but it was so noisy. I could use it in the studio, but I couldn\u2019t use it in a live performance. For the past 10 years, I\u2019ve been playing with a Fractal Axe-Fx III \u2013 it was only [after I bought it] that I started getting into using more effects.\"\n\n(Image credit: Chris McKay/WireImage)\n\nHave you got a large guitar collection?\n\n\"I used to have a lot more, but an ex-wife made me get rid of a lot of them. I currently have about 40 guitars.\"\n\nI want to ask you about one of the band\u2019s signature songs, Dust in The Wind. Guitar-wise on that song, there are actually two differently tuned guitars \u2013 one in standard tuning and the other in Nashville tuning, correct?\n\n\"Yes, and with the Nashville tuning you usually need to replace the four lowest strings with thinner strings and tune them an octave higher. Now that\u2019s hard to do because you\u2019ll end up breaking five strings before you can get one to hold. Later, I started using a little Taylor three-quarter size guitar and found that I could get that string up there a lot easier.\n\n\"So, for Dust In The Wind, I double-tracked a Martin D-28 acoustic twice and then I did the high string part and added that on top of it. I think I also double-tracked that, too. Then a nylon-string, which was played by Kerry, added just a bit more body, and a digital delay was also added on later. There were at least seven guitars on there. The Nashville tuning was just mixed in so that it added this nice sparkle to the track.\"\n\nAdding Steve Morse to Kansas in 1986 really brought another dynamic to the band. What was it like having him in the band?\n\n\"When we first started rehearsing in Phil\u2019s basement, I was sitting down with Steve and he had just been awarded the best guitar player ever for the third year in a row, and was now in the Hall of Fame. And here I am, in a room with him and we\u2019re creating material together. For me, that was a terrifying experience, until I got to know what Steve was like. He\u2019s the least threatening and intimidating guy you could ever meet. He\u2019s a guitar wizard.\n\n\"I also learned a lesson from him that I thought was very valuable. We were on the road somewhere, had just done a show and walked into the hotel lobby and there was this crappy band playing in the lounge. I was about to make a joke about it when Steve turned to me and said, \u2018Did you see what the guitar player just did there?\u2019 It was something that the player did with his toggle switch. Steve said he had never seen anybody do it that way before.\n\n\"I thought, \u2018He is the best guitar player in the world, and he is still always learning.\u2019 He was looking for something that was different, like this kid did in that band. And I thought that, as a guitar player, it was such a great mindset to have.\"\n\nDid you ever think you\u2019d be here and still touring 50 years later?\n\n\"We\u2019ve kind of perpetually toured, but we never would have imagined we\u2019d get 50 years. We thought we might get four or five good years and then I would go back to Kansas and maybe buy a bar, have a little stage there and play with my friends. But it just kept going.\n\n\"You know, those smallest little details, all those mini-steps have now taken us 50 years. It wasn\u2019t a plan so much; it was just the simple motion of moving forward.\""}, {"url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qbv89x/rank-your-records-rich-williams-rates-all-14-kansas-albums", "page_content": "For those of you who don't know Kansas \u200b (and I'm assuming a lot of you, because the majority of Noisey readers were born 18 to 34 years ago, and they released their most famous album, Leftoverture, in 1976), the band is a pioneering art-rock band formed in 1970 in, you guessed it, Kansas. They've had as many members as they have albums, and although many fans will jump at the opportunity to explain in detail which albums are canon and which aren't, every single album is, at least in this writer's opinion, worth at least one listen. They're the full embodiment of album-oriented rock, and while many of their songs are great as standalone tunes, you never really get the full experience until you listen to the whole album.\n\nDid Kerry want to make Vinyl Confessions more religious than it was? He kind of had been wanting to do that for a while. This is just what I feel about it. I think he tried that enough and knew he wasn't going to get anywhere with it. That was his calling. That's what he wanted to do and he knew he wouldn't be doing that through the vehicle of Kansas so it was his time to go.\n\nNoisey: Can you tell me a little bit about why Vinyl Confessions is last? Rich Williams: It just wasn't a good time in the band. There were just a lot of personal problems going on inside and outside of the band. Dave [Hope] and Kerry [Livgren] left soon after that record; their hearts weren't in it at all. As hard as we were trying, it just wasn't coming naturally at that point. Kerry was such a main writer up until then. He was wanting to do something else, and it was making the album hard to make. He wasn't into it anymore. When the whole team isn't on board, it just becomes a struggle. It should be a fun, exciting experience, and it just stopped being that.\n\nKansas released their 15th studio album, The Prelude Implicit, last week. It's the band's first album in seven years, the longest the band as ever gone without releasing new music. Now, buckle up and grab some snacks, because we're about to rank these records.\n\nRich Williams, the guitarist for the band since 1974, kindly spoke with me for over two hours about every single album the band has released, and while it sounds mean, I only had to remind him of what albums he hadn't ranked twice (after 14 albums I think you get a pass for forgetting if Drastic Measures came before or after _Point of Know Return). _\n\nDid you have a contingency plan if you didn't find a singer? No. [Laughs] I don't think we ever considered that an option. It was just: keep looking until we find somebody. John Elefante sent in a tape. We'd heard a lot of good singers, but we felt we needed someone who could sing the past songs and John had a similar voice to Steve. He was a tenor and had a powerful voice and that made a lot of sense. Plus, he was a songwriter. We were lacking material because Steve left with the material he'd written and we were in the studio and needed a bit more material. So it was all a scramble. We were in a complete panic. We were in damage-control mode and we just kept moving. We got John involved and we got it done but going through that album, things weren't the same anymore with any of us. When Steve left, that was the first real change we'd gone through. It was a bit like going through the motions because that's all we knew how to do, but I think it was inevitable it was going to fall apart after that.\n\nWhat was that like? It was a scramble. We never had to do that before. We'd been the same unit up until that point; it was tough. We were auditioning people in Atlanta, in Los Angeles, listening to tapes from different people auditioning while we were recording. We had tracks recorded and would have people come in and sing the tracks. It was very unsettling because a lot of money was being spent. Are we going to complete this project? Do we even have a band? So we had a lot going on; very disconcerting.\n\nWhy is this one 13? Kind of the same. On that album, Kerry was still struggling. He wanted Kansas to be a lot more of a Christian band. That's what he felt like he needed to do, but that's never what Kansas wanted to be as a unit, so there was dissatisfaction in that. We were working on the album, writing the songs, and that's when Steve Walsh quit. We had already booked studio time and the album was written, and Steve said he couldn't do it. So then he took the material he'd written and left, so we had an incomplete record. When we started recording that album, we didn't have a singer. While we were recording it, we were also auditioning singers.\n\nWhat makes this one number 11? It's one of our best sounding records. It sounds great and has got some great music on it, but there's nothing memorable about it, either. Lyrically, it didn't stand out; it was a bit dark. We went to Trinidad to kind of recapture the spirit of when we did Leftoverture, but we went to Louisiana in the middle of nowhere to be all together away from town, away from family, and be together and work. We went to Trinidad kind of for the same reason: there were too many distractions. It was a very well-formed and brilliant sounding record, but again, it was lacking anything memorable. As hard as we tried, we couldn't recreate what we were trying to recreate.\n\nWhen you say the band lost its hunger, what do you mean? Well, just before, you had nothing to compare it to, and now everyone's got money in the bank. You're up there, and you don't quite have the same drive to stay there sometimes. The dynamic changed in the band. We were younger men before, all with the same goal, but as people start having families and moving to different areas and going on with their lives\u2014and I'm not saying anything is wrong with that; that's what happens in life\u2014but it starts to be destructive to the unit.\n\nYou said it was disjointed. The band or the music? The band and the music seemed a bit disjointed; things weren't quite the same. Money changes everything. And songwriters made a lot more money so they had different incentives. They wanted to spend more time enjoying life. I'm really happy for you, but the rest of us aren't in your position yet, so money changes everything within an organization. It took the hunger out of the band. Before, we had something to prove. We'd proven it, and now we were just gathering stuff.\n\nHow about number 12? This is when Kerry really started distancing himself from us in what he wanted to do. So the album is disjointed to me. It was not the best of times again. The end was coming. You could feel it, but it still took three albums to get there.\n\nWhat makes that one number ten as opposed to Freaks of Nature? It was an odd record to make because Kerry had called Phil [Ehart]\u2014he hadn't been in the band for a time, but we talked all the time\u2014and said, \"I got a bunch of material here that I'm not going to put on a solo record, but it might be some good Kansas material.\" Kerry had moved back to Kansas and had a studio on his farm, so Phil and I went and listened and said, \"Let's do that.\" We'd never recorded in this fashion before. Steve [Walsh] was not into it. He was working on a solo album, doing his parts in Atlanta, mailing them in. Dave Hope came in and played bass on a song and was gone. People would come in and do the parts and leave. Kerry wasn't going to be in the band afterwards, we weren't going to tour this material. I like the album, it had some great material on it, but the way we assembled it and did it in such an uncharacteristic band sense is why I put it down in there. It could've been much better if we'd actually been involved as a unit.\n\nWhat exactly were you trying to recreate? The music was good but there was nothing special about the songs, melodically. Lyrically, it's hard for me to put into concise words. We were with a smaller label, and there wasn't a big push around it. We were irrelevant to the music scene\u2014at that time, classic rock hadn't been a part of a comeback. We knew it probably wouldn't be heard or well received except for a few dedicated fans. It was a helpless feeling going through it. We wanted to be creative, we wanted to record, but the times had changed. Quite a bit of touring at that time wasn't all that enjoyable\u2014riding around in a bus playing five clubs in a week for months on end for little money; it was a struggle. At the time, we were trying to keep our heads above water, but the time wasn't good for any classic rock bands. So that mood kind of prevailed above all.\n\nWhat was the draw? Why did you guys want to work with a symphony? We'd always tried to find a way to do something different, especially when we were going through a time when no new music was coming out with us. Kerry was no longer involved, Steve was not wanting to write anymore, we'd been on the road for two years doing the same things. We needed to re-package this, to find a different way to present the same stuff we were doing. We wanted to still feel creative even if we had to be creative with what had already been done, something to create some interest in us. That was a bit of the motivation behind all of that, and our music was always symphonic in nature, so from the very beginning we'd thought, \"Wouldn't it be great one day if we could do this with a symphony?\" It was that thought coming to fruition.\n\nWhy is this nine? I like what the album did for us. We were trying to reinvent ourselves a bit\u2014we needed to do something different to shake it up\u2014so we went in the studio and recorded a lot of songs and had it scored to record with a symphony orchestra. We did the re-records, then we took it to Abbey Road in London\u2014really what that gave us was a blueprint and charts to where we could start playing symphony shows\u2014and several years after that, we started playing with symphonies.\n\nDo you think the experiences with Freaks of Nature fed into those attitudes towards Somewhere to Elsewhere? Very much so. It was one of those things where touring was a struggle\u2014still bussing around from club to club, not really making any money. We were one of the few classic rock bands still out there trying. I got in a band simply because I wanted to play in one. I liked the rehearsals and the camaraderie and the traveling. All of that to me is what being in a band is about. And recording the new album, it's all part of the process. It provides a vehicle to continue touring. At some point, you have to be creative or you get extremely stagnant.\n\nDo you think it not sounding as good had to do with the fact that you guys didn't travel to the studio? Sonically, I don't think it was great. I don't think the material was as strong, and, although we were trying hard, the times were changing, too. We had our moment in the sun, then all of the sudden everyone was wearing a leisure suit and disco was getting hot, so the times were changing. We were getting a lot of odd direction that we weren't following. Radio dictated popularity at that time and radio was changing, and we weren't going to, and I think the first time our relevance had seen its day. At the ripe old age of 30, we were starting to feel like old men.\n\nWhy is Monolith number eight? We had back-to-back huge albums, and this was the very first beginning of the end. Up until this point, we were going to destinations to record, but now everyone is married, everyone has a house. This was when we were officially becoming individuals more than a unit\u2014again there's nothing wrong with that. The dynamic changes within a career\u2014money, etc. People just grow up, and we just kind of wanted to stay at home and do things at a different pace. The drive was there. We were just a bit naive in thinking this one would naturally progress in the way it has been\u2014\"we've got this down, we'll make another record and it's going to be successful.\" It was successful a lot more on the merit of what had come before it. It wasn't as good of a record. It didn't sound as good.\n\nIn the Spirit of Thing would be number six? So now we're with MCI, and we've got some great material. The record company is on fire about this, and we're really taking a lot of time putting this album together. It's well recorded and we were very excited about that. We really felt something great was going to happen out of this record. Towards the end, the record company said, \"Guys, we love the record but we're still lacking something that we feel really confident works for the radio.\" And then right before the album comes out, MCI fired everybody from the president on down. So then the album is almost not released. It sort of gets released, gets no backing, and then just sort of died. And that was very sad because we worked so hard on it and it was a great record and it never got a chance. So that knocked the wind out of our sails. Steve Morse went on to do other things, and we were down for a while. At that point, we were done but we weren't sure it was going to happen. Then things started to turn around and we started to get back on the road some, but from the first album to the fourth was a long time.\n\nNext would probably be Power, the first album with Steve Morse, when we got the band back together after the break with the new lineup. There's a lot of good stuff on it, and it was an interesting time to work with Steve Morse. Again, I like the album, it has some really good stuff on it, there was a good game plan, the album was well received, we were doing some good shows. This was going to be the new band, and the future was looking very bright. I guess what missed was not the album, but in the live shows. Steve was covering a lot of the violin parts\u2014that was a lot of his role with the older material and he did it extremely well\u2014but it wasn't the same to me. I guess I was missing that voice.\n\nWere they trying to push Kansas to have more of a disco sound? Yeah, something shorter, something more danceable. And, of course, these are your advisors\u2014the record company and management. We wanted to please people, but we didn't want to do that, so it was a bit of a struggle, and for that, it was a hit-or-miss album. There was some great stuff on it and some stuff that was not so great.\n\nWhat do you mean by progressively? \"It Takes a Woman's Love\" is just a straightforward rock 'n' roll song, whereas we were starting to lean towards a very much more progressive style of music, getting away from basic predictable lyrics about predictable things. Steve was more in that vein. Kerry was starting to go further into progressive music, and that's where the band was leaning, too. So it was a bit disjointed. We hadn't quite found a comfort zone, and again, the record company put a lot of money into the first and second album. We're getting tour support now from the company so they've got lots of money in us, and they want to hear something get on the radio. Those songs were attempts at that. Also, it doesn't sound real good. It's not a great sounding record. The speakers we were mixing on, they weren't flat. So what we were hearing in the room sounded great, but when it went to vinyl, it was like, \"What is this?\" So, sonically, we weren't real happy with the album.\n\nNext would probably be Masque, there are some people where this is their favorite record, so it's hard, but there are some songs on this that I'm just not crazy about. \"The Pinnacle\" is one of the most quintessential hardcore Kansas fan songs. It's a brilliantly written song, it's very musical, but it's not a rock song either. It's definitely Kansas all the way. \"All the World\" was a great song by Steve; \"Icarus\" is probably the favorite of the album is a quintessential Kansas song; \"Two Cents Worth,\" odd song for us. I think Steve captures the mood brilliantly in singing it, I really like the song. \"It Takes a Woman's Love\" didn't make any sense to me\u2014another song that was left over from the first demo tape that we made. It was like: record an album, tour, record an album, tour. Then, \"OK, we have to record an album, but shit, we haven't had a chance to write stuff.\" So we were going back into the vault, and while the band is starting to lean a little bit more progressively, some of these earlier writings weren't at all.\n\nWas that more on you guys as a band or the people producing the record? It was the process being moved along. We didn't have our own voice, strong enough to say, \"This isn't done, we're not happy with this, we're starting over.\" We were in awe of it all and didn't know what to say to speak up. There was a lot of great material on it, but I think we all wish we could've re-recorded that one. What it did was capture the essence of us, that's the album that got people to go, \"Wow, what is this?\" And that's the first time we really heard Steve's voice professionally recorded on tape. It was like, \"Holy crap, this is a world-class singer we got here, this is amazing.\" Suddenly, we were in awe of his talent.\n\nSo you guys had no idea of what you were doing? We figured they had more of an idea of what they were doing. We had a lot of questions, so on some songs, it's not like it was executed poorly, it was just put together in a rush, in a lot of panic and confusion.\n\nThe first album, that's the album I think we all wish we could re-record. We'd never done anything. We went from living in Kansas, playing in bars to flying to New York. We recorded in a little tiny demo studio before, but never had been in a real studio, and here are the hicks from Kansas. It was all intimidating, I guess. It was exciting, it was fun, but there's a lot of things we didn't know, so we just went along with it. Basically, it was done in two weeks and once it was over, we were like, \"What happened?\"\n\nDid any of that energy feed into recording Song for America? Yeah, we were very cocky. We definitely had something to prove. We were very confident in ourselves and in the band. We knew we had something different that other people weren't doing. We knew that we were unique and kind of cocky about it. \"You may not like us, but we're real good and you can kiss our butt,\" that was kind of our attitude. We didn't have that much of a past, and the future was too far to worry about, and we were young and dumb enough to experience the moment without a care about consequences or anything else. It was an innocent time for us as a band. \"Lamplight Symphonies\" is one of the most beautiful stories Kerry ever wrote. We haven't played that in years. When we do the tour coming up in October and the next year, we're going to start playing that song again. We've been wanting to play that for decades now.\n\nWhat is it about Song For America? You can really see we were starting to find ourselves. Looking at the tracklist. It starts to make sense. \"Down the Road\" was a very straightforward rock song. It was a great song to feature Robby [Steinhardt] singing. Then \"Song for America,\" which is probably in our top five, easily, of the best songs Kerry ever wrote. It's an epic piece of music. Overall, this album really sounded good. The engineers were very helpful getting us over the first album experience. It was fun. We had a great time staying on Sunset Blvd. The Kansas boys had been set free. It was fabulous, we were having the times of our lives.\n\nWhat is it about that song that gets you?\n\nOnce in a blue moon, you can record something and it has something indefinable about it; it has an atmosphere about. It captured a mood, but it's such a pumping story, and the music represents it well and everything about it\u2026 perfect package. Some songs do that. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" by Bob Dylan\u2014when that song comes on, there's a perfection about it that I can't define, and not too many songs and recordings can do that. That one captures such a unique character and mood to it. \"Lonely Street,\" it's kind of a blues song but it's not typical, lyrically. A little questionable, but the song was a very strong show of a very aggressive side of us. \"Devil Game\" was a fun song to play live that just got lost in the times. Steve never wanted to play it anymore so we didn't play it for decades. \"Incomudro\" is a cool song. It had some great parts to it, definitely dabbling into being more progressive; it's got some beautiful music in it.\n\nWhat was it like creating this album then having to release Masque?\n\nThe Masque album was kind of a lateral move, it didn't sound quite as good. We were still hunting and packing a bit. We hadn't quite found where we were going with those two records. You can see where we were headed, looking at the timeline of things. We just hadn't gotten there yet.\n\n2. Point of Know Return (1977)\n\nWe went back to rehearsing and Kerry was loaded with a lot of great material. Steve had this instrumental thing\u2014I'd never heard anything like it\u2014 it was the introduction to \"Portrait,\" a very strong song by Kerry. We always trying to come up with a twist with on things, and Steve suggested Point of Know Return for an album title, and so he wrote \"Point of Know Return,\" and it was a good single backing our success of \"Carry On Wayward Son.\" \"Paradox\" is a song we're starting to play again and it's a fun song to do. \"Closet Chronicle,\" we've been playing with the new band. Again, just a great song. So we've got a lot of really strong material. \"Sparks of the Tempest,\" great song for Robby, cool lyrics great piece of music. Once we started working with the symphony\u2014\"Nobody's Home\" is not a good song to play outside at a bike rally\u2014but once you're in a performance center with all the lights out, the symphony behind you, and the right mood is created\u2026 suddenly \"Nobody's Home\" was epic. It's such a mystical, unusual song. There's nothing about it that would ever be a favorite or a hit on the radio or anything, but for a Kansas fan, it really strikes home.\n\n1. Leftoverture (1976)\n\nWe'd been out on the road playing with Queen, and then it was time to start recording again and we're back working on material. Kerry was suddenly on fire. He was showing up with such an incredible variety of music that was just all so spectacular. \"Miracles Out of Nowhere\" I think was the first one we started working on\u2014that whole beginning section when it comes back in a different key and re-invents itself. It only took us three days to do that, to try and get the feel of it; it was just so awkward. Other stuff was in Kerry's head, so we're deciphering what he's trying to interpret inside of his head, and it took a long time to do it. Then he'd go, \"I got another one I wrote last night!\" Suddenly, music was pouring through him in such an unprecedented way. Meanwhile, we had all these parts of songs, and it was like, \"Wouldn't it be kind of cool to try and assemble a song out of all of these parts?\" And so that's when we put together\"Leftoverture.\" It was made out of leftover parts. Then the record company goes, \"That's an album title. That's one of the best album titles I've ever heard.\" So we re-named the song \"Magnum Opus.\"\n\nHow would you describe the energy and the mood of band during Leftoverture?\n\nWe'd been working on material for a while now, so at the end of this creative spurt by Kerry, we're a day from packing up\u2014last day of rehearsals, and we're just going to run through stuff before we pack up for Louisiana to record songs. Then Kerry goes, \"I got one more song.\" We were tired, we just wanted to go record, and he pulls out \"Carry On Wayward Son.\" We hadn't assembled it yet. We hadn't decided what comes when, but the song was there, and we thought it could be a really good song.\n\nWe were in the studio listening back to \"Wayward Son,\" and we thought it could be a game changer. It was us, not like anybody else. You could feel that everywhere, and the whole album had that feeling that there was something incredibly right about this record. You didn't know how it was going to be received, but it was hard to imagine how this wouldn't be received well. We knew this was a great record, the record company knew it was a great record. It had finally happened."}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/artist/472657-Rich-Williams", "page_content": "Real Name:\n\nRichard Williams\n\nProfile:\n\nRichard John \"Rich\" Williams (born February 1, 1950) is the guitarist for the American rock band Kansas, and has been with them since their 1974 self-titled debut album."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Rich-williams", "page_content": "About Rich Williams\n\nRich Williams, guitarist, is one of the founding members of legendary Progressive rock band Kansas.

The band known for the prog-/hard-rock hybrid exemplified by \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d recently released Leftoverture Live & Beyond, which included the 1976 classic Leftoverture performed in its entirety along with material from 2016\u2019s The Prelude Implicit.\n\nOriginal members Williams and drummer Phil Ehart today lead a rejuvenated lineup that includes longtime bassist Billy Greer, violinist David Ragsdale along with three new members \u2013 vocalist Ronnie Platt, keyboardist David Manion, and guitarist Zak Rizvi. Their collective excitement is palpable on both Leftoverture Live & Beyond and The Prelude Implicit.\n\nLeftoverture Live & Beyond is 19 songs recorded at 12 shows in early 2017.\n\n\u201cThe only song we\u2019d never played live from Leftoverture was \u2018Questions of My Childhood.\u2019 And we didn\u2019t re-record anything or go back in and do overdubs,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, we\u2019ve done a lot of rearrangements of Kansas songs \u2013 sometimes for good, sometimes for not so good. With this new lineup, we\u2019ve gone back as much as we can to the way the songs were written and recorded. We\u2019re trying to lean more on the original arrangements.\u201d\n\nBefore they started work on The Prelude Implicit, the band toured, and it went so well, he said, \u201c\u2026the restraints were off of us, musically.\u201d At first, doubts nagged about their ability to write new songs because former vocalist/keyboardist Steve Walsh and guitarist/keyboardist Kerry Livgren had always been Kansas\u2019 primary songwriters; Somewhere to Elsewhere was Livgren\u2019s material with the original members performing, but Williams said it was \u201can assembly-line thing\u201d with parts recorded separately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sitting in a room with a bunch of guys, developing ideas. That ebb and flow is really where some of our best stuff came from \u2013 not just from one person but by the combination and effort of everybody. We didn\u2019t have that on Somewhere to Elsewhere. That\u2019s what we had on The Prelude Implicit again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made the album for us as much as we made it for anything else. We didn\u2019t know what it was going to be going into it. We had never done it this way before. We wanted to be quintessentially Kansas from the artwork to the lyrics to the music to the variety within the music \u2013 very well-thought-out to be as Kansas as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 main concern has always been about what\u2019s best for Kansas as a whole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a team player. There\u2019s no Richard Williams solo album. I\u2019ve never had a desire to do a solo album,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, Kansas has always been the sum of its parts, not so much the talent of any one person. I\u2019ve always just been very comfortable in the role of a team player.\u201d\n\nHis attitude applies to working with other guitarists in Kansas, whether it\u2019s been Livgren, Steve Morse, or Rizvi.\n\n\u201cIn our early days, we were doing an interview and they asked Kerry, \u2018Who\u2019s your biggest influence?\u2019 He said, \u2018Probably Rich, because we play together all the time.\u2019 We were working on equipment together and guitars and guitar tones and different things. You\u2019re not in competition, but constantly working together. That\u2019s all very positive,\u201d said Williams.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Williams\u2019 main electric has been a PRS Custom from \u201984 or \u201985. Early in Kansas, he played a Gibson L-6S that\u2019s still part of his collection of about 30 guitars. He also plays a Martin D-28 based on the one he used on \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty nipping at Kansas\u2019 heels in recent years has been replaced with forward-thinking confidence; pending is a tour during which they\u2019ll perform 1977\u2019s Point of Know Return in its entirety, and they\u2019re set to record a new studio album.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the shows and the performance level of the band is at an all-time high,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThe energy level, the crowd enjoyment \u2013 everything \u2013 is greater than it has been since the early days. It feels much like it did on the second, third, and fourth albums,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s that type of focused energy. It\u2019s been a tremendous experience. None of us are looking back, remembering when. Our best days are in front of us.\u201d \u2013 Bret Adams\n\nThis article originally appeared in VG\u2018s June 2018 issue.

But more than the swaggering singles, roughneck fantasy videos or relentless sense of blue-collar boogie, at his core, the 72-year-old legend is a bluesman. Pure, unqualified and unadulterated, the only son of Hank Williams has the same down low lonesome in his veins as the man Rufus \u201cTee-Tot\u201d Payne taught to play guitar as a small child growing up in Greenville, Alabama.\n\nWith Rich White Honky Blues \u2013 set for release on June 17 \u2013 the second-generation Country Music Hall of Famer makes good on his legacy with a turpentine and rough wood take on the hill country blues that informed his father\u2019s raw-boned style of putting his pain out there. GRAMMY-winning Producer of the Year Dan Auerbach recorded the set live, with a dozen songs reprising classics from Robert Johnson, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, R.L. Burnside, Muddy Waters, Big Joe Turner and a few from Bocephus himself.\n\nThe blues is where it all comes from. It\u2019s the start of everything musical in my family; everything starts with Tee-Tot and flows from there. I\u2019ve always flirted with this stripped back blues \u2013 all the way back to the \u201880s. But I finally made an album that\u2019s just that, and I like it. Hank Williams Jr.\n\nBlame it on the owner of Easy Eye Sound. Auerbach went straight to the essence. Assembling a wicked core band of electric slide guitarist Kenny Brown, claimed as \u201cmy adopted son\u201d by R.L. Burnside, bassist Eric Deaton, who first toured with Fat Possum\u2019s Juke Joint Caravan, backing up T-Model Ford and Paul \u201cWine\u201d Jones, plus drummer Kinney Kimbrough, son of North Mississippi blues legend Junior Kimbrough, they tapped into the lifeblood of the blues at its most randy.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to play this kind of music, you couldn\u2019t have better players,\u201d Auerbach explains. \u201cThe first time I ever saw Hank Jr. on TV, I was a kid raised on Robert Johnson and Hank Williams, Sr. records, and those things came through so clearly watching him. So, I tried to assemble the right parts to just sit in that piece of who he is.\u201d\n\nIt started with a phone call, discussing what these sessions could be. Nothing definitive, no commitments made. But then Auerbach started receiving text messages the week leading up to the dates: pictures of Hank Williams, Jr. stationery, each with the title of a song he wanted to sing. Back and forth. Songs. Influences. Touchstones to draw upon.\n\nAnd then it was Day One.\n\n\u201cFirst thing he said to me when he walked in was, \u2018I don\u2019t really feel like fucking with this shit!\u2019,\u201d Auerbach recalls. \u201cAnd he walked into another room.\u201d\n\nUndaunted, the producer had the band start playing; grindhouse blues, sweltering hill country shuffles, juke joint altar calls.

Those are the songs that brought us to the table. Without Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind, we wouldn\u2019t be around today.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls how in 1976, with the band deep in debt to their record label and facing an uncertain future after their first three albums (Kansas, Song for America and Masque) stiffed, they approached the recording of their fourth album, Leftoverture, with a sense of impending doom.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty dark time. We were bleeding money pretty seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were signed to Kirshner Records, and our benefactor, Don Kirshner, could have easily said, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s been fun, but you need to find another record company.\u2019 We needed a hit, and thank goodness we came up with Carry On Wayward Son. It saved us so we could go on. And then we had Dust in the Wind. Those songs exploded and our worlds changed forever.\u201d\n\nKansas were in a unique position in the mid Seventies. Not only did they represent the last trace of progressive rock on AM playlists that were suddenly ruled by disco, but they were also one of the very few purveyors of American prog, period.\n\n\u201cNot to sound pompous, but we pretty much gave birth to American prog bands,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is, we did it pretty sneakily. We were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d slip in one of our own tunes and tell the crowd that we were playing the B-side of Smoke on the Water. We\u2019d stretch songs out and go crazy, and the people loved it. It became our thing.\u201d\n\nWe were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material\n\nOf the seven current members of Kansas, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original crew. Singer Steve Walsh, who ended his on-and-off association with the band in 2014, has been replaced by two co-lead vocalists, Billy Greer and Ronnie Platt, who double on bass and keyboards, respectively.\n\nWilliams\u2019 longtime guitar foil Kerry Livgren, who also served as Kansas\u2019 chief songwriter, split in 2000, and in his place is New Jersey picker Zak Rizvi.\n\n(Image credit: Paul Natkin/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like a different band sometimes because we\u2019ve got a bunch of newer faces,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut at the same time, it feels like the original band because we\u2019ve got seven guys who really love to perform and create. Back in the day, we let money and business get in the way. This bunch of guys just wants to make music.\u201d\n\nThe band has a new album out, 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence, and all told, it sounds like quintessential Kansas: there\u2019s muscular, epic prog-rockers like Throwing Mountains and the eight-minute-plus title track, symphonic power ballads such as Jets Overhead and Memories Down the Line, and there\u2019s even a \u201chow-over-the-top-can-we-go?\u201d instrumental in the form of Propulsion 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of always in a state of having to prove ourselves,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe had to do it on our last album, [2016\u2019s] The Prelude Implicit, because it was our first new music in 16 years, and I think this time we had to prove that we still mean it.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a laugh, then adds, \u201cI imagine on the next one, we\u2019ll have to do the same thing. That\u2019s OK \u2013 I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\nBefore the band got started, who were the guitar players that you were really listening to and emulating?\n\n\u201cI was copying anybody who was there. The Yardbirds were pretty big to me. My introduction to blues wasn\u2019t through the Americans; I dug the British guys. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton \u2013 Clapton\u2019s first solo album was like Guitar 101 to me.\n\n\u201cInstead of this twangy rhythmic instrument, suddenly here\u2019s this ballsy guitar with a guttural saxophone lead voice. Suddenly, I was hearing blues in a different way. Of course, I also loved Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck \u2013 those guys made a big impression on me. That stuff really formed the basis of my sound and style.\u201c\n\nGrowing up in Topeka, was it easy for you to get good guitars living where you were?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I had Marshall amps and Les Pauls. I had a Gibson ES-335, which I still have to this day. Everything that you could buy in Los Angeles you could buy in Topeka. When I was 15, I had a charge account at the local music store. If I wanted something, I\u2019d charge it and make weekly payments on it.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty cool time. When The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, Topeka exploded, just like every other town in the country. Everybody had to be in a band. There was a garage band on every block.\u201c\n\nKansas played covers in clubs for a few years. Do you remember when you first heard prog from England and when it started to influence the band?\n\n\u201cIt took a while. For a time it seemed as if only the two coasts were hearing the prog stuff. Gradually the stations in Kansas started playing it \u2013 I guess somebody\u2019s ears were tuned to it. We\u2019d be like, 'Wow, have you heard this band called ELP?' Or 'Have you heard Genesis\u2019 Selling England by the Pound?'\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to find all these new, creative ways of addressing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t even know if 'rock \u2018n\u2019 roll' was the correct term for that music.\u201c\n\nSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it... We cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different\n\nEven so, it didn\u2019t seem as if American bands were jumping on the prog bandwagon. You guys were outliers.\n\n\u201cSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it. I mean, we played Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels-type stuff; we cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different. I remember playing cover songs during our club days. You\u2019d get to a part and be like, 'Man, this song sucks. I hate the middle part.'\n\n\u201cSo we started thinking that we could do some sort of interlude at the beginning, or maybe we could play the song at half-time. We did anything to change it up and put some balls to the music. In hindsight, we were doing something very important: We were learning how to be us.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns)\n\nDid it seem as if playing throughout your home state was a dead end? Did the band consider relocating to one of the two coasts to get noticed?\n\n\u201cWell, what happened was, we made a demo tape, and that\u2019s what we sent out to the coasts. One of them wound up on Don Kirshner\u2019s desk. The people at Don\u2019s company loved it \u2013 they really dug the violin \u2013 and they sent a guy named Wally Gold to check us out.\n\n\u201cWe put together a show and did that old free-beer trick: 'Come to the show and the drinks are free.' So Wally showed up and the place was packed; everybody was drunk and partying. So Wally called Don and said, 'Man, there\u2019s something going on here. People are crawling through the windows to get in the place.' That sealed the deal. Next thing you know, we signed a deal with Don Kirshner and were making records.\u201c\n\nLeftoverture [1976] and Point of Know Return [1977] hit one after the other. After being hitless for several years, that must have felt remarkable.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still here today doing this because of that explosion. We didn\u2019t really know how huge it was at the time. We were just blue-collar guys from the Midwest. I remember arriving at Madison Square Garden in a limo with our manager, and he was going, 'Madison Square Garden! This is so big!'\n\n\u201dWe were like, 'Yeah, yeah, whatever.' We\u2019d been on the road for so long, so to us this was just a natural progression of more and more shows. Today I realize how big it was, but back then we didn\u2019t really see it.\u201d\n\nHow much of Carry On Wayward Son had Kerry written before the band got to dive into it? And how long did it take to work out that intricate guitar and keyboard solo section?\n\n\u201cThat was the last song we did for the album, on the final day or recording. Kerry came in and said he had a new song. We learned the structure of it and got to it. The version you hear on the record is probably the first time we ever played it correctly.\n\n\u201cThe solo thing didn\u2019t take long. My approach to guitar is just wing it. I didn\u2019t really have a planned solo. I just responded to what everybody else was doing and threw stuff out there. I was kind of like, 'I\u2019ll just play stuff. Let me know if it sounds right.'\u201c\n\nFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression\n\nThe acoustic guitar figure of Dust in the Wind is so recognizable. I understand that Kerry wrote it as a fingerpicking exercise.\n\n\u201cYeah, Kerry didn\u2019t write the song to write a song; he wrote this chord pattern to teach himself fingerstyle guitar. His wife thought it was a song, and he was like, 'No, this isn\u2019t Kansas. The band would never play this.' But he brought it in and we thought it was really nice.\n\n\u201cThe figure was there; it didn\u2019t have the middle section or the violin solo. But it came together fast. I remember when we were listening back to it, somebody said, 'That\u2019s the next single.' Kerry didn\u2019t think so, but the rest of us knew. And sure enough \u2013 boom. The track exploded on the radio.\u201c\n\nThe way you approached the solo section of Wayward Son \u2013 is that still the way you compose leads in the studio? I\u2019m thinking of the title track of the new album, which has a similar solo structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same. What happens is, somebody lays something down and everybody else plays off of it. It\u2019s very collaborative, but not as instant as it was back in the day. Somebody else\u2019s solo will dictate what you\u2019re going to do, and you take inspiration from what they\u2019ve done to go somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to do it that way. I\u2019ll lay down the foundation, and then Zak will play something; Tom will do a smoking keyboard part. Sometimes we redo our parts based on what somebody does.\u201c\n\nThe riff in the song Throwing Mountains sounds as tough and mean as early grunge. Did any of that stuff ever make an impression on you?\n\n\u201dNot really at first. I could appreciate the honesty of grunge. It\u2019s like, I loved The Beatles for their polish, but I loved The Rolling Stones for their rawness. You listen to Bob Dylan \u2013 his recordings are very elementary, but they\u2019re honest.\n\n\u201dFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression. So you mention grunge and that song, sure, I\u2019ll take that. It reminds me of how punk obliterated disco back in the day. Let\u2019s get back to being raw.\u201d\n\nHow are you enjoying playing live with Zak Rizvi?\n\n\u201dOh, I\u2019m loving it. Zak has a deep love and knowledge of the band. He\u2019s a tremendous engineer and guitarist \u2013 just brilliant musically. He\u2019s a real scholar of music. Playing with him and having him in the band is great. There isn\u2019t much he can\u2019t play. I mean, he played trombone in a symphony. I have a blast working with him.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Steve Morse during his time in the band?\n\n\u201dWhat an interesting guy! When he came in, he had just won every guitar award imaginable; they had to invent awards to give him. I\u2019ll be honest: I was a little intimidated at first, but I was pleased to find out that he\u2019s the least intimidating man around. He\u2019s fascinated by everything.\n\n\u201dWe would be on tour, and we would see some crappy band playing at a Holiday Inn or wherever. We would be like, 'Let\u2019s go. This band sucks.' But Steve would say, 'Did you see what that guitar player just did with his on/off switch?' The guitarist wasn\u2019t even that good, but Steve was learning from him anyway.\u201d\n\n\ufeffFor a while you played PRS guitars, but I understand you\u2019ve moved back to Les Pauls now.\n\n\u201dI still play PRS guitars occasionally, but I got my hands on a Les Paul that blew me away. It\u2019s one of the Lee Roy Parnell signature models \u2013 a reissue of the \u201957 Goldtop \u2013 and it\u2019s fabulous.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s got a support in the back of the headstock, so if it falls over it won\u2019t break, and the heel has a cutaway so you can get up the neck a lot easier. I run that through a Fractal Axe-Fx III and I\u2019m good to go. I used to have to spend hours getting tones. Now I can just dial in the sound, and boom \u2013 let\u2019s play.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.iconvsicon.com/2022/03/24/country-music-legend-hank-williams-jr-to-release-rich-white-honky-blues-album-in-june-2022/", "page_content": "Larger than life, capable of summoning \u201call his rowdy friends\u201d with a couple crashing downbeats and a blaring guitar riff, Hank Williams, Jr. has been one of country music\u2019s truest outlaws for over half a century. But more than the swaggering singles, roughneck fantasy videos or relentless sense of blue-collar boogie, at his core, the 72-year-old legend is a bluesman. Pure, unqualified and unadulterated, the only son of Hank Williams has the same down low lonesome in his veins as the man Rufus \u201cTee-Tot\u201d Payne taught to play guitar as a small child growing up in Greenville, Alabama.\n\nWith Rich White Honky Blues \u2013 set for release on June 17 \u2013 the second-generation Country Music Hall of Famer makes good on his legacy with a turpentine and rough wood take on the hill country blues that informed his father\u2019s raw-boned style of putting his pain out there. GRAMMY-winning Producer of the Year Dan Auerbach recorded the set live, with a dozen songs reprising classics from Robert Johnson, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, R.L.

I\u2019ve always flirted with this stripped back blues \u2013 all the way back to the \u201880s. But I finally made an album that\u2019s just that, and I like it.\u201d\n\nBlame it on the owner of Easy Eye Sound. Auerbach went straight to the essence.

Burnside, bassist Eric Deaton, who first toured with Fat Possum\u2019s Juke Joint Caravan, backing up T-Model Ford and Paul \u201cWine\u201d Jones, plus drummer Kinney Kimbrough, son of North Mississippi blues legend Junior Kimbrough, they tapped into the lifeblood of the blues at its most randy.\n\nIt started with a phone call, discussing what these sessions could be. Nothing definitive, no commitments made. But then Auerbach started receiving text messages the week leading up to the dates: pictures of Hank Williams, Jr. stationery, each with the title of a song he wanted to sing. Back and forth. Songs. Influences. Touchstones to draw upon.\n\nAnd then it was Day One.\n\n\u201cFirst thing he said to me when he walked in was, \u2018I don\u2019t really feel like fucking with this shit!\u2019,\u201d Auerbach recalls. \u201cAnd he walked into another room.\u201d\n\nUndaunted, the producer had the band start playing; grindhouse blues, sweltering hill country shuffles, juke joint altar calls. Before too long, the man whose alter-ego is Thunderhead Hawkins emerged, curious and hungry.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to play this kind of music, you couldn\u2019t have better players,\u201d Auerbach explains. \u201cThe first time I ever saw Hank Jr. on TV, I was a kid raised on Robert Johnson and Hank Williams, Sr. records, and those things came through so clearly watching him.

Steinhardt was the original violinist and vocalist on \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d and \u201cCarry on Wayward Son.\u201d Steinhardt, who was working on a solo album, was 71. The following interview with guitarist Rich Williams was conducted May 14, 2021.\n\nClassic rock bands have always experienced a revolving door of musicians. Kansas has seen its share of upheaval, but guitarist Rich Williams and drummer Phil Ehart have been with the band since its debut album. \u201cWe have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThings get tough, you stick with it.\u201d\n\nAfter years of false starts, the band signed with producer Don Kirshner\u2019s label and released Kansas in 1974. Its mix of progressive rock and symphonic arrangements with the work of violinist Robby Steinhardt produced the band\u2019s signature sound \u2014 a sound that has allowed the group to still maintain a steady presence today.\n\nThe band\u2019s breakout LP was 1976\u2019s Leftoverture, which featured the hit single \u201cCarry On Wayward Son.\u201d Point of Know Return followed in 1977. The success of the title track and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d secured the band\u2019s spot as a major arena headliner.\n\nIn July 2020, Kansas released its 16th studio album, The Absence of Presence. The album introduced the band\u2019s newest member, Tom Breslin, a vocalist who contributed music and lyrics.\n\nKansas in concert delivers performances that remain true to the original studio cuts. In 2016\u20132017 Kansas launched the Leftoverture 40th Anniversary Tour, which became the 2017 live album Leftoverture Live & Beyond. Kansas followed with its Point of Know Return Anniversary Tour.

It\u2019s an object lesson that every musician should read before putting pen to contract.\n\nRock Cellar: Why was Point of No Return the focus of the new live album?\n\nRich Williams: We had previously released the Leftoverture Live & Beyond album. To have a recording done in its entirety, in its original running order, it had never been done. Until this tour, we\u2019d never played all these songs ever. It also gave us the opportunity to go deeper into a lot of other albums. Like \u201cLonely Wind,\u201d we hadn\u2019t played it forever. If we played it, we didn\u2019t play it for long. To bring certain songs back from the dead was just smart to do.\n\nWe recorded every night from out front, so we probably had 100 shows taped. That process becomes a lot easier, it\u2019s almost like a studio at that point. You\u2019ve got everything mic\u2019d just right.\n\nRock Cellar: Kansas recently played its first live show in 14 months. What went into preparing for the show after such a long layoff?\n\nRich Williams: As far as the group, we showed up, we did the show. But fortunately we have the live album. And almost everything we\u2019re playing at the moment comes off of that album. So we just compiled the setlist and then a playlist and everybody just did their homework.\n\nFor the last two months I\u2019ve played that set twice a day. At home, I have the same setup as my live setup. So I can just stand there and go through all the motions of what I have to do and play along with the same guys, just through my studio speakers.\n\nThat\u2019s really what everybody did. We just continued doing the show. We had a real brief hotel room rehearsal the night before. And then we jumped on stage and did it. The weirdest part was walking out on stage. It\u2019s like another day. It didn\u2019t seem like that much time had passed. The lights went on and we did the show.\n\nWe were just glad to see each other. That part was exciting, but everybody was very prepared. There was a bit of adrenaline, some nerves, it\u2019s like, \u201chow\u2019s this going to go?\u201d Normally, if we\u2019re on the road, and we go three weeks without shows, one of us will put together a rehearsal. We probably won\u2019t do that anymore now because we know we can do it without that. It\u2019s six responsible guys that kept up on it.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you approach improvisation when performing live, especially on the best-known songs?\n\nRich Williams: For me, there are certain things I want to play not quite note-for-note, but I stick to the theme at least. There are other things I just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, \u201chere comes a part, what are you going to play?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Then I just start playing.\n\nI\u2019m just going to play in the moment, kind of the way I do it in the studio. I hate to over-rehearse. What moves me at the moment is what I usually tend to go for. There\u2019s been so many times where, in the studio, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to play here. Just roll the tape.\u201d\n\nFor example, in the song \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen\u201d on The Prelude Implicit, I had no idea what I was going to play in the solo. I just knew I wanted to get this big, out of control-kind of a sound. Usually, I record in the control room but for this I went out and had the amp right next to me, just crankin\u2019. I said, \u201cjust run it by, let me get a feel for this.\u201d\n\nSo it went by, I was just kind of holding on, I didn\u2019t know what I was gonna do exactly. And they said, \u201cyou\u2019re done.\u201d I said, \u201cwhat?\u201d That was great.\n\nI had no idea what I was doing whatsoever. I was just trying to get a feel for where the feedback points were and just get a general feel of it all. And it\u2019s one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever done. That\u2019s my approach to a lot of solos. \u201cI have no idea, here it comes.\u201d It\u2019s the shotgun approach. I just aim it in the general direction and pull the trigger and see what happens.\n\nKANSAS will be extending the popular Point of Know Return Tour starting with new shows starting November 13, 2021. Before that, the band will be performing sets of KANSAS Classics later this summer & early fall.

It\u2019s one thing to sit down and practice it but then you\u2019ve got the lights and the crowd and so many distractions. To keep a constant focus on what you\u2019re doing [can be tough], because if your mind wanders, you\u2019re in the weeds really quickly. It\u2019s mentally exhausting staying focused. But then on the other hand, there are some simpler songs that my mind will tend to wander and I will get lost. It\u2019s like, pay attention! It\u2019s funny how that works.\n\nMany bands of our era sit around and party before they go out and get half drunk and go out. We just have too much to do. There\u2019s no way to do that and go out there and play. It\u2019s too hard.\n\nRock Cellar: You\u2019ve said that the success of Leftoverture and Point of Know Return changed the internal workings of the band. What did you mean?\n\nRich Williams: When we first started, we were young men. It\u2019s not like we were from poor families, but leaving home, we all played in different bar bands, some together, some with other people, you\u2019re not successful in any way. People living in band houses, you have kind of an all-for-one, one-for-all, you\u2019re like pirates out on the open sea. It\u2019s teamwork. And it goes like that. And time goes on.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a complaint, it\u2019s an observation. It\u2019s just the way things go.\n\nThe way the money works with records, etc. is we did not sign a good deal with Don Kirshner. He was our benefactor, it was the only offer we got. Without him, nothing would have ever happened. But the first thing he did was say, \u201cI am a publisher. I want to publish or go somewhere else.\u201d So right away, we threw a third of the pie away. Another third of the pie is writer\u2019s royalties. And the last part of it is the royalties that the band would bank.\n\nThat part has to pay for every possible recording cost of everything. It takes a long time to pay off recording debts. So no money comes to the band. But the songwriters, and rightfully so, they get paid from the first record sold. They get money from that. So after Leftoverture went gold, we paid off all of our previous debt. The songwriters had already made a small fortune. That starts to change the dynamic.\n\nAt that point in the band, we\u2019re getting a little older, we\u2019ve been together for a while, people are buying houses, cars, getting married. So that all-for-one, one-for-all mentality has taken its natural course and starts to change the dynamic within the band.\n\nThen Point of Know Return, some people have made a lot of money and they don\u2019t want to work as much. Others are, \u201cI\u2019d like to get mine now.\u201d So things just changed. People were going from young, dumb guys to maturing a bit.\n\nAnd money does change people. So people will wander in all sorts of directions.\n\nThings just take their natural course. People naturally drifted apart because it wasn\u2019t really working anymore. But we\u2019re all good friends to this day. No animosity towards anybody through all of that.\n\nThat\u2019s just the dynamic of what happens within a band that\u2019s been around for a little while.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you maintain the classic Kansas sound despite so many personnel changes?\n\nRich Williams: For the first album, everyone was involved in arranging things, in editing things, saying this works, this doesn\u2019t work. Identifying what we\u2019re comfortable with, what parts we like, which parts we don\u2019t. My input is recognizing what fits within a quintessential Kansas part. Or what can we do to this to make it more Kansas-esque? I just have an ear for that.\n\nWe\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with people who have done it for quite a while with us, people who came in very familiar.\n\nWe know who we are and we know who we were and what we want to continue to be, so it\u2019s really not that difficult. Tom Breslin, the newest addition, brought in a lot of material and it wasn\u2019t difficult for us to turn this into what sounds like Kansas.\n\nRock Cellar: The title, The Absence of Presence, is a reference of modern technology?\n\nRich Williams: Yes, but it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. It tends to mean different things to different people. I like things that are ambiguous. The original concept of it was people are so out of touch with what\u2019s around because of the technology in their hand or what they\u2019re watching or computers, whatever.\n\nRock Cellar: The album continues the use of the band\u2019s trademark violin. Explain the violin\u2019s importance in the Kansas sound.\n\nRich Williams: We did a couple of albums, Steve Morse on guitar [Power and In the Spirit of Things], good albums but they sound like a different band. They just do. It is a signature sound, it does set us apart. I think it made us do something. What that is is the violinist needs something to do besides stand around and play fiddle parts. It changes my parts, it changes keyboard parts, because suddenly you find yourself in more of an orchestral sense.\n\nIt creates a more symphonic sound. If you take the violin away, all of a sudden the guitarist is just flashing, the keyboards are just playing away. You add that other dimension and suddenly you become more artistic in your approach.\n\nRock Cellar: You and Phil have been together since the first album. What\u2019s the secret of your longevity together?\n\nRich Williams: The top of the list would be tenacity. We grew up in the Midwest, family life. My dad met my mother in England during World War II. They married and remained married until their death. He had a job at a place called Baker Truck Rental before the war. He came back, Baker Truck Rental became Ryder Truck Rental. He remained with them until he retired. Phil\u2019s dad, he was a colonel in the Air Force. They travelled all over the world. His family life was very similar. He had one job, married until their death.\n\nWhat I learned was that sticking to a commitment is in my nature by birth and by example. We have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it. Things get tough, you stick with it. Things get good, you stick with it. I started at a certain age to take the next step: when something shitty happens, OK, fine, fuck it. Next step. I\u2019ve never quit anything. So that part isn\u2019t an effort. It\u2019s my nature.\n\nPeople ask, when are you going to retire, Rich? I go, what would you have me do? Play more golf? Stamp collecting? I\u2019ve got the best job on earth. And someone says, what do you do in your spare time? I practice. I\u2019ve got a guitar room with 30 guitars in it, a wall of amplifiers and my computer is all set up so I can prepare for the next show. That\u2019s what I do. And that\u2019s true for both of us.\n\nWe talked about it recently. It comes up once in awhile, after the pandemic especially. It\u2019s like, what do you think? Hey, I\u2019m in. Good, I\u2019m glad to hear that \u2019cause I am too. We will do this until we can\u2019t. Because we love to do it.\n\nRock Cellar: Let\u2019s do a Lightning Round. A Kansas song more people should have listened to.\n\nRich Williams: \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen.\u201d\n\nRock Cellar: What would be a great song for Kansas to cover?\n\nRich Williams: We have done some in the past. We did \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d with the London Symphony Orchestra. We did \u201cBringing It Back\u201d by J. J. Cale on the first album. A song that I always thought we\u2019d do great is \u201cSolsbury Hill\u201d by Peter Gabriel.\n\nRock Cellar: Favorite guitarist.\n\nRich Williams: Jeff Beck.\n\nRock Cellar: If you weren\u2019t in Kansas, what band, past or present, do you think you would have been a good fit for?\n\nRich Williams: AC/DC."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00469-2", "page_content": "Scientists and artists are working together as never before, finds a Nature poll. Both sides need to invest time, and embrace surprise and challenge.\n\nCenterbeam: MIT\u2019s iconic art\u2013science installation in 1977.Credit: Dietmar L\u00f6hrl/CAVS Special Collection, MIT\n\nExhilarating, challenging, enlightening, stimulating, inspiring, fun.\n\nThese were some of the words that Nature readers used to describe their experiences of art\u2013science collaborations in a series of articles on partnerships between artists and researchers. Nearly 40% of the roughly 350 people who responded to an accompanying poll said they had collaborated with artists; and almost all said they would consider doing so in future.\n\nSuch an encouraging result is not surprising. Public engagement has become essential to many research projects. Scientists are increasingly seeking out visual artists and designers to help them to communicate their work to new audiences. \u201cArtists help scientists reach a broader audience and make emotional connections that enhance learning,\u201d one respondent said. \u201cThe experience is very liberating for me, as a scientist,\u201d said another. \u201cThere\u2019s often a visual aspect to my science that generating and publishing data does not convey.\u201d\n\nOne example of how artists and scientists have together rocked the senses came last month when the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Australia performed a reworked version of Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons. They reimagined the 300-year-old score by injecting the latest climate prediction data for each season \u2014 provided by Monash University\u2019s Climate Change Communication Research Hub in Melbourne. The work was entitled The (Uncertain) Four Seasons, and variations of the score containing local data were sent to every major orchestra in the world. The performance was a creative call to action ahead of November\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.\n\nHow to shape a productive scientist\u2013artist collaboration\n\nAnother example is how researchers are able to \u2018walk\u2019 inside cells by incorporating nanometre-scale images from super-resolution microscopy into virtual-reality software (A. Spark et al. Nature Methods 17, 1097\u20131099; 2020). Researchers are also deploying scientific methods to study many aspects of literature and music.\n\nBut a genuine partnership must be a two-way street. Fewer artists than scientists responded to the Nature poll; however, several respondents noted that artists do not simply assist scientists with their communication requirements. Nor should their work be considered only as an object of study \u2014 even if these are reasons why scientists seek opportunities to work with artists. The alliances are most valuable when scientists and artists have a shared stake in a project, are able to jointly design it and can critique each other\u2019s work. Such an approach can both prompt new research as well as result in powerful art.\n\nMore than half a century ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) opened its Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) in Cambridge to explore the role of technology in culture. The centre was established during the Vietnam War, when many scientists in the United States were being criticized for working on defence contracts. Its founders believed that artists and scientists could, together, create a vision for a more humane world. They deliberately focused their projects around light \u2014 hence the \u2018visual studies\u2019 in the name. Light was a something that both artists and scientists had an interest in, and therefore could form the basis of collaboration, says Seth Riskin, a visual-arts researcher at the MIT Museum who previously worked at CAVS.\n\nHow the arts can help you to craft a successful research career\n\nAmong its many achievements, CAVS was responsible for Centerbeam, a 44-metre-long installation illustrating energy transfer. It included laser drawings against clouds of steam, holograms lit by mirrors tracking the Sun and huge nylon sculptures lifted into the air with helium-filled polyethylene tubing. As science and technology progressed, and divided into more sub-disciplines, the centre was simultaneously looking to a time when leading researchers could also be artists, writers and poets, and vice versa.\n\nNature\u2019s poll findings suggest that this trend is as strong as ever, but, to make a collaboration work, both sides need to be prepared to be surprised and challenged, to invest time in getting to know one another and to trust their different expertise. \u201cI enjoyed physics for its elegance and symmetry,\u201d a quantum physicist said in response to the poll. Their artist collaborator was drawn more to the messy reality of the process of science, which is not always reflected in popular science communication.\n\nThe reach of art\u2013science tie-ups needs to go beyond the necessary purpose of research communication, and participants must not fall into the trap of stereotyping each other. Artists and scientists alike are immersed in discovery and invention, and challenge and critique are core to both, too."}, {"url": "https://wrif.com/2023/02/10/kansas-guitarist-rich-williams-on-being-star-struck-meeting-the-rolling-stones/", "page_content": "My latest interviews featured Kansas guitarist, Rich Williams.

He would be one of those people where he wouldn\u2019t have been impressed because I would\u2019ve just stood there and stammered, and mumbled, and then he would\u2019ve finally just walked away just thinking I was an idiot.

And so we had played a few weeks earlier with them at the old, uh, football stadium in Cleveland. But at this particular show, there was a tent city built back to stage and uh, there was screens.

By the \u201880s, many of their peers had broken up, or faded away, or were aiming to get play on adult contemporary radio and VH1. But somehow, every time the Stones released an album in the \u201880s, it still felt like an event. And while their \u201880s output wasn\u2019t as revolutionary and world-changing as what they did during the prior decades, the Stones in the \u201880s still cranked out a number of classics, even as they released two of their weakest albums (Emotional Rescue and Dirty Work).

Hittman\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nJay Z: Renegade (2001)\n\nThe Jiggaman only handed out one guest spot on his sixth album, The Blueprint. Such was the jaw-dropping brilliance of Eminem\u2019s slew of stunningly dexterous verses, he arguably outshone the in-form Jay Z himself. Rival Nas certainly thought so, later rapping the infamous diss: \u201cEminem killed you on your own s__t.\u201d\n\nStan (featuring Elton John) (2001)\n\nEminem has pulled off no shortage of eye-opening collaborations in his career, but few can match the surprise that greeted this legendary rendition of \u201cStan\u201d alongside Elton John at the 2001 Grammy Awards. Long vilified for his seemingly homophobic lyrics, the stirring performance and post-song embrace with the openly gay singer saw Eminem answering his critics in inimitable style. Its inclusion on the deluxe edition of greatest hits release Curtain Call ensured its place among the best Eminen collaborations.\n\nEminem - Stan (Long Version) ft.

Given that both rapper and singer have admitted to being in abusive relationships in the past, the song is imbued with palpable feeling.

Ever the competitor, Eminem steps up to the challenge with a furiously inventive closing verse full of violence and comedy.\n\nDr. Dre: What\u2019s The Difference (featuring Eminem and Xzibit) (1999)\n\nAnother stand-out track from Dre\u2019s 2001, \u201cWhat\u2019s The Difference\u201d is a classic example of the conversational back and forth that have made collaborations between the pair so richly rewarding.

Those are the songs that brought us to the table. Without Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind, we wouldn\u2019t be around today.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls how in 1976, with the band deep in debt to their record label and facing an uncertain future after their first three albums (Kansas, Song for America and Masque) stiffed, they approached the recording of their fourth album, Leftoverture, with a sense of impending doom.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty dark time. We were bleeding money pretty seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were signed to Kirshner Records, and our benefactor, Don Kirshner, could have easily said, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s been fun, but you need to find another record company.\u2019 We needed a hit, and thank goodness we came up with Carry On Wayward Son. It saved us so we could go on. And then we had Dust in the Wind. Those songs exploded and our worlds changed forever.\u201d\n\nKansas were in a unique position in the mid Seventies. Not only did they represent the last trace of progressive rock on AM playlists that were suddenly ruled by disco, but they were also one of the very few purveyors of American prog, period.\n\n\u201cNot to sound pompous, but we pretty much gave birth to American prog bands,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is, we did it pretty sneakily. We were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d slip in one of our own tunes and tell the crowd that we were playing the B-side of Smoke on the Water. We\u2019d stretch songs out and go crazy, and the people loved it. It became our thing.\u201d\n\nWe were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material\n\nOf the seven current members of Kansas, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original crew. Singer Steve Walsh, who ended his on-and-off association with the band in 2014, has been replaced by two co-lead vocalists, Billy Greer and Ronnie Platt, who double on bass and keyboards, respectively.\n\nWilliams\u2019 longtime guitar foil Kerry Livgren, who also served as Kansas\u2019 chief songwriter, split in 2000, and in his place is New Jersey picker Zak Rizvi.\n\n(Image credit: Paul Natkin/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like a different band sometimes because we\u2019ve got a bunch of newer faces,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut at the same time, it feels like the original band because we\u2019ve got seven guys who really love to perform and create. Back in the day, we let money and business get in the way. This bunch of guys just wants to make music.\u201d\n\nThe band has a new album out, 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence, and all told, it sounds like quintessential Kansas: there\u2019s muscular, epic prog-rockers like Throwing Mountains and the eight-minute-plus title track, symphonic power ballads such as Jets Overhead and Memories Down the Line, and there\u2019s even a \u201chow-over-the-top-can-we-go?\u201d instrumental in the form of Propulsion 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of always in a state of having to prove ourselves,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe had to do it on our last album, [2016\u2019s] The Prelude Implicit, because it was our first new music in 16 years, and I think this time we had to prove that we still mean it.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a laugh, then adds, \u201cI imagine on the next one, we\u2019ll have to do the same thing. That\u2019s OK \u2013 I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\nBefore the band got started, who were the guitar players that you were really listening to and emulating?\n\n\u201cI was copying anybody who was there. The Yardbirds were pretty big to me. My introduction to blues wasn\u2019t through the Americans; I dug the British guys. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton \u2013 Clapton\u2019s first solo album was like Guitar 101 to me.\n\n\u201cInstead of this twangy rhythmic instrument, suddenly here\u2019s this ballsy guitar with a guttural saxophone lead voice. Suddenly, I was hearing blues in a different way. Of course, I also loved Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck \u2013 those guys made a big impression on me. That stuff really formed the basis of my sound and style.\u201c\n\nGrowing up in Topeka, was it easy for you to get good guitars living where you were?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I had Marshall amps and Les Pauls. I had a Gibson ES-335, which I still have to this day. Everything that you could buy in Los Angeles you could buy in Topeka. When I was 15, I had a charge account at the local music store. If I wanted something, I\u2019d charge it and make weekly payments on it.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty cool time. When The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, Topeka exploded, just like every other town in the country. Everybody had to be in a band. There was a garage band on every block.\u201c\n\nKansas played covers in clubs for a few years. Do you remember when you first heard prog from England and when it started to influence the band?\n\n\u201cIt took a while. For a time it seemed as if only the two coasts were hearing the prog stuff. Gradually the stations in Kansas started playing it \u2013 I guess somebody\u2019s ears were tuned to it. We\u2019d be like, 'Wow, have you heard this band called ELP?' Or 'Have you heard Genesis\u2019 Selling England by the Pound?'\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to find all these new, creative ways of addressing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t even know if 'rock \u2018n\u2019 roll' was the correct term for that music.\u201c\n\nSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it... We cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different\n\nEven so, it didn\u2019t seem as if American bands were jumping on the prog bandwagon. You guys were outliers.\n\n\u201cSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it. I mean, we played Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels-type stuff; we cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different. I remember playing cover songs during our club days. You\u2019d get to a part and be like, 'Man, this song sucks. I hate the middle part.'\n\n\u201cSo we started thinking that we could do some sort of interlude at the beginning, or maybe we could play the song at half-time. We did anything to change it up and put some balls to the music. In hindsight, we were doing something very important: We were learning how to be us.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns)\n\nDid it seem as if playing throughout your home state was a dead end? Did the band consider relocating to one of the two coasts to get noticed?\n\n\u201cWell, what happened was, we made a demo tape, and that\u2019s what we sent out to the coasts. One of them wound up on Don Kirshner\u2019s desk. The people at Don\u2019s company loved it \u2013 they really dug the violin \u2013 and they sent a guy named Wally Gold to check us out.\n\n\u201cWe put together a show and did that old free-beer trick: 'Come to the show and the drinks are free.' So Wally showed up and the place was packed; everybody was drunk and partying. So Wally called Don and said, 'Man, there\u2019s something going on here. People are crawling through the windows to get in the place.' That sealed the deal. Next thing you know, we signed a deal with Don Kirshner and were making records.\u201c\n\nLeftoverture [1976] and Point of Know Return [1977] hit one after the other. After being hitless for several years, that must have felt remarkable.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still here today doing this because of that explosion. We didn\u2019t really know how huge it was at the time. We were just blue-collar guys from the Midwest. I remember arriving at Madison Square Garden in a limo with our manager, and he was going, 'Madison Square Garden! This is so big!'\n\n\u201dWe were like, 'Yeah, yeah, whatever.' We\u2019d been on the road for so long, so to us this was just a natural progression of more and more shows. Today I realize how big it was, but back then we didn\u2019t really see it.\u201d\n\nHow much of Carry On Wayward Son had Kerry written before the band got to dive into it? And how long did it take to work out that intricate guitar and keyboard solo section?\n\n\u201cThat was the last song we did for the album, on the final day or recording. Kerry came in and said he had a new song. We learned the structure of it and got to it. The version you hear on the record is probably the first time we ever played it correctly.\n\n\u201cThe solo thing didn\u2019t take long. My approach to guitar is just wing it. I didn\u2019t really have a planned solo. I just responded to what everybody else was doing and threw stuff out there. I was kind of like, 'I\u2019ll just play stuff. Let me know if it sounds right.'\u201c\n\nFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression\n\nThe acoustic guitar figure of Dust in the Wind is so recognizable. I understand that Kerry wrote it as a fingerpicking exercise.\n\n\u201cYeah, Kerry didn\u2019t write the song to write a song; he wrote this chord pattern to teach himself fingerstyle guitar. His wife thought it was a song, and he was like, 'No, this isn\u2019t Kansas. The band would never play this.' But he brought it in and we thought it was really nice.\n\n\u201cThe figure was there; it didn\u2019t have the middle section or the violin solo. But it came together fast. I remember when we were listening back to it, somebody said, 'That\u2019s the next single.' Kerry didn\u2019t think so, but the rest of us knew. And sure enough \u2013 boom. The track exploded on the radio.\u201c\n\nThe way you approached the solo section of Wayward Son \u2013 is that still the way you compose leads in the studio? I\u2019m thinking of the title track of the new album, which has a similar solo structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same. What happens is, somebody lays something down and everybody else plays off of it. It\u2019s very collaborative, but not as instant as it was back in the day. Somebody else\u2019s solo will dictate what you\u2019re going to do, and you take inspiration from what they\u2019ve done to go somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to do it that way. I\u2019ll lay down the foundation, and then Zak will play something; Tom will do a smoking keyboard part. Sometimes we redo our parts based on what somebody does.\u201c\n\nThe riff in the song Throwing Mountains sounds as tough and mean as early grunge. Did any of that stuff ever make an impression on you?\n\n\u201dNot really at first. I could appreciate the honesty of grunge. It\u2019s like, I loved The Beatles for their polish, but I loved The Rolling Stones for their rawness. You listen to Bob Dylan \u2013 his recordings are very elementary, but they\u2019re honest.\n\n\u201dFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression. So you mention grunge and that song, sure, I\u2019ll take that. It reminds me of how punk obliterated disco back in the day. Let\u2019s get back to being raw.\u201d\n\nHow are you enjoying playing live with Zak Rizvi?\n\n\u201dOh, I\u2019m loving it. Zak has a deep love and knowledge of the band. He\u2019s a tremendous engineer and guitarist \u2013 just brilliant musically. He\u2019s a real scholar of music. Playing with him and having him in the band is great. There isn\u2019t much he can\u2019t play. I mean, he played trombone in a symphony. I have a blast working with him.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Steve Morse during his time in the band?\n\n\u201dWhat an interesting guy! When he came in, he had just won every guitar award imaginable; they had to invent awards to give him. I\u2019ll be honest: I was a little intimidated at first, but I was pleased to find out that he\u2019s the least intimidating man around. He\u2019s fascinated by everything.\n\n\u201dWe would be on tour, and we would see some crappy band playing at a Holiday Inn or wherever. We would be like, 'Let\u2019s go. This band sucks.' But Steve would say, 'Did you see what that guitar player just did with his on/off switch?' The guitarist wasn\u2019t even that good, but Steve was learning from him anyway.\u201d\n\n\ufeffFor a while you played PRS guitars, but I understand you\u2019ve moved back to Les Pauls now.\n\n\u201dI still play PRS guitars occasionally, but I got my hands on a Les Paul that blew me away. It\u2019s one of the Lee Roy Parnell signature models \u2013 a reissue of the \u201957 Goldtop \u2013 and it\u2019s fabulous.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s got a support in the back of the headstock, so if it falls over it won\u2019t break, and the heel has a cutaway so you can get up the neck a lot easier. I run that through a Fractal Axe-Fx III and I\u2019m good to go. I used to have to spend hours getting tones. Now I can just dial in the sound, and boom \u2013 let\u2019s play.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/music/5-times-taylor-swift-collaborated-with-other-artists-as-a-songwriter.html", "page_content": "Taylor Swift has proved her songwriting prowess on countless occasions.

His resume includes the likes of fashion titans like Louis Vuitton and Vogue, iconic musicians Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, and some of the most coveted clothing labels from around the world, not limited to Supreme, COMME des GAR\u00c7ONS and visvim.

The footwear was also adorned with a special graphic on the insole and outsole.\n\nTakashi Murakami x J Balvin Colores Album Artwork\n\nPrior to their collaboration, J Balvin had admittedly been wanting to work with Takashi Murakami for years. And seeing as the title of his fifth studio album was Colores, there was no better time to show color than through Murakami's signature flowers. In addition to the album artwork, Balvin and Murakami also teamed up on a range of Colores merch, consisting of T-shirts and hoodies.\n\nPORTER\n\nTakashi Murakami x PORTER FW19\n\nIn 2019, Murakami released a baggage collection with PORTER.

In place of the well-liked BBC graphics that we have seen season after season, one of Murakami's anime-inspired caricatures adorns the front of the tee.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Hajime Asaoka \"Death Takes No Bribe\" Tourbillon Watch\n\nIn 2013, Murakami put pen to paper with independent Japanese watchmaker Hajime Asaoka for a custom timepiece. Thematically, the phrase \u201cDeath Takes No Bribe\" served as the main inspiration for the project, which is characterized by dark flower and skull imagery in Murakami\u2019s trademark style. The covetable watch made its premiere at the Academie Horlogere des Createurs Independants watch fair in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Kaws for Christie's\n\nRenowned as visual artists in their own rights, Takashi Murakami teamed up with Brian Donnely aka KAWS and Christie's auction house to raise funds for victims of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the northeastern part of Japan in 2011.

What's more - Murakami himself joined in the parade, but not before throwing on a flower costume of his own design.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Britney Spears for POP Magazine\n\nA 2010 issue of British fashion imprint POP Magazine featured this mashup of Britney Spears and Takashi Murakami visuals. Although the publication is headquartered in the UK, the cover features a quintessentially Japanese style of imagery. Perhaps an unexpected choice for the \"Oops, I Did It Again\" songstress, yet the result was oddly memorable.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Casio G-SHOCK Frogman Watch\n\nFor art collectors that may be used to paying tens of thousands of dollars for a Murakami original, the price tag of this collaboration alongside G-SHOCK must have been a breath of fresh air. Limited to 300 pieces and originally retailing for around $4,000 when it dropped in 2010, the Frogman iteration came in a custom display case and featured the subtle use of Murakami graphics throughout.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Kirsten Dunst x McG \"Akihabara Majokko Princess\"\n\n2009's exhibition at London's Tate Modern museum, \"Pop Life: Art in a Material World,\" included a somewhat unexpected partnership between Takashi and Kirsten Dunst, who provided the vocals for a cover of \"Turning Japanese\" by the English new wave rock band The Vapors. The cover was included in a four-minute film directed by one of Hollywood's biggest commercial directors McG, while the video itself showed Dunst donning a blue wig and bright pink skirt.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Louis Vuitton\n\nCertainly one of the most prolific collaborations in Murakami's career, this project with Louis Vuitton saw Murakami graphics used on a range of Louis bags, while the highlight of the collaboration was arguably the range of custom Monogramouflage patterned pieces. With Marc Jacobs at the helm of the initiative, the collaboration was by-and-large a huge success for Louis Vuitton, as well as for Murakami, who was propelled further into the public eye.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Pharrell Williams \"The Simple Things\"\n\nFor Art Basel Miami, Murakami linked up once again with Pharrell, while the duo brought Jacob the Jeweller on board to produce a rather schizophrenic sculpture titled Simple Things. Crafted from glass fiber, steel, acrylic, wood, LED lights and various objects (a bottle of Heinz ketchup, a Billionaire Boys Club sneaker, a bag of Doritos and a cupcake) made of gold, set with rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds, the illustrious sculpture never actually went on sale.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x VISVIM KEIFER Hi-Suede \"Multi Flower\"\n\nAlthough it wasn't the only occasion that Murakami was tapped by visvim for a sneaker, this \"Multi Flower\" iteration of the VISVIM KEIFER Hi-Suede silhouette was produced circa 2008. As per Murakami's modus operandi, a floral pattern dominates the upper of the hi-top sneaker, which also spills over onto the tongue.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Supreme Skate Decks\n\nSupreme has a penchant like none other for picking the best and brightest collaborative partners. In 2007, Takashi Murakami joined the ranks of Todd James, Peter Saville, Larry Clark, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists who have collaborated with the legendary New York-based brand. A total of three decks were released, once again utilizing the anime-inspired characters from Murakami's past archive of works.\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nTakashi Murakami x Vogue x COMME des GAR\u00c7ONS\n\nIn 2009, Takashi Murakami linked up with Vogue Nippon and COMME des GAR\u00c7ONS to produce materials for a Tokyo-based pop-up shop. One of Murakami's signature characters was worked into a limited T-shirt, which was cooked up to celebrate the opening of the so-called \u201cMagazine Alive\u201d store, which at the time purveyed goods from UNDERCOVER and Maison Margiela, as well as goods bearing manga likenesses of Hedi Slimane, Marc Jacobs, and Donatella Versace."}, {"url": "https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2021/08/29/donda-tracklist-features/", "page_content": "Kanye West\u2019s long-awaited album, Donda, is officially here as of August 29th, 2021.
