And we\u2019re just going to get better together.\u201d\n\nIf King seems like just another one of the guys, it\u2019s because \u2014 for a long time \u2014 he was.\n\nHis NHL playing career spanned 830 games over 14 seasons with four teams. It was highlighted by a successful run with the Islanders: He scored 40 goals in 1991-92, 38 in 1992-93 and 30 in 1993-94.\n\nAs late as 1998-99, King was a valuable veteran scorer on a Maple Leafs team that went to the Eastern Conference finals. Along the way, he learned from legendary coaches such as Al Arbour and Pat Quinn, whom he named as major influences on his career today.\n\n\u201cI drove these coaches nuts; now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts,\u201d he joked.\n\nHis legacy as a player even impressed Patrick Kane.\n\n\u201cHe had 612 points in 830 career games, so he obviously was an effective player,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWhen you see that and know that he played in the NHL for a long time, that respect comes right away.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Kane] probably looked me up, saw my points total and just swiped right,\u201d King said. \u201cI [told him], \u2018After 1,000 points, you lose count.\u2019 When you have the least amount of points like I have, you remember every point.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s message to the Blackhawks has been to simply act like players again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [about] just being relaxed,\u201d he said. \u201c[It\u2019s about] not stressing over mistakes or coming back to the bench feeling just burnt out because we\u2019re hemmed in our end again or we\u2019re down 3-0 or whatever the situation is.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018Just take a deep breath and go out there and play hockey.\u2019 They\u2019ve been doing it their whole life. The game hasn\u2019t changed. . . . The nets haven\u2019t moved. Just go have fun.\u201d\n\nThat spirit has resonated. The Hawks certainly needed the lift. The cumulative weight of the sexual-assault scandal, their awful record and ex-coach Jeremy Colliton\u2019s frustrations had taken a toll. Already, the team\u2019s mood seems happier.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to the mental side,\u201d Connor Murphy said. \u201cWhen things are going tough, you\u2019re overthinking usually. And the first thing [King] told us is to ease off of our mind and don\u2019t think so much. . . . Once you can work hard and be free, good things start to happen.\u201d\n\nIf King also seems to coach with a minor-league style, that\u2019s because \u2014 until this past weekend \u2014 that\u2019s what he did.\n\nAs Rockford IceHogs coach, the best players he worked with daily were prospects such as Lukas Reichel and Alex Nylander. Winning was important but secondary to maturation and improvement. King would \u201cyap at\u201d his players after miscues but promptly send them back out to redeem themselves.\n\nAnd after 12-plus seasons of AHL coaching, King felt content doing that forever.\n\n\u201cI should say, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s been my dream since I was 5 [to be an NHL coach],\u2019 \u201d King said. \u201cBut, no, it wasn\u2019t. . . . If it came to me, I wasn\u2019t going to say no. But I wasn\u2019t going to go search for it.\u201d\n\nInterim general manager Kyle Davidson\u2019s call Saturday, however, changed his plans.\n\nAnd although King\u2019s playing and minor-league coaching experiences do shape his approach, he\u2019s fully capable of being an NHL coach \u2014 of handling the fun parts, which come naturally, and the hard parts.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for me is accountability,\u201d he said. \u201c[If players] work hard, play the game right and don\u2019t cheat it, we\u2019ll be fine. If you don\u2019t do that, then the accountability is going to kick in. You\u2019re going to hear from me.\u201d\n\nKing already adjusted the team\u2019s practice tempo. Under Colliton, the Hawks typically stayed on the ice for an hour or more, but many drills involved only a handful of players while others waited their turns. King\u2019s first practice Monday lasted only 30 minutes but kept everyone in constant motion.\n\nKing and Crawford changed the lines, as well. The team\u2019s top offensive players have been concentrated in the top two lines \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s common sense,\u201d King said \u2014 instead of spread out like under Colliton. King is particularly emphatic about Kane and Alex DeBrincat playing together.\n\nAfter a \u201chectic\u201d first few days in Chicago, King returned to Rockford on Monday night to decompress at a dinner with his family.\n\nHis 13-year-old twins showed him Instagram memes comparing him to \u201cTed Lasso\u201d and Walter White in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But King, as always, had no problem laughing it off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve [heard the] \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 thing before \u2014 I might have to try to grow my hair back to change that image,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cBut the \u2018Ted Lasso\u2019 thing was pretty good.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/k/kingde01.html", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow old is Derek King?\n\nDerek King is 56 years old.\n\nWhen was Derek King born?\n\nDerek King was born on February 11, 1967.\n\nWhere was Derek King born?\n\nDerek King was born in Hamilton, Canada.\n\nHow tall is Derek King?\n\nDerek King is 6-1 (185 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Derek King weigh when playing?\n\nDerek King weighed 203 lbs (92 kg) when playing.\n\nIs Derek King in the Hockey Hall of Fame?\n\nDerek King has not been elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nHow many goals did Derek King have?\n\nDerek King had 261 goals over his career.\n\nHow many points did Derek King have?\n\nDerek King had 612 points over his career.\n\nHow many Stanley Cups has Derek King won?\n\nDerek King has never won a Stanley Cup as a player.\n\nWhen did Derek King retire?\n\nDerek King last played in 2000."}, {"url": "https://calbears.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/derek-king/10224", "page_content": "As a Senior (2017-18): Saw time in three games\u2026Capped off his Cal career with a personal-best 5-point performance in 2 minutes against Stanford at the Pac-12 Tournament, going 2-3 from the floor, including 1-2 from downtown; Also added a rebound\u2026Saw action at home against Washington on Senior Day, tallying his first career rebound\u2026Made his season debut against CSUN\u2026Also played in the exhibition over Providence\n\n\n\nAs a Junior (2016-17): Saw time in one game, debuting on Feb. 24 against Oregon State, tallying one minute of action with one three-point attempt\n\nPrior to Cal: Began college at San Diego Christian College, where he redshirted\u2026Transferred to Foothill Junior College under head coach Matt Stanley and Jimmy Herrera\u2026Led Foothill to an upset No. 1 seed Fresno City College in the playoffs after hitting a last-minute three to seal the game on Foothill\u2019s run to the state\u2019s Elite 8\u2026.Scored a season-high 27 points against Skyline College\u2026Averaged 10.0 ppg, 2.7 rpg and 1.7 apg in his last season at Foothill, starting all 27 contests\u2026Earned the Scholar-Athlete Award with a 3.7 GPA\n\nHigh School/Club: Graduated from Santa Teresa High School in 2012\u2026Averaged 16.0 ppg and won CCS against Serra High School\u2026First Team All-League selection\u2026Played his freshman season at SMIC Private School in Shanghai, China, where he was named Team MVP and First Team All-SISAC (Shanghai International Schools Activities Conference)\n\nPersonal: Parents are William and Lea King\u2026Has one younger sister, Emily, who attends Stanford\n\nMajor: Following graduation, would like to play basketball professionally in China or Taiwan"}, {"url": "https://ebiographypost.com/sports/coaches/derek-king-bio-net-worth-wife-children", "page_content": "Derek King is a one-time Canadian professional ice hockey player who competed from 1986 to 2000 as a left winger in the National Hockey League. He currently serves the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL as an assistant coach.\n\nNew fans of the ice hockey professional might be eager to learn about him. So, let's get to know more about Derek King and see how he went from playing to coaching in this biography.\n\nAn\u017ee Kopitar Biography - Hockey Player\n\nDerek King Net Worth And Career\n\nIncluding his career as an athlete and a coach, the former left winger has been actively involved in hockey for over 35 years. He must have bagged a massive fortune throughout the years. Likewise, Derek King's net worth must be immense.\n\nThe sportsman was drafted 13th overall by the New York Islanders in the NHL Entry Draft in 1985 and made his NHL debut in the 1986-87 season. He also played for Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues of NHL. In addition, he also competed for different teams in leagues other than NHL. For example, King played for Grand Rapids Griffins in IHL and AHL and Oshawa Generals in the OHL. In his career as an NHL athlete, he played 830 games, scored 261 goals and 351 assists, and earned 612 points.\n\nNow, let's look at some of Derek's playing statistics in the table below:\n\nSeason Team Games Played Goals Scored Points 1996\u201397 New York Islanders 70 23 53 1997\u201398 Toronto Maple Leafs 77 21 46 1998\u201399 Toronto Maple Leafs 81 24 52\n\nTable Source: NHL Official Website\n\nAfter retiring from playing, the Hamilton native started his career as a coach in August 2009, when he became the assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, the AHL affiliate team of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Five years later, in 2014, he was promoted to associate coach. Then, in July 2015, Derek became the OHL's Owen Sound Attack's assistant coach. However, he left the team in just three months, in October.\n\nFinally, in July 2016, King was named an assistant coach of the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League, which is the minor league affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. He was later promoted to the interim head coach of the IceHogs on November 6, 2018. Eventually, he landed his first head coaching position at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe 1967-born sportsperson became the interim head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL on November 2, 2021. Just a day later, he earned his first win with the Blackhawks, defeating the Nashville Predators. Sadly, he was let go from the position on June 27, 2022. However, on July 11, 2022, Chicago Blackhawks announced Derek's return as an assistant coach for the 2022-23 season.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, veteran assistant coaches, with little head coaching experience, earn between $500,000 and $700,000 per year. Since King also previously served as a head coach, he must also earn in a similar range. Hence, Derek King's net worth must be a significant amount.\n\nLikewise, John Gibson is another sports celebrity with a massive net worth.\n\nDerek King Is Happily Married\n\nAs the title suggests, the Canadian coach enjoys a blissful marital life with his partner. But unfortunately, little to no information about his beloved spouse is known to the public as of now. Even the name of his missus has not been disclosed yet, making it hard to find her on social media. In addition, Mrs. King completely stays away from the limelight. Perhaps she prefers to keep a low profile.\n\nNonetheless, Derek has talked about his other half a few times in some of his interviews. Once in an interview with Chicago Tribune, while talking about how hectic his NHL schedule is, he revealed that Mrs. King controlled everything and got everything figured out. He also added that she is a huge supporter of his career. Hopefully, we will get to learn more about Derek King's wife in the future.\n\nProud Father Of Three\n\nThe former left winger and his spouse are parents of three lovely boys. Their eldest is D.J. King, who was born on August 7, 2000, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Derek King's son is pursuing a career in hockey and following in his footsteps. He is a professional hockey player who competes in the East Coast Hockey League as a Defense for the Fort Wayne Komets.\n\nDerek King shares three lovely sons with his wife. Image Source: Derek King's Twitter.\n\nDerek King's other children are a set of twins who arrived when he was living in Arizona. But, as in the case of his wife, along with their birth details, the names of his baby boys remain a mystery. Regardless, according to the coach's bio on his Twitter account, his younger kids also love the game of hockey. They often go to the Rockford Hockey Club rink for games and practices. So, could the twins be planning on becoming ice hockey players in the future?\n\nIs From Hamilton\n\nThe coach was welcomed by his parents on February 11, 1967, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Sadly, information regarding Derek King's mother and father, including their names, has yet to be revealed. Likewise, he has not disclosed much about his other family members. Perhaps, his parents and siblings are people of privacy and want to stay away from the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, not much has been made known about the assistant coach himself. Due to this reason, it is difficult to learn about his childhood. It seems he is also a secretive person and isn't eager to share about his life before starting his hockey career.\n\nWell, it's unfortunate that Derek King has not opened up much about his personal life. Hopefully, we will learn about his parents, wife, and children in the days ahead. Nonetheless, with his fortune likely to grow with his career, he must enjoy a comfortable life. We wish him and his close ones lead a happy and prosperous life in the future.\n\nTrivia And Facts"}, {"url": "https://members.servicenation.com/info/serviceworldexpo/DerekDaly.html", "page_content": "Complete Champion Culture: Driving to the Limits of Possibility\n\nKeynote: 9:00AM | Oct 26\n\nRemember Good to Great?

It was an optional skate at the Honda Center in Anaheim, and Arvid S\u00f6derblom \u2014 the only goaltender who took the ice \u2014 already was back in the locker room, so the Blackhawks were using a very basic \u201cshooter tutor,\u201d a simple mesh net that filled up most of the goal, with small openings along the top shelf, two more below where the goalie\u2019s glove and blocker would be, and a five-hole slot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blackhawks \u2014 well, the third- and fourth-liners who didn\u2019t choose to take the option that afternoon \u2014 kept drawing iron or hitting the net. They were making this thing look like Tony Esposito. So King \u2014 a 40-goal scorer 30 years ago \u2014 called for the puck himself, and promptly tucked it into the top-left corner on the first try. The players cheered, and King smiled broadly as he swung around the net, very much in his element.\n\nThis is what King likes doing best \u2014 working with players, teaching and actually coaching. And this is what he didn\u2019t do enough of last season. There was always somewhere else to be, something else to do, someone else to talk to.\n\n\u201cYou look at Luke (Richardson) and he\u2019s doing a good job of it \u2014 he\u2019s coaching, right?\u201d King said following that practice last Friday. \u201cI kind of got away from that last year. I had to do media, or I had to be here, or I\u2019m about to be there, I have to put out fires, I have to get ready and everything. I managed my time maybe not as good as I should have.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that King didn\u2019t enjoy his stint as the Blackhawks\u2019 interim head coach following Jeremy Colliton\u2019s firing in early November last season. Nor is it to say King isn\u2019t proud of the work he did in taking over a moribund team at arguably the nadir of franchise history and almost singlehandedly flipping the vibe around while turning it into a competitive squad. Nor does it mean King didn\u2019t want to keep the job. He very much wanted to keep the job.\n\nBut this is where he\u2019s happiest. This is where he\u2019s doing the most good. This is where he belongs. The title is almost irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps no one else in the league would have accepted an assistant coaching job with the same team for which he was just the head coach.\n\nDerek King. (Bill Smith / NHL I via Getty Images)\n\nBut perhaps no one in the league is quite like Derek King. He\u2019s an anomaly in the NHL. There\u2019s no ego there, no chip on his shoulder, no sneering defiance burning within. Even as head coach, as the voice of the team, there was no spin, no polish, no false veneer to hide behind. He is exactly what he looks like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what he looks like is a guy who\u2019s really enjoying himself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people have said to me \u2014 \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d King said. \u201cThey think I should be like, \u2018Screw you! You don\u2019t think I can coach?\u2019 But that has nothing to do with it. They feel I can help and they wanted to keep me on. And why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nReally, there are plenty of reasons why he wouldn\u2019t. For one, yeah, it\u2019s hard not to be at least a little insulted when a team picks someone else to take your job \u2014 general manager Kyle Davidson gave King \u201cthe old we\u2019re going in a different direction speech,\u201d King said. For another, just about every assistant coach in the league harbors dreams of becoming a head coach in the NHL, King included. And the chances of a demoted former interim coach becoming the head coach of that same team seem awfully slim. Especially when the new coach is just starting a four-year contract and has the kind of long leash that only comes with an openly declared rebuild. Surely, the path back to bench boss would be more navigable as an assistant on another NHL team. Then there\u2019s the ego hit that comes with walking into the same room with the same players as an assistant coach after being the top guy for nearly a full season.\n\nKing shrugged all of that off.\n\n\u201cHaving the opportunity to stay with the organization and be a part of this rebuild, I didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d King said. \u201cThis is where I started right? This is what I was. I was the assistant coach. I did skills after practice, I worked with guys individually, I got into the video and stuff. So now I\u2019m back doing all that, and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I missed it.\u201d\n\nDavidson knew King was wired differently than most coaches, and he knew he wanted him back on staff. But ultimately, he wasn\u2019t sure King \u2014 or Richardson \u2014 would be comfortable with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even really our call,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe said to Luke, \u2018You know what, your staff is your business. But this guy is a great guy, and he\u2019s got a great way with players, and I think he could be a really good counterpoint. But you\u2019ve got to talk to him and you\u2019ve got to feel the same way.\u2019\u201d\n\nRichardson didn\u2019t need much prodding. The two played against each other in the Ontario Hockey League, both broke into the NHL at the same time in 1987-88, had long and successful NHL careers (21 years for Richardson, 13 for King), and then coached against each other in the American Hockey League. They respected each other well enough that Richardson didn\u2019t even need to get mutual buddy Dallas Eakins\u2019 blessing before offering him the job.\n\nFacing both reality and a long-term rebuild, Richardson wanted to build a more modern coaching staff to suit today\u2019s young players \u2014 one built on hands-on teaching and open communication, not fire and brimstone. King fit the mold perfectly, and his knowledge of most of the roster from his time in Chicago and as Rockford\u2019s head coach made it an easy call.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have a personality as a coaching staff that we can teach and not be yelling and screaming and demanding things that are unachievable at this moment,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWe wanted to build and teach and learn and work well together and have a calmer demeanor doing that, so we can get that point across. After a while, players just tune that out if you\u2019re always yelling and screaming. And so I thought it was a good fit. I think it\u2019s working out really well.\u201d\n\nWhen Davidson had settled on Richardson and had given King the \u201cdifferent direction\u201d spiel, King asked about his contract. Davidson, hoping that Richardson would indeed want King on his staff, told King not to worry about that just yet, because Richardson was likely to call.\n\nKing spent a couple of days mulling the offer with his wife and three sons. But deep down, he knew what his answer was going to be the moment Richardson made the offer.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d King said. \u201cAnd plus, I didn\u2019t have to update my resume and chum it out and make phone calls. I\u2019ve been through that. The fact that he wanted me and management still wanted me, I thought, well, that\u2019s a good thing, right? That\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Davidson got to essentially hire a coach he really liked, fire a coach he really liked, yet somehow keep both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely surprised (King accepted the job) because he has no ego,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd I think he genuinely loves being part of the organization, he liked how we do things and how we operate. It\u2019s a testament to the person that he is and the lack of ego that he has that he was willing to do it. He saw that it was a good situation with a good head coach and he could still be involved at the NHL level and really help us push this thing forward. So yes and no. I was a little surprised, but I was relieved that he wanted to stay.\u201d\n\nAnd hey, King might have been demoted, but he got a new three-year contract out of it \u2014 and a raise.\n\n\u201cPretty good deal,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nAssistants are critical to running a successful team \u2014 working on individual skills, running special-teams meetings, cleaning up messes and soothing bruised egos left by the head coach. But unlike coordinators in football, they operate out of the limelight. So assuming his five months as interim coach were his last as head coach of the Blackhawks, King is likely to go down as a mere footnote in franchise history.\n\nBut what he accomplished in those five months shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\n\nKing arrived from Rockford on a Saturday morning in November to take over a team that entered the season with playoff hopes but started 1-9-2, that had just played one of the worst games imaginable in a pathetic 5-1 loss in Winnipeg, just 11 days after the Jenner & Block report laid bare all the franchise\u2019s sins in one of the darkest days in franchise history.\n\nInto a sullen and embittered locker room walked this soft-spoken, self-deprecating, folksy guy with wacky uncle energy, an arsenal of dad jokes and zero NHL coaching experience. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mood changed dramatically. Instantly. The Blackhawks won their first four games under King. Players started having fun again. They never had a chance of sniffing contention after that horrid start, but King managed to salvage the season to an unlikely degree. He convinced his players to loosen up a bit out there. He reinforced his mantra of \u201chabits protect you,\u201d constantly reminding players that if they have good habits on the ice, their mistakes will be minimal and minimized. He tweaked the way the Blackhawks played in the neutral zone and the defensive zone. He was critical when necessary, but encouraging always. He was unceasingly honest, even when it meant being harsh \u2014 whether he was talking to a player one-on-one or in a press conference.\n\nHe might not have been the biggest Xs and Os guy, but he fundamentally changed the team all the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just his personality,\u201d said Reese Johnson, who played for King in Rockford and Chicago. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes him a good coach and gives him a good relationship with the players. He knows when to be critical and he knows when to keep you going. He has good balance. I think Kinger did an unbelievable job going from head coach in Rockford to head coach in Chicago, and now to assistant coach. The one that thing stands out to me the most is throughout those years, he\u2019s just always been himself. He really hasn\u2019t changed throughout his roles.\u201d\n\nKing behind the bench during the 2021-22 season. (Steph Chambers / Getty Images)\n\nBut King had been thrown straight into the deep end, and really, he was just trying to keep his head above water. As head coach in Rockford, he basically managed a staff of one and only had to answer to the local PR guy and Rockford GM Mark Bernard. His job was to develop players; everything else was secondary, even winning. In Chicago, in his own words, \u201cEverybody\u2019s watching, and everybody\u2019s judging.\u201d\n\nSo he leaned on assistant coach and former head coach Marc Crawford \u2014 the only holdover from Colliton\u2019s staff \u2014 to handle much of the job. Crawford often ran practices. Crawford handled a lot of the Xs and Os. Crawford even chose King\u2019s second assistant coach, Rob Cookson, because King didn\u2019t really know anybody around the league. The hours got away from him, he wasn\u2019t getting his own workouts in the way he\u2019d like, and the commute to see his family back in Rockford took a toll on him (and on his wife, who was often dealing with the three boys while King stayed in a place he had in Chicago).\n\nKing loved every second of it. But he felt every second of it, too.\n\n\u201cIt was tiring,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking back on it, King can see what he did right and what he could have done better, how he could have made things easier on himself and had a better work-life balance. But he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call them regrets. He knows the challenge he faced, and how improbable (if modest) his success was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of it, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I change things? Sure, I would, knowing what I know now. That\u2019s natural. But going into it, I felt I did what I needed to do, and what I felt was the right thing. So I sleep at night.\u201d\n\nAs that practice in Anaheim wound down, King was one of the last guys off the ice, lingering to work on some skills work with the stragglers. Richardson had long left; the press was waiting, and there were probably a dozen other things he had to handle before heading back to the hotel. It\u2019s Richardson who has to tell guys that they\u2019ll be scratched or sent to Rockford. It\u2019s Richardson who has to delegate assignments to his staff. It\u2019s Richardson who has to meet with Davidson to discuss the depth chart. It\u2019s Richardson who has to sit down with team leaders and get the pulse of the room. It\u2019s Richardson who has to handle the surprisingly sprawling bureaucracy of running an NHL locker room.\n\nIt used to be King who did all that. But now King gets to be the good cop, bucking a player up after the head coach has to break him down a bit. Now King gets to have the time to sit down with a player one-on-one to go over the little details of a botched power play, or to reinforce the habits of a good penalty kill. Now King gets to linger on the ice and fire off one-timers.\n\nIt\u2019s all a little less difficult this season for King. He moved his family to the western suburb of Glen Ellyn; his kids love the high school and his twins play hockey at Johnny\u2019s IceHouse West, just a few blocks from the United Center. He\u2019s found that work-life balance that he never managed last season, not after suddenly being thrust into someone else\u2019s burning house and handed a watering can.\n\n\u201cThe hours are still there, but it\u2019s maybe not quite as stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I need to do, how I can help. I ask (Richardson) what he needs. I come in the morning, do my stuff, leave and go home. It\u2019s been great. I\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d\n\nWould King love to be the Blackhawks\u2019 head coach? Of course, he would. Does he think he deserved the job? Of course, he does. Will he try to become a head coach in the NHL again? Of course, he will. But while most coaches wouldn\u2019t be caught dead accepting a demotion and would instead defiantly storm off into the unknown in search of another job, King isn\u2019t like most coaches.\n\nHe was offered a job in the NHL. In an organization he knew well. With a roster full of players he cared about. To work for a coach he respected and liked. To do what he loves best \u2014 to teach, to grind, to coach.\n\nAnd what\u2019s so bad about that?\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Rockford, I never even thought about (an NHL job),\u201d King said. \u201cBut once I got it and I got comfortable and it was the end of the year, I\u2019m like, \u2018This ain\u2019t a bad gig.\u2019 So whether it\u2019s as a head guy or as an assistant, it\u2019s the NHL. It\u2019s pretty nice. It\u2019s been great this year, it honestly has. I can\u2019t think of one negative thing about it.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Derek King: John J.

He potted 108 goals for the New York Islanders during those three seasons \u2014 more than Wayne Gretzky, more than Jaromir Jagr, more than Mark Messier, more than Steve Larmer, more than Tony Amonte.\n\nDuring that three-season span, King never went more than seven games without a goal. Heck, he rarely went more than two or three.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the following season, 1994-95, King scored in the third and fourth games after the lockout ended, then had just one goal in his next 14 games. In 1995-96, he had one goal in his first 17 games, then later had an 11-game goal-less drought. In 1996-97, he had a stretch of one goal in 20 games and another of two goals in 17. In 1997-98, he had one goal in 17 games, then a 12-game drought. He finished those last two seasons with 26 and 21 goals, respectively and respectably.\n\nSo the Blackhawks\u2019 interim coach knows exactly how Jonathan Toews feels. And Patrick Kane. And Dominik Kubalik. And Kirby Dach.\n\nFrustrated. Furious. Flailing and fishing for answers.\n\n\u201cI was streaky,\u201d King said. \u201cI drove coaches nuts. When I was on a streak, it was fun. When I wasn\u2019t on a streak, I did the same thing (as them): I started second-guessing myself.\u201d\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s spirited 4-3 shootout win over the first-place Capitals, Kane now has one goal in 11 games. Dach hasn\u2019t scored in 15 straight. Toews hadn\u2019t scored in 15 months. And Kubalik\u2019s power-play goal in Washington was his first tally in 16 games. That\u2019s four of the top six mired in prolonged scoring droughts for a team that doesn\u2019t have much scoring beyond that top six. It\u2019s kind of a problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have a grayness in my beard,\u201d King said, stroking his chin beneath a wry smile.\n\nBut King\u2019s experience as a player has informed his upbeat, don\u2019t-sweat-it philosophy. It also makes that philosophy an easier sell to players who might be less willing to hear it from a coach with less playing experience.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, I think the squeezing of the stick is just your confidence \u2014 you don\u2019t feel like you could score anymore,\u201d King said. \u201cI always say it\u2019s like riding the bike. Having (not) ridden a bike for 20 years, once you get on the bike that first time and start pedaling, you find out you can do it still. It\u2019s the same (for) goal scorers. Guys that are just naturally skilled or are good goal scorers, you don\u2019t lose it. The only thing you lose is that confidence. So the big thing for them is try to be composed, don\u2019t put pressure on yourself, and just play. But usually, it takes a defenseman shooting the puck and it hits you in the butt or off your head or shoulder, it\u2019s like a crazy goal that goes in, and then all of a sudden you just take a deep breath and you\u2019re like, \u2018All right, I\u2019m on the scoresheet.\u2019 That\u2019s the biggest thing. Just getting on the scoresheet helps so much.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s a challenge to stay positive amid a goal drought. I wrote at length about the internal struggle every player deals with at some point in their career and how difficult \u2014 and sometimes, as King alluded to, random \u2014 it can be to bust out of it.\n\nAs Dach put it, \u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I said it doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d But in video sessions with King and his staff, the focus hasn\u2019t been on missed opportunities. Rather, it\u2019s been on all the positive things that are happening during their shifts. A good defensive play here, a nice pass there, a quality zone entry here. All the little things that should \u2014 and eventually will, if mathematical regression has anything to say about it \u2014 add up to goals.\n\nFor Kubalik, the law of averages finally might have kicked in during the second period, when he scored a power-play goal off the rush to put the Blackhawks up 2-1. You could almost see the weight lift off his shoulders with his ferocious fist-pump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying right now,\u201d Kubalik said before the game. \u201cAlways trying to watch my shifts with the coaches and talk most of the time about the positive things, especially away from the puck. Obviously, it\u2019s nice to do something that brings us success. But on the other side, you\u2019re not going to score every night, so you\u2019ve got to find a way to help the team in other ways.\u201d\n\nThe pressure on Kubalik has been even greater than on the other three slumping stars. He\u2019ll be a restricted free agent this summer, and interim general manager Kyle Davidson is still trying to determine whether Kubalik will be part of the Blackhawks\u2019 future. If he starts scoring again, he should get his first big multiyear payday, a raise from his current cap hit of $3.7 million. He\u2019d also become a more attractive trade chip who could get sent to a contender ahead of the trade deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it stands, he\u2019s suddenly a third-liner (with Henrik Borgstr\u00f6m and Jujhar Khaira instead of Toews and Brandon Hagel) with one five-on-five goal all season.\n\nBut Kubalik, generally an upbeat guy, said his future isn\u2019t on his mind.\n\n\u201cI (didn\u2019t) even think about it the years before,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just another year. It\u2019s the first normal year for me in the NHL, which is nice, finally. I know that my starts of the seasons the last two years weren\u2019t good, too, and I always found a way to come back. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nHe has a point. Like King outside of those three dynamite seasons, Kubalik has been streaky since coming to the NHL. Last year, he scored in just two of the first 15 games before scoring 14 in the next 35, and even that stretch included droughts of five, four and four games. As a rookie, he had eight goals in his first 34 games before ripping off 21 goals in his next 29 games. That, of course, coincided with his rise from the third line to the top line, however. This year, Kubalik has been in the top six pretty much all season until recently, and he hasn\u2019t produced.\n\nThis time around, King\u2019s hoping the line demotion will spark him.\n\n\u201cHopefully, that gets him working in the offensive zone a little harder, because those guys will push that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll make him come and help in the corners and stuff, and I think when he does that, he\u2019ll create more opportunities for himself.\u201d\n\nOffensively, that\u2019s where the Blackhawks are \u2014 throwing anything against the wall and hoping it sticks the puck in the net. Kubalik on a grinder line? Sure. Uniting Kane and Toews on the top line? Go for it. Dropping Alex DeBrincat to the second power-play unit, giving Kubalik a mirror image one-timer in the opposite circle? Why not? Putting Dach between the built-in chemistry of DeBrincat and Dylan Strome? Can\u2019t hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis deep in the hole, and this deep into the droughts, it\u2019s just a matter of trusting the work, trusting the law of averages and trusting the coach when he says to relax. It finally worked for Kubalik. It\u2019ll eventually work for the others. It has to, right?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a puck go in, obviously,\u201d said Toews, who made a vintage power move to the net in the first period, only to hit the post, and was later robbed by Vitek Vanecek. \u201cI definitely like scoring goals. So I\u2019d like to get going in that area. Just got to keep working through it. I\u2019m not really sure what else to say at this point.\u201d\n\nToews said that 10 days ago. He could have said it 10 minutes ago. He \u2014 and Kubalik, and Kane, and Toews \u2014 can only hope he\u2019s not still saying it 10 days from now.\n\nFive thoughts and observations\n\n1. Nobody wants to be known as a low-event hockey team. But with their third straight strong defensive performance \u2014 and their first win in Washington in nearly 16 years \u2014 that appears to be the Blackhawks\u2019 new identity.\n\nJust don\u2019t say it out loud.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying, (but) I don\u2019t want to say our identity is low-event hockey,\u201d King said. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for it. We have to manage the puck. That\u2019s the biggest thing with our team. We can\u2019t afford to turn pucks over against a lot of these teams, because they\u2019re good teams.\u201d\n\nThe safe, smart style of hockey worked against Washington. Other than a poor start to the second period and a frantic final few minutes of regulation, the Blackhawks had one of their best efforts of the season against a very good Capitals team. They were patient. They were careful. They dumped the puck when they didn\u2019t have a clear entry. They got back on defense when they anticipated a change in possession.\n\nAnd they still generated scoring chances by pouncing in transition. It\u2019s clearly a recipe for success, too, after beating St. Louis, playing well in a loss to San Jose and knocking off the Caps. Washington hitting five posts didn\u2019t hurt, but Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury made 25 of his own saves. Most importantly, the Blackhawks were credited with only three giveaways all game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe always talk about greasy road wins,\u201d said Jones, who wired in the equalizer at 11:56 of the third after Garnet Hathaway scored on a breakaway right out of the penalty box in the opening minute. \u201cThe crowd\u2019s not on our side, we have to create our own energy, and you don\u2019t do that by turning pucks over and giving them odd-man rushes. So I thought we did a great job of taking the crowd out of it in the first, sticking to our game, keeping it low event. That\u2019s just giving ourselves a chance.\u201d\n\n2. With his parents, wife, sister-in-law and trainer in attendance at Capital One Center, Josiah Slavin had a terrific NHL debut, centering the fourth line with Mike Hardman and Ryan Carpenter. The trio had several scoring chances early on, and Slavin picked up his first point by setting up Jones\u2019 goal in the third period.\n\nSlavin entered the offensive zone and stickhandled his way through traffic, then peeled back rather than simply dump the puck in. As he turned, he saw Jones barreling down the middle of the ice with nobody near him. Slavin made the pass, and Jones blistered a wrist shot past Vanecek to tie it 3-3.\n\nSlavin was on the ice for 13 shot attempts for and just six against, with seven scoring chances (four of them high-danger) in barely 10 minutes of ice time. He also got a shift on the Blackhawks\u2019 lone penalty kill.\n\n\u201cThe first one, you never know going into it, right?\u201d Slavin said. \u201cSo I think to get it out of the way was good, and I think I\u2019ll be more comfortable in the next one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks extremely comfortable out there,\u201d Jones countered. \u201cBig body down the middle, was making plays out of our own end, skating through the neutral zone with speed and creating offensively. He set up (Hardman) a couple times off the rush for some great chances. I thought he looked great. He didn\u2019t look out of place at all and definitely helped us get the win tonight.\u201d\n\n3. Dach\u2019s inability to finish has been an issue for all three of his NHL seasons and is the one thing that seems to prevent him from taking that next step into a true No. 1 center. But his unwillingness to even try to finish is an issue as well.\n\nIn the second period, Strome made a terrific move down the right wing to set up Dach on the doorstep. Dach had time and space and a point-blank shot on Vanecek, but he hesitated for a split second, then forced a tricky backdoor pass back to Strome that failed to connect. Sometimes, you just have to shoot the puck. Dach basically predicted the play earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cYou kind of get in the situations where you\u2019re gripping the stick a little bit too tight or trying to set up the perfect backdoor play where you go through the seams two or three times,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get in slumps like this, it\u2019s never a bad idea just to shoot the puck.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, King joked he\u2019d have to \u201cwhip him with a hose\u201d to get Dach to start shooting the puck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just keep beating it in him (to) shoot,\u201d King said. \u201cWe need more shots. We have to have a shooting mentality.\u201d\n\n4. Connor Murphy was knocked out of the game 22 seconds into the second period when Alex Ovechkin hit him hard along the boards. Murphy was slow to get up and had to be helped off the ice and back to the dressing room. King didn\u2019t have any details or an update after the game.\n\nIn other injury news, Riley Stillman made a surprise appearance at the morning skate, and King said he\u2019d be a game-time decision. He wasn\u2019t on the ice for warmups, however, and was scratched along with Calvin de Haan (back) and Reese Johnson (healthy). King was hopeful de Haan would return to the lineup either Saturday against the Rangers or Sunday against the Islanders. With de Haan out, the resurgent and defensively improved Erik Gustafsson was on the top pairing with Jones.\n\n5. The Blackhawks traded Malcolm Subban to goalie-starved Buffalo on Thursday for \u201cfuture considerations,\u201d which could mean anything but most likely means nothing. The Sabres needed goaltending with Craig Anderson hurt and Dustin Tokarski in COVID-19 protocol, and the Blackhawks needed to clear their logjam in Rockford. Subban had been splitting time with fellow veteran Collin Delia and potential goalie-of-the-near-future Arvid S\u00f6derblom, and nobody benefits from that situation.\n\nSubban, acquired from Vegas in the Robin Lehner trade, was a solid backup for Kevin Lankinen last season and will get his third real chance to prove he\u2019s an NHL goalie with the Sabres.\n\n(Photo of Dominik Kubalik and Alex DeBrincat: Rob Carr / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2960892/2021/11/17/thats-just-him-why-blackhawks-interim-head-coach-derek-king-is-wearing-the-right-hat-at-the-right-time/", "page_content": "The Derek King you\u2019ve seen as Chicago Blackhawks interim head coach is the one nearly everyone who\u2019s known him talks about.\n\nThey mention his quick wit \u2014 like when King, standing at a lectern instead of sitting at a table after his first practice with the Blackhawks, remarked, \u201cOne win and I\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis son D.J. King said, \u201cThat\u2019s just him.\u201d\n\nThey talk about his easygoing personality and how he allows the players their freedom. Calvin de Haan said recently, \u201cKinger\u2019s come in, said the right things, I believe, and he\u2019s got a real down-to-earth mentality and personality. He\u2019s been fun to talk to and fun to be around in the locker room. I think he\u2019s kind of letting us steer the ship to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nThey mention his unselfishness and say how good of a person he is. Dallas Eakins, who played and coached with King, said, \u201cBack when we\u2019re playing, like one of the call-up guys wouldn\u2019t have a car here. \u2026 He\u2019s like, can I give you a ride? It\u2019s who he is, and I just can\u2019t say enough about him. \u2026 Like 10 out of 10, this is a guy you\u2019d want as your friend. You\u2019d want him as your father. You\u2019d want him as your son-in-law.\u201d\n\nThey describe how he\u2019s content wherever he is, which allows him to do the job at hand and is why he seemed to be the ideal candidate for interim head coach. Rockford IceHogs president of hockey operations and general manager Mark Bernard said, \u201cIf I asked him his five-year plan, it was going to be, \u2018Well, to be in Rockford five years. I just want to come in and I want to help the future players in the Blackhawks.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have an agenda where, \u2018Well, I\u2019d like to be in Rockford for two years and then I want to move up to the NHL as assistant and then I want to move up as a head coach.\u2019 He was quite adamant that he could be in Rockford for the rest of his career and to develop players and be happy with that.\u201d\n\nWhat about when he isn\u2019t happy?\n\nAnders Sorensen, IceHogs interim head coach and King\u2019s former assistant, provided some intel on a seldom-seen but very effective King facial expression that seems to get his players\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cI joke around, I like when he gets his angry Scottish face on,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cHe can really stare a guy down with the best of them. His eyes go all black and he gives you the death stare. I\u2019ve seen it a few times. I think guys definitely respect that. It\u2019s not a daily thing at all, so you know when he does it, he means it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether the 54-year-old King will be the long-term choice for the Blackhawks as head coach is unknown. Interim general manager Kyle Davidson has already stated the search for a permanent head coach won\u2019t begin until the offseason. The search could begin and end with King. He\u2019ll have at least a 70-NHL game sample size to analyze at that point.\n\nBut for now, he is the Blackhawks head coach, and for many who have played and coached with and for him, he\u2019s the perfect person for the Blackhawks at this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen times are tough up top there, those guys feel the pressure,\u201d said Cody Franson, who played for King when King was an IceHogs assistant and head coach. \u201cSometimes when you get a new coach, it can provide that spark on its own. But I think what Kinger\u2019s going to bring to those guys is a guy who played, a guy who understands it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go in there and try and change everything overnight. But I think Kinger\u2019s going to be a guy that naturally guys want to play for and try and have success for.\n\n\u201cI went through coaching changes midseason in Toronto, so I\u2019ve been through it, too. There\u2019s different elements that come into play. But Kinger\u2019s one of those personalities that guys gravitate to. He\u2019s the kind of guy who wants to make you run through a wall for because he shows you respect when you deserve it and he manages a group really well and gets a good feel of his guys and tries to do everything he can to help guys win. He\u2019s very much a guy that\u2019s trying to work with the guys and doesn\u2019t want his room divided and that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDerek King began considering coaching at the end of his own long and successful playing career.\n\nKing produced 612 points in 830 career NHL games. There was a three-season stretch with the New York Islanders in the early 1990s where he scored 108 goals. He wrapped up his NHL playing days with the 1999-2000 season and kept playing elsewhere for a few seasons. He went to Germany and then returned to North America to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Griffins attracted him with an interesting proposal \u2014 be a player and a coach for them.\n\n\u201cHe was always a guy who had a good head for the game,\u201d said Danton Cole, who was the head coach of the Griffins at the time and is now Michigan State\u2019s men\u2019s head coach. \u201cWe talked to him about a lot of stuff anyhow, so it was a good kind of progression there. It was something that made our spot interesting for him. He was still playing, and I\u2019ve had player-assistants before; you try to involve them in certain parts and give them a flavor of what coaching is like. It\u2019s a lot different than what we think of as a player.\u201d\n\nKing mainly assisted on special teams and provided insight into what he was seeing on the ice. He remained player-assistant for two seasons, but there wasn\u2019t a full-time coaching position available after that.\n\nAfter the 2003-04 season, he permanently moved to Arizona, where he owned some real estate properties. He coached his eldest son, D.J., occasionally helped out at some pro camps and golfed. He and his wife later had twin sons while living in Arizona.\n\n\u201cAnd then my twins came and my golf game went pfft,\u201d King said.\n\nThat was his life and might have remained his life until Dallas Eakins called one day. They had played and roomed together while with the Toronto Maple Leafs and became good friends. When Eakins was hired as Toronto Marlies head coach in 2009, he first sought an assistant with coaching experience and hired Gord Dineen. There were fewer parameters with the second assistant position, and he thought of his old friend.\n\n\u201cDerek King was coaching kids in Scottsdale, like helping kids out, and I just thought he would be an unbelievable coach, even though he had no pro experience, because he had played for so long, he had played for Al Arbour, he had played for Pat Quinn, and I think when you play for great coaches whether you\u2019re cognizant of it or not, you\u2019re learning great lessons from them,\u201d said Eakins, who is now the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cAnd then just the way Kinger\u2019s personality was, I just thought he was really going to see the game through the players\u2019 eyes, and I really believe that\u2019s a massive part of the coaching process. And so that\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nDerek King was a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1985. (Getty Images)\n\nKing wasn\u2019t really aware of the impact Arbour and Quinn, who are third and sixth in NHL coaching victories, had on him at the time, but he does recognize it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI played in a time where the video and the iPads on the bench, there was none of that,\u201d King said. \u201cCoaches coached with feel. They had a feel for the game and they just knew how to manage players, so I had some great coaches that did that. Al Arbour was huge. \u2026 Because he used to ride me, but then when you retire and you start coaching kids, you understand why he was riding me: to make me a better player, better person, so I take stuff from him. Pat Quinn was another guy like that. He just had a way with things. He knew how to push buttons, he knew who to hug, who to kick in the butt, and he was excellent at it. I go to Toronto and I\u2019m getting kicked in the butt and yelled at, and I\u2019m wondering why, but I figured it out: I drove these coaches nuts. Now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts.\u201d\n\nRay Ferraro witnessed Arbour driving King nuts. Ferraro played with King under Arbour while with the Islanders.\n\n\u201cHe was hard on Kinger because he knew Kinger had lots more,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe knew Kinger had more than Kinger thought he had. And so, Kinger got 40 goals for Al. \u2026 Kinger could score, and Al kept pushing him for more because he knew he had it.\u201d\n\nWith Eakins\u2019 Marlies coaching offer, King jumped at the chance. Eakins gave him a lot of responsibility early on and put him in charge of the forwards. King had some things to learn, but he had a lot of coaching instincts already.\n\nKing was Eakins\u2019 assistant for four years with the Marlies. Eakins moved on and King stayed. He was then an assistant under Steve Spott during 2013-14 season and then an associate coach for Dineen for a season.\n\nAfter the 2014-15 season, King was let go by the Maple Leafs while the organization went through staff changes. King took an assistant position with the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL the following season, but he found the team was too far from his home in the Toronto area and only coached there for one season.\n\nMark Bernard and Derek King both grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. King was nearly two years older than Bernard, but they hung out within the same group of hockey players and skated together a lot of summers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernard and King had kept in touch a bit over the years, so it wasn\u2019t completely out of the blue when King rang Bernard after the 2015-16 season and asked if the Blackhawks were looking for any coaches. King had just left his OHL position.\n\nIt just happened the Blackhawks were searching for a new assistant for the IceHogs. The problem is they had already interviewed a number of people and Stan Bowman, then the Blackhawks general manager, was close to a final decision.\n\n\u201cIn Stan\u2019s mind, he really liked one of the applicants,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd I kind of begged, kind of said, \u2018No, let\u2019s just interview him in Buffalo. We\u2019re going to the draft and he can drive up from Hamilton. Trust me, you\u2019ll love this guy as an applicant.\u2019 Stan held off and we interviewed him before the draft in Buffalo, and it worked out and Stan loved him and he got the job and off we went.\u201d\n\nKing was an assistant under Ted Dent his first season with the IceHogs. It was a trying season for the team, and Dent was fired after it. King was retained and became an assistant for Jeremy Colliton.\n\nUnder Colliton, King had more of a vocal role at times.\n\n\u201cWhen (King) was the assistant coach, Jeremy wasn\u2019t much of a scream and yell guy,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who played for the IceHogs from 2017-2020. \u201cWhen we needed that, that would be Kinger\u2019s kind of job to step in, make sure everybody\u2019s on their toes. If he wasn\u2019t happy with how things were going, he was going to let you know about it.\u201d\n\nDerek King became the Rockford IceHogs coach early into the 2018-19 season. (Nathan Vestal/IceHogs)\n\nThe IceHogs reached the playoffs that season. Colliton and King returned together for the 2018-19 season. When the Blackhawks fired Joel Quenneville early into the season, Colliton was promoted to head coach of the Blackhawks, and King was made the IceHogs\u2019 interim head coach. King was given the job permanently after the season.\n\nWhile King did know how to push his players\u2019 buttons like his former coaches, he knows where the balance is at and often leans towards keeping the atmosphere light.\n\n\u201cHe knows when it\u2019s time to be serious with them, but at the same time, he puts them at ease where he can talk to them and be one of the guys,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cWhen he was the assistant coach here, he\u2019d go out and play (two)-touch soccer with them before the game. And we used to always laugh because he\u2019d go out to play and come right back. We\u2019d be like, \u2018I thought you\u2019re to play soccer.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they got me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy got called up to Chicago and Derek took over here, that was my main point of advice for him \u2014 just be yourself, the guys love you. They play hard for you. Just continue to be yourself because that\u2019s what the players love, and he did that, to his credit. The players here in Rockford, I know, all enjoyed playing for him.\u201d\n\nDylan Sikura, another one of King\u2019s former players, did enjoy playing for him, but he also recalled him not leaving the soccer games so graciously.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a players coach,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKept it very loose around the locker room but demanded a lot from his guys. Was always cracking jokes always, keeping it light. You could tell he got a real joy being around the guys like when he used to play. He would play sewer ball (also known as two-touch soccer) with our team and refuse to get out. I remember one time we were down in a (hockey) game going into the third not playing well at all. In between periods, he said that we\u2019re going back to minor hockey, which meant when you get off the ice you enter in one (bench) door and exit in the other. No lines, no pairs. Whenever you get off, that\u2019s who you would go with. I remember playing some shifts with five forwards or sometimes D playing forward. We ended up coming back and winning.\u201d\n\nCody Franson had come to the decision he wasn\u2019t going to return to the KHL last season and would pursue a team to play for in North America again. He looked at his options and thought immediately about the IceHogs.\n\nFranson had already been through one stint with the IceHogs while under contract with the Blackhawks during the 2017-18 season. Back then, King was an assistant for the IceHogs. With King as the head coach this time around, Franson felt good about returning to Rockford.\n\n\u201cRight away I reached out to my agent and asked him to reach out to Rockford to see if it would work just because I knew Kinger was there,\u201d Franson said. \u201cI loved playing for Kinger. We had a great relationship. Him and Anders took that approach of trying to use the brains around them to potentially bounce things off of, and Colly (Colliton) did the same thing when I was there for the first time. I really enjoyed my role and really enjoyed working with Kinger, Colly and Anders the first time. That just made it very easy to reach out and hope something would happen with Rockford obviously. I had great relationships with everyone that was there, and Kinger was a massive part of that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season was challenging for the IceHogs. There was everything COVID-related that all teams had to go through, but the IceHogs were also young and inexperienced. Franson had played more pro seasons than nearly all of the IceHogs\u2019 defensemen combined. A 9-4 loss to the Iowa Wild on March 3 gave them a 1-6-1 start to the season.\n\nKing and the IceHogs battled through the ensuing months, continued to focus on development more than anything and finished with a 12-19-1 record.\n\n\u201cI know last year was really tough in Rockford,\u201d Franson said. \u201cThey took a very developmental approach to it and it was a struggle. I think our group last year in Rockford came a long way. At the start, we were a group that was very young and very green and had a ton to learn, a lot more than you usually do with a team. Man, to be able to come out with a record that we came out with, just shows how much work he put in and how good of a coach he is because that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do to turn that into a respectable season.\u201d\n\nDerek King has been with the Blackhawks organization since 2016. (Scott Powers / The Athletic)\n\nIt helped that King bought into what the Blackhawks were doing developmentally. He wasn\u2019t concerned about wins and losses as some AHL coaches can be when their sights are on becoming NHL coaches.\n\n\u201cObviously I think he wanted to be a head coach, at least in the American League, but I think he\u2019s not a guy who is on a certain track looking to make it to a certain place,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who was a captain under King. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who enjoys what he\u2019s doing day to day. I think he was enjoying working with some of the younger guys. He has a couple of younger kids. He\u2019d bring them out for practice and things like that. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to be an NHL head coach. Obviously, when everybody\u2019s in this business, you want to have ultimate success, you want to make it there, but I don\u2019t think that was the kind of thing that struck you with him. \u2026 He\u2019s enjoying what he\u2019s doing and he loves being around the game and he loves being around the guys, and that\u2019s kind of his day-to-day approach.\u201d\n\nSorensen and King discussed that very topic during their last few seasons together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously gotten close over the years, and we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this,\u201d Sorensen. said. \u201cSo just being happy where your two feet are right now. Where you are right now, be happy with it and do the best and make the best out of that situation. \u201d\n\nRay Ferraro tuned into Derek King\u2019s introductory news conference as Blackhawks interim coach to see his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI was watching the press conference and Kinger\u2019s up there, he\u2019s fiddling around with the mic and his hands were on the mic, and the way he talked and the way he answered the questions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s Kinger,'\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy. He just got no hair. Because he had a long mane when we played. He didn\u2019t get to shaving it down until much later. But it looks very familiar. I was really happy to see him sitting there. I don\u2019t know. I was just really happy. I saw him out on the ice and he had a toque on. Like, it\u2019s just what I would expect.\u201d\n\nWearing a winter hat during practices is very unique to King.\n\n\u201cThe way he does, no, (I\u2019ve never had a coach do that),\u201d Tyler Sikura said. \u201cThat\u2019s his own style, I would say.\u201d\n\nFranson said while laughing, \u201cI think that Kinger\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\nWhile different, it does speak to King saying true to himself. When King was named Blackhawks interim coach, Eakins called him and reminded him of a few things. The conversation was a lot like what Bernard said to King when he became the IceHogs head coach.\n\n\u201cKinger played what, I don\u2019t know, probably 16 years or more pro, he\u2019s been coaching for a long time, too, so he has this vast amount of experience, as did I, but as much as you\u2019re ready, and you know you\u2019re ready, when you get that first job, there is the first few days like, holy man, I\u2019m a head coach of an NHL team,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAnd I simply called him to remind him of how many games he played in the NHL, remember Al Arbour, remember Pat Quinn, remember all the lessons you\u2019ve learned along the way, and that he was 100 percent ready for this and to trust his instinct.\u201d\n\nKing doing just that throughout his career path, first as a player and now as a coach, has led to him accumulating a lot of people in his life who wish to see him do well.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people excited for that man,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how my phone blew up from former staff people in other organizations, former players all, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s unbelievable for Kinger,\u2019 or, \u2018Do you have Kinger\u2019s new cell because the one I have isn\u2019t working.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing to me how much my phone blew up when he got the job. It\u2019s incredible because it\u2019s all people who love him and he\u2019s been able to have a positive effect on and influence. I think in the end, like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a coach or what you do in your life, when something good is happening for you and people are excited for you, I think that\u2019s a real true mark on what mark you\u2019ve left on their lives.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "http://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/Interactives/2015/05/medals-through-the-years/index.html", "page_content": "IT WAS the stage that launched the careers of the region\u2019s sporting greats \u2013 from Malaysia\u2019s sprint king and four-time Asian Games champion Mani Jegathesan to Indonesian badminton legend Susi Susanti, the first South-east Asian to win an Olympic gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nYet the biennial sporting meet \u2013 the brainchild of former Thailand Olympic Committee vice-president Luang Sukhum Nayaoradit \u2013 was a much humbler affair when founding members Thailand, Burma (now Myanmar), Malaya (Malaysia), Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia agreed to stage the first South-east Asian Peninsular (Seap) Games in 1959.\n\nOver 700 athletes and officials gathered in Bangkok for six days and competed in 12 sports (athletics, aquatics, badminton, basketball, boxing, cycling, football, shooting, table tennis, tennis, volleyball and weightlifting).\n\nSchool teacher Tan Eng Yoon etched his name into the history books as Singapore\u2019s first gold medallist when he won the 400m hurdles.\n\nIt was the greatest event of his life, Tan, who died in 2010, told The Straits Times years later.\n\nWhile the Games was created to enhance regional cooperation, its future was threatened briefly by politics and the emergence of the short-lived Indonesia-backed Games of the New Emerging Forces (Ganefo).\n\nThis led to the 1963 Games being cancelled before the Games was restarted with the 1965 edition in Kuala Lumpur.

He currently serves the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL as an assistant coach.\n\nNew fans of the ice hockey professional might be eager to learn about him. So, let's get to know more about Derek King and see how he went from playing to coaching in this biography.\n\nAn\u017ee Kopitar Biography - Hockey Player\n\nDerek King Net Worth And Career\n\nIncluding his career as an athlete and a coach, the former left winger has been actively involved in hockey for over 35 years. He must have bagged a massive fortune throughout the years. Likewise, Derek King's net worth must be immense.\n\nThe sportsman was drafted 13th overall by the New York Islanders in the NHL Entry Draft in 1985 and made his NHL debut in the 1986-87 season. He also played for Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues of NHL. In addition, he also competed for different teams in leagues other than NHL. For example, King played for Grand Rapids Griffins in IHL and AHL and Oshawa Generals in the OHL. In his career as an NHL athlete, he played 830 games, scored 261 goals and 351 assists, and earned 612 points.\n\nNow, let's look at some of Derek's playing statistics in the table below:\n\nSeason Team Games Played Goals Scored Points 1996\u201397 New York Islanders 70 23 53 1997\u201398 Toronto Maple Leafs 77 21 46 1998\u201399 Toronto Maple Leafs 81 24 52\n\nTable Source: NHL Official Website\n\nAfter retiring from playing, the Hamilton native started his career as a coach in August 2009, when he became the assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, the AHL affiliate team of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Five years later, in 2014, he was promoted to associate coach. Then, in July 2015, Derek became the OHL's Owen Sound Attack's assistant coach. However, he left the team in just three months, in October.\n\nFinally, in July 2016, King was named an assistant coach of the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League, which is the minor league affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. He was later promoted to the interim head coach of the IceHogs on November 6, 2018. Eventually, he landed his first head coaching position at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe 1967-born sportsperson became the interim head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL on November 2, 2021. Just a day later, he earned his first win with the Blackhawks, defeating the Nashville Predators. Sadly, he was let go from the position on June 27, 2022. However, on July 11, 2022, Chicago Blackhawks announced Derek's return as an assistant coach for the 2022-23 season.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, veteran assistant coaches, with little head coaching experience, earn between $500,000 and $700,000 per year. Since King also previously served as a head coach, he must also earn in a similar range. Hence, Derek King's net worth must be a significant amount.\n\nLikewise, John Gibson is another sports celebrity with a massive net worth.\n\nDerek King Is Happily Married\n\nAs the title suggests, the Canadian coach enjoys a blissful marital life with his partner. But unfortunately, little to no information about his beloved spouse is known to the public as of now. Even the name of his missus has not been disclosed yet, making it hard to find her on social media. In addition, Mrs. King completely stays away from the limelight. Perhaps she prefers to keep a low profile.\n\nNonetheless, Derek has talked about his other half a few times in some of his interviews. Once in an interview with Chicago Tribune, while talking about how hectic his NHL schedule is, he revealed that Mrs. King controlled everything and got everything figured out. He also added that she is a huge supporter of his career. Hopefully, we will get to learn more about Derek King's wife in the future.\n\nProud Father Of Three\n\nThe former left winger and his spouse are parents of three lovely boys. Their eldest is D.J. King, who was born on August 7, 2000, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Derek King's son is pursuing a career in hockey and following in his footsteps. He is a professional hockey player who competes in the East Coast Hockey League as a Defense for the Fort Wayne Komets.\n\nDerek King shares three lovely sons with his wife. Image Source: Derek King's Twitter.\n\nDerek King's other children are a set of twins who arrived when he was living in Arizona. But, as in the case of his wife, along with their birth details, the names of his baby boys remain a mystery. Regardless, according to the coach's bio on his Twitter account, his younger kids also love the game of hockey. They often go to the Rockford Hockey Club rink for games and practices. So, could the twins be planning on becoming ice hockey players in the future?\n\nIs From Hamilton\n\nThe coach was welcomed by his parents on February 11, 1967, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Sadly, information regarding Derek King's mother and father, including their names, has yet to be revealed. Likewise, he has not disclosed much about his other family members. Perhaps, his parents and siblings are people of privacy and want to stay away from the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, not much has been made known about the assistant coach himself. Due to this reason, it is difficult to learn about his childhood. It seems he is also a secretive person and isn't eager to share about his life before starting his hockey career.\n\nWell, it's unfortunate that Derek King has not opened up much about his personal life. Hopefully, we will learn about his parents, wife, and children in the days ahead. Nonetheless, with his fortune likely to grow with his career, he must enjoy a comfortable life. We wish him and his close ones lead a happy and prosperous life in the future.\n\nTrivia And Facts"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/derek.king/2384657", "page_content": "Derek King\n\nAugust 15, 1929 (age 73) London Borough of Hackney, Greater London, United Kingdom\n\nAfter leaving school aged 14 he trained as a tie maker and played his early football for Alexander Palace football club in 1945. King joined Tottenham Hotspur as a junior in the season of 1945-1946. After completing two years National Service serving with the Grenadier Guards he returned to Tottenham and in 1950 he became a full-time player. The central defender made 19 appearances for the Spurs before transferring to Swansea City in August 1956. A resolute player he featured in five matches with the Vetch Field club in 1956 before a recurring knee injury ended his senior career in December 1956. King attempted a come back at Ted Ditchburn\"s Romford in 1959. After retiring from football King used his skills as a tie maker when he was employed by Spurs legend Dave Mackay at his tie business. He later worked as a school caretaker. At one time he lived adjacent to White Hart Lane at Paxton Road and maintained a close interest in football up to his death at a Huntingdon nursing home in 2003."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2960892/2021/11/17/thats-just-him-why-blackhawks-interim-head-coach-derek-king-is-wearing-the-right-hat-at-the-right-time/", "page_content": "The Derek King you\u2019ve seen as Chicago Blackhawks interim head coach is the one nearly everyone who\u2019s known him talks about.\n\nThey mention his quick wit \u2014 like when King, standing at a lectern instead of sitting at a table after his first practice with the Blackhawks, remarked, \u201cOne win and I\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis son D.J. King said, \u201cThat\u2019s just him.\u201d\n\nThey talk about his easygoing personality and how he allows the players their freedom. Calvin de Haan said recently, \u201cKinger\u2019s come in, said the right things, I believe, and he\u2019s got a real down-to-earth mentality and personality. He\u2019s been fun to talk to and fun to be around in the locker room. I think he\u2019s kind of letting us steer the ship to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nThey mention his unselfishness and say how good of a person he is. Dallas Eakins, who played and coached with King, said, \u201cBack when we\u2019re playing, like one of the call-up guys wouldn\u2019t have a car here. \u2026 He\u2019s like, can I give you a ride? It\u2019s who he is, and I just can\u2019t say enough about him. \u2026 Like 10 out of 10, this is a guy you\u2019d want as your friend. You\u2019d want him as your father. You\u2019d want him as your son-in-law.\u201d\n\nThey describe how he\u2019s content wherever he is, which allows him to do the job at hand and is why he seemed to be the ideal candidate for interim head coach. Rockford IceHogs president of hockey operations and general manager Mark Bernard said, \u201cIf I asked him his five-year plan, it was going to be, \u2018Well, to be in Rockford five years. I just want to come in and I want to help the future players in the Blackhawks.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have an agenda where, \u2018Well, I\u2019d like to be in Rockford for two years and then I want to move up to the NHL as assistant and then I want to move up as a head coach.\u2019 He was quite adamant that he could be in Rockford for the rest of his career and to develop players and be happy with that.\u201d\n\nWhat about when he isn\u2019t happy?\n\nAnders Sorensen, IceHogs interim head coach and King\u2019s former assistant, provided some intel on a seldom-seen but very effective King facial expression that seems to get his players\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cI joke around, I like when he gets his angry Scottish face on,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cHe can really stare a guy down with the best of them. His eyes go all black and he gives you the death stare. I\u2019ve seen it a few times. I think guys definitely respect that. It\u2019s not a daily thing at all, so you know when he does it, he means it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether the 54-year-old King will be the long-term choice for the Blackhawks as head coach is unknown. Interim general manager Kyle Davidson has already stated the search for a permanent head coach won\u2019t begin until the offseason. The search could begin and end with King. He\u2019ll have at least a 70-NHL game sample size to analyze at that point.\n\nBut for now, he is the Blackhawks head coach, and for many who have played and coached with and for him, he\u2019s the perfect person for the Blackhawks at this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen times are tough up top there, those guys feel the pressure,\u201d said Cody Franson, who played for King when King was an IceHogs assistant and head coach. \u201cSometimes when you get a new coach, it can provide that spark on its own. But I think what Kinger\u2019s going to bring to those guys is a guy who played, a guy who understands it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go in there and try and change everything overnight. But I think Kinger\u2019s going to be a guy that naturally guys want to play for and try and have success for.\n\n\u201cI went through coaching changes midseason in Toronto, so I\u2019ve been through it, too. There\u2019s different elements that come into play. But Kinger\u2019s one of those personalities that guys gravitate to. He\u2019s the kind of guy who wants to make you run through a wall for because he shows you respect when you deserve it and he manages a group really well and gets a good feel of his guys and tries to do everything he can to help guys win. He\u2019s very much a guy that\u2019s trying to work with the guys and doesn\u2019t want his room divided and that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDerek King began considering coaching at the end of his own long and successful playing career.\n\nKing produced 612 points in 830 career NHL games. There was a three-season stretch with the New York Islanders in the early 1990s where he scored 108 goals. He wrapped up his NHL playing days with the 1999-2000 season and kept playing elsewhere for a few seasons. He went to Germany and then returned to North America to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Griffins attracted him with an interesting proposal \u2014 be a player and a coach for them.\n\n\u201cHe was always a guy who had a good head for the game,\u201d said Danton Cole, who was the head coach of the Griffins at the time and is now Michigan State\u2019s men\u2019s head coach. \u201cWe talked to him about a lot of stuff anyhow, so it was a good kind of progression there. It was something that made our spot interesting for him. He was still playing, and I\u2019ve had player-assistants before; you try to involve them in certain parts and give them a flavor of what coaching is like. It\u2019s a lot different than what we think of as a player.\u201d\n\nKing mainly assisted on special teams and provided insight into what he was seeing on the ice. He remained player-assistant for two seasons, but there wasn\u2019t a full-time coaching position available after that.\n\nAfter the 2003-04 season, he permanently moved to Arizona, where he owned some real estate properties. He coached his eldest son, D.J., occasionally helped out at some pro camps and golfed. He and his wife later had twin sons while living in Arizona.\n\n\u201cAnd then my twins came and my golf game went pfft,\u201d King said.\n\nThat was his life and might have remained his life until Dallas Eakins called one day. They had played and roomed together while with the Toronto Maple Leafs and became good friends. When Eakins was hired as Toronto Marlies head coach in 2009, he first sought an assistant with coaching experience and hired Gord Dineen. There were fewer parameters with the second assistant position, and he thought of his old friend.\n\n\u201cDerek King was coaching kids in Scottsdale, like helping kids out, and I just thought he would be an unbelievable coach, even though he had no pro experience, because he had played for so long, he had played for Al Arbour, he had played for Pat Quinn, and I think when you play for great coaches whether you\u2019re cognizant of it or not, you\u2019re learning great lessons from them,\u201d said Eakins, who is now the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cAnd then just the way Kinger\u2019s personality was, I just thought he was really going to see the game through the players\u2019 eyes, and I really believe that\u2019s a massive part of the coaching process. And so that\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nDerek King was a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1985. (Getty Images)\n\nKing wasn\u2019t really aware of the impact Arbour and Quinn, who are third and sixth in NHL coaching victories, had on him at the time, but he does recognize it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI played in a time where the video and the iPads on the bench, there was none of that,\u201d King said. \u201cCoaches coached with feel. They had a feel for the game and they just knew how to manage players, so I had some great coaches that did that. Al Arbour was huge. \u2026 Because he used to ride me, but then when you retire and you start coaching kids, you understand why he was riding me: to make me a better player, better person, so I take stuff from him. Pat Quinn was another guy like that. He just had a way with things. He knew how to push buttons, he knew who to hug, who to kick in the butt, and he was excellent at it. I go to Toronto and I\u2019m getting kicked in the butt and yelled at, and I\u2019m wondering why, but I figured it out: I drove these coaches nuts. Now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts.\u201d\n\nRay Ferraro witnessed Arbour driving King nuts. Ferraro played with King under Arbour while with the Islanders.\n\n\u201cHe was hard on Kinger because he knew Kinger had lots more,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe knew Kinger had more than Kinger thought he had. And so, Kinger got 40 goals for Al. \u2026 Kinger could score, and Al kept pushing him for more because he knew he had it.\u201d\n\nWith Eakins\u2019 Marlies coaching offer, King jumped at the chance. Eakins gave him a lot of responsibility early on and put him in charge of the forwards. King had some things to learn, but he had a lot of coaching instincts already.\n\nKing was Eakins\u2019 assistant for four years with the Marlies. Eakins moved on and King stayed. He was then an assistant under Steve Spott during 2013-14 season and then an associate coach for Dineen for a season.\n\nAfter the 2014-15 season, King was let go by the Maple Leafs while the organization went through staff changes. King took an assistant position with the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL the following season, but he found the team was too far from his home in the Toronto area and only coached there for one season.\n\nMark Bernard and Derek King both grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. King was nearly two years older than Bernard, but they hung out within the same group of hockey players and skated together a lot of summers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernard and King had kept in touch a bit over the years, so it wasn\u2019t completely out of the blue when King rang Bernard after the 2015-16 season and asked if the Blackhawks were looking for any coaches. King had just left his OHL position.\n\nIt just happened the Blackhawks were searching for a new assistant for the IceHogs. The problem is they had already interviewed a number of people and Stan Bowman, then the Blackhawks general manager, was close to a final decision.\n\n\u201cIn Stan\u2019s mind, he really liked one of the applicants,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd I kind of begged, kind of said, \u2018No, let\u2019s just interview him in Buffalo. We\u2019re going to the draft and he can drive up from Hamilton. Trust me, you\u2019ll love this guy as an applicant.\u2019 Stan held off and we interviewed him before the draft in Buffalo, and it worked out and Stan loved him and he got the job and off we went.\u201d\n\nKing was an assistant under Ted Dent his first season with the IceHogs. It was a trying season for the team, and Dent was fired after it. King was retained and became an assistant for Jeremy Colliton.\n\nUnder Colliton, King had more of a vocal role at times.\n\n\u201cWhen (King) was the assistant coach, Jeremy wasn\u2019t much of a scream and yell guy,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who played for the IceHogs from 2017-2020. \u201cWhen we needed that, that would be Kinger\u2019s kind of job to step in, make sure everybody\u2019s on their toes. If he wasn\u2019t happy with how things were going, he was going to let you know about it.\u201d\n\nDerek King became the Rockford IceHogs coach early into the 2018-19 season. (Nathan Vestal/IceHogs)\n\nThe IceHogs reached the playoffs that season. Colliton and King returned together for the 2018-19 season. When the Blackhawks fired Joel Quenneville early into the season, Colliton was promoted to head coach of the Blackhawks, and King was made the IceHogs\u2019 interim head coach. King was given the job permanently after the season.\n\nWhile King did know how to push his players\u2019 buttons like his former coaches, he knows where the balance is at and often leans towards keeping the atmosphere light.\n\n\u201cHe knows when it\u2019s time to be serious with them, but at the same time, he puts them at ease where he can talk to them and be one of the guys,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cWhen he was the assistant coach here, he\u2019d go out and play (two)-touch soccer with them before the game. And we used to always laugh because he\u2019d go out to play and come right back. We\u2019d be like, \u2018I thought you\u2019re to play soccer.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they got me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy got called up to Chicago and Derek took over here, that was my main point of advice for him \u2014 just be yourself, the guys love you. They play hard for you. Just continue to be yourself because that\u2019s what the players love, and he did that, to his credit. The players here in Rockford, I know, all enjoyed playing for him.\u201d\n\nDylan Sikura, another one of King\u2019s former players, did enjoy playing for him, but he also recalled him not leaving the soccer games so graciously.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a players coach,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKept it very loose around the locker room but demanded a lot from his guys. Was always cracking jokes always, keeping it light. You could tell he got a real joy being around the guys like when he used to play. He would play sewer ball (also known as two-touch soccer) with our team and refuse to get out. I remember one time we were down in a (hockey) game going into the third not playing well at all. In between periods, he said that we\u2019re going back to minor hockey, which meant when you get off the ice you enter in one (bench) door and exit in the other. No lines, no pairs. Whenever you get off, that\u2019s who you would go with. I remember playing some shifts with five forwards or sometimes D playing forward. We ended up coming back and winning.\u201d\n\nCody Franson had come to the decision he wasn\u2019t going to return to the KHL last season and would pursue a team to play for in North America again. He looked at his options and thought immediately about the IceHogs.\n\nFranson had already been through one stint with the IceHogs while under contract with the Blackhawks during the 2017-18 season. Back then, King was an assistant for the IceHogs. With King as the head coach this time around, Franson felt good about returning to Rockford.\n\n\u201cRight away I reached out to my agent and asked him to reach out to Rockford to see if it would work just because I knew Kinger was there,\u201d Franson said. \u201cI loved playing for Kinger. We had a great relationship. Him and Anders took that approach of trying to use the brains around them to potentially bounce things off of, and Colly (Colliton) did the same thing when I was there for the first time. I really enjoyed my role and really enjoyed working with Kinger, Colly and Anders the first time. That just made it very easy to reach out and hope something would happen with Rockford obviously. I had great relationships with everyone that was there, and Kinger was a massive part of that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season was challenging for the IceHogs. There was everything COVID-related that all teams had to go through, but the IceHogs were also young and inexperienced. Franson had played more pro seasons than nearly all of the IceHogs\u2019 defensemen combined. A 9-4 loss to the Iowa Wild on March 3 gave them a 1-6-1 start to the season.\n\nKing and the IceHogs battled through the ensuing months, continued to focus on development more than anything and finished with a 12-19-1 record.\n\n\u201cI know last year was really tough in Rockford,\u201d Franson said. \u201cThey took a very developmental approach to it and it was a struggle. I think our group last year in Rockford came a long way. At the start, we were a group that was very young and very green and had a ton to learn, a lot more than you usually do with a team. Man, to be able to come out with a record that we came out with, just shows how much work he put in and how good of a coach he is because that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do to turn that into a respectable season.\u201d\n\nDerek King has been with the Blackhawks organization since 2016. (Scott Powers / The Athletic)\n\nIt helped that King bought into what the Blackhawks were doing developmentally. He wasn\u2019t concerned about wins and losses as some AHL coaches can be when their sights are on becoming NHL coaches.\n\n\u201cObviously I think he wanted to be a head coach, at least in the American League, but I think he\u2019s not a guy who is on a certain track looking to make it to a certain place,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who was a captain under King. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who enjoys what he\u2019s doing day to day. I think he was enjoying working with some of the younger guys. He has a couple of younger kids. He\u2019d bring them out for practice and things like that. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to be an NHL head coach. Obviously, when everybody\u2019s in this business, you want to have ultimate success, you want to make it there, but I don\u2019t think that was the kind of thing that struck you with him. \u2026 He\u2019s enjoying what he\u2019s doing and he loves being around the game and he loves being around the guys, and that\u2019s kind of his day-to-day approach.\u201d\n\nSorensen and King discussed that very topic during their last few seasons together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously gotten close over the years, and we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this,\u201d Sorensen. said. \u201cSo just being happy where your two feet are right now. Where you are right now, be happy with it and do the best and make the best out of that situation. \u201d\n\nRay Ferraro tuned into Derek King\u2019s introductory news conference as Blackhawks interim coach to see his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI was watching the press conference and Kinger\u2019s up there, he\u2019s fiddling around with the mic and his hands were on the mic, and the way he talked and the way he answered the questions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s Kinger,'\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy. He just got no hair. Because he had a long mane when we played. He didn\u2019t get to shaving it down until much later. But it looks very familiar. I was really happy to see him sitting there. I don\u2019t know. I was just really happy. I saw him out on the ice and he had a toque on. Like, it\u2019s just what I would expect.\u201d\n\nWearing a winter hat during practices is very unique to King.\n\n\u201cThe way he does, no, (I\u2019ve never had a coach do that),\u201d Tyler Sikura said. \u201cThat\u2019s his own style, I would say.\u201d\n\nFranson said while laughing, \u201cI think that Kinger\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\nWhile different, it does speak to King saying true to himself. When King was named Blackhawks interim coach, Eakins called him and reminded him of a few things. The conversation was a lot like what Bernard said to King when he became the IceHogs head coach.\n\n\u201cKinger played what, I don\u2019t know, probably 16 years or more pro, he\u2019s been coaching for a long time, too, so he has this vast amount of experience, as did I, but as much as you\u2019re ready, and you know you\u2019re ready, when you get that first job, there is the first few days like, holy man, I\u2019m a head coach of an NHL team,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAnd I simply called him to remind him of how many games he played in the NHL, remember Al Arbour, remember Pat Quinn, remember all the lessons you\u2019ve learned along the way, and that he was 100 percent ready for this and to trust his instinct.\u201d\n\nKing doing just that throughout his career path, first as a player and now as a coach, has led to him accumulating a lot of people in his life who wish to see him do well.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people excited for that man,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how my phone blew up from former staff people in other organizations, former players all, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s unbelievable for Kinger,\u2019 or, \u2018Do you have Kinger\u2019s new cell because the one I have isn\u2019t working.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing to me how much my phone blew up when he got the job. It\u2019s incredible because it\u2019s all people who love him and he\u2019s been able to have a positive effect on and influence. I think in the end, like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a coach or what you do in your life, when something good is happening for you and people are excited for you, I think that\u2019s a real true mark on what mark you\u2019ve left on their lives.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Derek_King_(footballer_born_1980)", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Derek King (footballer born 1980)?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/blackhawks/ct-cb-chicago-blackhawks-derek-king-interim-coach-style-20211107-u6frfnrzbzfknclzgngtrogx2e-story.html", "page_content": "Thank you for supporting our journalism.

(Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)\n\nDerek King wore a winter hat on the ice as he surveyed his first morning skate as interim coach of the Chicago Blackhawks from the blue line, and the 54-year-old struck a jarring difference from the 36-year-old Jeremy Colliton scooting around the ice.\n\nKing has a rough act to follow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hawks\u2019 1-9-2 start to Colliton\u2019s fourth season was marked by sometimes listless play, defensive breakdowns and offensive struggles in five-on-five situations.\n\nIn his first news conference with Chicago media Sunday, King didn\u2019t presume that he can suddenly become the savior for a floundering team, but he did share a few points about philosophy and personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people ask me about my style,\u201d King said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a style.

The conversation with interim general manager Kyle Davidson came out of the blue.\n\nDavidson talked to Hawks CEO Danny Wirtz and Chairman Rocky Wirtz about firing Colliton on Saturday, then called King in Rockford, where the IceHogs were set to host the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\n\u201cI was in shock,\u201d King said. \u201cI was talking with Kyle and just like, \u2018Wow, sure, I\u2019ll do it. Why not, right?\u2019\n\n\u201cI mean, I was in shock. Had a chat with (interim GM) Kyle (Davidson). And I was just like, \u2018Wow, OK. Yeah, sure, I\u2019ll do it.

I\u2019m a little scared. I\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m excited. There\u2019s a lot of emotions going right now. It was good to get on the ice with the guys this morning, just to get that out of the way.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple of meetings, we\u2019ll have another meeting tonight.

He isn\u2019t ready to make major schematic changes \u2014yet.\n\nThe Hawks have been severely deficient in defensive execution, but King said he\u2019ll need a couple of games to get a handle on their problems.\n\nThrough 12 games, the Hawks were giving up the second-most goals per game at 3.92. Last season they allowed the eighth-most at 3.29.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing said he would observe how the defensive zone coverage looks Sunday night against the Nashville Predators.\n\nNew Blackhawks interim head coach Derek King: \u201cThe biggest thing for me is the accountability. Go out there work hard, play the game right, don\u2019t cheat it, and we\u2019ll be fine. And if you don\u2019t do that the accountability\u2019s going to kick in.

He comes off as laid-back \u2014 at a time when the Hawks perhaps need it.\n\nColliton was quietly affable once you got to know him, but he could come off as a bit serious at times. He looked like was born in a tailored suit.\n\nKing gives off the tone of a fun uncle \u2014 not the crazy fun uncle who sets off fireworks in your backyard but the kind who tells your parents to ease up on you a bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to keep things light,\u201d King said. \u201cI don\u2019t take it too serious.
