After he was expelled from the University of Oxford , Penn was sent by his father, Adm. Sir William Penn , on a grand tour of the European continent.\n\nIn 1666 Admiral Penn sent William to Ireland to manage the family estates. There he crossed paths again with Thomas Loe and, after hearing him preach, decided to join the Quakers (the Society of Friends), a sect of religious radicals who were reviled by respectable society and subject to official persecution.\n\nWilliam was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn . He acquired the foundations of a classical education at the Chigwell grammar school in the Essex countryside, where he came under Puritan influences. After Admiral Penn\u2019s naval defeat in the West Indies in 1655, the family moved back to London and then to Ireland. In Ireland William heard Thomas Loe, a Quaker itinerant, preach to his family at the admiral\u2019s invitation, an experience that apparently intensified his religious feelings. In 1660 William entered the University of Oxford , where he rejected Anglicanism and was expelled in 1662 for his religious Nonconformity . Determined to thwart his son\u2019s religiosity, Admiral Penn sent his son on a grand tour of the European continent and to the Protestant college at Saumur , in France, to complete his studies. Summoned back to England after two years, William entered Lincoln\u2019s Inn and spent a year reading law. This was the extent of his formal education.\n\nQuaker leadership and political activism\n\nAfter joining the sect, Penn would eventually be imprisoned four times for publicly stating his beliefs in word and print. He published 42 books and pamphlets in the seven years immediately following his conversion. In his first publication, the pamphlet Truth Exalted (1668), he upheld Quaker doctrines while attacking in turn those of the Roman Catholics, the Anglicans, and the Dissenting churches. It was followed by The Sandy Foundation Shaken (1668), in which he boldly questioned the Trinity and other Protestant doctrines. Though Penn subsequently qualified his anti-Trinitarianism in Innocency with Her Open Face (1669), he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he wrote his most famous book, No Cross, No Crown (1669). In this work he expounded the Quaker-Puritan morality with eloquence, learning, and flashes of humour, condemning the worldliness and luxury of Restoration England and extolling both Puritan conceptions of ascetic self-denial and Quaker ideals of social reform. No Cross, No Crown stands alongside the letters of St. Paul, Boethius\u2019s Consolation of Philosophy, and John Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress as one of the world\u2019s finest examples of prison literature. Penn was released from the Tower in 1669.\n\nIt was as a protagonist of religious toleration that Penn would earn his prominent place in English history. In 1670 he wrote The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience Once More Debated & Defended, which was the most systematic and thorough exposition of the theory of toleration produced in Restoration England. Though Penn based his arguments on theological and scriptural grounds, he did not overlook rational and pragmatic considerations; he pointed out, for example, that the contemporary prosperity of Holland was based on \u201cher Indulgence in matters of Faith and Worship.\u201d\n\nThat same year Penn also had an unexpected opportunity to strike another blow for freedom of conscience and for the traditional rights of all Englishmen. On August 14, 1670, the Quaker meetinghouse in Gracechurch Street, London, having been padlocked by the authorities, he preached in the street to several hundred persons. After the meetings, he and William Mead were arrested and imprisoned on a trumped-up charge of inciting a riot. At his trial in the Old Bailey, Penn calmly and skillfully exposed the illegality of the proceedings against him. The jury, under the leadership of Edward Bushell, refused to bring in a verdict of guilty despite threats and abusive treatment. For their refusal the jurymen were fined and imprisoned, but they were vindicated when Sir John Vaughan, the lord chief justice, enunciated the principle that a judge \u201cmay try to open the eyes of the jurors, but not to lead them by the nose.\u201d The trial, which is also known as the \u201cBushell\u2019s Case,\u201d stands as a landmark in English legal history, having established beyond question the independence of the jury. A firsthand account of the trial, which was a vivid courtroom drama, was published in The People\u2019s Ancient and Just Liberties Asserted (1670).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Young Penn inherited his father\u2019s estates in England and Ireland and became, like his father, a frequenter of the court, where he enjoyed the friendship of King Charles II and his brother, the duke of York (later James II). In 1672 Penn married Gulielma Springett, a Quaker by whom he had eight children, four of whom died in infancy. In the 1670s Penn was tirelessly active as a Quaker minister and polemicist, producing no fewer than 40 controversial tracts on religious doctrines and practice. In 1671 and 1677 he undertook preaching missions to Holland and northern Germany, where the contacts he established would later help him in peopling Pennsylvania with thousands of Dutch and German emigrants. The later years of the decade were also occupied with political activities. In 1679 Penn supported the Parliamentary candidacy of the radical republican Algernon Sidney, going on the hustings twice\u2014at Guildford and later at Bramber\u2014for his friend. During these years he wrote a number of pamphlets on behalf of the radical Whigs, including England\u2019s Great Interest in the Choice of this New Parliament (1679), which is noteworthy as one of the first clear statements of party doctrine ever laid before the English electorate."}, {"url": "https://www.biographies.net/biography/mayhew-foster/m/0gjdtr1", "page_content": "Who was Mayhew Foster?\n\nMayhew Y. \"Bo\" Foster was an American soldier who flew captured Nazi war criminal Hermann G\u00f6ring from Austria to Germany for interrogation by the 7th Army.

Provided by Mayhew Foster / Associated Press\n\nMISSOULA, Montana - Captain Mayhew Foster had an extraordinary mission: Fly captured Nazi leader Hermann Goering to the 7th Army's headquarters for interrogation.\n\nThen he took one look at the one-time heir to Adolf Hitler and commander of the fearsome Luftwaffe - all 136 kg of him - and knew he needed a bigger plane.\n\nIt was May 9, 1945, the day after World War II ended in Europe. Goering, Foster and a group of officers from the Army's 36th Infantry Division gathered on a tiny airstrip outside Kitzbuhel, Austria, to transport the highly-prized war prisoner back to Germany in an unarmed, two-man reconnaissance plane.\n\n\"They wanted to get him back where he could be debriefed. There was a strong rumor that in a mountainside in the Alps right down there in Bavaria there was a concentration of (German) military,\" Foster said. \"He just acted as though it was a nice, friendly trip.\"\n\nMayhew Foster, now 99 and living in a Missoula nursing home, recently recounted his rare one-on-one encounter with one of the most wanted Nazi leaders. Foster went on to become brigadier general of the Montana National Guard and was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his World War II service, but it was this mission that stood out as the highlight of an illustrious military career.\n\nGoering, 52, had surrendered to the US Army's 36th Infantry Division the day before. He had fallen out of favor with Hitler and hadn't played an active role at the end of the war, though he remained Reichsmarschall of Nazi Germany.\n\nBefore his capture, Goering wrote a letter to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, offering to work with Eisenhower on the conditions of the German army's surrender, according to an account of Goering's capture by Brigadier General Robert Stack kept by the 36th Infantry Division Association.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Stack and a group of soldiers drove from the division's base near Kitzbuhel across the border into Germany and intercepted a convoy that included Goering, his wife, daughter, sister-in-law, household servants and military aides, according to the account.\n\nGoering agreed to surrender unconditionally but asked that his family be cared for, and the Nazi leader was delivered to Foster for transport the next day.\n\nFoster, who was 33 at the time, said he didn't fear getting shot down carrying such precious cargo alone in an unescorted, unarmed plane. He didn't worry about Goering taking advantage of the lack of a guard to wrest control of the aircraft.\n\nThe main problem, he said, was getting the two of them off the ground - the nimble, lightweight Piper L4 that Foster piloted in his artillery spotting missions wouldn't support both him and Goering. But the division only had the small airstrip that was fine for Foster's aircraft, but was problematic for taking off and landing larger planes.\n\nThey'd have to upgrade to the one L5 in the division's inventory, a slightly larger aircraft Foster hadn't flown in years.\n\nGoering stood on the tiny airstrip in a plain, gray uniform that was unadorned but for a pistol at his hip and a medal around his neck. Still wearing the pistol, he stepped toward the plane. A Goering aide emerged from the group that had gathered and relieved Goering of the weapon.\n\nThe Nazi leader settled into the back seat and tried to fasten his seat belt. It wouldn't stretch across his belly. He held the strap in his hand, looked at Foster and said, \"Das goot!\" - that's good.\n\nA photograph of that moment shows Foster in the cockpit and Goering seated directly behind him, his elbow jauntily propped on the plane's fuselage.\n\nThe two men spent the 55-minute flight from Kitzbuhel to Augsburg, Germany, conversing in a mix of German and English. Foster said Goering avoided any talk of Hitler or the war but appeared to relish pointing out the sites below them.\n\n\"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour and he was showing me where he grew up,\" Foster said. \"I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\"\n\nHe described Goering as sharp, friendly and witty, even cracking a joke when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets.\n\n\"Too late,\" Goering replied, according to Foster.\n\nAt the time, Foster was somewhat less generous in describing the man. In a letter to his wife, Virginia Lou Foster, written soon after the mission, Foster told her that the Nazi leader was \"effeminate\" and \"gave me the creeps\".\n\n\"Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out but he was wedged in like a champagne cork,\" Foster wrote.\n\nAfter landing, Foster asked his passenger to sign a blank flight report. The prisoner scrawled \"Hermann Goering Reichsmarschall\" across the paper, which Foster folded and put in his pocket.\n\nIt's a document that he still has, one of Foster's most prized possessions alongside a collection of photographs of Goering, Hitler and other snapshots from the days of the Third Reich.\n\nThere was just a single jeep at the airstrip to meet the arriving flight carrying the world's most famous war prisoner. Foster rode with Goering to the gates of the 7th Army Headquarters and formally turned him over to the intelligence officer without ceremony.\n\nIt turned out, Foster learned later, those rumors of German troops hiding in the Bavarian Alps were untrue. Goering stood trial at Nuremberg, and the next year he was found guilty of war crimes.\n\nGoering was sentenced to hang, but he committed suicide instead by swallowing a cyanide capsule.\n\nSixty-five years later, Foster is trim, sharp and carries himself as a former military officer.\n\nHe still reflects on his rare insight into the Nazi leadership, and he recognizes that the experience had shifted his perceptions of the enemy. It allowed him to see the human side of those he had only known as caricatures.\n\n\"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up,\" Foster said. \"I wouldn't say it changed my view of the war but it showed me that there are ...\" He broke off.\n\n\"Well, I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press"}, {"url": "https://colonialnorthamerica.library.harvard.edu/spotlight/cna/catalog/990099580320203941", "page_content": "Mayhew family papers, 1731-1790 and undated\n\nContent Notes\n\nIn English.

He does not appear to have taken any degree. He was admitted a student of the Middle Temple on 23 May 1707, and was called to the bar in May 1713. Meeting with little success in London, he retired to Marlborough, whence he afterwards removed to Bristol, where as a local counsel he gained a great reputation. In August 1735 he was chosen recorder of Bristol, and in Easter term 1736 became a serjeant-at-law. He held the post of recorder for many years, and upon his resignation in 1764 was succeeded by Daines Barrington [q. v.] During Foster's tenure of office several important cases came before him. In the case of Captain Samuel Goodere [q. v.] who was tried for the murder of his brother, Sir John Dinely Goodere, in 1741 (Howell, State Trials, 1813, xvii. 1003\u201380), the right of the city of Bristol to try capital offences committed within its jurisdiction was fully established. When Alexander Broadfoot was indicted for the murder of Cornelius Calahan, a sailor in the king's service, who boarded the merchantman to which Broadfoot belonged, and was killed in an attempt to press the prisoner for the navy (ib. xviii. 1323\u201362), Foster delivered an elaborate judgment in support of the legality of impressment, being convinced that \u2018the right of impressing mariners for the publick service is a prerogative inherent in the crown, grounded upon common law, and recognised by many acts of parliament\u2019 (Life, pp. 10\u201312). He, however, directed the jury to find Broadfoot guilty of manslaughter only, as Calahan had acted without legal warrant. Upon the recommendation of Lord-chancellor Hardwicke, Foster was appointed a puisne judge of the king's bench in succession to Sir William Chapple. He was knighted on 21 April, and took his seat in court for the first time on 1 May 1745 (1 Barrow's Reports, 1812, i. 1). During the eighteen years he sat in the king's bench he maintained a high character for his learning as well as for his integrity and independence of judgment. Lord-chief-justice De Grey, in Brass Crosby's case, declared that Foster might \u2018be truly called the Magna Charta of liberty of persons as well as fortunes\u2019 (Howell, State Trials, xix. 1152), while Sir William Blackstone pronounced him to be \u2018a very great master of the crown law\u2019 (Commentaries, 1770, bk. iv. ch. i.) Thurlow, in a letter dated 11 April 1758, alluded in high terms to Foster's independent conduct in the trial of an indictment for a nuisance in obstructing a common footway through Richmond Park, of which Princess Amelia was then the ranger (Life, pp. 85\u20138), and Churchill in the \u2018Rosciad\u2019 (9th edit. p. 13) sums up his character in one word\u2014\n\nEach judge was true and steady to his trust,\n\nAs Mansfield wise, and as old Foster just.\n\nFoster died on 7 Nov. 1763, in the seventy-fourth year of his age, and was buried in the parish church of Stanton Drew in Somersetshire, where a monument was erected to his memory.

As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword. That adage is exemplified in the writings of Jonathan Mayhew, a Boston minister who is famous for having coined the phrase \u201cNo taxation without representation.\u201d\n\nEarly Life\n\nMayhew was born in 1720 on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. He was a fifth generation descendent of Thomas Mayhew, one of the very first to arrive in the New World and settle on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\n\nJonathan Mayhew died in 1766, a decade before the first shot was fired in the Revolutionary War in 1776, but it would be difficult to imagine the quest for freedom would have ever began if it were not for the influence of this preacher\u2019s sermons.\n\nLife as an Intellectual\n\nYoung Jonathan was an intellectual from an early age. He graduated from Harvard in 1744 and then earned a Doctor of Divinity degree so that he could begin his chosen career as minister of his church. However, Mayhew barely survived the process of ordination because his religious views were so independent and liberal, few other ministers considered him to be an orthodox scholar of the Bible.\n\nIn effect, Mayhew\u2019s views on religion were more akin to that of the Unitarian tradition rather than to the Congregationalist fold in which was a member. He espoused a religious practice largely free of the dogma and ritual of more conservative churches.\n\nMayhew also had passionate views about politics. Like his powerful belief in a religion that was free of dogma and too much authority, Mayhew naturally subscribed to a governmental system that was free from the shackles of higher, oppressive regimes, such as that of the British Monarchy.\n\nMayhew\u2019s Writings\n\nTo this end, Mayhew wrote a number of publications (called sermons), one of the most notable of which was \u201cDiscourse Concerning Unlimited Submission.\u201d This was a remarkable document that was much more than a diatribe against the contemporary policies of the British. It reached back to the times of the ancient conquest of Britain by the Romans, a time in which Mayhew notes that the British were extremely jealous of their own freedoms, and was driven to throw of their submission to Rome.\n\nMayhew concludes that it is the fundamental nature of English-speaking people to be as free and independent as possible, but that the current British government had evolved into an empire that was as oppressive and dictatorial as that to which they were once subjugated by \u2013 the Romans.\n\nThe \u201cDiscourse Concerning Unlimited Submission\u201d was a sensational success. It was published and read not only throughout the American colonies, but in European nations as well. It\u2019s a brilliant and lucid argument for the natural rights of freedom of human beings. The Founding Fathers of the United States were greatly influenced by Mayhew\u2019s philosophy of independence, and so this document was a critical reference to everything that followed, including the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nJonathan Mayhew also worked vigorously in his ministry and church, and also spearheaded efforts to send teachers and ministers throughout the colonies to educate children."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/mayhew-jonathan-1720-1766", "page_content": "Jonathan Mayhew (1720-1766)\n\nSources\n\nCongregational revolutionary\n\nEarly Training. Jonathan Mayhew was born on the small island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the Massachusetts coast, on 8 October 1720. His father, Experience Mayhew, was the missionary to the Indians there, a post the Mayhew family had filled since 1641. The Vineyard mission was one of the few successful English ventures to Christianize Native Americans, and during Jonathan\u2019s youth the Chilmark congregation, as it was called, was a peaceful church, although its numbers were declining as the Indian population decreased. Experience nurtured his converts faithfully, defending them against spurious land claims and the rigors of orthodox Calvinism, which he came to see as too harsh a system of religion for Indians and whites alike. He struggled to obtain adequate funds to support his work. Jonathan\u2019s elder brother Nathan was marked to attend college and follow in his father\u2019s footsteps as a missionary, but his early death left Jonathan to assume this family duty.\n\nReason. Mayhew kept his father\u2019s liberal religious ideas with him as he attended Harvard College, graduating in 1744. There he embraced the rationalist Congregationalism that was a hallmark of the training Harvard offered at that time. Particularly important was the teaching of Professor Edward Wigglesworth, a leading spokesman for rational religion and against the emotionalism of the revivals of the 1730s and 1740s. In 1742 Mayhew briefly turned to revivalism after hearing the great evangelical preacher George Whitefield, but he soon rejected that kind of religion as \u201clow, confused, puerile, conceited, ill-natur\u2019d, [and] enthusiastik,\u201d as he wrote to his father. In 1747 Mayhew became the minister of Boston\u2019s West Congregational Church, where he worked for the rest of his life. From this pulpit Mayhew preached a rational religion that evolved into something quite different from its Puritan roots. Mayhew became an outspoken advocate of free rational inquiry into religious truth and argued that humans had the natural ability to come closer to God through that inquiry. He was a true Enlightenment figure, thinking of the practice of Christianity as a kind of science and even reading the radical French philosophers Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Mayhew ended by rejecting the orthodox beliefs in the three persons of God and in the predestination of a select few for salvation in favor of a faith in a universally benevolent God who loved all humans.\n\nControversies. Mayhew frequently came into conflict with others over religion, politics, and even social matters. An early sign was his lateness in marrying, unusual for a young minister with a good position. Instead of settling down, Mayhew enjoyed an active social life of dining out, hunting, and fishing, although he did not attend theatrical performances, which he considered immoral. His congregation\u2019s criticism of this lifestyle ended when he married nine years after assuming his pulpit, but more serious opposition came from theological and political figures. Mayhew\u2019s rational religion took him into public debates with John Cleaveland, a leading revivalist, and Samuel Hopkins, one of Jonathan Edwards\u2019s students and a major figure in the New Divinity movement. Mayhew\u2019s temper often got the better of him in these controversies, which fostered more bad feeling than mutual understanding. As early as 1754 Mayhew began another long conflict. This time his opponent was the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the leading sponsor of Indian missions in colonial America. He criticized the society for using its resources in parts of New England that needed no missionaries and so failing to bring Native Americans to Christ, reflecting on the difficulties of his own family\u2019s experiences with that task.\n\nPolitics. Criticism of Anglican missions brought Mayhew to a deeper skepticism about relations between England and America, coincided with the first political tensions between the two. Mayhew spoke out against rumors that the Anglican Church was preparing to send a bishop to America to better support its efforts there. Mayhew saw this effort as a significant threat to American religious liberty as it had existed in New England since the days of the Puritan founders. He recalled for his listeners and readers the sacrifices of English Puritans during their own revolution of the 1640s, as they opposed the tyranny of King Charles I and his bishops and struggled to worship God in accordance with their consciences. He argued that the English Puritans were right to oppose their king because he was unjust. This was a much more positive view of the English revolution than Americans had heard up to this period. Over time Mayhew expanded his thoughts to criticize the current English monarchy and its representatives in New England. Mayhew was never fully allied with American political leaders such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock, and he opposed the mobs who demonstrated against the Stamp Act. Yet Mayhew\u2019s thoughts about religious freedom supported their emerging notions of political liberty. He preached his most famous sermon, \u201cThe Snare Broken,\u201d in celebration of the repeal of the Stamp Act. In it he criticized mob violence but also spoke against England\u2019s exploitation of America, setting the tone for the revolutionary era. He failed to see that emerge, however, having a stroke soon after this success and dying on 9 July 1766.\n\nCharles W.

For the English cabinetmaker, see Ince and Mayhew.\n\nGovernor Thomas Mayhew, the Elder (March 31, 1593 \u2013 March 25, 1682) established the first European settlement on Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and adjacent islands in 1642. He is one of the editors of the Bay Psalm Book, the first book published in the Thirteen Colonies. His *istant Peter Foulger was the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nBiography\n\nMarker for Thomas Mayhew homestead in Watertown, M*achusetts\n\nThomas Mayhew was born in Tisbury, in the county of Wiltshire in England. He married Anna (also called Hanna and Abigail) Parkhurst, born about 1600, in Hampshire, England, daughter of Matthew Parkhurst. In 1621 they had a son, Thomas, the Younger, baptised in Hanna's home town of Southampton. Two years later they had another child, Robert Mayhew, baptized in Tisbury.\n\nThe family left England in 1631/2 during the Great Migration of Puritans that brought 20,000 settlers to M*achusetts in thirteen years. Through the agency of Matthew Cradock of London, Mayhew had been appointed to manage properties in Medford, M*achusetts, and to engage in trade and shipbuilding. In or about 1633, Mayhew's wife Anna died, and about 1634 he returned to England for a business meeting with Cradock. While in England, he married Jane Gallion (1602\u20131666), and brought her back to New England with him. Their daughter Hannah was born in 1635, and three more daughters, Mary (1639), Martha (1642), and Bethiah, followed. Martha is the 7th great grandmother to the world-famous singer and songwriter Taylor Swift.\n\nIn 1641, Thomas secured Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and other islands as a proprietary colony from Sir Ferdinando Gorges and the Earl of Stirling. This enabled him to transfer his business operations there. With the help of his son Thomas, a settlement was established and farming and whaling enterprises were begun.\n\nThe Mayhews had great success in regard to Indian policy. Because of the fair treatment of the Indians there, the colony was protected from the bloodshed that occurred elsewhere, in King Philip's War. In 1646, the General Court of M*achusetts directed the religious leaders of the colony to select two among them to serve as missionaries to the natives. So great was the interest aroused by this venture that a society was formed in England also to support the missionaries. Unfortunately a m*ive conflict broke out, called King Philip's War (1675\u201376), which resulted in many deaths of both the settlers and the natives. However, three prominent names appear. They are: John Eliot (known as the Apostle to the Indians); Thomas Mayhew (who was already ministering to the natives); and, three generations later, Eleazar Wheelock, who established \"Doctor Wheelock's Academy for the promotion of Christianity and civility among the savage Indians of this continent\" (now known as Dartmouth College).\n\nIn 1657, the younger Thomas Mayhew was drowned when a ship he was travelling in was lost at sea on a voyage to England. Mayhew's three grandsons Matthew Mayhew (born 1648), Thomas (born 1650), John (born 1652), and other members of his family *isted him in running his business and government.\n\nTranscription of Watertown marker: \"HERE BY THE ANCIENT FORDTHE LANDING AND THE WEIRWAS THE HOMESTALL OFTHOMAS MAYHEW:A LEADER IN WATERTOWN AFFAIRSFROM 1635 TO 1645.AFTERWARDS WITH HIS SON,THE REV. THOMAS MAYHEW,HE LABORED AMONG THE INDIANSAT MARTHA'S VINEYARD.\"\n\nColonizing Dukes County\n\nIn 1641, while engaged in business ventures in the vicinity of Boston, Mayhew succeeded in acquiring the rights to the islands that now cons*ute Dukes County and Nantucket County: Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands. He bought the County for 40 pounds and two beaver skin hats from William Alexander, the 2nd Earl of Stirling. To resolve a conflicting ownership claim, he also paid off Sir Ferdinando Gorges, thereby acquiring a clear *le.\n\nMayhew established himself as governor of Martha's Vineyard in 1642 and sent his son, Thomas the Younger, with about forty families to settle there. He himself followed four years later. Together he and the younger Thomas established Martha's Vineyard's first settlement and called it Great Harbor, now Edgartown.\n\nRelations with the natives\n\nMayhew and his fellow settlers found a large and economically stable native population of about 3,000 living in permanent villages, led by four sachems (chiefs). Relations between the first settlers and their Wampanoag neighbors were peaceful and courteous. Under the leadership of his son, a minister, they ins*uted a policy of respect and fair dealing with the Wampanoag natives that was unequaled anywhere. One of the first of Mayhew's orders was that no land was to be taken from the native islanders, the Wampanoags, without their consent or without fair payment. From this time forward, the colonial settlers and Wampanoag lived without the bloodshed that marked the history of European colonies elsewhere in the New World.\n\nFrom the beginning, Mayhew had worked to preserve the original political ins*utions of the native population. Religion and government were distinct matters, he told the chiefs. When one of your subjects becomes a Christian, he is still under your jurisdiction. Wampanoag land was guarded against further encroachment by white settlers. So successful were these policies that during the bloody battles of King Philip's War, in 1675-1676, the Vineyard's native population never stirred, although they outnumbered the settlers on the island by twenty to one.\n\nSpreading religion\n\nBy 1660 there were about 85 white people living peaceably among the natives, earning their living by farming and fishing. The Mayhew family, which from that time forth became an integral part of island history, wanted to share its religion with the natives, but the Wampanoags were not too interested, having their own spiritual faith. However, once it was clear that, though Mayhew was the governor, the sachems remained in charge of their people, some became curious about the white man's God. When a native named Hiacoomes expressed an interest, Mayhew invited him into his home and instructed him in English and Christianity. Hiacoomes, in return, taught Mayhew the native language. As soon as Mayhew could converse with the natives, he would some days \"walk 20 miles through uncut forests to preach the Gospel...in wigwam or open field\".\n\nThere is a stained gl* window in the baptismal font in the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. depicting Rev. Thomas Mayhew Jr. baptizing a native.\n\nChange was in the air though, for the world outside this small island was unsettled. There were more visitors from off island and some stayed, challenging the Mayhew government, while Baptists and Methodists arrived to make converts from the established Congregational Church.\n\nFrom colony to aristocracy\n\nThrough a maze of conflicting land grants, changing political allegiances, and settler unrest, Mayhew, who styled himself \"Governour Mayhew\", began to rule his island with an iron hand. The most serious threat to his control came in 1665 when Martha's Vineyard was included in the lands placed under the king's brother, the Duke of York. After much delay, a settlement, worked out in 1671, confirmed the Mayhew patent and named Mayhew \"Governour and Chiefe Magistrate\" for life. At the same time, a patent was issued erecting the Manor of Tisbury in the southwestern part of the island. The Governor and his grandson Matthew were made \"joint Lords of the Manor of Tisbury\", and the inhabitants became manorial tenants subject to the feudal jurisdiction of the Mayhews. This full-fledged feudal manor appears to have been the only such ins*ution actually established in New England.\n\nThe attempt of the Mayhews to create a hereditary aristocracy on the Vineyard met with increasing opposition as more and more colonists arrived. When the Dutch temporarily recaptured New York in 1673, open rebellion broke out and this lasted until the colonial government regained control over New York and restored the authority of the Mayhews on the island. The old patriarch died in 1682, at the age of eight-nine. Nine years later the political rule of his family ended when Martha's Vineyard was annexed by M*achusetts after the Glorious Revolution in England, but the manorial land tenure remained. Although some of the Mayhews clung to the \"pleasant fiction\" of their manorial rights almost until the American Revolution and received token quit rents as late as 1732, feudalism on Martha's Vineyard died the same slow, lingering but certain death it did elsewhere in the colonies.\n\nMissionary work\n\nKenneth Scott Latourette has concluded that the Missionary Mayhews of Martha's Vineyard represent what is probably the longest and most persistent missionary endeavor in the annals of all Christendom. The elder Thomas Mayhew, known for his missionary work, was not concerned for Indian souls when he settled on his island; he sought only to improve his social and economic position. His son, Thomas Mayhew the Younger, is credited with the launching an Indian mission. Like his father, he had emigrated from England. Somewhere, he received a liberal education, apparently from private tutors, and after moving to the Vineyard to begin the white settlement there he became pastor of the small Anglican church as well as acting governor in his father's absence. He soon discovered that he could not refuse the challenge he found among the three thousand Pokanaukets, a branch of the mainland Narragansetts, who far outnumbered the whites, so an effective settlement required friendly relations with the Indians. But Thomas the Younger appears to have been motivated largely by spiritual concern, while his father and other members of the family enjoyed the practical results of the Indian mission. The son gradually abandoned most of his secular tasks and spent the remainder of his life among the natives. Progress was slow at first, but by the end of 1652 there were 283 converts, a school for Indian children, and two Indian meetings each Sabbath. The Praying Indians of Martha's Vineyard who said grace before meals became a topic of conversation on both sides of the Atlantic. Thomas Mayhew the Younger carried on his missionary work with little heed for his personal fortunes. As the elder Mayhew put it, his son had followed this work \"when 'twas bare with him for food and rayment, and when indeede there was nothing in sight any waies but Gods promises.\" The situation was improved somewhat by the formation in 1649 of a London missionary society, usually called the New England Company, which in a few years began to provide substantial aid for the Mayhews and other missionaries.\n\nIn the fall of 1657, Thomas Mayhew the Younger sailed for England on a trip combining an appeal for missionary funds with personal business. After leaving Boston Harbor, the ship was never seen again. The death of his only son at the age of thirty-six was a heavy blow to Mayhew and greatly increased the burdens he carried in old age. He made repeated efforts to find a replacement to continue his son's ministry to the Indians, but no minister who knew the language or was willing to learn could be induced to settle permanently on the island, so at the age of sixty Mayhew, who had started as a merchant, then turned landed proprietor, became a missionary in his son's place. For the next twenty-five years he traveled on foot as far as twenty miles to preach once a week at the Indian *embly or to visit the native camps.\n\nDeath\n\nWhen the venerable Governor Mayhew became ill one Sunday evening in 1682, he calmly informed his friends and relatives that \"his Sickness would now be to Death, and he was well contented therewith, being full of Days, and satisfied with Life\". His great-grandson, Experience Mayhew, a son of John, was only eight at the time, but he clearly remembered being led to the bedside to receive from the dying man a blessing \"in the Name of the Lord\". Matthew Mayhew, the eldest grandson, succeeded his military and civil duties. Rev. John Mayhew, the youngest grandson and grandfather of Jonathan Mayhew, continued his missionary work to the Indians. Thomas, another grandson, became a Judge of M*achusetts.\n\nHis descendant Jonathan Mayhew was a prominent 18th-century Boston clergyman who coined the phrase \"No taxation without representation.\"\n\nDescendants\n\nMatthew Mayhew (1648\u20131710), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician and missionary\n\nExperience Mayhew (1673\u20131758), Martha's Vineyard colonist and missionary\n\nJoseph Mayhew (1709/10\u20131782), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician, and missionary\n\nJonathan Mayhew (1720\u20131766), Congregationalist minister and Patriot\n\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright I (1792\u20131854), Episcopal Bishop of New York\n\nCharles Tupper (1821\u20131915), 6th Prime Minister of Canada\n\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright II (1821\u20131863) U.S. Navy officer during the American Civil War\n\nElla Edes (1832\u20131916) American writer, newspaper correspondent, and Catholic activist\n\nJonathan M.
