In their first game, they defeated the St. Louis Hawks 97-84 on Dec. 26, 1964 in what became the first of 14 straight wins with the new starting five (Boston had won its two previous games prior to inserting Naulls into the starting five). That helped set the tone for the franchise\u2019s 7th straight NBA title, and 8th overall.\n\nIn addition to Naulls, the starting five for that game included Satch Sanders, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones and Bill Russell \u2013 all Naismith Memorial Hall of Famers in addition to being the only black players on the Celtics roster at that time.\n\nWhile there was certainly a heightened sense of social consciousness throughout the country at that time, Red Auerbach was a coach consumed by winning and because of that, didn\u2019t initially recognize the historical significance of putting Naulls in with the first unit.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I had no idea that I started five black players until a writer pointed it out to me a few weeks later,\u201d Auerbach said at the time. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make a difference to me what color any of my players were. I was putting the five best players out on the court so that we could win.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the first all-Black starting five was just part of the history-making narrative surrounding Naulls.\n\nHe spent his first seven seasons with the New York Knicks and served as a team captain for the last three. Naulls was the first Black captain in New York Knicks history and one of the first for any major professional sports team.\n\nDuring his career, the 6-foot-6 Naulls, known for his one-handed outside shot, was a four-time All-Star (1958; 1960-1962) who was a career 15.8 points per game scorer who left New York as one of the franchise\u2019s all-time leader scorers.\n\nSensing he could be of some help to the Boston Celtics in their quest to win yet another championship, Auerbach convinced Naulls to join forces with the Celtics.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the famous guys Red (Auerbach) enticed to come out of retirement,\u201d Heinsohn said.\n\nUpon retirement, the former UCLA star went into real estate and commercial development in addition to activating several community-based initiatives designed to aid youth.\n\nThat would serve as a precursor to his true calling as a pastor.\n\n\u201cThe main factors contributing to my success have been, first, the wisdom of my parents in seeing that I received a disciplined Christian upbringing and the best education available and, second, my good fortune in having achieved a high and rare degree of success in athletics,\u201d Naulls said in a curriculum vita obtained by NBC Sports Boston. \u201cAs an adult, I can reflect back and realize how blessed I am to have escaped the perpetuation of mediocrity foisted upon most African-American people. Even though I have had the opportunity of meeting and associating with the \u201celite\u201d of our society, I have always understood that my successes were a deviation from the norm, and I have never stopped agonizing over the plight of poor, underprivileged people who have not experienced the benefits of a mother\u2019s unselfish sacrifice and vision to equip her children.\n\nNaulls added, \u201cThe insecurities that I felt growing up in a disadvantaged community I have never\n\nforgotten. These memories have directly influenced my life\u2019s commitment to serve young people of all ethnic backgrounds who would commit themselves to the pursuit of Truth and excellence. I was taught very early the value of a positive attitude about working toward becoming the best that I could be. Young people are our most valuable resource, and my life\u2019s goal is to bring together prepared and committed teachers who will share their specific knowledge and wisdom with youth who commit themselves to preparing to become positive and productive members of our society.\u201d\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

He established UCLA's single-game rebounding record, totaling 28 rebounds in a game against Arizona State on Jan. 28, 1956. His record still stands today.\n\n\n\nThrough three varsity seasons at UCLA, Naulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. He secured All-America honors after his senior season.\n\n\n\nWhen he had finished playing at UCLA, Naulls had established the program's all-time scoring record (1,225 points in three seasons). He currently ranks No. 40 on the Bruins' all-time scoring list and No. 7 on the all-time rebounds list. Naulls led the Bruins in rebounding in each of his three seasons on the varsity team.\n\n\n\nNaulls was an all-conference selection (Pacific Coast Conference) in 1955 and 1956.\n\n\n\nAfter a remarkable collegiate career, Naulls was selected in the second round of the NBA Draft by the St. Louis Hawks. He enjoyed a 10-year NBA career, competing for St. Louis, the New York Knicks, the San Francisco Warriors and the Boston Celtics. He became the first former UCLA player to lead his team to the NBA Finals. Boston advanced to the finals and won the NBA Championship in 1964, 1965 and 1966 (Naulls' final three NBA seasons).\n\n\n\nNaulls, along with Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones and Tom Sanders, became the first all-African-American starting team in the history of integrated professional sports in Dec. 1964, when Naulls replaced injured Tom Heinsohn in the starting lineup.\n\n\n\nChoosing to retire from the NBA after leading Boston to the 1966 NBA Championship, Naulls returned to Los Angeles and completed his undergraduate degree at UCLA. Naulls was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, the NCAA honored Naulls with the Silver Anniversary Award, bestowed upon five former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their collegiate eligibility. While the award factors in an individual's athletic accomplishments, the Silver Anniversary Award also uses professional accomplishments and philanthropic work as criteria.\n\n\n\nAfter his basketball career had ended, Naulls worked with youth for over five decades. He served young people growing up in communities similar to those of his childhood in San Pedro and Watts and founded a non-profit organization. The foundation raised funds to provide week-long free summer basketball camps on college campuses for junior high and high school boys, recommended by coaches in southern California.\n\n\n\nNaulls enrolled in Fuller Theological Seminary in 1990, earning a master's degree in theology in 1993. During that time, he worked as a college counselor for Brentwood Presbyterian Church. Later, he served as associate pastor for Antelope Valley Christian Center. In 1993, he incorporated Willie Naulls Ministries.\n\n\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anne Van de Water Naulls; his children Lisa, Shannon, Joanh and Malaika; and his grandchildren Celia, Michael, Dean, Jonathan, Elle and Jojo.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Willie-Naulls/Summary/66576", "page_content": "The Improbable, Inevitable Miami Heat by John Wilmes It was not foreseeable Miami would defeat the most talented teams in the sport, flaring an unusual ability to find and corner the frightened child within some of the NBA's biggest stars.\n\nNBA Draft Report: Cason Wallace Of Kentucky by Zachary Cohen Cason Wallace is a plus defender with an NBA ready jumper that can immediately help a lot of basketball teams, and he's going to be a chameleon in the league when it comes to fit.\n\nFor The Nuggets, Attention Isn't the Prize by John Wilmes Your life is certainly better if you don't make yourself think like a media executive, but the exercise may be useful to those acting confused about why a business-first basketball team with minimal mainstream history and no loud characters has been under-publicized."}, {"url": "https://www.2kratings.com/willie-naulls-1964-65-boston-celtics", "page_content": "About Willie Naulls\n\nWillie Naulls was a member of the renowned NBA team 1964-65 Boston Celtics who played at the Small Forward position.\n\nWillie Naulls on NBA 2K23\n\nOn NBA 2K23, this version of Willie Naulls is yet to be added in the game thus his 2K Rating, Attributes, Badges and Hot Zones are not available."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/d38ef8a932cb49bfae54665fb9ab3017", "page_content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Willie Naulls, the former UCLA star who was a four-time All-Star with the New York Knicks and won three NBA championships with the Boston Celtics, has died.
