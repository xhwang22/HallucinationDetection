Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-ii-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik\u2019s road to the national team from a 14 year old in the stands to a 20 year old Matildas debutante was the prologue.\n\nThe main feature would begin once she reached her dream. It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/emily-gielnik", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1992\n\nFirst Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games Tokyo 2020"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Emily_Gielnik", "page_content": "What we do.

With only 18-players able to be selected on an Olympic Football squad, Emily Gielnik missed out on making the Australian women\u2019s football team for the Rio 2016 Games by one spot. \u201c[It] was heart wrenching and disappointing, to say the least, I felt entirely defeated at that point, I felt like I had done what I could do, and I wasn't going,\u201d the Matildas forward, who had also missed out on the 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad a year prior, told Tokyo 2020 in April. \u201cA very difficult time in my career to understand but moving past that was just as important for me so that's what I focussed on.\u201d The Brisbane-born footballer knew she wanted to be an Olympian as soon as she pulled on the green and gold jersey \u2013 making her senior national debut against Japan, Tokyo in 2012. \u201cI remember that feeling of actually watching the girls at the Olympics from my couch with my family and just how passionate and excited I was to be supporting them,\u201d Gielnik said. \u201cI knew that's what I wanted. I wanted to be on the on the other end of that, being a part of that. So that was more so when it really sunk in that I wanted that more than anything.\u201d Now the 28-year-old is squarely within the mix for Tokyo 2020 selection after scoring a double against Rio 2016 gold medallist Germany in Australia\u2019s 5-2 friendly loss last month.\n\nHowever, Gielnik wasn\u2019t the only Matilda to miss out five years ago with Aivi Luik also named as an alternate for Rio 2016. The 36-year-old told Tokyo 2020 it would be a dream come true to represent Australia at Tokyo 2020. \u201cTo be able to go there and compete with the best in a tournament that has such history, I think it would be amazing, it would be a once in a lifetime kind of experience. And it was something that I always wanted as a kid.\u201d\n\nThe ability to preserve Getting knocked down, facing challenges, and overcoming barriers is something both Gielnik and Luik know all too well. For Gielnik, after missing out on Rio 2016, she didn\u2019t let her determination die, she continued to work hard and made the decision to leave her long-time club Brisbane Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 W-League season. It was a move that would pay dividends as she made Australia\u2019s squad for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in France. \u201cWhat I would put it down to, honestly, is just how I've approached every football season from then onwards leaving no stone unturned, just knowing my own body, knowing what it takes to stay at that top level and what's required of me in working alongside the clubs but also working on my own in terms of individual performance away from the football clubs,\u201d she said of her desire to continue being her best.\" \u201cThat's really what's got to me, is just honing in on that that focus and those extra things that have that kept me in the top level and keep giving me the opportunity to come back into the Matildas squad.\u201d Luik, who also got her start in the W-League with Brisbane Roar, had to wait a tad longer before making her World Cup debut despite making her international debut in 2010 and was part of Australia\u2019s victorious AFC Asian Cup team that year. But throughout her career she was plagued with injuries including bilateral hamstring tendinopathy. Despite missing out on selection for both the 2011 and 2015 World Cups then Rio 2016 Olympics, the midfielder continued playing because it had been her dream to go to a World Cup. \u201cAfter that second let down, I didn't really think it was going to be in the cards for me, but I continued to play,\u201d she said.\n\nAivi Luik (2018 Getty Images)\n\nIt was in 2018, seven years after her last appearance in the green and gold, that Luik took to the pitch as a Matilda once again during their 5-0 friendly win against Thailand and after a successful season with Spanish club Levante in 2019, she was on the radar of then Matildas coach Ante Milicic for the upcoming World Cup in France. Named in the 23-player World Cup squad, it wouldn\u2019t be until Australia\u2019s final group game that the Perth-born player would take to the field. \u201cI thought maybe I was going on and it didn't happen so I [was] starting to wonder if maybe it wouldn't happen but I did get that debut and it felt amazing,\u201d she said. Australia beat Jamaica 4-1 in that match. \u201cIt was really emotional afterwards, especially to see my brother and sister in the crowd. Having them witness my dream since I was a kid was amazing. It's very hard to put into words, but it's definitely one of the highlights of my life.\u201d\n\nTogether again after 400 days Assembling at Soest, the headquarters of the Dutch Football Federation, it was the first time since Australia had secured qualification for Tokyo 2020 in March last year during their 5-0 and 2-1 wins over Vietnam, that they were together again. And for many, it was the first time they had seen their national teammates \u2013 many have spent the last decade playing together in the green and gold \u2013 in over a year so there was excitement. \u201cIt was so good to see everyone again in camp, obviously, their familiar faces, but it's like you never left. It feels like we had we just saw them not long ago. So really exciting, really good vibes. We are one big family, and it was just so good to see everyone again,\u201d Gielnik said ahead of the team\u2019s first match in 400 days. With Australian-based players unable to be selected, it was up to the Matildas playing abroad to put their best foot forward in front of Tony Gustavsson, who was appointed head coach in September last year. The former United States assistant coach took the reins of Australia\u2019s most loved national team in the New Year but due to the global pandemic hadn\u2019t been able to meet players in person. With the playing group meeting Gustavsson for the first time, there were positive vibes around camp. \u201cTony has showed us the way that he believes we can play in order to get us to the next level,\u201d Luik said of the Swedish-born coach. \u201cThat's what we all want at the end of the day and through his words, through his intensity and the belief in us, I think that's really flowed through his meetings and how he runs training sessions.\u201d \u201cVery good energy, good vibe and most importantly, extremely encouraging just coming in. So that really works well for me,\u201d Gielnik said. \u201cI think me as a player, I really respond better with someone who really believes in me and has that positive energy to want you to get on the ball. So I'm really looking forward to what he's got in store for all of us.\u201d\n\nWelcoming the pressure From fighting for equality, recognition, and the right to play the game they love, the Matildas of today have become one of the most recognisable sport teams in Australia \u2013 and in women\u2019s football. Following their Rio 2016 quarter-finals loss in a penalty shootout, it was at the 2017 Tournament of Nations that Australia reached new heights as they beat Japan (4-2), the United States (1-0) and Brazil (6-1) to win their first piece of silverware since the 2010 AFC Asian Cup success. Going on to win their next four matches on home soil, the following year still saw solid performances including a fourth-placed finish at the 2018 Algarve Cup and runners-up performance at the 2018 AFC Asian Cup. The 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup left more to be desired, as they bowed out in the quarter-finals to Norway, but their qualification for Tokyo 2020 once again brought excitement. While recent 5-2 and 5-0 losses to Germany and the Netherlands brought harsh critics from Australian media \u2013 just three months out from Tokyo 2020. But the pressure to produce results is something the side welcome. \u201cI think it's something that we enjoy and welcome with open arms, because if you're a team that is not doing well, there's no pressure on you so because we've risen through the rankings and we've got a name for ourselves, now there is that pressure but it's great,\u201d Luik said. \u201cIt means people are following us. People want us to do well, and people expect us to do well.

However, she is currently studying to obtain a Bachelor of Exercise Science from an unnamed institution.\n\nIt is not out of place to say that she was born with a natural gift for sports, but she didn\u2019t have the slightest idea that would end up a footballer. It was basketball and rugby at the beginning, but due to the physicality of the game and injuries she sustained, her mother talked her out of it.\n\nBut she was not the type that gives up easily, so she convinced her mother to allow her to play soccer instead. And that marks the beginning of a journey, though filled with many ups and downs, only courage, drive, and passion saw her through.\n\nToday, She is one of the formidable strikers in the Westfield Matildas with the natural knack to score goals from anywhere and everywhere.\n\nAlso; Read Aliona Bolsova- Tennis Career and Earnings, Bio, Dating, 7 Unknown Details\n\nEmily Gielnik\u2019s 2021 Player Profile\n\nFull Name: Emily Gielnik\n\nEmily Gielnik Date of Birth: 13th May 1992\n\n13th May 1992 Age: 31 years old\n\n31 years old Place of Birth: Melbourne, Australia\n\nMelbourne, Australia Nationality: Australia\n\nAustralia Current Club: Vittsjo GIK (Sweden)\n\nVittsjo GIK (Sweden) Position: Forward\n\nForward Jersey: #15\n\n#15 Preferred Foot: Right\n\nRight Education: Cleveland District State High School/ Bachelor of Exercise Science\n\nCleveland District State High School/ Bachelor of Exercise Science Height: 6 feet 0 inch (1.83m)\n\n6 feet 0 inch (1.83m) Weight: 68kg (149lbs)\n\nNet Worth Of Emily Gielnik\n\nGielnik who can play on the wing but is more dangerous in the center makes a pretty amount of money from playing football.

Gielnik Didn\u2019t Make It To The 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup And 2016 Rio Olympics\n\nPlayers are always devastated whenever they don\u2019t make it to the squad representing their countries in international tournaments. It was a similar experience for Gielnik whose name was omitted from the 2015 FIFA women\u2019s world cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. Even though she was part of the squad that played the Rio 2016 qualifying games.\n\n2. She Owns A Fitness Outfit\n\nSometimes happiness and fulfillment don\u2019t only come from targets you set to reach. But also from areas, you ain\u2019t looking at.

Her Father\u2019s Criticisms As A Child Inspired Her To Greatness\n\nThough her mother was apprehensive when she wanted to start playing football in the beginning, but her dad was the opposite. In fact, he was the one who often takes her to every sporting event. He watches all her basketball and football games and goes as far as to the sidelines.\n\nShe gives him credit for all the times he supported and pushed her to go the extra mile, to become a better player.\n\n4. Tokyo Olympics Is Her First Olympics\n\nAfter she didn\u2019t make the cut for the 2016 Rio Olympics, the forward didn\u2019t allow it to weigh her down completely. Football is the game she loves, so she improved on herself and her skills.\n\nShe moved to Norway and later returned to play in the W-League for Melbourne Victory. After the improvement, she returned to the Westfield Matildas and began to gain more ground by scoring more goals.\n\nWith this, she was shortlisted for Jordan 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup. And the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in France.\n\nShe was in Germany for Bayern Munich where she gained more experience. Now, she is seen as a key figure for Australia in Tokyo.\n\n5.

Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-i-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "If there was ever a moment that encapsulates the evolution of Emily Gielnik, it was a superb strike against Korea Republic in the 2019 Cup of Nations.\n\nDeep in the match, the 26 year old drifted in from the left wing, sized up the full back, cut inside and rifled a strike at the near post.\n\nIt was a strike of a player full of confidence and at the height of her powers.\n\nGielnik has become a hot topic of conversation for women\u2019s football fans of late, with her newly-commanding presence on the pitch leaving those new to the game wondering where this prolific forward came from.\n\nHer story is one of resilience, grit and determination. One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2019/05/28/emily-gielniks-journey-from-queensland-to-her-first-world-cup/", "page_content": "In football there are stories of disappointment but there are also the ones of triumph and dedication, where players fight tooth and nail to get their chance. Westfield Matildas forward Emily Gielnik is one of those stories.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the age of 12 that Gielnik started playing football, after injuries in basketball convinced her parents to encourage her to give a different round ball game a go.\n\nPlaying most of her junior football with Redlands United FC, Gielnik worked under the guidance of current Junior Matildas coach Rae Dower, who was Technical Director at the Cleveland-based club at the time.\n\n\u201cRae coming up was good for my development; she more or less gave me the confidence to be free as a player, take players on and score goals,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what made me become more of a goal scorer so most definitely she had impact when I was younger and obviously as I got older and matured as a player there are a lot of other coaches and people.\u201d\n\nIn her first season of playing, the Melbourne-born attacker made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour however, at the age of 15 with teammates and friends making the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team, Gielnik didn\u2019t receive a letter.\n\nIt was a disappointing moment for the teenager.\n\nHowever, opportunities pop up in the strangest of ways and it was while on a school trip to Canberra when she visited the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), that an unbelievable chance came about.\n\nThe Matildas were training at the AIS with then Head Coach Tom Sermanni when Gielnik\u2019s sports teacher asked him if she could join the training session.\n\n\u201cI must have trained out of my skin even though I was so intimidated because it was all the best players in Australia, and all the really old-school Matildas were there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom Sermanni asked me to come back the next day and I played a training match with the Matildas.\u201d\n\nImpressed with Gielnik, Sermanni called Jeff Hopkins who was heading up the women\u2019s football program at QAS and recommended he get her into the program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how my journey kicked off,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nShe played a whole season with the QAS before earning a contract the following year with Brisbane Roar, however an injury would keep her sidelined for the whole 2009 Westfield W-League season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following season at 18 that she made her debut.\n\nGielnik had to work incredibly hard to get her Westfield W-League opportunity and even in her first two seasons with the club she wouldn\u2019t see much game time with 15 of her 19 appearances coming from the bench.\n\nHowever, after a successful 2011-12 season with Roar, where she was dubbed the \u2018super sub\u2019 for her ability to score goals as a substitute, Gielnik earnt a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nIt was a tough squad to break into at the time, particularly being a striker, with the likes of Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna and Kyah Simon just some of the players who had cemented spots in the national team.\n\nAfter making several appearances, Gielnik spent a couple of years away from the national team but fought her way back into Westfield Matildas fold for the 2016 Olympic qualification campaign.\n\nHowever, there was heartbreak when she just missed out on going to the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to be out of the squad but once you are it makes you realise how hungry you are to get back in,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlways one to work hard, she continued to keep pushing and made the decision to leave Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 Westfield W-League season to reach new heights as a player.\n\nAll her hard work paid off when Gielnik got the phone call that she was selected in the Westfield Matildas FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad for the France tournament this year.\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the 27-year-old, who cried after hearing the news.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put a word on it to be honest,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a sense of relief and satisfaction in a way with the build-up and how everything has come together.\n\n\u201cI know I spoke about it in W-League and how desperate I was to make this one so it was more the relief of what I had done had been recognised and I\u2019ve been rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nGielnik puts her recent selection for the national team down to perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just persistence and I think that\u2019s the key for me, the earlier I learnt that it takes more than training with the teams and that it takes dedication then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be rewarded,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Westfield Matildas are currently in Antalya, Turkey for a 10-day camp as they prepare for their opening game of the

road to the national team from a 14 year old in the stands to a 20 year old Matildas debutante was the prologue.\n\nThe main feature would begin once she reached her dream. It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Emily_Gielnik", "page_content": "What we do.

After stopping basketball due to injuries she took up soccer and was eventually signed by Brisbane Roar for the second season of the W\u2013League.[1] At Brisbane she became recognised as a \"super sub\" for her knack of coming off the substitutes' bench to score late goals.[2] Gielnik played eight seasons at Brisbane, appearing in 83 games and scoring 30 goals. She won the W-League Championship in 2010\u201311 and the Premiership in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318.[3]\n\nLiverpool LFC and Ottawa Fury, 2012\u20132013\n\nIn May 2012, Gielnik signed for English club Liverpool L.F.C., during the 2012 FA WSL season.[4] In October 2012, she was one of ten players to be released by Liverpool's new manager Mark Beard.[5] In 2013, Gielnik joined Ottawa Fury for their W-League season.[6]\n\nUrawa Red Diamonds, 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 Olympics, Gielnik joined Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds.[7]\n\nAvaldsnes IL, 2017\n\nGielnik joined Norwegen team Avaldsnes IL for the 2017 season. She had a breakout season with the team, scoring eight goals in league play. Avaldsnes finished second in the Toppserien and won the Norwegian Cup.[8]\n\nMelbourne Victory, 2018\u20132019\n\nGielnik signed with Melbourne Victory for the 2018\u201319 W-League season.\n\nBayern Munich, 2019\u20132020\n\nOn 23 August 2019, Gielnik joined German Frauen-Bundesliga club Bayern Munich.[9] In July 2020, she left the club after making only 6 appearances, partially due to injury.[10]\n\nVittsj\u00f6, 2020\n\nA week after leaving Bayern Munich, Gielnik signed with another European club, joining Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6.[11]\n\nBrisbane Roar, 2020\u2013\n\nIn November 2020, Gielnik returned Australia, signing with her hometown club, Brisbane Roar.[12]\n\nInternational career\n\nGielnik scored a hat-trick on her international debut for Australia U-19s in October 2011.[1] She made her first appearance for the senior Matildas team in a 3\u20130 friendly defeat to World champions Japan in Tokyo on 11 July 2012.[13]\n\nGielnik was named to the Australian squad for 2016 Olympic Qualifying, she scored a goal against Vietnam.[14] Australia won the tournament and qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nGielnik was part of the Matildas squad that won the 2017 Tournament of Nations and defeated the United States for the first time ever.[15]\n\nAt the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup Gielnik appeared in three matches for Australia. The Matildas advanced to the final, but lost to Japan 1\u20130.

Like Cinderella it was a race against the clock for Australian football player Emily Gielnik, but she has managed to escape the confines of her moonboot, trading Velcro straps for leather lace-ups just in time to make the Matildas squad for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup in Jordan. Moments before boarding her plane to Portugal for the 2018 Algarve Cup in early March, Gielnik received news that the excruciating pain in her ankle was a result of bone stress. She says it was a blessing in disguise as any further strain would have caused a fracture, sidelining the Matildas forward for 3-6 months. With a grueling strength and conditioning program combined with some TLC, Gielnik has beaten the odds and found her happily ever after in the Australian squad.\n\nGielnik says her most recent injury is the result of a prior ankle fracture following one of the biggest performances that sparked her professional career in 2012. Gielnik made her debut for the Young Matildas in the FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Vietnam scoring a hat-trick and changing the game for the green and gold, from three goals down to a 4-3 win. She says however, an evolution in her career has occurred more recently, coincidently in last year\u2019s Algarve Cup, scoring three goals during the tournament against big name teams including China and The Netherlands.\n\n\u201cIt was a turning point for me not just scoring the goals but having a good tournament and the realisation that I wanted to do it (football) full-time and take it more seriously,\u201d Gielnik says.\n\nGielnik, 25, was a late bloomer to the sport at age 12 when she began playing for Redlands United, already setting her sights high towards Brisbane Roar and Young Matildas. She says her pathway into the sport was quite different to others as it happened during a school trip to the Australian Institute of Sport where the Matildas were holding a training session.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my sports teacher who asked the coach at the time, Tom Sermanni, if I could have a session with them,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cHe (Sermanni) asked me to come back the next day and I played a game with them. Straight away he made the call to get me into the QAS (Queensland Academy of Sport) with Jeff Hopkins who was the head coach at the time.\u201d\n\nGielnik\u2019s professional football career began with the Brisbane Roar in 2009 where she later was dubbed the super-sub coming off the bench time and time again to score 12 goals in 2011-12 season.\n\n\u201cI got second highest goal scorer for that year and I only played 5-10 minutes every game,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure to keep going on and scoring but it actually just kept happening.\u201d\n\nHaving recently finished her eighth season loyal to her club, Gielnik is eager to go all the way with Brisbane Roar after they were knocked out in a devastating loss in Westfield W-League semi-final despite finishing minor premiers.\n\n\u201cSo we didn\u2019t win and that\u2019s just football; in the most important games any team can win on any given day and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gielnik\u2019s season never ends with W-League. Throughout her career she has ventured to international clubs including Liverpool, Ottawa Fury in Canada, Urawa Red Diamonds in Japan and Avaldsnes IL in Norway. She says although the style of play differs from place to place, the W-league provides a high standard of football.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are far behind and sometimes I think we are a little bit ahead. Now we are starting to attract international big names as well as those in the American league coming over to play W-League.\u201d\n\nDespite the W-League producing strong competition Gielnik says women\u2019s football has a lot of catching up to do in the male oriented sport but it is growing every year. She says Brisbane Roar is already contributing to that growth by including the young Roar girls under-17s team to compete in the NPL Queensland Women\u2019s competition.\n\n\u201cI think it is a foot in the door for the girls to be exposed.\u201d\n\nShe says the biggest issue is the lack of opportunities for exposure and is why Brisbane Roar are trying to provide a platform for youth girls teams as young as 13-14.\n\n\u201cI think it needs a bit of work (the football pathway) but its heading in the right direction, so it\u2019s a positive.\u201d\n\nShe says her biggest advice to young up and comers is to be doing extra work outside of training.\n\n\u201cThose willing to work a bit hard will be rewarded in the end.\u201d\n\nOn top of her already busy schedule Gielnik also holds private coaching for girls that she believes are quite talented, this is on top of owning her own strength and condition gym ShedEm, teaching 16 classes a week.\n\nBeing selected to play for the green and gold in the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup has crossed one goal off Gielnik\u2019s list and if all goes well she is eager to compete in 2018 Tournament of Nations in the US after Matildas won the major competition last year putting them on the map.\n\nThe Matildas kick-off their Asian Cup campaign in Jordan on Sunday, April 8.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup group stage fixtures\n\nAustralia | v | Korea Republic\n\nApril 8 | King Abdullah Stadium II, Amman, Jordan.\n\nKick-off: 3.00am (EST) Fox Sports\n\nVietnam | v | Australia\n\nApril 11 | Amman International Stadium, Amman, Jordan\n\nKick-off: 3.00am (EST) Fox Sport\n\nJapan | v | Australia\n\nApril 13 | Amman International Stadium, Amman, Jordan.\n\nKick-off: 11:45pm (EST) on Fox Sports\n\n2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup groups\n\nGroup A: Jordan (Current FIFA world ranking: 50), China PR (13), Thailand (29), Philippines (70)\n\nGroup B: Japan (8), Australia (6), Korea Republic (15), Vietnam (31)\n\nMatildas squad:\n\nLydia Williams (GK), Caitlin Cooper, Aivi Luik, Clare Polkinghorne, Laura Alleway, Chloe Logarzo, Steph Catley, Elise Kellond-Knight, Alex Chidiac, Emily van Egmond, Lisa de Vanna, Casey Dumont (GK, Tameka Butt, Alanna Kennedy, Emily Gielnik, Hayley Raso, Kyah Simon, Mackenzie Arnold (GK), Katrina Gorry, Sam Kerr, Ellie Carpenter, Larissa Crummer, Michelle Heyman."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/emily-gielnik/biography", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik Biography\n\nAustralian soccer player\n\nEmily Gielnik (born 13 May 1992) is an Australian professional soccer player who plays as a forward for Aston Villa of the FA WSL. and the Australia women's national team.
