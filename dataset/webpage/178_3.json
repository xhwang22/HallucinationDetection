{"Acoustic Soul was released in 2005.": [{"url": "https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/arie-india-1975/", "page_content": "Let it play in the background as you study and immerse yourself in this topic!\n\nIndia Arie is a four-time Grammy award-winning singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. She has sold over 10 million records worldwide.\n\nArie was born in Denver, Colorado on October 3, 1975 to parents Joyce and Ralph Simpson. When she was 13, her parents divorced and Arie moved with her mother and siblings to Atlanta, Georgia. When she got to Atlanta, Arie began to play guitar. Arie went on to also play the saxophone, baritone clarinet, French horn, and trumpet. Arie attended Savannah College of Arts and Design where she studied jewelry design. She would eventually give this up to focus her attention on music.\n\nCollaborating with other local artists in Atlanta, Arie and the artists eventually formed the music group Groovement. The group was very successful, but in 1999, Arie was discovered by and signed a deal with Motown records in Los Angeles, California. There at the age of 24 she began her career as a solo artist.\n\nArie is famous for writing songs about female empowerment and dismissing the societal standards of beauty. Arie\u2019s debut album, Acoustic Soul, was released in 2001 and earned her seven Grammy nominations. The album was also certified double platinum by the Music Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nIn 2002, Arie released her second album, Voyage to India. It was certified platinum by the RIAA and it won Best R&BAlbum at the 2003 Grammy Awards. Arie\u2019s success continued with her albums Testimony: Vol 1, Life and Relationship and Testimony: Vol 2, Love and Politics released in 2006 and 2009, respectively. Her album, Testimony: Vol 2 debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 list. Arie took a few years off from making music and in 2013, she released her fifth album, Songversation. Arie released a collaborative album with musician Joe Sample called Christmas with Friends in 2015. In 2016, she released a song called \u201cBreathe\u201d that was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and the death of Eric Garner. In 2017, Arie released her first EP called Songversation: Medicine.\n\nArie has four Grammy awards and 21 Grammy nominations. She also has two BET awards, four NAACP Image awards, and has been nominated for five Soul Train music awards."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ready_for_Love_(India.Arie_song)", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Ready for Love (India.Arie song)?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.timeout.com/music/the-best-soul-songs", "page_content": "The best soul music songs hit you where it hurts \u2013 namely, square in the chest. But it\u2019s a misnomer to say all the genre\u2019s greatest tunes are about love. Sure, a great deal of the most classic soul tracks are indeed centred on matters of the heart, whether it\u2019s the euphoria of young romance or the drama of a broken relationship. But just as many are about social injustice, religious salvation and the freedom of letting loose on the dancefloor. Really, a great soul song can be about anything \u2013 it just has to come from, well, the soul.\n\nIn compiling our list of the greatest ever soul music songs, we\u2019ve touched on as many corners of the R&B landscape as possible, from Stax and Motown to Northern Soul and neo-soul.

Never have there been so many true virtuoso players, working in so many different styles, expanding the possibilities of the instrument with their seemingly boundless imaginations. And as listeners and fans, we have never had access to this much music, old and new. Virtually the entire history of recording is literally at our fingertips through our phones and computers. Want to compare Joni Mitchell\u2019s early records with her later work? Want to hear 1920s recordings of Blind Blake, or the quirky folk of England\u2019s Incredible String Band from the late \u201960s? Where should you start if you want to understand all this fuss about Tommy Emmanuel? What\u2019s the story with Michael Hedges? Just start streaming; maybe you\u2019ll find that magical album. At the very least, the search will be interesting and enlightening.\n\nIt recently occurred to us that in these fractured and hyper times, when we are deluged with so much information from everywhere, and it is so difficult to keep up with anything before the next shiny object appears to distract us, many AG readers might not be aware of a lot of the fantastic acoustic-guitar-driven albums that have come out in the new millennium. Well, we\u2019re here to help! We asked some of our regular writers to give us lists of their favorite acoustic-guitar-dominated recordings that came out between 2000 and 2017, and then opened the topic to you, our readers, and were greeted by a blizzard of responses\u2014more than 1,500 total choices.\n\nThis was not, strictly speaking, a poll, in which the albums that got the most \u201cvotes\u201d would constitute our Top 25 (or the ten honorable mentions). Otherwise, you\u2019d probably have four by Tommy Emmanuel on here, and three by Julian Lage. Instead, our goal was to show the range of the great acoustic-guitar music that\u2019s been made so far in this century. So we limited the picks to one album per artist (sneaking in a couple of other mentions when we felt like it) and tried to broaden the list to reflect not just the virtuosos\u2014you\u2019ll find plenty here\u2014but also some of the talented guitar-playing singer-songwriters who turned up repeatedly in the survey, as well. Our picks are listed in chronological order by album release. You\u2019ll no doubt be mystified by some choices, possibly angered by others\u2014or by the omissions this sort of list inevitably engenders: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t include ___!\u201d Honest, we\u2019re not trying to make you mad. We simply want to turn you on to some great music you might not have heard\u2014most of which you can access through Spotify and/or Apple Music (and no doubt other streaming services).\n\nAlas, you will not find any classical-guitar picks here (such a list might make its way into our sister publication Classical Guitar), nor is there any Hawaiian music, or much world music in general (save for albums by Corey Harris and Habib Koit\u00e9). Maybe another time. However, you will find an additional listing of ten particularly notable archival/historical albums and boxes that have come out since 2000.\n\nHappy listening! The videos are all performances of songs from the albums mentioned.\n\nVarious Artists\n\n\u2018O Brother, Where Art Thou?\u2019 Soundtrack\n\n(Lost Highway) 2000\n\nA true phenomenon of recent music history, this old-time music soundtrack for the Coen Brothers\u2019 quirky and fun film sold more than 8 million copies and won Album of the Year at the Grammys (as well as other honors). The soundtrack was put together by T Bone Burnett and features a stellar cast of pickers and singers, including Norman Blake, Alison Krauss, Dan Tyminski, Emmylou Harris, the Peasall Sisters, Gillian Welch, Ralph Stanley, and many more. Look for the \u201c10th Anniversary Edition,\u201d which includes a bonus disc with 14 added tracks.\n\nLaurence Juber\n\nLJ Plays the Beatles\n\n(Solid Air) 2000\n\nJuber took up the guitar after hearing the Beatles in 1964, and later spent three years in Paul McCartney\u2019s Wings. So who better to render Beatles songs in wondrous solo acoustic arrangements? Not only is Juber an exceptional player, he is a spectacularly gifted arranger, adept at simultaneously playing melody, bass lines, and clever ornamentation to make his versions of Beatles classics sound both faithful and new. What he does here with \u201cStrawberry Fields,\u201d \u201cThings We Said Today,\u201d and \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d is magical. Vol. 2 (2010) and LJ Can\u2019t Stop Playing the Beatles (2017) are also sensational.\n\nPierre Bensusan\n\nIntuite\n\n(Favored Nations) 2001\n\nThis solo guitar album by the French-Algerian DADGAD specialist covers many different styles and moods\u2014from cool, jazzy numbers to plunges into Middle Eastern, Spanish, and old English music. Bensusan is one of the most fluid players you\u2019ll ever hear, and he has a wide range of ornaments and \u201ceffects\u201d (like making his guitar sound like an oud at one point) at his disposal, but he parses them out judiciously. Check out his fantasia on \u201cScarborough Fair\u201d (dedicated to John Renbourn), and his lovely tribute to Michael Hedges. His 2013 live, career-spanning 3-CD retrospective Encore also received several votes.\n\nAlison Krauss & Union Station\n\nNew Favorite\n\n(Rounder) 2001\n\nSinger/fiddler Alison Krauss is the marquee name, but guitar fans also love this band because of Dan Tyminski and dobro titan Jerry Douglas (along with banjo ace and sometime guitarist Ron Block). A bluegrass vibe shines through this nicely presented recording, though it sounds less traditional than earlier Krauss outings. Still, the playing is magnificent and covers much ground, from the dobro-banjo throwdown \u201cChoctaw Hayride\u201d to the seamless country pop of \u201cThe Lucky One\u201d to the affecting Gillian Welch/David Rawlings title track that ends the album. The 2003 2-CD Live contains nearly all these songs and more.\n\nKelly Joe Phelps\n\nSky Like a Broken Clock\n\n(Rykodisc) 2001\n\nAG readers listed a few different Phelps albums and this one captures his gritty essence as well as any of them. He has that touch of sandpaper in his voice, and a bluesy, rough-hewn intensity in both his fingerpicking (on acoustic, and resonator on \u201cBeggar\u2019s Oil\u201d) and his songwriting, which runs from vivid portraits of various common-folk characters to gut-wrenching personal musings. The tasteful bare-bones instrumentation matches the dark hues of Phelps\u2019 engaging story-songs perfectly.\n\nJorma Kaukonen\n\nBlue Country Heart\n\n(Columbia) 2002\n\nBecause of Hot Tuna, most people think of Jorma as a supreme blues picker, and certainly there is blues running all through this brilliant, Grammy-nominated collection. But it leans more country (as the title implies), with most tunes dating back to the \u201920s and \u201930s, popularized originally by the likes of the Delmore Brothers, Jimmie Rodgers, and others. Jorma gets plenty of chances to shine, but this is truly an ensemble album with an A-list band: Sam Bush (mandolin), Jerry Douglas (dobro), Byron House (bass), and B\u00e9la Fleck (banjo on a few cuts).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCorey Harris\n\nMississippi to Mali\n\n(Rounder), 2003\n\nIn an exciting meeting of two distant but related musical cultures, American bluesman Corey Harris is joined by the late, great Malian guitarist/singer Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 (d. 2006) who, ten years earlier, cut the groundbreaking Talking Timbuktu with Ry Cooder. This one is a seamless exploration of the nexus between African folk and Delta blues consisting of just guitars, varied percussion, and the occasional flute or fiddle (played by Tour\u00e9). There are traditional blues, African tunes, and a couple in French. The recording has a live, intimate, you-are-there quality to it and the music feels wonderfully raw and spontaneous.\n\nBryan Sutton\n\nBluegrass Guitar\n\n(Sugar Hill) 2003\n\nFlatpicking guitar master and accompanist supreme Bryan Sutton has played with just about everybody who\u2019s anybody in country and bluegrass, winning scads of awards along the way. He\u2019s also made a number of albums himself, like this flawless disc of instrumentals played by a red-hot lineup including Tim O\u2019Brien (mandolin), David Talbot (guitar, mandolin), Tim Crouch (fiddle), and Dennis Crouch (bass). The solos are fairly traded around, but Sutton definitely gets plenty of chances to show his stuff. Most of the songs are traditional reels and up-tempo kickers, but there are also a couple of affecting ballads.\n\nPat Metheny\n\nOne Quiet Night\n\n(Warner Bros.) 2003\n\nAnother top vote-getter, this solo acoustic album marked quite a departure for Metheny, one of the great collaborators in modern jazz. This time out it\u2019s just him and a Manzer baritone acoustic, and the material definitely leans more toward folk spaces than jazz. Still, it swings on his cover of Jesse Harris\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d (a hit for Norah Jones); he does a nice job with Keith Jarrett\u2019s \u201cMy Song\u201d; and the album hit #1 on the Billboard Jazz chart. Even so, it won a Grammy for Best New Age album, maybe appropriate for this mostly gentle and atmospheric work.\n\nAdrian Legg\n\nGuitar Bones\n\n(Favored Nations) 2003\n\nThe prolific British fingerstylist is famous for using unusual guitars, and on this solid album he employs everything from a 19th century\u2013style Brook Creedy parlor guitar to a funky, \u201cthoroughly non-descript\u201d resonator he bought cheap to a sparkling custom job built around an Ovation pickup. So there are lots of timbral shadings and styles, including the slide-driven \u201cThe One-Eyed Turk,\u201d the jazzy blues \u201cJam Tomorrow,\u201d the fluttering \u201cSt. Mary\u2019s,\u201d and even an extrapolation off of \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d He claimed this album was \u201cabout simplicity\u201d; apparently he just can\u2019t help being dazzling.\n\nRory Block\n\nLast Fair Deal\n\n(Telarc) 2003\n\nFor more than 40 years, Rory Block has been putting out albums that dig way, way down into the real blues. Today few, if any, can match her when it comes to acoustic slide guitar. This album didn\u2019t attract as much attention as her 2007 all\u2013Robert Johnson disc, The Lady and Mr. Johnson, but her singing and playing has never been more impassioned, more feral than it is here, mostly performing her own heartfelt songs (along with two from Johnson). Her originals are, frankly, more varied than Johnson\u2019s, with clouds of gospel and folk drifting through a few songs.\n\nIron & Wine\n\nOur Endless Numbered Days\n\n(Sub Pop) 2004\n\n\u201cIron & Wine\u201d is actually one very talented person\u2014singer-songwriter-guitarist Sam Beam, whose solo first album, the DIY The Creek Drank the Cradle was something of an indie folk sensation in 2002 (it received several votes, too). This second album features a few other tasteful players but is still dominated by Beam\u2019s breathy vocals and fingerpicked acoustic guitars, slide guitar, banjo, and mandolin. His lyrics are occasionally opaque, but songs like \u201cEach Coming Night\u201d and \u201cLove and Some Verses\u201d are so gorgeous and accessible, it\u2019s easy to understand why Beam has his considerable following.\n\nKaki King\n\nLegs to Make Us Longer\n\n(Red Ink) 2004\n\nKaki King received votes for a few different albums, but since there was no consensus, we\u2019ve chosen this one because it features some of the percussive tapping approach that wowed so many fans early on. Legs also features several pieces with other textures (such as moody electric lap steel, strings, and piano) that point in directions she would follow later, with arrangements that are more complex and more outside musicians. A few also mentioned the \u201csoundtrack\u201d album of her groundbreaking 2015 multimedia show The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body, also a compelling work by an artist who loves taking chances.\n\nTommy Emmanuel\n\nLive One\n\n(Original Works) 2005\n\nFingerstyle god Tommy Emmanuel\u2019s various albums from this century got the most reader votes by far, with Only (2000) the most listed of any single album. So why did we choose this live 2-CD set? Because it best shows his incredible versatility, combining many of his best-known songs (including a handful from Only) and a bunch of highly original, head-spinning covers, including his great \u201cBeatles Medley,\u201d \u201cClassical Gas,\u201d Merle Travis\u2019 \u201cGuitar Rag,\u201d and lovely standards like \u201cMona Lisa\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d There\u2019s mind-boggling virtuosity and exquisitely nuanced balladry. A great album to get to know T.E.!\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela\n\n(ATO) 2006\n\nThis Mexican duo is a worldwide phenomenon, drawing crowds of all ages with their flashy, fiery blend of Spanish-influenced nuevo flamenco, rock, and heavy metal. This album is mostly originals, but includes two notable covers: Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d and Metallica\u2019s \u201cOrion.\u201d Their highly rhythmic and often percussive style is on full display throughout this album, which is relentless in its drive, with no ballads in sight and just a couple of calm moments\u2014ironically in the two rock covers. This album was one of the most-mentioned in our online poll.\n\nAndy McKee\n\nThe Art of Motion\n\n(Candyrat) 2006\n\nModern fingerstylist Andy McKee is a true YouTube sensation, boasting videos with several million views\u2014including one, \u201cDrifting,\u201d that is approaching the 57 million mark! (The one below is different.) That percussive number appears on this superb album along with several others that showcase his rhythmic, Hedges-esque tapping and slapping. But there are also many tracks that show a more delicate, melodic side, such as \u201cWhen She Cries,\u201d \u201cFor My Father,\u201d and the harp-guitar tune \u201cInto the Ocean.\u201d McKee is an unlikely star, but he\u2019s definitely got imagination and chops galore.\n\nBon Iver\n\nFor Emma, Forever Ago\n\n(Jagjaguwar) 2007\n\nThis haunting indie folk-alternative album got a surprising number of votes. Though guitar is prominent, it\u2019s rudimentary, in service of the songs, which are dominated by Justin Vernon\u2019s high, ethereal vocals. Vernon wrote and recorded this true DIY album (playing all the instruments and doing all of the vocals himself) in an isolated Wisconsin cabin, and it built slowly over the course of a year to become a widespread success. A couple of songs eventually made their way into film and TV soundtracks, and the single of \u201cSkinny Love\u201d was a US and UK hit.\n\nMartin Simpson\n\nProdigal Son\n\n(Topic) 2007\n\nA stirring mix of traditional English and American ballads, originals by the veteran Brit (including luscious instrumentals), and with a moving version of Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cLouisiana 1927\u201d (with Jackson Browne on harmony vocals) thrown in for good measure, Prodigal Son won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Best Album award in 2008. It\u2019s a deep and tuneful record, with Simpson showing great skill and elegance on acoustic and resonator guitars (and banjo), ably aided by tasteful accordion, strings, and a few other instruments. Simpson has a classic folk voice\u2014resonant and full of character.\n\nPete Huttlinger\n\nFingerpicking Wonder: The Music of Stevie Wonder\n\n(Instar) 2009\n\nHuttlinger, who died in 2016, won the National Fingerstyle Championship in 2000, enjoyed a successful career performing with many artists onstage and in the studio, and also recorded ten solo albums showcasing his guitar artistry in styles ranging from country to Celtic to Christmas carols to this one-of-kind exploration of the music of Stevie Wonder. You might expect that sweet ballads like \u201cMy Cherie Amour\u201d and \u201cIsn\u2019t She Lovely\u201d would translate easily to solo guitar, but what he does with rhythmically and melodically complex numbers such as \u201cSir Duke,\u201d \u201cLiving for the City,\u201d and \u201cSuperstition\u201d is truly astounding.\n\nGillian Welch\n\nThe Harrow & the Harvest\n\n(Acony) 2011\n\nIt was a toss-up whether to choose this one or Time (The Revelator) from 2001. Every album Welch and her musical partner/foil David Rawlings make is worth hearing. Like the best folk music, this has a timeless quality to it. One song might sound like an Appalachian folk number, another like a stripped-down Patsy Cline ballad (\u201cDark Turn of Mind\u201d). \u201cThe Way It Goes\u201d sounds like mountain music, but its first line is about a drug overdose. Throughout, Rawlings\u2019 guitar lines dance around Welch\u2019s solid rhythm playing and often somber but soulful vocals, and their harmonies will break your heart.\n\nMilk Carton Kids\n\nThe Ash & Clay\n\n(Anti) 2013\n\nKenneth Pattengale and Joey Ryan constitute one of the most interesting male duos to come along in many years. Their close harmonies are somewhat reminiscent of both Simon & Garfunkel and the Everly Brothers, and their vintage Martin and Gibson guitars blend as beautifully as their voices. Their songwriting also clearly owes a debt to Paul Simon and to early country and folk antecedents. Still, they definitely have their own highly appealing sound, and both are guitarists worth checking out.\n\nJason Isbell\n\nSoutheastern\n\n(Southeastern) 2013\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe former member of the rockin\u2019 alt-country Drive-By Truckers is thriving as a solo artist, thanks to confessional albums like this one, where he lays his heart on the line in a collection of evocative, obviously personal country songs. Most are anchored by his dependable acoustic picking and strumming, and this particular album has less of a full-band feel than ones spotlighting his band, the 400 Unit; the arrangements are spare and airy, allowing his plaintive singing to carry the songs. Isbell\u2019s 2015 album Something More Than Free also received votes. At the time of the album\u2019s release, Pitchfork magazine called it \u201chis most gripping and his most personal album to date.\u201d\n\nRichard Thompson\n\nAcoustic Classics\n\n(Beeswing) 2014\n\nIt\u2019s always a risk for musicians to re-record songs that are ingrained in the public mind through other versions. But leave it to Richard Thompson to pull off that feat on this intimate and engrossing solo acoustic disc, which really lets his passionate vocals, imaginative guitar work on his Lowden, and powerful songwriting shine through. The song choices from his truly vast catalog are impeccable, and include \u201cWall of Death,\u201d \u201cShoot Out the Lights,\u201d \u201cDimming of the Day,\u201d \u201c1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\u201d \u201cWhen the Spell is Broken,\u201d \u201cValerie,\u201d and eight more. Acoustic\n\nClassics II was released in 2017.\n\nJulian Lage\n\nWorld\u2019s Fair\n\n(Modern Lore) 2015\n\nLage received the second most votes of any artist in our poll (after Tommy Emmanuel), with this and the 2017 Mount Royal (with Chris Etheridge) the top choices. Here it\u2019s just Lage and a 1939 Martin 000-18 on 12 diverse tunes, ten his own originals. Though Lage can clearly play circles around almost anyone, on this album he\u2019s not out to show off his virtuosity (though plenty is still on display). Instead, there are calm and lyrical gems like \u201cRyland,\u201d \u201cLullaby,\u201d and his take on Rogers & Hart\u2019s \u201cWhere or When,\u201d which show how expressive he can be.\n\nBilly Bragg & Joe Henry\n\nShine A Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad\n\n(Cooking Vinyl), 2017\n\nThis unique duo collaboration\u2014just voices and vintage guitars\u2014was recorded at various railway stations between Chicago and L.A., and features a wonderful collection of classic train songs, such as \u201cRock Island Line,\u201d \u201cK.C. Moan,\u201d \u201cLonesome Whistle,\u201d \u201cIn the Pines,\u201d \u201cThe Midnight Special,\u201d \u201cRailroad Bill,\u201d and modern tunes like \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d and Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cEarly Morning Rain.\u201d Audible ambient noise (people, trains, etc.) crops up here and there on these live, \u201con location\u201d recordings, adding to the intimate, you-are-there quality of the project. All in all, it\u2019s an amazing slice of Americana; perfect in its imperfection.\n\nHonorable Mention: 10 More to Check Out\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Vol. 3 (Capitol) 2002 Patti Griffin 1000 Kisses (ATO) 2002 Damien Rice O (Vector), 2002 Habib Koit\u00e9 & Bamada F\u00f4ly! Live Around the World (World Villa) 2004 Bert Jansch The Black Swan (Drag City) 2006 Ralph Towner Time Line (ECM), 2006 Bir\u00e9li Lagr\u00e8ne Gypsy Project (Dreyfus) 2009 Tony McManus The Maker\u2019s Mark: The Dream Guitar Sessions (Alliance) 2009 Clive Carroll The Furthest Tree (self-released) 2016 Eric Bibb Blues People (Stony Plain) 2014\n\n10 Compilations and Vintage Performance Releases Worth Your Time\n\nDoc Watson\n\nTrouble in Mind: The Doc Watson Country Blues Collection\n\n(Sugar Hill) 2003\n\nThough rightly associated primarily with old-time country, Doc Watson was also a formidable blues singer and guitarist, as this fabulous 17-song compilation proves. Drawing on traditional tunes and songs written or popularized by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt, the Delmore Brothers, Jimmie Rodgers, and the Mississippi Sheiks, Watson appears on this compendium solo (playing guitar, banjo, or harmonica), and also with his son Merle and bassist Eric Weissberg. Two of his best-known songs, \u201cDeep River Blues\u201d and \u201cLittle Sadie\u201d are here in strong versions.\n\nTony Rice\n\n58957: The Bluegrass Guitar Collection\n\n(Rounder) 200\n\nThe title refers to the serial number of the great bluegrass guitarist Clarence White\u2019s 1935 Martin D-28, which Rice has owned since the mid-\u201970s. He does that guitar proud on this extraordinary compilation of 21 old and recent tunes (spanning Bill Monroe to B\u00e9la Fleck) featuring Rice alongside such notables as Norman Blake, Doc Watson, Jerry Douglas, David Grisman, J.D. Crowe, Vassar Clements, Stuart Duncan, and so many others. Among the configurations are the Bluegrass Album Band, the Tony Rice Unit, a Rice brothers quartet, and a hot duo with Blake.\n\nLeo Kottke\n\nInstrumentals: The Best of the Capitol Years\n\n(Blue Note) 2003\n\nLeo Kottke is a fine, evocative singer, but there are always going to be fans who like his original guitar instrumentals (6- and 12-string) best. This generous 18-song compilation is for those fans and for anyone who might not know or remember how great Kottke is (and has always been). He is one of the last links to the early days of the \u201cAmerican primitive\u201d guitar movement, and an utterly distinctive stylist capable of dizzying displays of speed and graceful, lilting ballads. Too bad \u201cWatermelon\u201d predates his Capitol years.\n\nJohn Fahey\n\nThe Best of John Fahey, Vol. 2: 1964\u20131983\n\n(Takoma) 200\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough much of this collection comes from after Fahey\u2019s supposed peak years, and it includes a number of rare and even unreleased tracks (so how is that a \u201cbest of\u201d?), it is still shows the depth and breadth of the pioneering solo guitarist\u2019s imagination. Fahey was always a little off-kilter and far away from the mainstream, and so is this cool compendium assembled by guitarist Henry Kaiser.\n\nNeil Young\n\nLive at Massey Hall 1971\n\n(Reprise) 2007\n\nThe second archival release from his deep vault, this solo show (acoustic guitar and piano) at a Toronto theater finds Young in the midst of his first wave of mass popularity after the success of Crazy Horse, CSNY, and his smash Harvest album. All three of those phases are represented here, but in the solo setting these \u201chit\u201d songs feel even more like the personal works they all started as, and they are interspersed with less-known songs that are every bit as good as his biggies. It\u2019s a warm and inviting album.\n\nPentangle\n\nThe Time Has Come, 1967\u201373\n\n(Castle Us) 2008\n\nOne of the most popular and influential groups of the late 1960s\u2019 British folk wave, Pentangle is the eclectic outfit that first brought widespread attention to singular guitarists John Renbourn and Bert Jansch. This 4-CD set has 32 tracks from the group\u2019s albums (over two discs), an Albert Hall concert from 1968, and a final disc of TV appearances, B-sides, and other oddities. Pentangle never quite broke through in the US, but this box makes a good argument for why they should have.\n\nVarious Artists\n\nImaginational Anthems Vol. 1\u20133\n\n(Tompkins Square) 2008\n\nThree CDs trace the modern history of the acoustic guitar as a solo instrument, from early pioneers like John Fahey, Robbie Basho, Henry Taussig, Sandy Bull, and Peter Lang, to some of today\u2019s best, such as Kaki King, Nathan Salsburg, and Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez. Gyan Riley plays a nice piece with his father, Terry Riley (on piano), and there are colossal 12-string tunes by James Blackshaw, Mark Fosson, and Suni McGrath.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nThe Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965\u201366\n\nDeluxe Edition\n\n(Columbia) 2015\n\nA lot of this is electric Dylan, but spread out across the four discs are also many unreleased acoustic guitar takes of songs that ended up on three seminal Dylan albums\u2014Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61, and Blonde on Blonde\u2014plus several unreleased tunes. With multiple versions of historic songs, this is like an audio documentary about the moment when folk and rock merged and shook the music world. (Another notable Dylan set is the all-acoustic The Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos, 1962\u201364, released in 2010.)\n\nLead Belly\n\nThe Smithsonian Folkways Collection\n\n(Smithsonian/Folkways) 2015\n\nThere have been literally dozens of anthologies of Lead Belly recordings released through the years, but this one is just about definitive: The 5-CD set contains 108 tracks from throughout his career, on five CDs, including more than a dozen that were previously unreleased. Lead Belly was a walking archive of old American folk and blues tunes, so there is much to be learned from digesting this massive set and letting his commanding voice and guitar-playing seep into your soul. The hefty accompanying book is filled with photos and essays.\n\nVarious Artists\n\nAmerican Epic: The Collection\n\n(Legacy) 2017\n\nThis 5-CD box is an incredibly rich, expanded companion \u201csoundtrack\u201d to the outstanding PBS series on American roots music, and contains 100 tracks recorded in the late 1920s and early 1930s, covering blues, old-time country, gospel, Tex-Mex, Hawaiian, and other regional styles from the early days of recording. Many terrific guitarists are represented, including Booker White, Gary Davis, Skip James, Blind Willie Johnson, Maybelle Carter, and Son House. But just as likely you\u2019ll be blown away by guitarists you might not know: Mattie Delaney, Roosevelt Graves, Sol Ho\u2018opi\u2018i, and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the May 2018 issue of Acoustic Guitar magazine."}, {"url": "https://www.acousticsoulofficial.com/about", "page_content": "You Flow Through Me began as a remembrance for my baby girl, Alaya. I wanted to give her something that would endure beyond my lifetime.\n\nI recorded for five years, snatching moments of inspiration and time to develop songs that I had written over the previous decades. What ended up coming out were twelve tracks of funk and soul, genres that had been my refuge in this life.\n\n\n\nI wrote, recorded, and produced all of You Flow Through Me in a room with no doors in the foyer of my little rental bungalow. It was easy to feel isolated, pushing the entire project to completion without resources or collaboration. Despite limitations, I tried to maintain faith that I was completing an album worth finishing. I felt compelled to express my gratitude to the American Black people whose friendship, music, and cultural legacy stood as a reminder to reject the lesson my white upbringing had always encouraged me to embrace, namely, a life without soul.\n\n\n\nIt will be a lifelong endeavor to learn how to meaningfully express the full extent of my appreciation for the national treasure that is Black culture; how does one begin to repay a boundless debt? This album is neither the beginning or end of that journey; it is simply a step in the direction that felt right to take.\n\n\n\nListening back to the album, I hear all the good fortune that I have been blessed to receive in my life: the love of my daughter, the enduring gift of soul music, and the love of those like Della Mae Henrix, Jozo, Ne, Charmagne, the Lumakandas, and so many others in my life.\n\n\n\nMay this album help us all to remember the forces of devotion that flow in our own lives."}, {"url": "https://www.nationaldayarchives.com/day/national-acoustic-soul-day/", "page_content": "When is National Acoustic Soul Day?

This day is an opportunity to recognise her commitment, achievements, and service throughout her career.\n\nThe background of National Acoustic Soul Day\n\nIndia Arie is a Denver, Colorado-based singer-songwriter. Joyce and Ralph Simpson, her parents, encouraged her musical abilities in her youth. When she was an adolescent, her mother, a Motown musician, opened for Stevie Wonder and Al Green. Her mother is currently her beautician. Arie is African-American and descended from the Mende, Kru, and Fula peoples of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau, respectively.\n\nIndia\u2019s parents divorced when she was 13 years old, and her mother relocated the family to Atlanta, Georgia. Her education in Denver assisted her in achieving success with her musical instruments, and her passion for the guitar led to a personal discovery regarding composition and performance. She told the press that writing songs had a direct effect on her, as when she began to delve into her own sensitivity, she began to comprehend people better.\n\nThe most popular album by India is her debut, \u201cAcoustic Soul,\u201d which was released on March 27, 2001. The album received favourable reviews and was commercially successful. In the United States, \u201cAcoustic Soul\u201d debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It only took a few months for the Recording Industry Association of America to certify \u201cAcoustic Soul\u201d as double platinum. It sold 2,180,00 copies in the United States and 3,000,000 copies internationally. In addition, the British Phonographic Industry and Music Canada both awarded the album their gold certifications. In that era, \u201cAcoustic Soul\u201d was a popular genre.\n\nNational Medical Science Liaison Awareness and Appreciation Day 2023: Date, History, Facts, Activities\n\nActivities associated with National Acoustic Soul Day\n\nListen to Arie\u2019s greatest songs\n\nNow is your opportunity to listen to Arie if you have never done so before.

Never have there been so many true virtuoso players, working in so many different styles, expanding the possibilities of the instrument with their seemingly boundless imaginations. And as listeners and fans, we have never had access to this much music, old and new. Virtually the entire history of recording is literally at our fingertips through our phones and computers. Want to compare Joni Mitchell\u2019s early records with her later work? Want to hear 1920s recordings of Blind Blake, or the quirky folk of England\u2019s Incredible String Band from the late \u201960s? Where should you start if you want to understand all this fuss about Tommy Emmanuel? What\u2019s the story with Michael Hedges? Just start streaming; maybe you\u2019ll find that magical album. At the very least, the search will be interesting and enlightening.\n\nIt recently occurred to us that in these fractured and hyper times, when we are deluged with so much information from everywhere, and it is so difficult to keep up with anything before the next shiny object appears to distract us, many AG readers might not be aware of a lot of the fantastic acoustic-guitar-driven albums that have come out in the new millennium. Well, we\u2019re here to help! We asked some of our regular writers to give us lists of their favorite acoustic-guitar-dominated recordings that came out between 2000 and 2017, and then opened the topic to you, our readers, and were greeted by a blizzard of responses\u2014more than 1,500 total choices.\n\nThis was not, strictly speaking, a poll, in which the albums that got the most \u201cvotes\u201d would constitute our Top 25 (or the ten honorable mentions). Otherwise, you\u2019d probably have four by Tommy Emmanuel on here, and three by Julian Lage. Instead, our goal was to show the range of the great acoustic-guitar music that\u2019s been made so far in this century. So we limited the picks to one album per artist (sneaking in a couple of other mentions when we felt like it) and tried to broaden the list to reflect not just the virtuosos\u2014you\u2019ll find plenty here\u2014but also some of the talented guitar-playing singer-songwriters who turned up repeatedly in the survey, as well. Our picks are listed in chronological order by album release. You\u2019ll no doubt be mystified by some choices, possibly angered by others\u2014or by the omissions this sort of list inevitably engenders: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t include ___!\u201d Honest, we\u2019re not trying to make you mad. We simply want to turn you on to some great music you might not have heard\u2014most of which you can access through Spotify and/or Apple Music (and no doubt other streaming services).\n\nAlas, you will not find any classical-guitar picks here (such a list might make its way into our sister publication Classical Guitar), nor is there any Hawaiian music, or much world music in general (save for albums by Corey Harris and Habib Koit\u00e9). Maybe another time. However, you will find an additional listing of ten particularly notable archival/historical albums and boxes that have come out since 2000.\n\nHappy listening! The videos are all performances of songs from the albums mentioned.\n\nVarious Artists\n\n\u2018O Brother, Where Art Thou?\u2019 Soundtrack\n\n(Lost Highway) 2000\n\nA true phenomenon of recent music history, this old-time music soundtrack for the Coen Brothers\u2019 quirky and fun film sold more than 8 million copies and won Album of the Year at the Grammys (as well as other honors). The soundtrack was put together by T Bone Burnett and features a stellar cast of pickers and singers, including Norman Blake, Alison Krauss, Dan Tyminski, Emmylou Harris, the Peasall Sisters, Gillian Welch, Ralph Stanley, and many more. Look for the \u201c10th Anniversary Edition,\u201d which includes a bonus disc with 14 added tracks.\n\nLaurence Juber\n\nLJ Plays the Beatles\n\n(Solid Air) 2000\n\nJuber took up the guitar after hearing the Beatles in 1964, and later spent three years in Paul McCartney\u2019s Wings. So who better to render Beatles songs in wondrous solo acoustic arrangements? Not only is Juber an exceptional player, he is a spectacularly gifted arranger, adept at simultaneously playing melody, bass lines, and clever ornamentation to make his versions of Beatles classics sound both faithful and new. What he does here with \u201cStrawberry Fields,\u201d \u201cThings We Said Today,\u201d and \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d is magical. Vol. 2 (2010) and LJ Can\u2019t Stop Playing the Beatles (2017) are also sensational.\n\nPierre Bensusan\n\nIntuite\n\n(Favored Nations) 2001\n\nThis solo guitar album by the French-Algerian DADGAD specialist covers many different styles and moods\u2014from cool, jazzy numbers to plunges into Middle Eastern, Spanish, and old English music. Bensusan is one of the most fluid players you\u2019ll ever hear, and he has a wide range of ornaments and \u201ceffects\u201d (like making his guitar sound like an oud at one point) at his disposal, but he parses them out judiciously. Check out his fantasia on \u201cScarborough Fair\u201d (dedicated to John Renbourn), and his lovely tribute to Michael Hedges. His 2013 live, career-spanning 3-CD retrospective Encore also received several votes.\n\nAlison Krauss & Union Station\n\nNew Favorite\n\n(Rounder) 2001\n\nSinger/fiddler Alison Krauss is the marquee name, but guitar fans also love this band because of Dan Tyminski and dobro titan Jerry Douglas (along with banjo ace and sometime guitarist Ron Block). A bluegrass vibe shines through this nicely presented recording, though it sounds less traditional than earlier Krauss outings. Still, the playing is magnificent and covers much ground, from the dobro-banjo throwdown \u201cChoctaw Hayride\u201d to the seamless country pop of \u201cThe Lucky One\u201d to the affecting Gillian Welch/David Rawlings title track that ends the album. The 2003 2-CD Live contains nearly all these songs and more.\n\nKelly Joe Phelps\n\nSky Like a Broken Clock\n\n(Rykodisc) 2001\n\nAG readers listed a few different Phelps albums and this one captures his gritty essence as well as any of them. He has that touch of sandpaper in his voice, and a bluesy, rough-hewn intensity in both his fingerpicking (on acoustic, and resonator on \u201cBeggar\u2019s Oil\u201d) and his songwriting, which runs from vivid portraits of various common-folk characters to gut-wrenching personal musings. The tasteful bare-bones instrumentation matches the dark hues of Phelps\u2019 engaging story-songs perfectly.\n\nJorma Kaukonen\n\nBlue Country Heart\n\n(Columbia) 2002\n\nBecause of Hot Tuna, most people think of Jorma as a supreme blues picker, and certainly there is blues running all through this brilliant, Grammy-nominated collection. But it leans more country (as the title implies), with most tunes dating back to the \u201920s and \u201930s, popularized originally by the likes of the Delmore Brothers, Jimmie Rodgers, and others. Jorma gets plenty of chances to shine, but this is truly an ensemble album with an A-list band: Sam Bush (mandolin), Jerry Douglas (dobro), Byron House (bass), and B\u00e9la Fleck (banjo on a few cuts).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCorey Harris\n\nMississippi to Mali\n\n(Rounder), 2003\n\nIn an exciting meeting of two distant but related musical cultures, American bluesman Corey Harris is joined by the late, great Malian guitarist/singer Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 (d. 2006) who, ten years earlier, cut the groundbreaking Talking Timbuktu with Ry Cooder. This one is a seamless exploration of the nexus between African folk and Delta blues consisting of just guitars, varied percussion, and the occasional flute or fiddle (played by Tour\u00e9). There are traditional blues, African tunes, and a couple in French. The recording has a live, intimate, you-are-there quality to it and the music feels wonderfully raw and spontaneous.\n\nBryan Sutton\n\nBluegrass Guitar\n\n(Sugar Hill) 2003\n\nFlatpicking guitar master and accompanist supreme Bryan Sutton has played with just about everybody who\u2019s anybody in country and bluegrass, winning scads of awards along the way. He\u2019s also made a number of albums himself, like this flawless disc of instrumentals played by a red-hot lineup including Tim O\u2019Brien (mandolin), David Talbot (guitar, mandolin), Tim Crouch (fiddle), and Dennis Crouch (bass). The solos are fairly traded around, but Sutton definitely gets plenty of chances to show his stuff. Most of the songs are traditional reels and up-tempo kickers, but there are also a couple of affecting ballads.\n\nPat Metheny\n\nOne Quiet Night\n\n(Warner Bros.) 2003\n\nAnother top vote-getter, this solo acoustic album marked quite a departure for Metheny, one of the great collaborators in modern jazz. This time out it\u2019s just him and a Manzer baritone acoustic, and the material definitely leans more toward folk spaces than jazz. Still, it swings on his cover of Jesse Harris\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d (a hit for Norah Jones); he does a nice job with Keith Jarrett\u2019s \u201cMy Song\u201d; and the album hit #1 on the Billboard Jazz chart. Even so, it won a Grammy for Best New Age album, maybe appropriate for this mostly gentle and atmospheric work.\n\nAdrian Legg\n\nGuitar Bones\n\n(Favored Nations) 2003\n\nThe prolific British fingerstylist is famous for using unusual guitars, and on this solid album he employs everything from a 19th century\u2013style Brook Creedy parlor guitar to a funky, \u201cthoroughly non-descript\u201d resonator he bought cheap to a sparkling custom job built around an Ovation pickup. So there are lots of timbral shadings and styles, including the slide-driven \u201cThe One-Eyed Turk,\u201d the jazzy blues \u201cJam Tomorrow,\u201d the fluttering \u201cSt. Mary\u2019s,\u201d and even an extrapolation off of \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d He claimed this album was \u201cabout simplicity\u201d; apparently he just can\u2019t help being dazzling.\n\nRory Block\n\nLast Fair Deal\n\n(Telarc) 2003\n\nFor more than 40 years, Rory Block has been putting out albums that dig way, way down into the real blues. Today few, if any, can match her when it comes to acoustic slide guitar. This album didn\u2019t attract as much attention as her 2007 all\u2013Robert Johnson disc, The Lady and Mr. Johnson, but her singing and playing has never been more impassioned, more feral than it is here, mostly performing her own heartfelt songs (along with two from Johnson). Her originals are, frankly, more varied than Johnson\u2019s, with clouds of gospel and folk drifting through a few songs.\n\nIron & Wine\n\nOur Endless Numbered Days\n\n(Sub Pop) 2004\n\n\u201cIron & Wine\u201d is actually one very talented person\u2014singer-songwriter-guitarist Sam Beam, whose solo first album, the DIY The Creek Drank the Cradle was something of an indie folk sensation in 2002 (it received several votes, too). This second album features a few other tasteful players but is still dominated by Beam\u2019s breathy vocals and fingerpicked acoustic guitars, slide guitar, banjo, and mandolin. His lyrics are occasionally opaque, but songs like \u201cEach Coming Night\u201d and \u201cLove and Some Verses\u201d are so gorgeous and accessible, it\u2019s easy to understand why Beam has his considerable following.\n\nKaki King\n\nLegs to Make Us Longer\n\n(Red Ink) 2004\n\nKaki King received votes for a few different albums, but since there was no consensus, we\u2019ve chosen this one because it features some of the percussive tapping approach that wowed so many fans early on. Legs also features several pieces with other textures (such as moody electric lap steel, strings, and piano) that point in directions she would follow later, with arrangements that are more complex and more outside musicians. A few also mentioned the \u201csoundtrack\u201d album of her groundbreaking 2015 multimedia show The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body, also a compelling work by an artist who loves taking chances.\n\nTommy Emmanuel\n\nLive One\n\n(Original Works) 2005\n\nFingerstyle god Tommy Emmanuel\u2019s various albums from this century got the most reader votes by far, with Only (2000) the most listed of any single album. So why did we choose this live 2-CD set? Because it best shows his incredible versatility, combining many of his best-known songs (including a handful from Only) and a bunch of highly original, head-spinning covers, including his great \u201cBeatles Medley,\u201d \u201cClassical Gas,\u201d Merle Travis\u2019 \u201cGuitar Rag,\u201d and lovely standards like \u201cMona Lisa\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d There\u2019s mind-boggling virtuosity and exquisitely nuanced balladry. A great album to get to know T.E.!\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela\n\n(ATO) 2006\n\nThis Mexican duo is a worldwide phenomenon, drawing crowds of all ages with their flashy, fiery blend of Spanish-influenced nuevo flamenco, rock, and heavy metal. This album is mostly originals, but includes two notable covers: Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d and Metallica\u2019s \u201cOrion.\u201d Their highly rhythmic and often percussive style is on full display throughout this album, which is relentless in its drive, with no ballads in sight and just a couple of calm moments\u2014ironically in the two rock covers. This album was one of the most-mentioned in our online poll.\n\nAndy McKee\n\nThe Art of Motion\n\n(Candyrat) 2006\n\nModern fingerstylist Andy McKee is a true YouTube sensation, boasting videos with several million views\u2014including one, \u201cDrifting,\u201d that is approaching the 57 million mark! (The one below is different.) That percussive number appears on this superb album along with several others that showcase his rhythmic, Hedges-esque tapping and slapping. But there are also many tracks that show a more delicate, melodic side, such as \u201cWhen She Cries,\u201d \u201cFor My Father,\u201d and the harp-guitar tune \u201cInto the Ocean.\u201d McKee is an unlikely star, but he\u2019s definitely got imagination and chops galore.\n\nBon Iver\n\nFor Emma, Forever Ago\n\n(Jagjaguwar) 2007\n\nThis haunting indie folk-alternative album got a surprising number of votes. Though guitar is prominent, it\u2019s rudimentary, in service of the songs, which are dominated by Justin Vernon\u2019s high, ethereal vocals. Vernon wrote and recorded this true DIY album (playing all the instruments and doing all of the vocals himself) in an isolated Wisconsin cabin, and it built slowly over the course of a year to become a widespread success. A couple of songs eventually made their way into film and TV soundtracks, and the single of \u201cSkinny Love\u201d was a US and UK hit.\n\nMartin Simpson\n\nProdigal Son\n\n(Topic) 2007\n\nA stirring mix of traditional English and American ballads, originals by the veteran Brit (including luscious instrumentals), and with a moving version of Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cLouisiana 1927\u201d (with Jackson Browne on harmony vocals) thrown in for good measure, Prodigal Son won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Best Album award in 2008. It\u2019s a deep and tuneful record, with Simpson showing great skill and elegance on acoustic and resonator guitars (and banjo), ably aided by tasteful accordion, strings, and a few other instruments. Simpson has a classic folk voice\u2014resonant and full of character.\n\nPete Huttlinger\n\nFingerpicking Wonder: The Music of Stevie Wonder\n\n(Instar) 2009\n\nHuttlinger, who died in 2016, won the National Fingerstyle Championship in 2000, enjoyed a successful career performing with many artists onstage and in the studio, and also recorded ten solo albums showcasing his guitar artistry in styles ranging from country to Celtic to Christmas carols to this one-of-kind exploration of the music of Stevie Wonder. You might expect that sweet ballads like \u201cMy Cherie Amour\u201d and \u201cIsn\u2019t She Lovely\u201d would translate easily to solo guitar, but what he does with rhythmically and melodically complex numbers such as \u201cSir Duke,\u201d \u201cLiving for the City,\u201d and \u201cSuperstition\u201d is truly astounding.\n\nGillian Welch\n\nThe Harrow & the Harvest\n\n(Acony) 2011\n\nIt was a toss-up whether to choose this one or Time (The Revelator) from 2001. Every album Welch and her musical partner/foil David Rawlings make is worth hearing. Like the best folk music, this has a timeless quality to it. One song might sound like an Appalachian folk number, another like a stripped-down Patsy Cline ballad (\u201cDark Turn of Mind\u201d). \u201cThe Way It Goes\u201d sounds like mountain music, but its first line is about a drug overdose. Throughout, Rawlings\u2019 guitar lines dance around Welch\u2019s solid rhythm playing and often somber but soulful vocals, and their harmonies will break your heart.\n\nMilk Carton Kids\n\nThe Ash & Clay\n\n(Anti) 2013\n\nKenneth Pattengale and Joey Ryan constitute one of the most interesting male duos to come along in many years. Their close harmonies are somewhat reminiscent of both Simon & Garfunkel and the Everly Brothers, and their vintage Martin and Gibson guitars blend as beautifully as their voices. Their songwriting also clearly owes a debt to Paul Simon and to early country and folk antecedents. Still, they definitely have their own highly appealing sound, and both are guitarists worth checking out.\n\nJason Isbell\n\nSoutheastern\n\n(Southeastern) 2013\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe former member of the rockin\u2019 alt-country Drive-By Truckers is thriving as a solo artist, thanks to confessional albums like this one, where he lays his heart on the line in a collection of evocative, obviously personal country songs. Most are anchored by his dependable acoustic picking and strumming, and this particular album has less of a full-band feel than ones spotlighting his band, the 400 Unit; the arrangements are spare and airy, allowing his plaintive singing to carry the songs. Isbell\u2019s 2015 album Something More Than Free also received votes. At the time of the album\u2019s release, Pitchfork magazine called it \u201chis most gripping and his most personal album to date.\u201d\n\nRichard Thompson\n\nAcoustic Classics\n\n(Beeswing) 2014\n\nIt\u2019s always a risk for musicians to re-record songs that are ingrained in the public mind through other versions. But leave it to Richard Thompson to pull off that feat on this intimate and engrossing solo acoustic disc, which really lets his passionate vocals, imaginative guitar work on his Lowden, and powerful songwriting shine through. The song choices from his truly vast catalog are impeccable, and include \u201cWall of Death,\u201d \u201cShoot Out the Lights,\u201d \u201cDimming of the Day,\u201d \u201c1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\u201d \u201cWhen the Spell is Broken,\u201d \u201cValerie,\u201d and eight more. Acoustic\n\nClassics II was released in 2017.\n\nJulian Lage\n\nWorld\u2019s Fair\n\n(Modern Lore) 2015\n\nLage received the second most votes of any artist in our poll (after Tommy Emmanuel), with this and the 2017 Mount Royal (with Chris Etheridge) the top choices. Here it\u2019s just Lage and a 1939 Martin 000-18 on 12 diverse tunes, ten his own originals. Though Lage can clearly play circles around almost anyone, on this album he\u2019s not out to show off his virtuosity (though plenty is still on display). Instead, there are calm and lyrical gems like \u201cRyland,\u201d \u201cLullaby,\u201d and his take on Rogers & Hart\u2019s \u201cWhere or When,\u201d which show how expressive he can be.\n\nBilly Bragg & Joe Henry\n\nShine A Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad\n\n(Cooking Vinyl), 2017\n\nThis unique duo collaboration\u2014just voices and vintage guitars\u2014was recorded at various railway stations between Chicago and L.A., and features a wonderful collection of classic train songs, such as \u201cRock Island Line,\u201d \u201cK.C. Moan,\u201d \u201cLonesome Whistle,\u201d \u201cIn the Pines,\u201d \u201cThe Midnight Special,\u201d \u201cRailroad Bill,\u201d and modern tunes like \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d and Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cEarly Morning Rain.\u201d Audible ambient noise (people, trains, etc.) crops up here and there on these live, \u201con location\u201d recordings, adding to the intimate, you-are-there quality of the project. All in all, it\u2019s an amazing slice of Americana; perfect in its imperfection.\n\nHonorable Mention: 10 More to Check Out\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Vol. 3 (Capitol) 2002 Patti Griffin 1000 Kisses (ATO) 2002 Damien Rice O (Vector), 2002 Habib Koit\u00e9 & Bamada F\u00f4ly!

Drawing on traditional tunes and songs written or popularized by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt, the Delmore Brothers, Jimmie Rodgers, and the Mississippi Sheiks, Watson appears on this compendium solo (playing guitar, banjo, or harmonica), and also with his son Merle and bassist Eric Weissberg. Two of his best-known songs, \u201cDeep River Blues\u201d and \u201cLittle Sadie\u201d are here in strong versions.\n\nTony Rice\n\n58957: The Bluegrass Guitar Collection\n\n(Rounder) 200\n\nThe title refers to the serial number of the great bluegrass guitarist Clarence White\u2019s 1935 Martin D-28, which Rice has owned since the mid-\u201970s. He does that guitar proud on this extraordinary compilation of 21 old and recent tunes (spanning Bill Monroe to B\u00e9la Fleck) featuring Rice alongside such notables as Norman Blake, Doc Watson, Jerry Douglas, David Grisman, J.D. Crowe, Vassar Clements, Stuart Duncan, and so many others. Among the configurations are the Bluegrass Album Band, the Tony Rice Unit, a Rice brothers quartet, and a hot duo with Blake.\n\nLeo Kottke\n\nInstrumentals: The Best of the Capitol Years\n\n(Blue Note) 2003\n\nLeo Kottke is a fine, evocative singer, but there are always going to be fans who like his original guitar instrumentals (6- and 12-string) best. This generous 18-song compilation is for those fans and for anyone who might not know or remember how great Kottke is (and has always been). He is one of the last links to the early days of the \u201cAmerican primitive\u201d guitar movement, and an utterly distinctive stylist capable of dizzying displays of speed and graceful, lilting ballads. Too bad \u201cWatermelon\u201d predates his Capitol years.\n\nJohn Fahey\n\nThe Best of John Fahey, Vol. 2: 1964\u20131983\n\n(Takoma) 200\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough much of this collection comes from after Fahey\u2019s supposed peak years, and it includes a number of rare and even unreleased tracks (so how is that a \u201cbest of\u201d?), it is still shows the depth and breadth of the pioneering solo guitarist\u2019s imagination. Fahey was always a little off-kilter and far away from the mainstream, and so is this cool compendium assembled by guitarist Henry Kaiser.\n\nNeil Young\n\nLive at Massey Hall 1971\n\n(Reprise) 2007\n\nThe second archival release from his deep vault, this solo show (acoustic guitar and piano) at a Toronto theater finds Young in the midst of his first wave of mass popularity after the success of Crazy Horse, CSNY, and his smash Harvest album. All three of those phases are represented here, but in the solo setting these \u201chit\u201d songs feel even more like the personal works they all started as, and they are interspersed with less-known songs that are every bit as good as his biggies. It\u2019s a warm and inviting album.\n\nPentangle\n\nThe Time Has Come, 1967\u201373\n\n(Castle Us) 2008\n\nOne of the most popular and influential groups of the late 1960s\u2019 British folk wave, Pentangle is the eclectic outfit that first brought widespread attention to singular guitarists John Renbourn and Bert Jansch. This 4-CD set has 32 tracks from the group\u2019s albums (over two discs), an Albert Hall concert from 1968, and a final disc of TV appearances, B-sides, and other oddities. Pentangle never quite broke through in the US, but this box makes a good argument for why they should have.\n\nVarious Artists\n\nImaginational Anthems Vol. 1\u20133\n\n(Tompkins Square) 2008\n\nThree CDs trace the modern history of the acoustic guitar as a solo instrument, from early pioneers like John Fahey, Robbie Basho, Henry Taussig, Sandy Bull, and Peter Lang, to some of today\u2019s best, such as Kaki King, Nathan Salsburg, and Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez. Gyan Riley plays a nice piece with his father, Terry Riley (on piano), and there are colossal 12-string tunes by James Blackshaw, Mark Fosson, and Suni McGrath.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nThe Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965\u201366\n\nDeluxe Edition\n\n(Columbia) 2015\n\nA lot of this is electric Dylan, but spread out across the four discs are also many unreleased acoustic guitar takes of songs that ended up on three seminal Dylan albums\u2014Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61, and Blonde on Blonde\u2014plus several unreleased tunes. With multiple versions of historic songs, this is like an audio documentary about the moment when folk and rock merged and shook the music world. (Another notable Dylan set is the all-acoustic The Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos, 1962\u201364, released in 2010.)\n\nLead Belly\n\nThe Smithsonian Folkways Collection\n\n(Smithsonian/Folkways) 2015\n\nThere have been literally dozens of anthologies of Lead Belly recordings released through the years, but this one is just about definitive: The 5-CD set contains 108 tracks from throughout his career, on five CDs, including more than a dozen that were previously unreleased. Lead Belly was a walking archive of old American folk and blues tunes, so there is much to be learned from digesting this massive set and letting his commanding voice and guitar-playing seep into your soul. The hefty accompanying book is filled with photos and essays.\n\nVarious Artists\n\nAmerican Epic: The Collection\n\n(Legacy) 2017\n\nThis 5-CD box is an incredibly rich, expanded companion \u201csoundtrack\u201d to the outstanding PBS series on American roots music, and contains 100 tracks recorded in the late 1920s and early 1930s, covering blues, old-time country, gospel, Tex-Mex, Hawaiian, and other regional styles from the early days of recording. Many terrific guitarists are represented, including Booker White, Gary Davis, Skip James, Blind Willie Johnson, Maybelle Carter, and Son House. But just as likely you\u2019ll be blown away by guitarists you might not know: Mattie Delaney, Roosevelt Graves, Sol Ho\u2018opi\u2018i, and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the May 2018 issue of Acoustic Guitar magazine."}, {"url": "https://www.acousticsoulofficial.com/about", "page_content": "You Flow Through Me began as a remembrance for my baby girl, Alaya. I wanted to give her something that would endure beyond my lifetime.\n\nI recorded for five years, snatching moments of inspiration and time to develop songs that I had written over the previous decades. What ended up coming out were twelve tracks of funk and soul, genres that had been my refuge in this life.\n\n\n\nI wrote, recorded, and produced all of You Flow Through Me in a room with no doors in the foyer of my little rental bungalow. It was easy to feel isolated, pushing the entire project to completion without resources or collaboration. Despite limitations, I tried to maintain faith that I was completing an album worth finishing. I felt compelled to express my gratitude to the American Black people whose friendship, music, and cultural legacy stood as a reminder to reject the lesson my white upbringing had always encouraged me to embrace, namely, a life without soul.\n\n\n\nIt will be a lifelong endeavor to learn how to meaningfully express the full extent of my appreciation for the national treasure that is Black culture; how does one begin to repay a boundless debt? This album is neither the beginning or end of that journey; it is simply a step in the direction that felt right to take.\n\n\n\nListening back to the album, I hear all the good fortune that I have been blessed to receive in my life: the love of my daughter, the enduring gift of soul music, and the love of those like Della Mae Henrix, Jozo, Ne, Charmagne, the Lumakandas, and so many others in my life.\n\n\n\nMay this album help us all to remember the forces of devotion that flow in our own lives."}, {"url": "https://nationaltoday.com/national-acoustic-soul-day/", "page_content": "History of National Acoustic Soul Day\n\nIndia Arie is a singer-songwriter from Denver, Colorado.

She was age 11 when she sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, and the following year she picked up the guitar and began to write songs. Taking her inspiration from country music artists such as Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks, Swift crafted original material that reflected her experiences of tween alienation. When she was 13, Swift\u2019s parents sold their farm in Pennsylvania to move to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so that she could devote more of her time to courting country labels in nearby Nashville. Britannica Quiz 2000s Music Quiz A development deal with RCA Records allowed Swift to make the acquaintance of recording-industry veterans, and in 2004, at age 14, she signed with Sony/ATV as a songwriter. At venues in the Nashville area, she performed many of the songs she had written, and it was at one such performance that she was noticed by record executive Scott Borchetta. Borchetta signed Swift to his fledgling Big Machine label, and her first single, \u201cTim McGraw\u201d (inspired by and prominently referencing a song by Swift\u2019s favourite country artist), was released in the summer of 2006.\n\nDebut album and Fearless Taylor Swift The song was an immediate success, spending eight months on the Billboard country singles chart. Now age 16, Swift followed with a self-titled debut album, and she went on tour, opening for Rascal Flatts. Taylor Swift was certified platinum in 2007, having sold more than one million copies in the United States, and Swift continued a rigorous touring schedule, opening for artists such as George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, and Faith Hill. That November Swift received the Horizon Award for best new artist from the Country Music Association (CMA), capping the year in which she emerged as country music\u2019s most-visible young star. On Swift\u2019s second album, Fearless (2008), she demonstrated a refined pop sensibility, managing to court the mainstream pop audience without losing sight of her country roots. With sales of more than half a million copies in its first week, Fearless opened at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. It ultimately spent more time atop that chart than any other album released that decade. Singles such as \u201cYou Belong with Me\u201d and \u201cLove Story\u201d were popular in the digital market as well, the latter accounting for more than four million paid downloads.\n\nKanye West incident at the VMAs, Red, and 1989 Taylor Swift In 2009 Swift embarked on her first tour as a headliner, playing to sold-out venues across North America. That year also saw Swift dominate the industry award circuit. Fearless was recognized as album of the year by the Academy of Country Music in April, and she topped the best female video category for \u201cYou Belong with Me\u201d at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in September. During her VMA acceptance speech, Swift was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, who protested that the award should have gone to Beyonc\u00e9 for what he called \u201cone of the best videos of all time.\u201d Later in the program, when Beyonc\u00e9 was accepting the award for video of the year, she invited Swift onstage to conclude her speech, a move that drew a standing ovation for both performers. At the CMA Awards that November, Swift won all four categories in which she was nominated. Her recognition as CMA entertainer of the year made her the youngest-ever winner of that award, as well as the first female solo artist to win since 1999. She began 2010 with an impressive showing at the Grammy Awards, where she collected four honours, including best country song, best country album, and the top prize of album of the year.

Although Swift avoided discussing her personal life in interviews, she was surprisingly frank in her music. Her third album, Speak Now (2010), was littered with allusions to romantic relationships with John Mayer, Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, and Twilight series actor Taylor Lautner. Swift reclaimed the CMA entertainer of the year award in 2011, and the following year she won Grammys for best country solo performance and best country song for \u201cMean,\u201d a single from Speak Now. Taylor Swift Taylor Swift Swift continued her acting career with a voice role in the animated Dr. Seuss\u2019 The Lorax (2012) before releasing her next collection of songs, Red (2012). While she remained focused on the vagaries of young love, her songwriting reflected a deepened perspective on the subject, and much of the album embraced a bold pop-rock sound. In its first week on sale in the United States, Red sold 1.2 million copies\u2014the highest one-week total in 10 years. In addition, its lead single, the gleeful \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d gave Swift her first number-one hit on the Billboard pop singles chart. In 2014 Swift released 1989, an album titled after the year of her birth and reportedly inspired by the music of that era. Although Swift had already been steadily moving away from the traditional country signifiers that marked her early work\u2014\u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d the second single from Red, even flirted with electronic dance music\u2014she called 1989 her first \u201cofficial pop album.\u201d On the strength of the upbeat \u201cShake It Off,\u201d the album proved to be another blockbuster for Swift, with its first-week sales surpassing those of Red. It went on to sell more than five million copies in the United States and earned Swift her second Grammy for album of the year.

They were tired and weak, and their faces had the drawn expression of patience which comes of hardship long endured. They were heavily burdened with blanket packs which were strapped to their shoulders. Head- straps, passing across the forehead, helped support these packs. Each man carried a rifle. They walked in a stooped posture, the shoulders well forward, the head still farther forward, the eyes bent upon the ground.\n\n\u201cI wish we had just about two of them cartridges that\u2019s layin' in that cache of ourn,\u201d said the second man.\n\nHis voice was utterly and drearily expressionless. He spoke without enthusiasm; and the first man, limping into the milky stream that foamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply.\n\nThe other man followed at his heels. They did not remove their foot-gear, though the water was icy cold - so cold that their ankles ached and their feet went numb. In places the water dashed against their knees, and both men staggered for footing.\n\nThe man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell, but recovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time uttering a sharp exclamation of pain. He seemed faint and dizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled, as though seeking support against the air. When he had steadied himself he stepped forward, but reeled again and nearly fell. Then he stood still and looked at the other man, who had never turned his head.\n\nThe man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating with himself. Then he called out:\n\n\u201cI say, Bill, I\u2019ve sprained my ankle.\u201d\n\nBill staggered on through the milky water. He did not look around. The man watched him go, and though his face was expressionless as ever, his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer.\n\nThe other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on without looking back. The man in the stream watched him. His lips trembled a little, so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly agitated. His tongue even strayed out to moisten them.\n\n\u201cBill!\u201d he cried out.\n\nIt was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress, but Bill\u2019s head did not turn. The man watched him go, limping grotesquely and lurching forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft sky-line of the low-lying hill. He watched him go till he passed over the crest and disappeared. Then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now that Bill was gone.\n\nNear the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly, almost obscured by formless mists and vapors, which gave an impression of mass and density without outline or tangibility. The man pulled out his watch, the while resting his weight on one leg. It was four o\u2019clock, and as the season was near the last of July or first of August, - he did not know the precise date within a week or two, - he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest. He looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the Great Bear Lake; also, he knew that in that direction the Arctic Circle cut its forbidding way across the Canadian Barrens. This stream in which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine River, which in turn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and the Arctic Ocean. He had never been there, but he had seen it, once, on a Hudson Bay Company chart.\n\nAgain his gaze completed the circle of the world about him. It was not a heartening spectacle. Everywhere was soft sky-line. The hills were all low-lying. There were no trees, no shrubs, no grasses - naught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning into his eyes.\n\n\u201cBill!\u201d he whispered, once and twice; \u201cBill!\u201d\n\nHe cowered in the midst of the milky water, as though the vastness were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force, brutally crushing him with its complacent awfulness. He began to shake as with an ague-fit, till the gun fell from his hand with a splash. This served to rouse him. He fought with his fear and pulled himself together, groping in the water and recovering the weapon. He hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder, so as to take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle. Then he proceeded, slowly and carefully, wincing with pain, to the bank.\n\nHe did not stop. With a desperation that was madness, unmindful of the pain, he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over which his comrade had disappeared - more grotesque and comical by far than that limping, jerking comrade. But at the crest he saw a shallow valley, empty of life. He fought with his fear again, overcame it, hitched the pack still farther over on his left shoulder, and lurched on down the slope.\n\nThe bottom of the valley was soggy with water, which the thick moss held, spongelike, close to the surface. This water squirted out from under his feet at every step, and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip. He picked his way from muskeg to muskeg, and followed the other man\u2019s footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss.\n\nThough alone, he was not lost. Farther on he knew he would come to where dead spruce and fir, very small and weazened, bordered the shore of a little lake, the TITCHIN-NICHILIE, in the tongue of the country, the \u201cland of little sticks.\u201d And into that lake flowed a small stream, the water of which was not milky. There was rush- grass on that stream - this he remembered well - but no timber, and he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a divide. He would cross this divide to the first trickle of another stream, flowing to the west, which he would follow until it emptied into the river Dease, and here he would find a cache under an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks. And in this cache would be ammunition for his empty gun, fish-hooks and lines, a small net - all the utilities for the killing and snaring of food. Also, he would find flour, - not much, - a piece of bacon, and some beans.\n\nBill would be waiting for him there, and they would paddle away south down the Dease to the Great Bear Lake. And south across the lake they would go, ever south, till they gained the Mackenzie. And south, still south, they would go, while the winter raced vainly after them, and the ice formed in the eddies, and the days grew chill and crisp, south to some warm Hudson Bay Company post, where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end.\n\nThese were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward. But hard as he strove with his body, he strove equally hard with his mind, trying to think that Bill had not deserted him, that Bill would surely wait for him at the cache. He was compelled to think this thought, or else there would not be any use to strive, and he would have lain down and died. And as the dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered every inch - and many times - of his and Bill\u2019s flight south before the downcoming winter. And he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the Hudson Bay Company post over and over again. He had not eaten for two days; for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat. Often he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries, put them into his mouth, and chewed and swallowed them. A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water. In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter. The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge, and from sheer weariness and weakness staggered and fell. He lay for some time, without movement, on his side. Then he slipped out of the pack- straps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture. It was not yet dark, and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of dry moss. When he had gathered a heap he built a fire, - a smouldering, smudgy fire, - and put a tin pot of water on to boil.\n\nHe unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his matches. There were sixty-seven. He counted them three times to make sure. He divided them into several portions, wrapping them in oil paper, disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch, of another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat, of a third bunch under his shirt on the chest. This accomplished, a panic came upon him, and he unwrapped them all and counted them again. There were still sixty-seven.\n\nHe dried his wet foot-gear by the fire. The moccasins were in soggy shreds. The blanket socks were worn through in places, and his feet were raw and bleeding. His ankle was throbbing, and he gave it an examination. It had swollen to the size of his knee. He tore a long strip from one of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly. He tore other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both moccasins and socks. Then he drank the pot of water, steaming hot, wound his watch, and crawled between his blankets.\n\nHe slept like a dead man. The brief darkness around midnight came and went. The sun arose in the northeast - at least the day dawned in that quarter, for the sun was hidden by gray clouds.\n\nAt six o\u2019clock he awoke, quietly lying on his back. He gazed straight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry. As he rolled over on his elbow he was startled by a loud snort, and saw a bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity. The animal was not mere than fifty feet away, and instantly into the man\u2019s mind leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and frying over a fire. Mechanically he reached for the empty gun, drew a bead, and pulled the trigger. The bull snorted and leaped away, his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the ledges.\n\nThe man cursed and flung the empty gun from him. He groaned aloud as he started to drag himself to his feet. It was a slow and arduous task.\n\nHis joints were like rusty hinges. They worked harshly in their sockets, with much friction, and each bending or unbending was accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will. When he finally gained his feet, another minute or so was consumed in straightening up, so that he could stand erect as a man should stand.\n\nHe crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect. There were no trees, no bushes, nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely diversified by gray rocks, gray lakelets, and gray streamlets. The sky was gray. There was no sun nor hint of sun. He had no idea of north, and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the night before. But he was not lost. He knew that. Soon he would come to the land of the little sticks. He felt that it lay off to the left somewhere, not far - possibly just over the next low hill.\n\nHe went back to put his pack into shape for travelling. He assured himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches, though he did not stop to count them. But he did linger, debating, over a squat moose-hide sack. It was not large. He could hide it under his two hands. He knew that it weighed fifteen pounds, - as much as all the rest of the pack, - and it worried him. He finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack. He paused to gaze at the squat moose-hide sack. He picked it up hastily with a defiant glance about him, as though the desolation were trying to rob him of it; and when he rose to his feet to stagger on into the day, it was included in the pack on his back.\n\nHe bore away to the left, stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries. His ankle had stiffened, his limp was more pronounced, but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his stomach. The hunger pangs were sharp. They gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind steady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little sticks. The muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing, while they made his tongue and the roof of his mouth sore with their irritating bite.\n\nHe came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings from the ledges and muskegs. Ker - ker - ker was the cry they made. He threw stones at them, but could not hit them. He placed his pack on the ground and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow. The sharp rocks cut through his pants' legs till his knees left a trail of blood; but the hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger. He squirmed over the wet moss, saturating his clothes and chilling his body; but he was not aware of it, so great was his fever for food. And always the ptarmigan rose, whirring, before him, till their ker - ker - ker became a mock to him, and he cursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry.\n\nOnce he crawled upon one that must have been asleep. He did not see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook. He made a clutch as startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan, and there remained in his hand three tail-feathers. As he watched its flight he hated it, as though it had done him some terrible wrong. Then he returned and shouldered his pack.\n\nAs the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was more plentiful. A band of caribou passed by, twenty and odd animals, tantalizingly within rifle range. He felt a wild desire to run after them, a certitude that he could run them down. A black fox came toward him, carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth. The man shouted. It was a fearful cry, but the fox, leaping away in fright, did not drop the ptarmigan.\n\nLate in the afternoon he followed a stream, milky with lime, which ran through sparse patches of rush-grass. Grasping these rushes firmly near the root, he pulled up what resembled a young onion- sprout no larger than a shingle-nail. It was tender, and his teeth sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food. But its fibers were tough. It was composed of stringy filaments saturated with water, like the berries, and devoid of nourishment. He threw off his pack and went into the rush-grass on hands and knees, crunching and munching, like some bovine creature.\n\nHe was very weary and often wished to rest - to lie down and sleep; but he was continually driven on - not so much by his desire to gain the land of little sticks as by his hunger. He searched little ponds for frogs and dug up the earth with his nails for worms, though he knew in spite that neither frogs nor worms existed so far north.\n\nHe looked into every pool of water vainly, until, as the long twilight came on, he discovered a solitary fish, the size of a minnow, in such a pool. He plunged his arm in up to the shoulder, but it eluded him. He reached for it with both hands and stirred up the milky mud at the bottom. In his excitement he fell in, wetting himself to the waist. Then the water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish, and he was compelled to wait until the sediment had settled.\n\nThe pursuit was renewed, till the water was again muddied. But he could not wait. He unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool. He baled wildly at first, splashing himself and flinging the water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool. He worked more carefully, striving to be cool, though his heart was pounding against his chest and his hands were trembling. At the end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry. Not a cupful of water remained. And there was no fish. He found a hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger pool - a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day. Had he known of the crevice, he could have closed it with a rock at the beginning and the fish would have been his.\n\nThus he thought, and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth. At first he cried softly to himself, then he cried loudly to the pitiless desolation that ringed him around; and for a long time after he was shaken by great dry sobs.\n\nHe built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot water, and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night before. The last thing he did was to see that his matches were dry and to wind his watch. The blankets were wet and clammy. His ankle pulsed with pain. But he knew only that he was hungry, and through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and banquets and of food served and spread in all imaginable ways.\n\nHe awoke chilled and sick. There was no sun. The gray of earth and sky had become deeper, more profound. A raw wind was blowing, and the first flurries of snow were whitening the hilltops. The air about him thickened and grew white while he made a fire and boiled more water. It was wet snow, half rain, and the flakes were large and soggy. At first they melted as soon as they came in contact with the earth, but ever more fell, covering the ground, putting out the fire, spoiling his supply of moss-fuel.\n\nThis was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble onward, he knew not where. He was not concerned with the land of little sticks, nor with Bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the river Dease. He was mastered by the verb \u201cto eat.\u201d He was hunger- mad. He took no heed of the course he pursued, so long as that course led him through the swale bottoms. He felt his way through the wet snow to the watery muskeg berries, and went by feel as he pulled up the rush-grass by the roots. But it was tasteless stuff and did not satisfy. He found a weed that tasted sour and he ate all he could find of it, which was not much, for it was a creeping growth, easily hidden under the several inches of snow.\n\nHe had no fire that night, nor hot water, and crawled under his blanket to sleep the broken hunger-sleep. The snow turned into a cold rain. He awakened many times to feel it falling on his upturned face. Day came - a gray day and no sun. It had ceased raining. The keenness of his hunger had departed. Sensibility, as far as concerned the yearning for food, had been exhausted. There was a dull, heavy ache in his stomach, but it did not bother him so much. He was more rational, and once more he was chiefly interested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the river Dease.\n\nHe ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and bound his bleeding feet. Also, he recinched the injured ankle and prepared himself for a day of travel. When he came to his pack, he paused long over the squat moose-hide sack, but in the end it went with him.\n\nThe snow had melted under the rain, and only the hilltops showed white. The sun came out, and he succeeded in locating the points of the compass, though he knew now that he was lost. Perhaps, in his previous days' wanderings, he had edged away too far to the left. He now bore off to the right to counteract the possible deviation from his true course.\n\nThough the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite, he realized that he was weak. He was compelled to pause for frequent rests, when he attacked the muskeg berries and rush-grass patches. His tongue felt dry and large, as though covered with a fine hairy growth, and it tasted bitter in his mouth. His heart gave him a great deal of trouble. When he had travelled a few minutes it would begin a remorseless thump, thump, thump, and then leap up and away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go faint and dizzy.\n\nIn the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool. It was impossible to bale it, but he was calmer now and managed to catch them in his tin bucket. They were no longer than his little finger, but he was not particularly hungry. The dull ache in his stomach had been growing duller and fainter. It seemed almost that his stomach was dozing. He ate the fish raw, masticating with painstaking care, for the eating was an act of pure reason. While he had no desire to eat, he knew that he must eat to live.\n\nIn the evening he caught three more minnows, eating two and saving the third for breakfast. The sun had dried stray shreds of moss, and he was able to warm himself with hot water. He had not covered more than ten miles that day; and the next day, travelling whenever his heart permitted him, he covered no more than five miles. But his stomach did not give him the slightest uneasiness. It had gone to sleep. He was in a strange country, too, and the caribou were growing more plentiful, also the wolves. Often their yelps drifted across the desolation, and once he saw three of them slinking away before his path.\n\nAnother night; and in the morning, being more rational, he untied the leather string that fastened the squat moose-hide sack. From its open mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse gold-dust and nuggets. He roughly divided the gold in halves, caching one half on a prominent ledge, wrapped in a piece of blanket, and returning the other half to the sack. He also began to use strips of the one remaining blanket for his feet. He still clung to his gun, for there were cartridges in that cache by the river Dease.\n\nThis was a day of fog, and this day hunger awoke in him again. He was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times blinded him. It was no uncommon thing now for him to stumble and fall; and stumbling once, he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest. There were four newly hatched chicks, a day old - little specks of pulsating life no more than a mouthful; and he ate them ravenously, thrusting them alive into his mouth and crunching them like egg- shells between his teeth. The mother ptarmigan beat about him with great outcry. He used his gun as a club with which to knock her over, but she dodged out of reach. He threw stones at her and with one chance shot broke a wing. Then she fluttered away, running, trailing the broken wing, with him in pursuit.\n\nThe little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite. He hopped and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle, throwing stones and screaming hoarsely at times; at other times hopping and bobbing silently along, picking himself up grimly and patiently when he fell, or rubbing his eyes with his hand when the giddiness threatened to overpower him.\n\nThe chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley, and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss. They were not his own - he could see that. They must be Bill\u2019s. But he could not stop, for the mother ptarmigan was running on. He would catch her first, then he would return and investigate.\n\nHe exhausted the mother ptarmigan; but he exhausted himself. She lay panting on her side. He lay panting on his side, a dozen feet away, unable to crawl to her. And as he recovered she recovered, fluttering out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her. The chase was resumed. Night settled down and she escaped. He stumbled from weakness and pitched head foremost on his face, cutting his cheek, his pack upon his back. He did not move for a long while; then he rolled over on his side, wound his watch, and lay there until morning.\n\nAnother day of fog. Half of his last blanket had gone into foot- wrappings. He failed to pick up Bill\u2019s trail. It did not matter. His hunger was driving him too compellingly - only - only he wondered if Bill, too, were lost. By midday the irk of his pack became too oppressive. Again he divided the gold, this time merely spilling half of it on the ground. In the afternoon he threw the rest of it away, there remaining to him only the half-blanket, the tin bucket, and the rifle.\n\nAn hallucination began to trouble him. He felt confident that one cartridge remained to him. It was in the chamber of the rifle and he had overlooked it. On the other hand, he knew all the time that the chamber was empty. But the hallucination persisted. He fought it off for hours, then threw his rifle open and was confronted with emptiness. The disappointment was as bitter as though he had really expected to find the cartridge.\n\nHe plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again. Again he fought it, and still it persisted, till for very relief he opened his rifle to unconvince himself. At times his mind wandered farther afield, and he plodded on, a mere automaton, strange conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his brain like worms. But these excursions out of the real were of brief duration, for ever the pangs of the hunger-bite called him back. He was jerked back abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight that caused him nearly to faint. He reeled and swayed, doddering like a drunken man to keep from falling. Before him stood a horse. A horse! He could not believe his eyes. A thick mist was in them, intershot with sparkling points of light. He rubbed his eyes savagely to clear his vision, and beheld, not a horse, but a great brown bear. The animal was studying him with bellicose curiosity.\n\nThe man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he realized. He lowered it and drew his hunting-knife from its beaded sheath at his hip. Before him was meat and life. He ran his thumb along the edge of his knife. It was sharp. The point was sharp. He would fling himself upon the bear and kill it. But his heart began its warning thump, thump, thump. Then followed the wild upward leap and tattoo of flutters, the pressing as of an iron band about his forehead, the creeping of the dizziness into his brain.\n\nHis desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear. In his weakness, what if the animal attacked him? He drew himself up to his most imposing stature, gripping the knife and staring hard at the bear. The bear advanced clumsily a couple of steps, reared up, and gave vent to a tentative growl. If the man ran, he would run after him; but the man did not run. He was animated now with the courage of fear. He, too, growled, savagely, terribly, voicing the fear that is to life germane and that lies twisted about life\u2019s deepest roots.\n\nThe bear edged away to one side, growling menacingly, himself appalled by this mysterious creature that appeared upright and unafraid. But the man did not move. He stood like a statue till the danger was past, when he yielded to a fit of trembling and sank down into the wet moss.\n\nHe pulled himself together and went on, afraid now in a new way. It was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food, but that he should be destroyed violently before starvation had exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him that made toward surviving. There were the wolves. Back and forth across the desolation drifted their howls, weaving the very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he found himself, arms in the air, pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a wind- blown tent.\n\nNow and again the wolves, in packs of two and three, crossed his path. But they sheered clear of him. They were not in sufficient numbers, and besides they were hunting the caribou, which did not battle, while this strange creature that walked erect might scratch and bite.\n\nIn the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves had made a kill. The debris had been a caribou calf an hour before, squawking and running and very much alive. He contemplated the bones, clean-picked and polished, pink with the cell-life in them which had not yet died. Could it possibly be that he might be that ere the day was done! Such was life, eh? A vain and fleeting thing. It was only life that pained. There was no hurt in death. To die was to sleep. It meant cessation, rest. Then why was he not content to die?\n\nBut he did not moralize long. He was squatting in the moss, a bone in his mouth, sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it faintly pink. The sweet meaty taste, thin and elusive almost as a memory, maddened him. He closed his jaws on the bones and crunched. Sometimes it was the bone that broke, sometimes his teeth. Then he crushed the bones between rocks, pounded them to a pulp, and swallowed them. He pounded his fingers, too, in his haste, and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending rock.\n\nCame frightful days of snow and rain. He did not know when he made camp, when he broke camp. He travelled in the night as much as in the day. He rested wherever he fell, crawled on whenever the dying life in him flickered up and burned less dimly. He, as a man, no longer strove. It was the life in him, unwilling to die, that drove him on. He did not suffer. His nerves had become blunted, numb, while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious dreams.\n\nBut ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou calf, the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried with him. He crossed no more hills or divides, but automatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley. He did not see this stream nor this valley. He saw nothing save visions. Soul and body walked or crawled side by side, yet apart, so slender was the thread that bound them.\n\nHe awoke in his right mind, lying on his back on a rocky ledge. The sun was shining bright and warm. Afar off he heard the squawking of caribou calves. He was aware of vague memories of rain and wind and snow, but whether he had been beaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did not know.\n\nFor some time he lay without movement, the genial sunshine pouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth. A fine day, he thought. Perhaps he could manage to locate himself. By a painful effort he rolled over on his side. Below him flowed a wide and sluggish river. Its unfamiliarity puzzled him. Slowly he followed it with his eyes, winding in wide sweeps among the bleak, bare hills, bleaker and barer and lower-lying than any hills he had yet encountered. Slowly, deliberately, without excitement or more than the most casual interest, he followed the course of the strange stream toward the sky-line and saw it emptying into a bright and shining sea. He was still unexcited. Most unusual, he thought, a vision or a mirage - more likely a vision, a trick of his disordered mind. He was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea. He closed his eyes for a while, then opened them. Strange how the vision persisted! Yet not strange. He knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands, just as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle.\n\nHe heard a snuffle behind him - a half-choking gasp or cough. Very slowly, because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness, he rolled over on his other side. He could see nothing near at hand, but he waited patiently. Again came the snuffle and cough, and outlined between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf. The sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on other wolves; the eyes were bleared and bloodshot, the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly. The animal blinked continually in the sunshine. It seemed sick. As he looked it snuffled and coughed again.\n\nThis, at least, was real, he thought, and turned on the other side so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him before by the vision. But the sea still shone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible. Was it reality, after all? He closed his eyes for a long while and thought, and then it came to him. He had been making north by east, away from the Dease Divide and into the Coppermine Valley. This wide and sluggish river was the Coppermine. That shining sea was the Arctic Ocean. That ship was a whaler, strayed east, far east, from the mouth of the Mackenzie, and it was lying at anchor in Coronation Gulf. He remembered the Hudson Bay Company chart he had seen long ago, and it was all clear and reasonable to him.\n\nHe sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs. He had worn through the blanket-wrappings, and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw meat. His last blanket was gone. Rifle and knife were both missing. He had lost his hat somewhere, with the bunch of matches in the band, but the matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper. He looked at his watch. It marked eleven o\u2019clock and was still running. Evidently he had kept it wound.\n\nHe was calm and collected. Though extremely weak, he had no sensation of pain. He was not hungry. The thought of food was not even pleasant to him, and whatever he did was done by his reason alone. He ripped off his pants' legs to the knees and bound them about his feet. Somehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin bucket. He would have some hot water before he began what he foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship.\n\nHis movements were slow. He shook as with a palsy. When he started to collect dry moss, he found he could not rise to his feet. He tried again and again, then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees. Once he crawled near to the sick wolf. The animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way, licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the strength to curl. The man noticed that the tongue was not the customary healthy red. It was a yellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and half-dry mucus.\n\nAfter he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able to stand, and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed to walk. Every minute or so he was compelled to rest. His steps were feeble and uncertain, just as the wolf\u2019s that trailed him were feeble and uncertain; and that night, when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness, he knew he was nearer to it by no more than four miles.\n\nThroughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf, and now and then the squawking of the caribou calves. There was life all around him, but it was strong life, very much alive and well, and he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man\u2019s trail in the hope that the man would die first. In the morning, on opening his eyes, he beheld it regarding him with a wistful and hungry stare. It stood crouched, with tail between its legs, like a miserable and woe-begone dog. It shivered in the chill morning wind, and grinned dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no more than a hoarse whisper.\n\nThe sun rose brightly, and all morning the man tottered and fell toward the ship on the shining sea. The weather was perfect. It was the brief Indian Summer of the high latitudes. It might last a week. To-morrow or next day it might he gone.\n\nIn the afternoon the man came upon a trail. It was of another man, who did not walk, but who dragged himself on all fours. The man thought it might be Bill, but he thought in a dull, uninterested way. He had no curiosity. In fact, sensation and emotion had left him. He was no longer susceptible to pain. Stomach and nerves had gone to sleep. Yet the life that was in him drove him on. He was very weary, but it refused to die. It was because it refused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows, drank his hot water, and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf.\n\nHe followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along, and soon came to the end of it - a few fresh-picked bones where the soggy moss was marked by the foot-pads of many wolves. He saw a squat moose-hide sack, mate to his own, which had been torn by sharp teeth. He picked it up, though its weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers. Bill had carried it to the last. Ha! ha! He would have the laugh on Bill. He would survive and carry it to the ship in the shining sea. His mirth was hoarse and ghastly, like a raven\u2019s croak, and the sick wolf joined him, howling lugubriously. The man ceased suddenly. How could he have the laugh on Bill if that were Bill; if those bones, so pinky-white and clean, were Bill?\n\nHe turned away. Well, Bill had deserted him; but he would not take the gold, nor would he suck Bill\u2019s bones. Bill would have, though, had it been the other way around, he mused as he staggered on.\n\nHe came to a pool of water. Stooping over in quest of minnows, he jerked his head back as though he had been stung. He had caught sight of his reflected face. So horrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be shocked. There were three minnows in the pool, which was too large to drain; and after several ineffectual attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore. He was afraid, because of his great weakness, that he might fall in and drown. It was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the river astride one of the many drift-logs which lined its sand- spits.\n\nThat day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by three miles; the next day by two - for he was crawling now as Bill had crawled; and the end of the fifth day found the ship still seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day. Still the Indian Summer held on, and he continued to crawl and faint, turn and turn about; and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at his heels. His knees had become raw meat like his feet, and though he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and stones. Once, glancing back, he saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail, and he saw sharply what his own end might be - unless - unless he could get the wolf. Then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever played - a sick man that crawled, a sick wolf that limped, two creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and hunting each other\u2019s lives.\n\nHad it been a well wolf, it would not have mattered so much to the man; but the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and all but dead thing was repugnant to him. He was finicky. His mind had begun to wander again, and to be perplexed by hallucinations, while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter.\n\nHe was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear. The wolf leaped lamely back, losing its footing and falling in its weakness. It was ludicrous, but he was not amused. Nor was he even afraid. He was too far gone for that. But his mind was for the moment clear, and he lay and considered. The ship was no more than four miles away. He could see it quite distinctly when he rubbed the mists out of his eyes, and he could see the white sail of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea. But he could never crawl those four miles. He knew that, and was very calm in the knowledge. He knew that he could not crawl half a mile. And yet he wanted to live. It was unreasonable that he should die after all he had undergone. Fate asked too much of him. And, dying, he declined to die. It was stark madness, perhaps, but in the very grip of Death he defied Death and refused to die.\n\nHe closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution. He steeled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being. It was very like a sea, this deadly languor, that rose and rose and drowned his consciousness bit by bit. Sometimes he was all but submerged, swimming through oblivion with a faltering stroke; and again, by some strange alchemy of soul, he would find another shred of will and strike out more strongly.\n\nWithout movement he lay on his back, and he could hear, slowly drawing near and nearer, the wheezing intake and output of the sick wolf\u2019s breath. It drew closer, ever closer, through an infinitude of time, and he did not move. It was at his ear. The harsh dry tongue grated like sandpaper against his cheek. His hands shot out - or at least he willed them to shoot out. The fingers were curved like talons, but they closed on empty air. Swiftness and certitude require strength, and the man had not this strength.\n\nThe patience of the wolf was terrible. The man\u2019s patience was no less terrible. For half a day he lay motionless, fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to feed. Sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he dreamed long dreams; but ever through it all, waking and dreaming, he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress of the tongue.\n\nHe did not hear the breath, and he slipped slowly from some dream to the feel of the tongue along his hand. He waited. The fangs pressed softly; the pressure increased; the wolf was exerting its last strength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it had waited so long. But the man had waited long, and the lacerated hand closed on the jaw. Slowly, while the wolf struggled feebly and the hand clutched feebly, the other hand crept across to a grip. Five minutes later the whole weight of the man\u2019s body was on top of the wolf. The hands had not sufficient strength to choke the wolf, but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair. At the end of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat. It was not pleasant. It was like molten lead being forced into his stomach, and it was forced by his will alone. Later the man rolled over on his back and slept.\n\nThere were some members of a scientific expedition on the whale- ship Bedford. From the deck they remarked a strange object on the shore. It was moving down the beach toward the water. They were unable to classify it, and, being scientific men, they climbed into the whale-boat alongside and went ashore to see. And they saw something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man. It was blind, unconscious. It squirmed along the ground like some monstrous worm. Most of its efforts were ineffectual, but it was persistent, and it writhed and twisted and went ahead perhaps a score of feet an hour.\n\nThree weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whale-ship Bedford, and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks told who he was and what he had undergone. He also babbled incoherently of his mother, of sunny Southern California, and a home among the orange groves and flowers.\n\nThe days were not many after that when he sat at table with the scientific men and ship\u2019s officers. He gloated over the spectacle of so much food, watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths of others. With the disappearance of each mouthful an expression of deep regret came into his eyes. He was quite sane, yet he hated those men at mealtime. He was haunted by a fear that the food would not last. He inquired of the cook, the cabin-boy, the captain, concerning the food stores. They reassured him countless times; but he could not believe them, and pried cunningly about the lazarette to see with his own eyes.\n\nIt was noticed that the man was getting fat. He grew stouter with each day. The scientific men shook their heads and theorized. They limited the man at his meals, but still his girth increased and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt.\n\nThe sailors grinned. They knew. And when the scientific men set a watch on the man, they knew too. They saw him slouch for\u2019ard after breakfast, and, like a mendicant, with outstretched palm, accost a sailor. The sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea biscuit. He clutched it avariciously, looked at it as a miser looks at gold, and thrust it into his shirt bosom. Similar were the donations from other grinning sailors.\n\nThe scientific men were discreet. They let him alone. But they privily examined his bunk. It was lined with hardtack; the mattress was stuffed with hardtack; every nook and cranny was filled with hardtack. Yet he was sane. He was taking precautions against another possible famine - that was all. He would recover from it, the scientific men said; and he did, ere the Bedford\u2019s anchor rumbled down in San Francisco Bay.\n\n\u8bd1\u6587\uff08\u8bd1\u8005\uff1a\u672a\u77e5\uff09\n\n\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u603b\u7b97\u5269\u4e0b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u2014\u2014

The singer shared the new version of \u201cLove Story,\u201d which was first released in September 2008. Naturally, she sounds much more grown up and powerful in the re-recorded track (she was just 18 when she first recorded the original). The new version is officially called \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d, making it clear that this is the version of the song that Taylor owns the rights to.\n\nTaylor fully owns the rights to this version of the song, as she will with all of the music she re-records and releases to the public. The 31-year-old has been re-recording the music from her first six albums (Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation). These were all of the albums she recorded before leaving Big Machine Records at the end of 2018. She already owns the rights to the three albums (Lover, Folklore and Evermore) that she\u2019s released on her new label, Republic Records.\n\nHours before releasing \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d Taylor announced that the entire re-record of Fearless, her second album, will be coming on April 9. She also revealed that the new version will have 26 songs in total, which means there will be six never-before-heard songs that didn\u2019t make the original album (platinum edition) when it was released. These are tracks that Taylor pulled from her \u201cvault\u201d and fans will finally be able to hear for the first time!\n\nWhen Taylor signed her contract with Big Machine as a teenager, she agreed that the label would own the rights to her masters. As she grew up, became an international superstar, and got to know the industry better, she, naturally, wanted to own the music herself. However, when she approached label head, Scott Borchetta, about buying the rights to her songs, he wanted to make a different deal. Scott offered Taylor the rights to her first six albums, but only if she recorded six new ones on Big Machine first.\n\nRather than being tied to that, Taylor left the label, giving up her rights to the music. However, in 2019, Scott sold her masters to one of her nemeses, Scooter Braun, for $300 million. Since Taylor never had the chance to outright buy her own music in this way, she was (rightfully) not happy. In November 2020, Taylor\u2019s contract with Big Machine officially ended and she was able to begin re-recording the old songs on her own terms. \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d is just the beginning!"}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/best-breakup-songs-this-century-ranked-2022-2", "page_content": "4. \"Cry Me a River\" by Justin Timberlake\n\n\"Cry Me a River\" was released in 2002. Justin Timberlake/YouTube\n\nWhen Greta Gerwig wrote Justin Timberlake a letter to ask if she could use \"Cry Me a River\" in her directorial debut \"Lady Bird,\" she aptly described the track as \"sultry and sullen and infectious \u2014 what 'Gimme Shelter' must have felt like to the kids of the late '60s.\"\n\nGerwig was 19 when \"Cry Me a River\" was released, just a few years younger than Timberlake was when the song was written \u2014 or, more accurately, when it came spilling out after a heated phone call with his then-girlfriend.\n\nAs producer Timbaland recounted in 2011: \"I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it,' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth...'\"\n\nAgainst all odds, Timbaland makes Timberlake's angst and spite sound impossibly stylish, draping his famous falsetto with streaks of rain, layers of beatboxing, and Gregorian chants.\n\nWhile that hardly sounds like a winning formula, \"Cry Me a River\" succeeds precisely because it's not bound by common laws of etiquette and chill. If most breakup songs are like sitcom episodes, \"Cry Me a River\" is the vengeance plot on a soap opera."}, {"url": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-love-story-rerecorded-version", "page_content": "When Taylor Swift announced, in August 2019, her \u201cabsolute\u201d intention to rerecord her first six albums, fans immediately raised questions.\n\nWould she opt to make any significant changes to the songs \u2014 their instrumentation, or even their lyrics \u2014 or would each rerecording simply be a carbon copy of its original? Which album would she decide to record first? Would she go in chronological order of their releases? Or might she even rerelease her biggest singles as a kind of greatest hits collection? Would there be acoustic versions? Piano versions? Remixes? Would we finally be able to hear the fabled 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d?\n\nSome \u2014 though not all \u2014 of those questions were finally answered in early February, when Taylor announced in a post on her social media accounts that her rerecorded version of 2008\u2019s Fearless \u2014 aptly subtitled Taylor\u2019s Version \u2014 would arrive on April 9. To prelude its release, the album\u2019s lead single, \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d would drop in just a few hours, at midnight.\n\nIt may have been mildly surprising, for those familiar with Taylor and her proclivity for routine, that she didn\u2019t choose to begin the journey of rerecording and rereleasing her back catalog with her self-titled debut album. It was likely what the majority of fans expected, but if the last year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that some of Taylor\u2019s best career moves are also some of her least predictable. The Old Taylor may have been killed off in 2017, following the most tumultuous year of her career \u2014 but with \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d the pop superstar provided a symbolic foundation for her previous iterations' imminent resurrection.\n\nThe new version of \u201cLove Story,\u201d as it turned out, was almost indistinguishable from the original. There is a very slight variation in the tone of Taylor\u2019s voice, unsurprisingly more mature at 31 than it was at 18. There are a couple of instances of changing intonation, and some syllables are emphasized where they weren\u2019t before, and the instrumentals are more crisp. The difference, though, is likely noticeable only to those who have spent the last 13 years studying Taylor\u2019s music in excruciating detail, and that is, of course, the point: In rerecording her first six albums, Taylor aims to diminish the value of their original master recordings.\n\nThe story of her battle with Big Machine Records over the rights to her masters is well documented. Taylor originally signed with the label when she was just 15 \u2014 but when it came time for her to renew her contract, she declined, announcing that she had instead signed a brand-new deal with Universal Music Group. Six months later, in an explosive post on her Tumblr account, she revealed why she had left.\n\nIn the post, Taylor claimed that when she asked to buy the rights to her master recordings, Scott Borchetta \u2014 Big Machine\u2019s founder and CEO \u2014 had refused. Instead, he counteroffered with the opportunity for Taylor to \u201cearn\u201d them back on the condition that she sign a new 10-year contract and produce six more albums under the label. She turned down the offer, aware that Borchetta intended to sell the label, and she chose to prioritize the security of her future work over her past. And then, in a move Taylor called her \u201cworst nightmare,\u201d Borchetta sold Big Machine for $300 million to Scooter Braun\u2019s company, Ithaca Holdings.\n\n\u201cAny time Scott Borchetta has heard the words \u2018Scooter Braun\u2019 escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to,\u201d Taylor wrote on Tumblr, referencing the years of \u201cincessant, manipulative bullying\u201d she said she experienced from Braun and his celebrity clients, including Kanye West and Justin Bieber. \u201cHe knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn\u2019t want to be associated with them.\u201d\n\nBraun\u2019s acquisition of the company not only meant that he and Big Machine had the ability to block Taylor\u2019s music from being licensed \u2014 it also meant they profited any time a song in her back catalog was bought, used, or streamed. In an interview with Billboard in December 2019, Taylor announced she would categorically deny any requests to license her old music until she was able to rerecord and rerelease it, in order to prevent Big Machine or Scooter Braun from profiting off her work.\n\n\"Every week, we get a dozen synch requests to use 'Shake It Off' in some advertisement or 'Blank Space' in some movie trailer, and we say no to every single one of them,\" she said at the time. \"The reason I'm rerecording my music next year is because I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies, I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it.\"\n\nIt makes sense, then, from a business perspective, for Taylor to have begun rerecording with one of her most well-known and well-loved songs. While her debut album may have been the beginning, \u201cLove Story\u201d \u2014 and the Fearless era as a whole \u2014 arguably marked the birth of Taylor Swift the superstar. Following its release in 2008, the song become one of the biggest-selling digital singles in US history; upon its most recent certification from RIAA in 2015, \"Love Story\" was awarded 8x platinum. Fearless, meanwhile, received a diamond certification in 2017, and in 2010 made Taylor the youngest ever recipient of Album of the Year at the Grammys.\n\n\u201cLove Story\u201d and Fearless paved the way for Taylor's journey from small-time country singer to the living pop legend she is today \u2014 the one whose music is so valuable, someone might think to pay $300 million to own it. It\u2019s one of those songs that everybody knows, and as a result it will undoubtedly be streamed endlessly and played on the radio and licensed for use in movie trailers and TV shows and ads ad infinitum. But if all Taylor were chasing with this rerecording process was profit, she could have started with 1989, the album that contains \u201cShake It Off\u201d and \u201cBlank Space,\u201d arguably her most commercially successful hits.\n\nInstead, Taylor decided to take us back to the era with which, for many of her longest-serving fans, this journey all began. She famously wrote \u201cLove Story\u201d by herself on the floor of her childhood bedroom in \u201cabout 20 minutes,\u201d filled with 18-year-old angst over her parents\u2019 disapproval of a boy she wanted to date (but ultimately never did). It was written late in Fearless\u2019s album-making process and a last-minute addition to the tracklist, but the song went on to soundtrack the trials and tribulations of countless fans\u2019 teenage years.\n\n\u201cWhen I think back on the Fearless album and all that you turned it into, a completely involuntary smile creeps across my face,\u201d Taylor wrote in her statement announcing the rerecorded album\u2019s completion. \u201cThis was the musical era in which so many inside jokes were created between us, so many hugs exchanged and hands touched, so many unbreakable bonds formed.\u201d\n\nFor fans who have stuck with Taylor through all the years since, the announcement felt like a familiar hug from an old friend. It resurrected a previously defunct Taylor Swift tradition, a message hidden in seemingly random capitalized letters spelling out \u201cApril ninth\u201d \u2014 the release date of Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version). She revealed that the rerecorded version of the album will include six never-before-heard songs written during the making of the original, ensuring the same level of excitement that precedes brand-new Taylor Swift music, even if we have heard most of the tracks countless times before. Even the two-month wait between the single and the album recalls a familiar pattern of anticipation we never got to experience with 2020\u2019s Folklore and Evermore.\n\nIn short, with Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), it feels like Taylor is re-creating the journey of releasing the original not only for herself, but for fans, too \u2014 and, during a moment when everything feels uncertain, the nostalgia that comes with it couldn\u2019t be a more welcome comfort.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t escaped fans that \u201cLove Story\u201d both starts and concludes with the words \u201cwe were both young when I first saw you.\u201d It's a poignant sentiment for the innumerable fans who discovered Taylor through the song in 2008 and have stuck by her side ever since. The lyric video for the rerecorded version pays homage to that cherished relationship between the fan and the artist \u2014 a slideshow of photos of Fearless-era Taylor signing autographs and posing for photos with fans captured during a comically dated moment in time. (Borchetta\u2019s face is blurred out of one of the photos.) After it was released, Taylor liked a bunch of side-by-side photos from fans in tweets showing how much they\u2019ve grown alongside her. The video ends with a simple message: \u201cWith love to all my fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the people who keep you going and support you and have your back out there in the world to know that you\u2019re thinking of them all the time,\u201d an 18-year-old Taylor told the Los Angeles Times in 2008.\n\nWith Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), she proves that she still is."}, {"url": "https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/love-life-canceled-hbo-max-1235458581/#!", "page_content": "\u201cLove Life\u201d has been canceled at HBO Max after two seasons.\n\nThe anthology romantic comedy series was originally ordered in May 2019 before HBO Max even had a name.

Both seasons will be pulled off of HBO Max.\n\nSam Boyd created the series and served as co-showrunner and executive producer on both seasons. Bridget Bedard was also the co-showrunner and executive producer on both seasons, with Rachelle Williams joining as co-showrunner and executive producer in Season 2.

In Season 2, Harper starred with Jessica Williams, Punkie Johnson and Chris \u201cComedian CP\u201d Powell.\n\nThis now marks the second reported cancellation of a Lionsgate series at HBO Max this week. Earlier, Variety reported that the comedy series \u201cMinx\u201d was also canceled, despite the fact that show had been renewed for a second season back in May. According to sources, both cancellations are the result of cost-cutting efforts within HBO Max and Warner Bros.

To that end, a great deal of development as been cut, while a number of shows have been pulled of the service altogether. In addition, \u201cChad\u201d was canceled at TBS despite the fact it had already completed production on Season 2, while scripted programming is largely done at TBS and TNT.\n\nThe decisions are not confined to television, either.

The band\u2019s whole existence had already been a long, strange trip \u2014 from youthful iterations mostly existing in obscurity in the \u201880s, to beginning to incorporate more dance influences, to the massive breakthroughs during Britpop\u2019s mid-\u201890s heyday. After all of that, there was the crash landing of 1998\u2019s This Is Hardcore \u2014 the fallout from fame and partying, the ugly and bleak late nights on the other side of everything. That, in a way, could\u2019ve already been Pulp\u2019s conclusion. It was an endpoint from the stories they told on His \u2019N\u2019 Hers and Different Class, and it arrived in the 1997/1998 moment when Britpop was undergoing its great collective comedown, as the albums sprawled and egos frayed and the whole heady moment had gone about as far as it could go.\n\nPresumably, This Is Hardcore almost was the ending. Pulp struggled to work on a followup, originally embarking on sessions with Chris Thomas, who had produced their last two albums. Those were aborted, and the band wondered whether the songs were any good; to hear Jarvis Cocker tell it, a performance of the new track \u201cSunrise\u201d at Reading Festival in 2000 helped buoy their spirits. Then they partnered with the legendary Scott Walker, who helped them shepherd a strange, unexpected new Pulp album out into the world. That album, We Love Life, arrived 20 years ago today in the UK. It would be their final album, and it stands now as an oft-overlooked epilogue and resolution to all that came before.\n\nAt the time, We Love Life was presented and regarded as something brighter or more hopeful than This Is Hardcore. Oddly, it was sometimes even written about as a return to form after This Is Hardcore\u2018s sordid dead-ends, as if suggesting the latter didn\u2019t stand up to its predecessors and complete Pulp\u2019s great \u201890s trilogy. No matter one\u2019s personal opinion of This Is Hardcore, however, it was clear the Pulp of We Love Life was in a different space. The name could come across as sarcastic, and there were a great many lyrics on the album that suggested a supposedly rosier outlook hadn\u2019t quite taken hold of the band. But in the moment, there was at least some definitive tonal and stylistic overhaul.\n\nMuch was made of We Love Life\u2018s more nature-oriented aesthetic and themes. Cocker talked often about how he was looking to nature more \u2014 a jarring shift for a band that was always sleek and urbane, the poets of late-night misadventures in city centers. The more theoretically bucolic setting of We Love Life was a bit more complicated than that, but the music did mirror a more organic, lived-in approach, with Candida Doyle\u2019s synths taking a backseat to evocative string arrangements and Mark Webber\u2019s guitars, ranging from acoustic and rough-hewn to jangling and shimmery. The songs were strong \u2014 the twilit reflection of \u201cThe Trees,\u201d the autumnal flickers of \u201cBob Lind (The Only Way Is Down),\u201d the way \u201cBad Cover Version\u201d managed to update a would-be old Britpop ballad with more grey at the temples. Pulp were successfully carving out a new sound for themselves that, while not without its connections to their past, seemed to point a way forward for all the post-Britpop years to come.\n\nLyrically, though, We Love Life told a very different story. Maybe it wasn\u2019t as obviously strung-out and depleted as This Is Hardcore, but there were a whole lot of lyrics on We Love Life that dwelled on mortality, time passed and things nearly forgotten. There\u2019s a wistfulness to \u201cThe Trees,\u201d one of the most evocative pop songs on the album, mulling over withered love and life disappearing back to the earth: \u201cI carved your name with a heart just above/ Now swollen, distorted, unrecognizable like our love/ The smell of leaf mold and the sweetness of decay/ Are the incense at the funeral procession here today.\u201d It\u2019s not the only time that death and decomposition parallel romantic collapse: \u201cA deer lay dying in the road/ Maybe I should have seen it as some kind of sign/ Except I don\u2019t believe in them no more,\u201d Cocker sings on \u201cRoadkill.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bad cover version of love is not the real thing,\u201d he sings elsewhere. \u201cBad Cover Version\u201d is a bitter post-breakup take that then, in characteristically hilarious Cocker fashion, goes on to compare the disappointment of subsequent relationships to the Stones since the \u201880s and the Tom And Jerry cartoons where they could talk. At the same time, Cocker\u2019s ongoing grappling with celebrity and pop success could be rearing its head as a greater disenchantment with the whole endeavor \u2014 the Stones since the \u201880s perhaps also a warning to themselves to not run this thing into the ground in the Britpop postscript. Throughout the album, there is a worn, haggard quality \u2014 maybe a bit more grounded and matter-of-fact than This Is Hardcore, but something approaching closure in the form of the decision that Pulp had run out of road. When you get to \u201cI Love Life,\u201d it plays like an intentional, desperate effort to really believe the phrase.\n\nYet as much as Pulp might\u2019ve sounded like they feared being washed up, the album is inspired. We Love Life still sits outside the main Britpop narrative, but Pulp had certainly fared better than some of their peers in the post-peak years. We Love Life is a strong album, all the more entrancing for how it exists to the side of much louder, more ubiquitous classics. Within it, you have some of Pulp\u2019s greatest achievements hidden away. That is perhaps truest of \u201cWickerman,\u201d the album\u2019s shadowy centerpiece. It finds Cocker returning to long-lost memories and loves in Sheffield, the post-industrial town he remembered fading further into the rearview. It\u2019s one of the band\u2019s long, shape-shifting epics, winding like a ghostly wind until Cocker reaches his conclusion over dramatic, cinematic strings.\n\nThen there\u2019s We Love Life\u2019s calling card, \u201cSunrise,\u201d the closer of Pulp\u2019s career. \u201cI used to hate the sun/ Because it shone on everything I\u2019d done/ Made me feel that all that I had done/ Was overfill the ashtray of my life,\u201d Cocker sings in the beginning, like transposing Mick Jagger\u2019s \u201cThe sunshine bores the daylights out of me\u201d to a middle-aged reckoning. Clearer than any other moment on We Love Life, it feels like a goodbye to the Pulp we knew and, for Cocker, the whole pop-musician life altogether. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been awake all night/ So why should you crash out at dawn?\u201d he asks, his final parting words on a Pulp album, and then \u201cSunrise\u201d erupts into its great, cathartic outro of lacerating guitars and choral denouements. One last run, but also a true finale. Musically, it\u2019s the exact kind of passage where the credits roll on one chapter of your life and all your memories tumble through your head in rapid-fire succession.\n\nBy the end of 2002, Pulp were no more. A nine-year hiatus ensued, during which Cocker thought about retiring from making music entirely, before getting roped back in to write for Nancy Sinatra, which in turn spurred his 2006 solo debut Jarvis. Even then, he hasn\u2019t always seemed particularly interested in the life anymore; after 2009\u2019s Further Complications, there was a yawning 11-year gap until Cocker released Beyond The Pale in the summer of 2020. During that interim, Pulp returned for a triumphant reunion tour. There were maybe some hints of a new future: Cocker at one point saying he was working on new songs, the fact that they released a new version of \u201cAfter You\u201d \u2014 originally a demo from the We Love Life sessions \u2014 and letting the prospect of a Pulp reunion album produced by a then-retired James Murphy just hang there. But it\u2019s been almost another 10 years now, and when promoting Beyond The Pale Cocker pretty much shut down any possibility for Pulp to return again, stating the tour had gone about as perfectly as he could expect and provided a \u201csatisfying end.\u201d\n\nTwenty years later, all the obvious markers of We Love Life\u2019s finality remain mostly true, then. In many ways, it\u2019s hard to imagine Pulp having continued on to a more logical conclusion. The landscape was changing around them, and on We Love Life they seemed happy to exist outside the trends of the moment. But within that, they found a way to hang it up and go out on a high note. It\u2019s a weathered, conversational high note, but a high note nonetheless. After tearing through the wild tabloid frenzy of Britpop and a million dance floors and nights out, Pulp took a cue from the characters Cocker depicted on We Love Life. They emerged one more time, then let themselves get overtaken by the currents of time and nature, disappearing into the past."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2020/12/22/948655542/successful-sentimental-and-satirized-love-story-celebrates-50th-anniversary", "page_content": "Successful, Sentimental And Satirized, 'Love Story' Celebrates 50th Anniversary\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures\n\nFifty years ago, a simple but tragic love story became a global sensation that stunned the entertainment industry. Love Story, the romantic tearjerker starring Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw, broke box office records and the book it was based on was a bestseller that was translated into more than 30 languages.\n\n\"What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who dies?\" So begins the novel and screenplay, both written by Erich Segal.\n\nIn December, 1970, in the midst of the Vietnam War and the continuing fight for Civil Rights \u2014 along came an \"unabashedly sentimental\" story \"about the power of love,\" says Segal's daughter, writer Francesca Segal. It was \"genuine and earnest and I think it just struck a chord,\" she says. The 50th anniversary edition of the novel Love Story includes an introduction by Francesca.\n\nErich Segal was 30 years old and a professor at Yale when he wrote the 131-page Love Story. The idea came when he learned that one of his former students was just 25 when he lost his wife to cancer. Oliver Barrett IV, played by Ryan O'Neal in the movie, is a sensitive, rich kid and a Harvard hockey player. The inspiration for Oliver has been the source of intrigue and even controversy. Segal said Oliver was partly modeled after Al Gore, but mostly after Tommy Lee Jones (who also has a part in the movie). Segal got to know both men when they were all students at Harvard together. Some years later, Segal said he modeled Oliver after Watergate investigator Terry Lenzner.\n\nJenny, played by MacGraw, is a sassy, working-class baker's daughter who goes to Radcliffe and works in the library. In 1970, Segal told The New York Times Jenny was modeled after a woman he dated while he was a student at Harvard.\n\n\"Ollie, you're a preppie millionaire, and I'm a social zero,\" Jenny teases.\n\nThey were gorgeous to look at as they frolic in the snow, argue, fall deeply in love and marry, despite the disapproval of Oliver's father. Just as they start a new life together, Jenny learns she has a fatal blood disease and dies. (Only in the book is the disease identified as leukemia.)\n\n\"It was clich\u00e9, but it worked,\" says Ali MacGraw. \"And everybody was completely flabbergasted when it had the reception that it had, which was right away,\" she remembers.\n\nTheater 'Love Letters' Reunites Stars Of Iconic Love Story 'Love Letters' Reunites Stars Of Iconic Love Story Listen \u00b7 6:19 6:19\n\nPeople flocked to see Love Story when it was released widely on Christmas Day, with numerous accounts of people waiting in long lines at the box office. Movie attendance had been down in 1970. The Los Angeles Times called Love Story a \"phenomenon\" that was a \"boon\" to the \"embattled\" studio Paramount and \"evidence people ... still want to go to the movies in vast numbers.\" The film, directed by Arthur Hiller, was nominated for seven Oscars, winning one for Francis Lai's original score. It won five Golden Globes, including Best Drama and Best Actress and Actor for MacGraw and O'Neal respectively. MacGraw quickly became a fashion icon.\n\nBestselling romance writer Susan Elizabeth Phillips says just about everyone she knew saw the movie after first reading the book.\n\nPhillips, who was in her early 20s when the book and movie came out, also recalls the sobs. \"Love Story was an ugly cry,\" she says.\n\n\"I remember when I read it, of course dissolving in tears,\" says Phillips. \"I read it to my boyfriend at the time, read it out loud to him, sobbing through the whole thing. We've now been married for 50 years.\" Phillips says her husband doesn't remember any of this. \"So that's a blessing,\" she jokes.\n\nAs for Love Story's very famous, oft-ridiculed line, \"Love means never having to say you're sorry,\" even MacGraw says she didn't know what it meant at the time. But now, years later, she finds truth in it: \"Saying sorry isn't what it's about. It's about really feeling badly for the hurt ... and then absolutely trying never to do it again. So there's a lot of work more than, 'Gee, I'm sorry,' and then scooting outside to get on your bike and ride into the fall leaves or whatever.\"\n\nStill, MacGraw wishes she'd asked about the meaning 50 years ago during filming: \"It's an insane line. But I said it. And I live with it!\"\n\nYouTube\n\nMacGraw also lives with the many parodies Love Story inspired. Her personal favorite is by Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman. \"Fabulous,\" says MacGraw. In an episode of The Simpsons, Homer and Marge are big fans of the movie and force their kids to watch it. They don't get it at all. When Bart hears the opening line, \"What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who dies,\" he blurts out, \"I say bury her before she starts to smell!\" Homer and Marge are appalled.\n\nYouTube\n\nMany a Simpson writer attended Harvard where Love Story was filmed and where it is still lampooned to this day. The school's Crimson Key Society puts on an annual, Rocky Horror-style screening for first-year students (this year's was canceled due to the pandemic). Older students dress up like hippies and heckle the screen from beginning to end. Junior Davis Bailey, president of the Crimson Key Society, says they make fun of everything about it. \"Basically every ten seconds or so we have a line that, collectively or individually, some of us will shout out at the screen or we do something that we act out,\" says Bailey. \"Because the movie is definitely very sappy.\"\n\n\"Sappy\" is how some critics felt about Love Story way back in 1970. \"Phony,\" \"clich\u00e9,\" \"contrived\" were some of the words they used.\n\nAnd here's where Erich Segal's best-known work becomes an example of what happens when popular culture and academia collide.\n\nSegal, the son of a rabbi, grew up in New York. While Love Story was embraced by the masses, Segal also wrote scholarly works on Plato and Plautus and his lectures at Yale were hugely popular. \"Electrifying\" is how one of his students, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau, described him. But in 1972, Segal was denied tenure at Yale. \"It wasn't fair,\" Trudeau told the Yale Alumni Magazine in 2010, shortly after Segal's death, \"but you can't dress up in tight leather pants to chat with starlets on Johnny Carson Friday night and expect to be taken seriously in a classroom Monday morning.\" Yale denies that the popular and commercial success of Segal's Love Story's had anything to do with its decision.\n\nRemembrances Remembering Authors Robert Parker, Erich Segal Remembering Authors Robert Parker, Erich Segal Listen \u00b7 3:24 3:24\n\nFrancesca Segal says her father was, \"for a long time, completely and absolutely devastated and heartbroken that he didn't make tenure at Yale.\" She believes one of the reasons Love Story touched so many people is because her father \"didn't have a cynical bone in his body,\" and that he wrote from his heart.\n\nRomance fiction writer Susan Elizabeth Phillips says critics back in 1970 had an aversion to just about anything that was embraced by the masses. \"The fact that a work of art, which that book is, evokes this strong emotion was something that the literati at the time looked down on,\" says Phillips. \"The experience was supposed to be cerebral. It wasn't supposed to be emotional.\"\n\nIf nothing else, Love Story is definitely emotional. Reviewing the film, Roger Ebert called it a \"a three-, four-or five-handkerchief movie.\" Le Monde wrote it was the novel that \"no one dared to write, but everyone was waiting to read.\"\n\ntoggle caption Elise Amendola/AP\n\nAt a time when people could use a good cry, Ali MacGraw wonders if today's audiences have the patience for a simple story about love and loss.\n\n\"The terrifying thing about this ever more automaton world that we're walking into,\" she says, is \"that we're functioning as opposed to feeling. And I think there's a big difference.\"\n\nStill, MacGraw says, to this day, she hears from people who remember being deeply moved by Love Story. \"Always somebody comes up and says, 'Oh, you were in that movie, why aren't you guys making another one?' Of course, the fact that I'm dead and considerably older probably hasn't computed,\" she laughs.\n\nNina Gregory edited this story."}]}
