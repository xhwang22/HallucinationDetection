Several states were already using voting machines in their elections and the Federal government was finally convinced of their safety and accuracy.\n\nIn 1914, at the age of only 15 years old, David was alive when in August, the Panama Canal opened to traffic. Begun by the French in the 1880's and abandoned, the United States undertook further construction in 1904. After 10 years, and the elimination of malaria carrying mosquitoes (which caused immense delays for the French and the Americans), the 48 mile long artificial waterway - a series of locks - created a shortcut for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nIn 1940, at the age of 41 years old, David was alive when on November 5th, President Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, defeating Wendell Willkie of Indiana (a corporate lawyer). Roosevelt running for a third term was controversial. But the U.S. was emerging from the Great Recession and he promised that he would not involve the country in any foreign war (which of course changed when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor). Roosevelt defeated Willkie in the popular vote by 54.7 to 44.8% and in the Electoral College 449 to 82.\n\nIn 1962, David was 63 years old when on February 20th, Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr. became the first American to orbit the Earth. The Friendship 7 flew three times around the earth in 4 hours and 55 minutes. At age 77, Glenn returned to space - the oldest person to fly in space.\n\nIn 1971, in the year of David King's passing, in March, Congress passed the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age to 18 (from 21). It was a response to the criticism that men could fight at 18, but not vote for the policies and politicians who sent them to war. The states quickly ratified the Amendment and it was signed into law on July 1st by President Richard Nixon."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/david-king-birth-1940-death-1968/27734641", "page_content": "We All Deserve to be Remembered: AncientFaces - 20 years in 2020\n\nHow in the world is it that when our loved ones die we have only their social media accounts to remember them by?

According to the Bible, David grew up in the rugged Judean hills around the Israelite town of Bethlehem, a few miles south of what was then the Canaanite stronghold of Jerusalem. At the time, Israel was threatened by other peoples in the region, especially the Philistines, who occupied the Mediterranean coastal plain to the west. What was David\u2019s early life like? David was the youngest of eight sons of Jesse, a farmer and sheep breeder of the Israelite tribe of Judah. David likely spent much of his boyhood tending his family\u2019s flock. One day he was summoned from the fields by the prophet Samuel, who anointed him king of Israel while Saul was still king. What did David do for a living? As a youth, David distinguished himself as a musician and warrior. This gained him the attention of King Saul, for whom he played the harp and fought the Philistines. David\u2019s popularity aroused the king\u2019s jealousy. After Saul tried to kill him, David fled and became a leader of outlaws. When Saul died, David became king. What did David achieve? As Israel\u2019s second king, David built a small empire. He conquered Jerusalem, which he made Israel\u2019s political and religious centre. He defeated the Philistines so thoroughly that they never seriously threatened the Israelites\u2019 security again, and he annexed the coastal region. He went on to become the overlord of many small kingdoms bordering Israel.\n\nDavid, (flourished c. 1000 bce), second ruler of the united kingdom of ancient Israel and Judah. He founded the Judaean dynasty and united all the tribes of Israel under a single monarch. His son Solomon expanded the empire that David built. David is an important figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nEarly life David slaying Goliath According to 1 Samuel, David was the youngest son of Jesse, a man of Bethlehem, and served as a shepherd for his father before beginning his career as an aide at the court of Saul, Israel\u2019s first king. When Israel came into conflict with the Philistines, a people from a neighbouring region, David\u2019s brothers went to fight for King Saul. Young David would travel back and forth to the camp to bring his brothers food and supplies. According to 1 Samuel 17, Goliath, a heavily armed Philistine giant, challenged Saul for 40 days to send out a man to fight him. No one would face this warrior until David, armed only with a sling and stones, volunteered. David hit the giant in the forehead with a stone and killed him. He continued to distinguish himself as a warrior in the ongoing battles against the Philistines, and his resultant popularity aroused Saul\u2019s jealousy. Fearing that the people would make David king, Saul plotted to kill him. With the help of his loyal friend Jonathan, Saul\u2019s eldest son, David fled into southern Judah and Philistia, on the coastal plain of Palestine, where, with great sagacity and foresight, he began to lay the foundations of his career. As an outlaw with a price on his head, David led the life of a Robin Hood on the desert frontier of his tribal domain in Judah (in the south of the Levant). He became the leader and organizer of a group of other outlaws and refugees, who progressively ingratiated themselves with the local population by protecting them from other bandits or, in case they had been raided, by pursuing the raiders and restoring the possessions that had been taken. Although the boy David was anointed by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16), his actions in exile helped ensure that he would be \u201cinvited\u201d to become king as the true successor of Saul after Saul and Jonathan were slain in battle against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-I", "page_content": "father Malcolm III Canmore mother Saint Margaret of Scotland brother Alexander I brother Edgar ...(Show more)\n\nDavid I, (born c. 1082\u2014died May 24, 1153, Carlisle, Cumberland, Eng.), one of the most powerful Scottish kings (reigned from 1124). He admitted into Scotland an Anglo-French (Norman) aristocracy that played a major part in the later history of the kingdom. He also reorganized Scottish Christianity to conform with continental European and English usages and founded many religious communities, mostly for Cistercian monks and Augustinian canons.\n\nThe youngest of the six sons of the Scottish king Malcolm III Canmore and Queen Margaret (afterward St. Margaret), David spent much of his early life at the court of his brother-in-law King Henry I of England. Through David\u2019s marriage (1113) to a daughter of Waltheof, earl of Northumbria, he acquired the English earldom of Huntingdon and obtained much land in that county and in Northamptonshire. With Anglo-Norman help, David secured from his brother Alexander I, king of Scots from 1107, the right to rule Cumbria, Strathclyde, and part of Lothian. In April 1124, on the death of Alexander, David became king of Scots.\n\nBritannica Quiz Medieval History Quiz: Part One\n\nDavid recognized his niece, the Holy Roman empress Matilda (died 1167), as heir to Henry I in England, and from 1136 he fought for her against King Stephen (crowned as Henry\u2019s successor in December 1135), hoping thereby to gain Northumberland for himself. A brief peace made with Stephen in 1136 resulted in the cession of Cumberland to David and the transfer of Huntingdon to his son Earl Henry. David, however, continued to switch sides. While fighting for Matilda again, he was defeated in the Battle of the Standard, near Northallerton, Yorkshire (Aug. 22, 1138). He then made peace once more with Stephen, who in 1139 granted Northumberland (as an English fief) to Earl Henry. In 1141 David reentered the war on Matilda\u2019s behalf, and in 1149 he knighted her son Henry Plantagenet (afterward King Henry II of England), who acknowledged David\u2019s right to Northumberland.\n\nIn Scotland, David created a rudimentary central administration, issued the first Scottish royal coinage, and built or rebuilt the castles around which grew the first Scottish burghs: Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, Roxburgh, and perhaps Perth. As ruler of Cumbria he had taken Anglo-Normans into his service, and during his kingship many others settled in Scotland, founding important families and intermarrying with the older Scottish aristocracy. Bruce, Stewart, Comyn, and Oliphant are among the noted names whose bearers went from northern France to England during the Norman Conquest in 1066 and then to Scotland in the reign of David I. To these and other French-speaking immigrants, David granted land in return for specified military service or contributions of money, as had been done in England from the time of the Conquest."}, {"url": "https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/david-king.htm", "page_content": "David King's About \u270e]\n\nDavid King was born on March 7, 1972 (age 51) in Australia.

Only an unlikely win this weekend would prevent them claiming a second straight wooden spoon.\n\nClarkson will be the fourth coach in five years at North Melbourne, returning to the club where he played 93 matches between 1987-1995.\n\n\"I can't speak highly enough of the professionalism of Alastair and his manager James Henderson over this past four weeks,\" club president Sonja Hood wrote in a letter to members.\n\nClarkson call a huge blow for Bombers\n\n\"We've had a crash course in getting to know each other and Alastair's passion to drive our club back to where we belong is incredibly infectious.\n\n\"Today is a good day.
