Everyone was told they were just motorcycle racers, not Nazis. With the 70th anniversary of that incredible event I decided to find out if that was true or not.\n\n\u201cI uncovered a lot of information that you just couldn\u2019t make up. 1939 at the TT was a complete Nazi propaganda operation organised on paramilitary lines. All three teams were involved in it- BMW, NSU and DKW.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was run by a leading Nazi party official on the Isle of Man who was masquerading as the representative of the German equivalent of the Auto- Cycle Union, which was actually just an adjunct to a paramilitary organisation called the National Socialist Motorized Transport Corps- a Nazi party run organisation.\n\n\"1939 at the Isle of Man TT was a complete Nazi propaganda operation organised on paramilitary lines.\" Roger Willis \u201cAll German motorcycle racers had to belong to this organisation and its purpose was to train dispatch riders and drivers from the German army with the aim of to motorising the German military. Most of the transport at the time was still horse drawn carts and they needed more drivers. It was all about training the army and the races were a propaganda element. They made the organisation attractive to belong to because all the racers were in it.\n\n\u201cThis meant that all international motorcycle sporting events which the Germans participated in were run as propaganda operations and it culminated here at the TT in 1939. It\u2019s amazing to think that only 3 months before the beginning of the war the Isle of Man was hosting a group of German Nazis. Everybody knew we were going to war so the atmosphere must have been incredibly strange, made even stranger when the German\u2019s won. At the time the TT was regarded as the premier motorcycle event in the world so to win was a big feather in Hitler\u2019s cap.\n\n\u201cSome of those riders had been to the Island before and one of them, a leading Nazi activist, had won the Light Weight TT in 1938. His name was Ewald Kluge and he went to prison after the war because of his Nazi connections. He was in jail until 1949.\n\nBook Cover for 'The Nazi TT' \u201cNone of the competitors wore uniforms at the TT but when they raced in Germany they wore full military uniforms. The only sign of the Nazi associations at the TT was the swastika insignia on the leathers of the riders.\n\n\u201cIn the book I tried to follow what happened to all the individuals through the war and then what happened to the after the war. Some of the German riders raced again and of course some of them didn\u2019t survive the war.\n\n\u201cBritain went to war on September 3rd, 3 months after that TT event. The atmosphere at the races would have been really weird especially when the winning German riders performed the Nazi salute on the podium.\u201d\n\nThe Nazi TT by Roger Willis is available in all good bookshops."}, {"url": "https://www.carolenash.com/news/bike-news/detail/rider-of-the-week-freddie-frith", "page_content": "Rider Of The Week focuses on an exceptional rider and Freddie Frith was up there with the greatest. Known as \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019 Frith gained a reputation for being a stylish and skilled racer. His accomplishments include winning the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and becoming the first 350cc World Champion.\n\nEarly days\n\nFrith was born in Grimsby in 1909 and came from a well-known stonemason family. He inherited his motorcycle enthusiasm from his dad, even though he started working in the family business. He went on to become a motorbike retailer in his hometown, but he always had a need to be on the road.\n\nRacing career\n\nFrith managed to earn a sponsorship from Nigel Spring, who was part of a family known for owning a jam and curd factory. His first ride occurred in the Isle of Man at the 1930 Manx Grand Prix and he came third. The bike he rode was a 350 cc Velocette KTT. Frith enjoyed major success in 1935 when he won the Junior 350 cc.\n\nThis win inspired him to turn professional and he joined the Norton team in 1936. His success continued when he won the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record lap of 81.94 mph. He followed this up with a second place position in the Senior 500 cc race, losing out to Norton teammate Jimmie Guthrie. In 1937, Frith won the Senior TT, becoming the first man to lap the course at over ninety miles per hour.\n\nFrith served at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed in Keswick during WW2. He was set to participate in the 1947 TT, only to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder. This stopped him from racing, but he came back strong in 1948 and won the Junior race in the European championship.\n\nIn 1949, the Moto GP was created and it became Frith\u2019s most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first 350 cc World Champion.\n\nAt the end of the season, Frith retired, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix. In 1950, he received royal honours, being awarded the OBE for his service to motorcycle racing.\n\nVery few racers can claim to go out on the top of their career, but Frith was happy with the success that he\u2019d earned.

He also won the Dutch TT and the Belgian and Swiss GPs, and did not need to compete in the sixth and last race of the season (the Italian Grand Prix at Monza) having already won the Championship with maximum points.\n\n\n\nWinning the 350cc class of the FIM's inaugural World Championship was the pinnacle of Freddie Frith's career and he subsequently retired (he was by then 40 years old). He was honoured with an OBE by King George VI at the end of the year for 'services to British motorcycle racing' and 'British prestige' in general.\n\n\n\nThe works Velocettes of the late 1940s were based on the latest version of the company's immensely successful over-the-counter KTT racer: the MkVIII. With its deep petrol tank, massively finned overhead-camshaft engine and purposeful appearance, the MkVIII KTT is unquestionably one of the most beautiful racing motorcycles ever made. The talking point of Velocette's new racer on its introduction in 1939 was its swinging-arm rear suspension, an innovation first seen on the works bikes in 1936. By now tried and tested, the Velocette rear suspension comprised a pivoting fork made from tapered tubing and complemented by a pair of Dowty Oleomatic air-sprung struts. The rest of the cycle parts remained much as those of the rigid-framed MkVII.\n\n\n\nThe production Mk VIII's original engine, while basically the same as its MkVII predecessor's, incorporated a number of improvements intended to enhance power and reliability. The big-end bearing assembly had already been strengthened (after some failures on the earlier model) and despite the springer's increase in weight over the rigid machine, its superior performance and excellent handling made the MkVIII KTT a formidable competitor. Indeed, the production version differed little from the factory bikes that had dominated the 1938 Isle of Man Junior TT, Stanley Woods leading home team-mate Ted Mellors to break Norton's seven-year stranglehold on the event. Woods repeated his win the following year.\n\n\n\nDespite its pre-war design origins, the Nigel Spring-entered MkVIII KTT had proved good enough to provide Freddie Frith and Velocette with the 1948 Junior TT; however, in order to win the 350cc World Championship in 1949, a complete redesign of the valve gear was considered necessary. Velocette had first experimented with a double-overhead-camshaft (DOHC) cylinder head on the KTT-based factory bikes back in 1936 (courtesy of chief designer Charles Udall). The post-war revisit of the DOHC concept however, was instigated by Bertie Goodman, only son of company boss, Percy.\n\n\n\nThe principal advantage of the DOHC motor was its lighter and better-controlled valve gear, which enabled it to rev safely at 8,000rpm, as against the 7,200rpm maximum of the single-cam 'rocker' engines (though the latter were preferred at some circuits on account of their greater low-down torque). At 74mm x 81mm, the bore and stroke were the same as the standard KTT, but the DOHC 'double knocker' (an original term coined by team manager Harold Willis in the mid-1930s) differed considerably in its detail design. Special machined-all-over forged pistons were used while, in anticipation of higher revs, the exhaust valve was sodium-filled to dissipate heat. The post-war DOHC engines were also fitted with larger-than-standard Oldham couplings while at the same time (and for the same reason) the valve gear's vertical drive-shaft was waisted. As usual, there was the additional oil scavenge pump in the lower end of the timing cover, a normal practice on works machines, in an effort to minimise oil drag on the spinning crankshaft. For the first time since before the war there was extensive use of Elektron magnesium alloy and also, as with most of the Velocette TT and Grand Prix machines, larger capacity fuel tanks.\n\n\n\nAs well as being original thinkers, Velocette were masters of both chassis and engine development. After what can only be described as a very short 'teething' period, the engines were immediately producing significantly more power than the 'single-knockers' but with the - almost luxurious - added benefit of a turbine-smooth power delivery. On the circuit they were extremely quick, and Bertie's attention to detail clearly helped achieve this (as a good example, individual camshafts were carefully balanced with special counter-weights so as to avoid vibration within the gear trains). As with all the factory racers, a very large cylinder barrel was employed to improve cooling. In addition, to assist when climbing Snaefell Mountain at the Isle of Man TT, a batch of special gearboxes was produced, in Elektron magnesium alloy, employing modified internal ratios as used on the pre-war works machines.\n\n\n\nAccording to works mechanic Frank Panes' notes, '1046' was one of two experimental 350cc DOHC engines produced from scratch for the 1949 season. Bertie himself later stated that in total, six 350cc DOHC engines had been produced by the factory after the war (some having been converted from the earlier single-knocker works motors).\n\n\n\nWith most of Velocette Ltd's limited financial resources committed to developing the forthcoming LE model, the post-war racing effort was bankrolled by Castrol and supported by several dealers together with private entrants Nigel Spring and Dick Wilkins. Factory records show that the KTTs, which were to be ridden by Freddie Frith and Ken Bills, were invoiced to Nigel Spring on 20th May 1948 and delivered via the Premier Motor Company of Birmingham. Frith's machine was numbered 'SF114' (frame) and 'KTT 954' (engine), while Bills' was numbered 'SF129' and 'KTT 956' respectively. Interviewed by Motor Cycling in February 1948, Spring remarked that he had expected a couple of standard MkVIII KTTs, but was delighted to hear that Veloce had decided to build a limited number of special models, with 'hotted-up' engines. As works supported riders, Frith and Bills enjoyed the advantages of these special engines that had been modified by the factory. In the same Motor Cycling article, Bertie Goodman confirmed that four of these special KTTs had been made: two for the Spring \u00e9quipe, and one each for Bob Foster and David Whitworth.\n\n\n\nR M N Spring was proprietor of a preserves manufacturer ('Spring's Delights') based in Brigg, Lincolnshire where it operated a large fruit processing plant. He was also a pre-war Brooklands competitor, race winner, world record holder, tuner, and sponsor, so knew a thing or two about racing motorcycles. Another Lincolnshire man, and one of the few riders to win Isle of Man TT's both before and after the war, Freddie Frith first came to prominence in 1930 when he rode a Velocette to 3rd place in the inaugural Manx Grand Prix's Junior race. In 1935 he won the Junior Manx GP on a Norton, a ride that earned him a place in Bracebridge Street's works team for '36. Freddie Frith was an instant success at the higher level, winning the 1936 Junior TT and the Senior TT in 1937, during which he became the first man to lap the Mountain Course at over 90mph.\n\n\n\nHaving spent the war years as an Army motorcycle instructor, he was tempted back into the saddle in 1947 at the age of 38 but did not compete in that year's TT following a spill in practice on a Senior Moto-Guzzi. He joined the Spring stable for 1948, and the rest, as they say, is history. A quiet, modest man, referred to consistently by all as a 'real gentlemen' Freddie Frith retired at the end of the 1949 season and opened a motorcycle dealership in Grimsby, which traded successfully for many years. He died in 1988 aged 78 and is still remembered fondly in Lincolnshire as one of the county's greatest sporting heroes.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 1949 season, the special DOHC engines that had been on loan to Spring were returned to the factory, while the rest of the Frith Velocette, being Spring's personal property, was retained by him. (Apparently, at some point, possibly after being sold to a private owner, it was fitted with a standard KSS engine and used on the road).\n\n\n\nVelocette's exceedingly fast DOHC 350s raced on into 1950, Bob Foster winning the World Championship for the second year in succession for Hall Green, and these advanced engines were so good that they continued to be reused in more up-to-date cycle parts as development progressed. Fitted into lightweight 'low-boy' frames in 1951, they were once again raced by Foster (now in his final year) as well as up-and-coming new team members Cecil Sandford and Bill Lomas, whose machine ended up being fitted with the ex-Frith engine, 'L.IOM 68560.1046'.\n\n1951 would turn out to be the swansong of the full Velocette race team (in 1952 Veloce Ltd were only to enter a single rider - Les Graham - in international events) and the race shop was closed down soon afterwards.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, but as is so often the case with obsolescent racing machines, the works Velocettes were dismantled and the major components dispersed, their historic identities being lost in the short term. The special magnesium DOHC engines, which still retained the promise of a useful life, were all sold to private owners, and 'L.IOM 68560.1046' eventually found itself recycled into the Reynolds-framed Velocette originally built for Geoff Duke. This came about because the Duke Reynolds Velocette had been acquired as a rolling chassis by the Australian Hinton Brothers, minus its original single-knocker engine. As the Hinton's also by now owned the ex-Lomas low-boy works Velocette, they wasted no time in transferring the ultra-quick ex-Frith motor, 'L.IOM 68560.1046', into the Duke machine.\n\n\n\nHaving gone down separate paths for so many years, frame and engine have now been reunited, and the ex-Frith 350cc motor, having changed hands a multitude of times in the intervening years, has been rebuilt by the world's leading authority on the Velocette marque. Since the rebuild's completion, this beautiful historic Velocette has been ridden on the Isle of Man TT Parade Lap, at the Assen Classic TT, and at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Presented in sound order, this turbine-smooth, docile yet exceptionally fast motorcycle is ready to parade or even race. Accompanying documentation consists of period photographs, copies of factory records, Velocette Owners Club works record extract, engine specification details, and various magazine articles.\n\n\n\nExceptional motorcycles with important race history seldom come to market, let alone ultra-rare factory racers such as that offered here, so this multiple Grand Prix-winning works DOHC KTT, originally ridden to such success by one of the sport's most iconic World Champions, represents a unique opportunity, of enormous significance for collectors, to own a genuine World Championship-winning Velocette."}, {"url": "https://www.motoridersuniverse.com/b1311411", "page_content": "1939 Isle of Man TT. motorcycle race #28\n\nAs war clouds gathered in 1939, the German government was determined to boost national prestige by dominating every international sporting event, and the TT races were no exception.

The BMWs had been very impressive in practice, with a top speed of 135mph, and deep down even the most patriotic British enthusiast knew the only real chances of home success were if the German machines both broke down or the weather was wet.\n\nUnfortunately for British pride, neither occurrence took place.\n\nIn dry conditions Meier led by almost a minute at the end of the first lap, with West and Velocette-mounted Woods tying on time for second.

Although Austin remained an amateur throughout his career, Freddie was to turn professional, with outstanding success. Later in their lives they both proved to be successful businessmen.\n\nAustin was the youngest son of Mr and Mrs A E Munks, and his father was blacksmith of the Highgate. He was obviously always interested in speed, and started racing locally on grass and at proper hard tracks, Donington Park being the nearest. His first Isle of Man Manx Grand Prix victory came in 1933, when he won the Junior (350cc) on a Velocette \u2013 he had finished third in the Junior class on his Velocette the previous year. Three years later, in 1936, he was the first man ever to win the double, the Junior and the Senior (500cc) on Velocette and Norton machines respectively. After the war, in 1947, Austin was to secure his final Manx Grand Prix victory, winning the Lightweight class (250cc) on a Moto Guzzi, with an average speed of seventy miles per hour, setting a new record lap of 72.54mph.\n\nAustin was not only interested in motorcycle racing, flying aircraft was another of his passions. He learned to fly and obtained his pilot\u2019s licence in 1933. He owned his own aircraft, and flew it from a strip belonging to the Bowser family at Hurn End. He became friendly with Alex Henshaw CBE, a former test pilot, and they both used this strip.\n\nAustin was to suffer a terrible shooting accident during October 1935. While he was out with an organised shoot at Asterby, one stray pellet was to hit him in his left eye, causing him to lose his sight from that eye. But this setback obviously did not slow down his racing brain, and he went on to notch up his remarkable double Manx Grand Prix wins the following year. After this he retired from racing, and of course the outbreak of the Second World War was soon to follow.\n\nWhen the hostilities ceased he was to get itchy feet again and have a crack at the race he had previously not won on the Isle of Man, the lightweight class of the Manx Grand Prix. So he bought a motorcycle of Italian manufacture, a Moto Guzzi, and the only way he could get it back was to fly to Italy himself. So off to Milan he flew in his Auster aircraft and picked up the dismantled machine \u2013 a good story he could surely tell about that experience. The machine was re-assembled by his very good friend and mechanic, Sammy Coupland of Frithville, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAfter this he did finally retire from racing, and he was to sponsor a couple of local lads who were to make names for themselves in the sport. First it was R H (Dickie) Dale, from Wyberton. Dickie went on to win the following year\u2019s Lightweight Manx Grand Prix (1948) on the same machine, Austin\u2019s Motto Guzzi, setting an average speed of 73.36mph, and a new record lap of 74.36 in the process. Dickie was to go on and enjoy a successful career in the sport riding first for the Norton works team, then followed by spells in various continental teams, including Gilera, Benelli, MV Agusta, BMW, and Moto Guzzi (where he was especially noted for his rides on the 500cc V8 model) teams. Unfortunately he was to lose his life after a crash at the Nurburgring, Germany, in 1961.\n\nDickie was followed by Bernard Codd from Wrangle, who still farmed there until his recent death last July. Starting in trials riding, he also proved to be successful in the Isle of Man. Winning the Clubman\u2019s Tourist Trophy double (350 and 500cc), he was the only man to achieve this unique double, during the last year these classes were held, 1956.\n\nHe was certainly a force to be reckoned with on the short circuit scene in this country. A serious crash at Crystal Palace the following year ended a very promising career. Unfortunately, he suffered a serious break to his right leg, and was bed bound for a year. The latest technology for treating such injuries had not reached these parts of the country in those days.\n\nFrederick Lee (Freddie) Frith, was born in Grimsby, into a reputable monumental and stonemason family. Like his father, who was a keen motorcyclist, he had the urge for speed. He was to enjoy the sponsorship of Nigel Spring, of the Spring family from Brigg \u2013 famous for their jam and curd factory.\n\nFrom 1936 until the outbreak of World War II he rode works machines provided by the Norton factory, and later, Velocette. He always held the reputation of being a very stylish rider, and gained such quotes from the press of the day as \u2018chivalrous\u2019 and \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019. His first ride in the Isle of Man was in the 1930 Manx Grand Prix, in which he was to finish third in the Junior race on a Velocette. His first win came in 1935, when he won the Junior (350cc) race \u2013 he had previously finished second to Austin in the 1933 Junior. The following year he turned professional and joined the works Norton team, with immediate success. He won, on his first attempt, the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record, and record lap at 81.94mph, making him the first man to lap the famous course at over eighty miles per hour for the Junior class. And he followed this up with a second place in the Senior (500cc) to his Norton teammate, Jimmie Guthrie. Later that season he was to go on to win the Junior (350cc class) European championship. The 1937 senior TT was to be a memorable race for Freddie; not only did he win it, but he was the first rider ever to lap the famous TT course at over ninety miles per hour (90.27mph) on his works Norton. By this time the German and Italian supercharged machines were becoming a real threat to the British manufacturers in the European championships, with George Meier winning both the 1938 and 1939 Senior class on his BMW. The 1939 Ulster Grand Prix was the last race before the Second World War intervened. In this Freddie finished second in the Senior class on his Norton, to Italian, Dorino Serafini, who was Gilera mounted.\n\nDuring the war Freddie served in the army, at the infantry driving and maintenance school at Keswick, reaching the rank of sergeant. At the first TT after the war in 1947, Freddie had secured a ride on a Moto Guzzi in the senior class. But he was to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder, and was unable to race. In the 1948 season Freddie was back on British machinery, this time Velocette. He went on to win the Junior class in the European championship that year.\n\nIn 1949 the World Championships, now known as Moto GP, was born. There were four classes for solo machines, 125cc Ultra-Lightweight, 250cc Lightweight, 350cc Junior and 500cc Senior, and one for 600cc sidecars. It was to turn out for Freddie to be his most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle Of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first ever 350cc World Champion. He was to retire at the end of that season, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix, and setting a new record lap speed of 90.60mph in the process. When Royal honours were announced the following year (1950), Freddie was honoured for his efforts, by being awarded the OBE for his services to the sport. This made him the first person ever to receive a Royal honour for motorcycling. Geoff Duke was the next to follow him, and receive the same honour.\n\nBoth Austin and Freddie were able to prove, beyond their motorcycling endeavours, that they could run successful businesses. Austin ran his motor garage at Leverton Highgate from the 1930s and was soon to obtain the very successful Jaguar car agency. He was later to add Daimler and later still Austin/Rover to the list. On his death on 29th January 1981, he left the business to his workers. He also had a collection of vintage motorcycles, his favourite being a 1939 Brough Superior. It was later sold at a Bonham\u2019s sale to an American collector for \u00a342,200, well above the \u00a330\u201335,000 estimate.\n\nFreddie also owned his own successful business, a motorcycle sales and repair outlet, run from the family\u2019s original stonemason premises in Victoria Street, Grimsby, now unfortunately demolished. He was the agent for various leading manufacturers, including BMW, and was very successful for many years. He died on 24th May 1988.\n\nThese two true gentlemen have both been great ambassadors for their chosen sport and the county of Lincolnshire. We can only guess at what might have happened if the war had not interrupted their respective careers, but they have both left us with their own unique memories. The famous (or infamous) Isle of Man TT course certainly held no fears for either of these two intrepid Lincolnshire yellowbellies.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nThe Story of the Manx G S Davison (The TT.

A former stonemason and later a motor cycle retailer in Grimsby, he was a stylish rider and five times winner of the Isle of Man TT. Frith had the distinction of being one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War.\n\nHe entered his first major race, the first Manx Grand Prix in 1930 riding an over-the counter, 350 cc Velocette KTT in the Junior event, finishing third at a speed of 60.34 mph. He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place.\n\nHe won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT Races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course.\n\nAfter finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948 he won the Junior Race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350cc World Champion in 1949 when, he won all five events of the inaugural campaign.\n\nFrith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War 2 at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country.

With 265 corners in 37.73 miles (60.66km) the Isle of Man Mountain circuit is the most physically punishing and mechanically exacting in the world. The route passes through three sleepy villages and one seaside town, climbs over 1,000ft (300 metres) in less than a mile (1.6 km) and reaches 1384ft (454 metres) over Snaefell Mountain.\n\nIn spite of travelling at speeds over 180mph (290 km/h), there is no point at which the rider can see as far as one mile (1.6 km) ahead. And the straight parts are far from smooth, testing a bike\u2019s suspension to the limit.\n\nPretty white-walled cottages and winding country roads bordered by stone walls, picturesque pubs and leafy glades are all part of the TT. On what other racetrack do riders cross roundabouts, go through traffic lights, power down suburban streets at full throttle with the front doors of terraced houses just centimetres away? Where else do racers count tramlines, telegraph poles and farm animals as normal hazards?\n\nThe first TT took place on 28 May 1907 with 13 single cylinder machines competing for a silver statue of the Greek god Mercury, complete with winged helmet. A separate class for multi-cylinder machines attracted six entries. Riders set off in pairs to race against the clock \u2013 a feature of future TTs.\n\nThe famous 37.73-mile Mountain course was first used in 1911 and BMW first contested the Isle of Man TT \u2013 which had become the most important race in the world \u2013 in 1937. But it didn\u2019t look like the Bavarians were taking it too seriously. Their rider was Jock West, who worked for Frazer Nash, the BMW sports car importer. West was a good racer, but not in the same league as Norton works rider Freddie Frith, or Velocette\u2019s Stanley Woods. And West didn\u2019t speak German, which meant communicating with his mechanic wasn\u2019t easy!\n\nWith plunger rear suspension and advanced telescopic forks the oil-tight BMW gleamed with a showroom finish and drew admiring glances from everyone \u2013 especially when West showed how well it handled. The compact Zoller supercharger evened up the odds over the British singles and better riders.\n\nWest was making the best of his 50 hp, holding fourth place for the first four laps until his petrol tank split and he ran out of gas at Governor\u2019s Bridge. He pushed in for more petrol. He had to take on more gas on the sixth lap, but still finished an incredible sixth at 81.3mph. Frith won at 88.21mph. West didn\u2019t make the podium, but BMW had high hopes for 1938.\n\nBMW\u2019s star rider Karl Gall, Georg Meier and West spent two weeks in April preparing for the June races the following year. But with more powerful engines the handling seemed to suffer. Meier crashed in practice, escaping with bruises and a battered ego. And Gall crashed heavily when he was riding the wrong way round the course, to meet technicians who were going to set up his carburetion on the Mountain mile. He spent the next weeks in Ramsey hospital.\n\nIn the Senior TT, Meier went out before finishing a single lap \u2013 his magneto failed at the bottom of Bray Hill. Jock West held onto fifth place for all seven laps, finishing just 4 min 36 sec slower than the winning Norton. He had been told to finish at all costs, so never rode all-out.\n\nGall, Meier and West were back for the 1939 TT, but the results were bitter sweet for BMW. Gall crashed again in practice and was taken once again to Ramsey hospital. He was operated on by BMW\u2019s own surgeon, but died on the eve of the Senior TT.\n\nMeier was on a mission. With a whispered 70 hp and a top speed of 140mph (225 km/h) available from the supercharged twin (at 137kg the BMW was also the lightest Senior bike) he simply blasted the opposition into the weeds.\n\nGeorg set a new race record at 89.38mph (143 km/h), with Jock coming home second at 88.22mph (141 km/h). There was no doubt that if Gall had not crashed it would have been a BMW 1-2-3. The supercharged Boxers were simply years ahead of the opposition.\n\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale Motorcycliste (FIM) banned superchargers in 1946, which meant that BMW\u2019s solo racers were finished for the moment. But their sidecars were soon to rule the Mountain. Except for the use of direct petrol injection on early models, the Rennsport BMW was not exotic machinery.\n\nThe flat twin may not have been the most powerful engine, but it was perfect for sidecar racing. The engine had a low centre of gravity, ideal cooling, a nice spread of power, and reliable shaft-drive. The list of drivers who have won a TT thanks to BMW power reads like a \u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 of racing greats: Schneider, Hillebrand, Fath, Deubel, Camathias, Scheidegger, Schauzu and Enders.\n\nThe Rennsport twin, developed by Alex von Falkenhausen, monopolised the TT for the next 20 years and the grip of the flat-twin BMW engine continued until 1974, when Yamaha two-stroke power screamed out the Boxers in the smaller class \u2013 although German driver Luthringhauser still won the race. The last BMW sidecar victory was in 1975, when Schauzu won the new 1000cc class.\n\nBut then along came Helmut D\u00e4hne, one of the most popular heroes to race in the Production TT in the seventies. The tall, lanky German won his army of fans because was a true enthusiast who prepared his own bike, rode it all the way from Munich to the Island, raced it over the Mountain, and then rode it home again.\n\nAt first glance, his Isle of Man bike looked like an ordinary R 90 S, but the chassis was basically a stock short wheelbase R 75/5 with the same forks and rear shock absorbers as the road bikes.\n\nBut the engine was a very special R 90 S, fitted with high compression pistons, race cams and bigger valves, titanium con rods, close ratio gears, a deeper sump to carry more oil, big bore carbs and a race exhaust system. But this was no factory special \u2013 D\u00e4hne built his bike himself.\n\nIn 1974 he finished third in the 1000cc Production TT behind fellow German Hans-Otto Butenuth on another BMW, with Brit Mick Grant on the Triumph Trident Slippery Sam in first place. A year later D\u00e4hne was back and leading the 362-km six-lap race when a stone punched a hole through the right-side rocker box cover and he lost so much oil that the engine seized.\n\nIt was the only time he failed to finish a race. The rocker box had been worn thin by D\u00e4hne\u2019s enthusiastic cornering, and in later years he raced with a spare strapped to the frame under the seat.\n\nHe finally won a TT in 1976 when Butenuth partnered him in the 10-lap 1000cc Production race. Close to the end of his final practice session, a loose valve seat caused the exhaust valve to break, badly damaging the cylinder head and he had no spares. Any other rider would have retired, but D\u00e4hne asked a BMW rider who was watching the racing if he could borrow his cylinder head, and the rest is history. It was an amazing result for a part-time racer on a bike that everyone thought would be no match for the Laverda triples and Ducati V-twins.\n\nThe TT lost its grand prix status in 1976. But the Isle of Man\u2019s popularity with race fans has never waned and crowds still make the crossing over the Irish Sea every June. And the racing is never short of thrills.\n\nMichael Dunlop currently holds the outright lap record, with a 133.962mph (215.591km/h) lap on a BMW S 1000 RR, as well as the Superbike TT lap record 133.393mph (214.675km/h) on a BMW, while Ian Hutchinson also holds the Superstock TT record on a BMW S 1000 RR at 133.098mph (214.200km/h).\n\nAt the 2017 Isle of Man TT BMW riders finished 1-2-3-4 led by Ian Hutchinson.\n\nLink \u2013 Isle of Man TT Official"}], "Freddie Frith was the first rider to win Senior TT twice in succession.": [{"url": "https://www.devittinsurance.com/guides/motorcycle-racing/isle-of-man-tt/course-history/", "page_content": "TT Milestones\n\nThere\u2019s no surprise that the Isle of Man TT has some impressive milestones set over the last 100 years\u2026\n\n1904 \u2013 Motor racing comes to the Isle of Man as the Gordon Bennett car trials are held.

Although Austin remained an amateur throughout his career, Freddie was to turn professional, with outstanding success. Later in their lives they both proved to be successful businessmen.\n\nAustin was the youngest son of Mr and Mrs A E Munks, and his father was blacksmith of the Highgate. He was obviously always interested in speed, and started racing locally on grass and at proper hard tracks, Donington Park being the nearest. His first Isle of Man Manx Grand Prix victory came in 1933, when he won the Junior (350cc) on a Velocette \u2013 he had finished third in the Junior class on his Velocette the previous year. Three years later, in 1936, he was the first man ever to win the double, the Junior and the Senior (500cc) on Velocette and Norton machines respectively. After the war, in 1947, Austin was to secure his final Manx Grand Prix victory, winning the Lightweight class (250cc) on a Moto Guzzi, with an average speed of seventy miles per hour, setting a new record lap of 72.54mph.\n\nAustin was not only interested in motorcycle racing, flying aircraft was another of his passions. He learned to fly and obtained his pilot\u2019s licence in 1933. He owned his own aircraft, and flew it from a strip belonging to the Bowser family at Hurn End. He became friendly with Alex Henshaw CBE, a former test pilot, and they both used this strip.\n\nAustin was to suffer a terrible shooting accident during October 1935. While he was out with an organised shoot at Asterby, one stray pellet was to hit him in his left eye, causing him to lose his sight from that eye. But this setback obviously did not slow down his racing brain, and he went on to notch up his remarkable double Manx Grand Prix wins the following year. After this he retired from racing, and of course the outbreak of the Second World War was soon to follow.\n\nWhen the hostilities ceased he was to get itchy feet again and have a crack at the race he had previously not won on the Isle of Man, the lightweight class of the Manx Grand Prix. So he bought a motorcycle of Italian manufacture, a Moto Guzzi, and the only way he could get it back was to fly to Italy himself. So off to Milan he flew in his Auster aircraft and picked up the dismantled machine \u2013 a good story he could surely tell about that experience. The machine was re-assembled by his very good friend and mechanic, Sammy Coupland of Frithville, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAfter this he did finally retire from racing, and he was to sponsor a couple of local lads who were to make names for themselves in the sport. First it was R H (Dickie) Dale, from Wyberton. Dickie went on to win the following year\u2019s Lightweight Manx Grand Prix (1948) on the same machine, Austin\u2019s Motto Guzzi, setting an average speed of 73.36mph, and a new record lap of 74.36 in the process. Dickie was to go on and enjoy a successful career in the sport riding first for the Norton works team, then followed by spells in various continental teams, including Gilera, Benelli, MV Agusta, BMW, and Moto Guzzi (where he was especially noted for his rides on the 500cc V8 model) teams. Unfortunately he was to lose his life after a crash at the Nurburgring, Germany, in 1961.\n\nDickie was followed by Bernard Codd from Wrangle, who still farmed there until his recent death last July. Starting in trials riding, he also proved to be successful in the Isle of Man. Winning the Clubman\u2019s Tourist Trophy double (350 and 500cc), he was the only man to achieve this unique double, during the last year these classes were held, 1956.\n\nHe was certainly a force to be reckoned with on the short circuit scene in this country. A serious crash at Crystal Palace the following year ended a very promising career. Unfortunately, he suffered a serious break to his right leg, and was bed bound for a year. The latest technology for treating such injuries had not reached these parts of the country in those days.\n\nFrederick Lee (Freddie) Frith, was born in Grimsby, into a reputable monumental and stonemason family. Like his father, who was a keen motorcyclist, he had the urge for speed. He was to enjoy the sponsorship of Nigel Spring, of the Spring family from Brigg \u2013 famous for their jam and curd factory.\n\nFrom 1936 until the outbreak of World War II he rode works machines provided by the Norton factory, and later, Velocette. He always held the reputation of being a very stylish rider, and gained such quotes from the press of the day as \u2018chivalrous\u2019 and \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019. His first ride in the Isle of Man was in the 1930 Manx Grand Prix, in which he was to finish third in the Junior race on a Velocette. His first win came in 1935, when he won the Junior (350cc) race \u2013 he had previously finished second to Austin in the 1933 Junior. The following year he turned professional and joined the works Norton team, with immediate success. He won, on his first attempt, the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record, and record lap at 81.94mph, making him the first man to lap the famous course at over eighty miles per hour for the Junior class. And he followed this up with a second place in the Senior (500cc) to his Norton teammate, Jimmie Guthrie. Later that season he was to go on to win the Junior (350cc class) European championship. The 1937 senior TT was to be a memorable race for Freddie; not only did he win it, but he was the first rider ever to lap the famous TT course at over ninety miles per hour (90.27mph) on his works Norton. By this time the German and Italian supercharged machines were becoming a real threat to the British manufacturers in the European championships, with George Meier winning both the 1938 and 1939 Senior class on his BMW. The 1939 Ulster Grand Prix was the last race before the Second World War intervened. In this Freddie finished second in the Senior class on his Norton, to Italian, Dorino Serafini, who was Gilera mounted.\n\nDuring the war Freddie served in the army, at the infantry driving and maintenance school at Keswick, reaching the rank of sergeant. At the first TT after the war in 1947, Freddie had secured a ride on a Moto Guzzi in the senior class. But he was to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder, and was unable to race. In the 1948 season Freddie was back on British machinery, this time Velocette. He went on to win the Junior class in the European championship that year.\n\nIn 1949 the World Championships, now known as Moto GP, was born. There were four classes for solo machines, 125cc Ultra-Lightweight, 250cc Lightweight, 350cc Junior and 500cc Senior, and one for 600cc sidecars. It was to turn out for Freddie to be his most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle Of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first ever 350cc World Champion. He was to retire at the end of that season, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix, and setting a new record lap speed of 90.60mph in the process. When Royal honours were announced the following year (1950), Freddie was honoured for his efforts, by being awarded the OBE for his services to the sport. This made him the first person ever to receive a Royal honour for motorcycling. Geoff Duke was the next to follow him, and receive the same honour.\n\nBoth Austin and Freddie were able to prove, beyond their motorcycling endeavours, that they could run successful businesses. Austin ran his motor garage at Leverton Highgate from the 1930s and was soon to obtain the very successful Jaguar car agency. He was later to add Daimler and later still Austin/Rover to the list. On his death on 29th January 1981, he left the business to his workers. He also had a collection of vintage motorcycles, his favourite being a 1939 Brough Superior. It was later sold at a Bonham\u2019s sale to an American collector for \u00a342,200, well above the \u00a330\u201335,000 estimate.\n\nFreddie also owned his own successful business, a motorcycle sales and repair outlet, run from the family\u2019s original stonemason premises in Victoria Street, Grimsby, now unfortunately demolished. He was the agent for various leading manufacturers, including BMW, and was very successful for many years. He died on 24th May 1988.\n\nThese two true gentlemen have both been great ambassadors for their chosen sport and the county of Lincolnshire. We can only guess at what might have happened if the war had not interrupted their respective careers, but they have both left us with their own unique memories. The famous (or infamous) Isle of Man TT course certainly held no fears for either of these two intrepid Lincolnshire yellowbellies.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nThe Story of the Manx G S Davison (The TT.

Frith was one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War.[5] He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1950 Birthday Honours.[6]\n\nMotorcycle racing career\n\nFrith entered his first major race, the first Manx Grand Prix in 1930 riding an over-the counter, 350 cc Velocette KTT in the Junior event, finishing third at a speed of 60.34 mph. He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place.[7]\n\nHe won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT Races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course.\n\nAfter finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948 he won the Junior Race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie was the first ever 350cc World Champion in 1949, winning all five events of the inaugural campaign, using a single-overhead-camshaft engine in the Ulster race.\n\nFrith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War 2 at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country. Sgt. Freddie Frith taught teams of four on Norton 500s over Skiddaw in all weathers. A special treat on the last day was reserved for roadwork, following Frith's track-style fast cornering.\n\nMotorcycle Grand Prix results\n\n1949 point system\n\nPosition 1 2 3 4 5 Fastest lap Points 10 8 7 6 5 1\n\n(key) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nYear Class Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 Points Rank Wins 1949 350cc Velocette IOM\n\n1 SUI\n\n1 NED\n\n1 BEL\n\n1 ULS\n\n1 33 1st 5 500cc Velocette IOM\n\nNC SUI\n\n5 NED\n\n- BEL\n\n- ULS\n\n- NAT\n\n- 5 11th 0"}, {"url": "https://dbpedia.org/page/Freddie_Frith", "page_content": "dbo: abstract \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062b (\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0629: Freddie Frith)\u200f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0625\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a \u0641\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0628\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629. \u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0641\u0626\u0629 500 \u0633\u064a \u0633\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0641\u0626\u0629 350 \u0633\u064a \u0633\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0641\u0626\u0629 50 \u0633\u064a \u0633\u064a. \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0623\u0633 \u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629.

Known as \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019 Frith gained a reputation for being a stylish and skilled racer. His accomplishments include winning the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and becoming the first 350cc World Champion.\n\nEarly days\n\nFrith was born in Grimsby in 1909 and came from a well-known stonemason family. He inherited his motorcycle enthusiasm from his dad, even though he started working in the family business. He went on to become a motorbike retailer in his hometown, but he always had a need to be on the road.\n\nRacing career\n\nFrith managed to earn a sponsorship from Nigel Spring, who was part of a family known for owning a jam and curd factory. His first ride occurred in the Isle of Man at the 1930 Manx Grand Prix and he came third. The bike he rode was a 350 cc Velocette KTT. Frith enjoyed major success in 1935 when he won the Junior 350 cc.\n\nThis win inspired him to turn professional and he joined the Norton team in 1936. His success continued when he won the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record lap of 81.94 mph. He followed this up with a second place position in the Senior 500 cc race, losing out to Norton teammate Jimmie Guthrie. In 1937, Frith won the Senior TT, becoming the first man to lap the course at over ninety miles per hour.\n\nFrith served at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed in Keswick during WW2. He was set to participate in the 1947 TT, only to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder. This stopped him from racing, but he came back strong in 1948 and won the Junior race in the European championship.\n\nIn 1949, the Moto GP was created and it became Frith\u2019s most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first 350 cc World Champion.\n\nAt the end of the season, Frith retired, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix. In 1950, he received royal honours, being awarded the OBE for his service to motorcycle racing.\n\nVery few racers can claim to go out on the top of their career, but Frith was happy with the success that he\u2019d earned. He passed away in 1988, having lived a satisfying life."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/freddie-frith/biography", "page_content": "Freddie Frith Biography\n\nBritish motorcycle racer\n\nFrederick Lee Frith OBE (30 May 1909 \u2013 24 May 1988 Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England) was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racing world champion.

He also won the Dutch TT and the Belgian and Swiss GPs, and did not need to compete in the sixth and last race of the season (the Italian Grand Prix at Monza) having already won the Championship with maximum points.\n\n\n\nWinning the 350cc class of the FIM's inaugural World Championship was the pinnacle of Freddie Frith's career and he subsequently retired (he was by then 40 years old). He was honoured with an OBE by King George VI at the end of the year for 'services to British motorcycle racing' and 'British prestige' in general.\n\n\n\nThe works Velocettes of the late 1940s were based on the latest version of the company's immensely successful over-the-counter KTT racer: the MkVIII. With its deep petrol tank, massively finned overhead-camshaft engine and purposeful appearance, the MkVIII KTT is unquestionably one of the most beautiful racing motorcycles ever made. The talking point of Velocette's new racer on its introduction in 1939 was its swinging-arm rear suspension, an innovation first seen on the works bikes in 1936. By now tried and tested, the Velocette rear suspension comprised a pivoting fork made from tapered tubing and complemented by a pair of Dowty Oleomatic air-sprung struts. The rest of the cycle parts remained much as those of the rigid-framed MkVII.\n\n\n\nThe production Mk VIII's original engine, while basically the same as its MkVII predecessor's, incorporated a number of improvements intended to enhance power and reliability. The big-end bearing assembly had already been strengthened (after some failures on the earlier model) and despite the springer's increase in weight over the rigid machine, its superior performance and excellent handling made the MkVIII KTT a formidable competitor. Indeed, the production version differed little from the factory bikes that had dominated the 1938 Isle of Man Junior TT, Stanley Woods leading home team-mate Ted Mellors to break Norton's seven-year stranglehold on the event. Woods repeated his win the following year.\n\n\n\nDespite its pre-war design origins, the Nigel Spring-entered MkVIII KTT had proved good enough to provide Freddie Frith and Velocette with the 1948 Junior TT; however, in order to win the 350cc World Championship in 1949, a complete redesign of the valve gear was considered necessary. Velocette had first experimented with a double-overhead-camshaft (DOHC) cylinder head on the KTT-based factory bikes back in 1936 (courtesy of chief designer Charles Udall). The post-war revisit of the DOHC concept however, was instigated by Bertie Goodman, only son of company boss, Percy.\n\n\n\nThe principal advantage of the DOHC motor was its lighter and better-controlled valve gear, which enabled it to rev safely at 8,000rpm, as against the 7,200rpm maximum of the single-cam 'rocker' engines (though the latter were preferred at some circuits on account of their greater low-down torque). At 74mm x 81mm, the bore and stroke were the same as the standard KTT, but the DOHC 'double knocker' (an original term coined by team manager Harold Willis in the mid-1930s) differed considerably in its detail design. Special machined-all-over forged pistons were used while, in anticipation of higher revs, the exhaust valve was sodium-filled to dissipate heat. The post-war DOHC engines were also fitted with larger-than-standard Oldham couplings while at the same time (and for the same reason) the valve gear's vertical drive-shaft was waisted. As usual, there was the additional oil scavenge pump in the lower end of the timing cover, a normal practice on works machines, in an effort to minimise oil drag on the spinning crankshaft. For the first time since before the war there was extensive use of Elektron magnesium alloy and also, as with most of the Velocette TT and Grand Prix machines, larger capacity fuel tanks.\n\n\n\nAs well as being original thinkers, Velocette were masters of both chassis and engine development. After what can only be described as a very short 'teething' period, the engines were immediately producing significantly more power than the 'single-knockers' but with the - almost luxurious - added benefit of a turbine-smooth power delivery. On the circuit they were extremely quick, and Bertie's attention to detail clearly helped achieve this (as a good example, individual camshafts were carefully balanced with special counter-weights so as to avoid vibration within the gear trains). As with all the factory racers, a very large cylinder barrel was employed to improve cooling. In addition, to assist when climbing Snaefell Mountain at the Isle of Man TT, a batch of special gearboxes was produced, in Elektron magnesium alloy, employing modified internal ratios as used on the pre-war works machines.\n\n\n\nAccording to works mechanic Frank Panes' notes, '1046' was one of two experimental 350cc DOHC engines produced from scratch for the 1949 season. Bertie himself later stated that in total, six 350cc DOHC engines had been produced by the factory after the war (some having been converted from the earlier single-knocker works motors).\n\n\n\nWith most of Velocette Ltd's limited financial resources committed to developing the forthcoming LE model, the post-war racing effort was bankrolled by Castrol and supported by several dealers together with private entrants Nigel Spring and Dick Wilkins. Factory records show that the KTTs, which were to be ridden by Freddie Frith and Ken Bills, were invoiced to Nigel Spring on 20th May 1948 and delivered via the Premier Motor Company of Birmingham. Frith's machine was numbered 'SF114' (frame) and 'KTT 954' (engine), while Bills' was numbered 'SF129' and 'KTT 956' respectively. Interviewed by Motor Cycling in February 1948, Spring remarked that he had expected a couple of standard MkVIII KTTs, but was delighted to hear that Veloce had decided to build a limited number of special models, with 'hotted-up' engines. As works supported riders, Frith and Bills enjoyed the advantages of these special engines that had been modified by the factory. In the same Motor Cycling article, Bertie Goodman confirmed that four of these special KTTs had been made: two for the Spring \u00e9quipe, and one each for Bob Foster and David Whitworth.\n\n\n\nR M N Spring was proprietor of a preserves manufacturer ('Spring's Delights') based in Brigg, Lincolnshire where it operated a large fruit processing plant. He was also a pre-war Brooklands competitor, race winner, world record holder, tuner, and sponsor, so knew a thing or two about racing motorcycles. Another Lincolnshire man, and one of the few riders to win Isle of Man TT's both before and after the war, Freddie Frith first came to prominence in 1930 when he rode a Velocette to 3rd place in the inaugural Manx Grand Prix's Junior race. In 1935 he won the Junior Manx GP on a Norton, a ride that earned him a place in Bracebridge Street's works team for '36. Freddie Frith was an instant success at the higher level, winning the 1936 Junior TT and the Senior TT in 1937, during which he became the first man to lap the Mountain Course at over 90mph.\n\n\n\nHaving spent the war years as an Army motorcycle instructor, he was tempted back into the saddle in 1947 at the age of 38 but did not compete in that year's TT following a spill in practice on a Senior Moto-Guzzi. He joined the Spring stable for 1948, and the rest, as they say, is history. A quiet, modest man, referred to consistently by all as a 'real gentlemen' Freddie Frith retired at the end of the 1949 season and opened a motorcycle dealership in Grimsby, which traded successfully for many years. He died in 1988 aged 78 and is still remembered fondly in Lincolnshire as one of the county's greatest sporting heroes.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 1949 season, the special DOHC engines that had been on loan to Spring were returned to the factory, while the rest of the Frith Velocette, being Spring's personal property, was retained by him. (Apparently, at some point, possibly after being sold to a private owner, it was fitted with a standard KSS engine and used on the road).\n\n\n\nVelocette's exceedingly fast DOHC 350s raced on into 1950, Bob Foster winning the World Championship for the second year in succession for Hall Green, and these advanced engines were so good that they continued to be reused in more up-to-date cycle parts as development progressed. Fitted into lightweight 'low-boy' frames in 1951, they were once again raced by Foster (now in his final year) as well as up-and-coming new team members Cecil Sandford and Bill Lomas, whose machine ended up being fitted with the ex-Frith engine, 'L.IOM 68560.1046'.\n\n1951 would turn out to be the swansong of the full Velocette race team (in 1952 Veloce Ltd were only to enter a single rider - Les Graham - in international events) and the race shop was closed down soon afterwards.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, but as is so often the case with obsolescent racing machines, the works Velocettes were dismantled and the major components dispersed, their historic identities being lost in the short term. The special magnesium DOHC engines, which still retained the promise of a useful life, were all sold to private owners, and 'L.IOM 68560.1046' eventually found itself recycled into the Reynolds-framed Velocette originally built for Geoff Duke. This came about because the Duke Reynolds Velocette had been acquired as a rolling chassis by the Australian Hinton Brothers, minus its original single-knocker engine. As the Hinton's also by now owned the ex-Lomas low-boy works Velocette, they wasted no time in transferring the ultra-quick ex-Frith motor, 'L.IOM 68560.1046', into the Duke machine.\n\n\n\nHaving gone down separate paths for so many years, frame and engine have now been reunited, and the ex-Frith 350cc motor, having changed hands a multitude of times in the intervening years, has been rebuilt by the world's leading authority on the Velocette marque. Since the rebuild's completion, this beautiful historic Velocette has been ridden on the Isle of Man TT Parade Lap, at the Assen Classic TT, and at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Presented in sound order, this turbine-smooth, docile yet exceptionally fast motorcycle is ready to parade or even race. Accompanying documentation consists of period photographs, copies of factory records, Velocette Owners Club works record extract, engine specification details, and various magazine articles.\n\n\n\nExceptional motorcycles with important race history seldom come to market, let alone ultra-rare factory racers such as that offered here, so this multiple Grand Prix-winning works DOHC KTT, originally ridden to such success by one of the sport's most iconic World Champions, represents a unique opportunity, of enormous significance for collectors, to own a genuine World Championship-winning Velocette."}, {"url": "https://classic-motorbikes.net/velocette-ktt-race-bike/", "page_content": "Velocette KTT Race Bike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Birmingham based Goodman brothers founded the Veloce company in 1905 after their previous company was wound up. They had already pr\n\noduced a viable two wheeled machine, the 2hp Veloce, so the name was used on the letterhead of the new company, albeit to make cars in the early days. In 1913 a small capacity two-stroke machine was designed and named the Velocette but sales were poor, as motorcycles hadn\u2019t really caught on as a viable means of transport.\n\nThe First World War interrupted plans and the Veloce Company was turned over to munitions production for the war effort, after the hostilities the Velocette name was used for the company as it had become a recognised brand and motorcycles were fast becoming a popular way of getting around. A breakthrough came for the Velocette concern when a new, 348cc overhead camshaft, K series engine was developed. Once a few teething troubles were overcome the new engine saw success in the 1925 TT races, returning the following year to win, thus starting a 40-year dynasty that would see the KTT in its various forms take victories all over the world. Velocette dominated 350cc racing between 1938 and 1949, winning all five Junior TT races of the period.\n\nThe post war KTT MKVIII racer owed much to the pre war KTT as development ground to a halt during and immediately after the Second World War, the production version using the exact engine as 1938 model. It was hugely popular on the UK race scene however as very little else was available for the common man to purchase and remain competitive.\n\nThe works specials built after the war had enough speed and reliability to take two European Championships, in 1947 and 48 with Fergus Anderson and Freddie Frith respectively, and two World Championships titles in 1949 and 1950, Frith being the first rider to win the honours for Velocette and Bob Foster the last. Although never officially backed by the company these factory specification machines were supplied to selected teams to run and largely develop themselves. Using the same chassis as the production KTT, the factory race bike is clearly distinguishable from the over the counter machine due to its larger fuel tank and Cylinder head to accommodate the two camshafts.\n\nThe ex Freddie Frith \u201cFactory\u201d racer seen here has the double overhead camshaft power plant first used in 1936 but with mixed success due to the extra strain placed on the valve train. The bottom end remained largely unchanged from its originally spec so adding an extra camshaft and vales soon overwhelmed the design.\n\nOnce sorted, and with the demands of the war effort out of the way, the gains where apparent and the new engine could be safely revved an extra 1000rpm with a healthy dollop of horsepower provided simply by this increased headroom.\n\nProduction of the customer KTT ended in 1950, 49 MK VII machines had been built before the war and a further 189 after, while numbers of the Works engine are not fully known it is thought that just 6 units were completed in the post war period. Velocette quit developing machines for GP racing soon after this initial success and any race success in the future came with modified road going machinery, due mainly to the high cost of competing at the highest level.\n\nAnother factor in the company\u2019s decision was the illness and subsequent death in 1952 of the chief race designer and company principal, Peter Goodman, he had been working on a four-cylinder, liquid cooled, race engine that was well ahead of its time but, following his demise all efforts ion this radical power plant was halted. The factory did build a 250cc version of the KTT but it was too heavy to offer a serious threat to the fast emerging competition and 1952 marked the swansong of the KTT racer with numbers fast disappearing in the following years as more affordable and competitive race machinery became available.\n\nFreddie Frith.\n\nFreddie Frith was born in Grimsby in 1910 and became a keen competitor at trials and other motorcycle events during the late 20s. Riding a production KTT Velocette, Frith finished 3rd in the 1930 Manx GP junior event, eventually winning the Junior race in 1935. His success soon attracted the factory teams and he joined Norton in 1936, winning the Junior TT that year along with an impressive Grand Prix victory in the 500 Ulster Grand Prix. Frith became the first rider to lap the TT course when he won the 1937 senior race. When war broke out in 1939 Frith joined the Army as a motorcycle instructor but returned to racing as soon as competitions resumed in 1947, as a works supported Velocette rider he had lost none of the form seen before the war and he went on to be the first ever 350 World Champion in 1949. In 1950, Frith retired from competition and the following season was awarded the OBE for his work in motorsport, he continued in the industry running his own motorcycle retail outlet and died in 1988.\n\nVelocette KTT factory racer Specifications\n\nEngine \u2013 Single Cylinder, Air Cooled, Double Overhead Camshaft\n\nCapacity \u2013 348cc\n\nBore & stroke \u2013 74 x 81mm\n\nCompression Ratio \u2013 8:1\n\nCarburation \u2013 Amal TT\n\nMax Power \u2013 39bhp @ 7500rpm\n\nTorque \u2013 28ft-lbs @ 5000rpm\n\nIgnition \u2013 contact breaker\n\nTransmission \u2013 4-speed, wet clutch, chain final drive\n\nFrame \u2013 Steel Tube\n\nSuspension \u2013 Girder forks, twin shock rear\n\nWheels \u2013 3.00 x 21, 3.50 x 19\n\nBrakes \u2013 single leading shoe drum front and rear\n\nWheelbase \u2013 1350mm\n\nWeight \u2013 145kgs\n\nFuel capacity \u2013 litres\n\nTop speed \u2013 115mph\n\nVelocette KTT Race Bike Gallery\n\n[dmalbum path=\u201d/wp-content/uploads/dm-albums/KTT/\u201d/]"}]}
