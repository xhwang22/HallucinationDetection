He transformed Egypt from an inward-looking kingdom into a triumphant, conquering nation. And he established a reputation as a brilliant military strategist, one whom later historians would call the \u201cNapoleon of Egypt.\u201d\n\nJust a few months after coming to power, Thutmose III marched with an army of 20,000 soldiers to Megiddo, in modern-day northern Israel\u2014a site better known by its Greek name, Armageddon. A coalition of opponents had gathered there, outside the city. Scribes traveled with Thutmose III\u2019s forces and recorded the campaign\u2019s details, an invaluable chronicle now known as the Annals of Thutmose III.\n\n5:58\n\nThe pharaoh defied his advisers and surprised his foes by surging through a treacherous mountain pass to mount a deadly direct attack on Megiddo. He rode up front during that perilous advance to show that he trusted in the gods to protect him and his troops, and indeed, all made it through the pass unscathed. Then he entered battle at Megiddo \u201con a chariot of fine gold, decked in his shining armor,\u201d dazzling and intimidating his opponents, who soon gave up the fight and retreated to their last bastion of safety within the city walls. Thutmose III laid siege to Megiddo for seven months, mercilessly starving out its remaining inhabitants until they surrendered.\n\nThutmose III flexed his military might repeatedly: in Nubia, in Phoenician ports, in the valuable trade center of Kadesh, and in the kingdom of Mitanni, in modern-day Syria and Turkey. Over the course of 17 campaigns, he secured more territory than any other pharaoh. By the end, he controlled Egypt\u2019s largest ever empire.

But he also secured human capital from his captured lands. The sons of conquered rulers were taken to Egypt and educated at court.

His reign, which spanned from around 1479 to 1425 BC, was one marked by his unrelenting thirst for dominance and power. Arguably Egypt\u2019s greatest warrior king, Thutmose III built upon the laurels and works of predecessors like his stepmother Hatshepsut and his father Thutmose II.\n\nWith a total of 17 military campaigns, this powerful king was able to stretch the boundaries of Egypt, turning Egypt into the most dominant power in the region. It is generally accepted among Egyptologists and scholars alike that Egypt reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III. What were some of his most famous military campaigns? And how did Thutmose III bring the mighty Mitannians to submission?\n\nBelow, World History Edu explores the life, family tree, military campaigns, and major achievements of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nQuick facts about Thutmose III\n\nBirth: c. 1481 BC\n\nDied: c. 1425 BC\n\nAged: 56\n\nBurial place: Valley of the Kings, Luxor, Egypt\n\nReligion: Ancient Egyptian religion\n\nFather: Thutmose II\n\nMother: Iset\n\nSiblings: Neferure\n\nSpouses: Satiah, Nebtu, Menwi, Menhet, Merti, Nebsemi\n\nChief consort: Merytre-Hatshepsut\n\nChildren: Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, Siamun, Nefertiri, Amenemhat, Amenhotep II\n\nReign: 1479-1425 BC\n\nDynasty: 18th\n\nPredecessor: Queen Hatshepsut\n\nSuccessor: Amenhotep II\n\nEpithets: \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d, \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d\n\nOther names: Thutmosis (\u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d or \u201cThoth is born\u201d)\n\nMost known for: Steering ancient Egypt to its zenith ever\n\nConquests: northern Syria, parts of Nubia, Palestine, Niya Kingdom\n\nBirth and early life\n\nSon of Egyptian ruler Thutmose II and Queen Iset, Thutmose III was born around 1481 BC. Following the death of his father in 1479 BC, he was the most eligible person to rise to throne. However, he was only just child at the time. Hence his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut ruled on his behalf as regent of Egypt.\n\nGrowing up, the young boy-king received the best of education befitting of an Egyptian monarch. Thutmose III also received training in military tactics, horse and chariot riding, archery, and among others. Right from an early age, he had a knack for horsemanship, as he was very well built and a good marksman.\n\nNames and epithets\n\nAs it was common for ancient Egyptian kings and queens, Thutmose III went by a number of names and epithets. His two main names were associated with major Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth. For example his name Tuthmosis or Thutmose evokes the meaning of \u201cThoth is born\u201d or \u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d. The god Thoth was the Egyptian deity of the moon, time, and wisdom.\u2019\n\nThutmose III\u2019s other name mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02c1 \u1e0f\u1e25wty-ms means \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d or \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d. Egyptians believed that the sun god Ra, also known as the chief of the Egyptian pantheon, steered his sun barge through the sky bringing sunlight to land.\n\nThutmose II \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s father\n\nThutmose II was the father of Thutmose III. Born to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Mutnofret, Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is said to have started in 1493 and ended upon his death in 1479. During his reign he achieved a number of things, including quelling revolts in the Levant and Nubia.\n\nIn addition to Iset, Thutmose III\u2019s mother, Thutmose II had a number of consorts. Upon his death in 1479, Thutmose II\u2019s chief consort Queen Hatshepsut succeeded him to the throne.\n\nQueen Iset \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s mother\n\nWith Hatshepsut taking the role as the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, Queen Iset was the secondary wife of Thutmose II. Iset\u2019s name was derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian mother goddess Isis. In some ancient texts and inscriptions, Iset is referred to as the chief consort of Thutmose II. Thutmose III\u2019s mother\u2019s name appears on his mummy wrappings as well as a statue of the king in the Karnak Temple Complex. Upon her son\u2019s coronation as the sole ruler of Egypt in 1458 BC (i.e. after the death of Queen Hatshepsut), Iset received the epithet \u201cKing\u2019s Mother\u201d.\n\nA number of Iset\u2019s images and depictions can be found in the tomb of Thutmose III at the Valley of the Kings. Many of those depictions see her revered as the manifestation of the Egyptian goddess Isis. In one depiction, she can be seen standing behind Thutmose III on a boat.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut\u2019s regency, co-regency and ultimate rule\n\nFollowing the death of Thutmose II around 1479 BC, the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut became regent Thutmose II\u2019s only son Thutmose III, who was too young to reign as king. Even long before the death of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut\u2019s power in the kingdom was quite immense, with some describing her as the real power behind Thutmose II\u2019s reign. Thutmose II, a lesser son of Thutmose I, had to marry Hatshepsut in order to consolidate his power.\n\nAbout seven years into her regency, Hatshepsut will go from regent of Egypt to co-ruler of the kingdom until her death in 1458 BC. She thus co-ruled with her stepson Thutmose III. Upon her death, Thutmose III became the sole ruler of Egypt.\n\nHatshepsut assigned herself full titles of a pharaoh. She donned clothes similar to the ones Egyptian pharaohs wore. Bent on dominating the affairs of land of Egypt, she also assumed the insignia of the Egyptian pharaoh. Effectively ruling as pharaoh from c. 1479 to 1458 BC, Hatshepsut, who was also known as \u201cForemost of Noble Ladies\u201d, steered Egypt to great heights.\n\nRead More: 10 Greatest Accomplishments of Queen Hatshepsut\n\nThutmose III and Hatshepsut\n\nUpon attaining the age of maturity, Queen Hatshepsut appointed Thutmose III as the commander of her army. Egyptologists note that Thutmose III served as the co-ruler of Egypt throughout the reign of Hatshepsut. There was hardly any grudge between the two as they worked in tandem. Both rulers had royal names and insignia.\n\nAs a matter of fact their different leadership traits complemented perfectly. Some scholars have noted that the co-rulership of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III proved extremely beneficial for the latter\u2019s sole reign over Egypt.\n\nMajor achievements of Thutmose III\n\nLike many 18th Dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III benefited a lot from the technology transferred to Egypt during the reign of Hyksos rulers [Fifteenth Dynasty (c. 1650-1550 BC)]. Armed with military innovations like the horse and chariot, the sickle sword and the composite bow, Thutmose III embarked on many military campaigns and conquests. By so doing, he was able to wield tremendous influence in the region, from southern Syria and Canaan to the east to Nubia to the south. Ancient Egypt was truly a superpower during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nDuring his reign from 1479 BC to 1425 BC, Thutmose III was able to accomplish a lot of outstanding things. Some of his major accomplishments are as follows:\n\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon\n\nEgyptologists often opine that there was hardly any ancient Egyptian ruler that could rival the expansionist ambitions of Thutmose III. It\u2019s been estimated that he spent more than twenty years of his thirty-year reign as Egypt\u2019s sole ruler campaigning in foreign lands. It is for this reason some historians like to refer to him as ancient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon.\n\nThutmose III embarked upon a total of 17 campaigns in foreign territories, capturing several hundreds of cities in the process. By the time he was through, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s influence and dominion to places as far as the Near East, Nubia in the south, and the Euphrates.\n\nAn astute commander of Egypt\u2019s army\n\nAs co-ruler and commander of Egypt\u2019s army, Thutmose III prepared himself adequately to reassert Egypt\u2019s influence in northern Syria, Nubia and Palestine. For many years since his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s conquest of those regions, Egypt\u2019s hold over those regions had gradually faded. During his father Thutmose II\u2019s reign, the tributes that Egypt received from those foreign rulers steadily fell.\n\nAnd the fact that Egypt was left with a boy-king following the death of Thutmose II in some way emboldened those foreign Syrian princes to rebel against Egypt\u2019s influence in the region. The task of bringing those regions back under Egypt\u2019s control fell squarely on Thutmose III. Realizing this, co-ruler Queen Hatshepsut was right in naming her stepson and co-ruler Thutmose III the commander-in-chief of Egypt\u2019s army.\n\nBy his mid-20s, he had grown into a fine warrior, knowledgeable in many military tactics and skilled at weapon handling. Thutmose was ready to begin his military campaigns in Syria and other surrounding regions in Mesopotamia.\n\nThutmose III led what was possible the mightiest and largest Egyptian army ever\n\nThutmose III\u2019s early introduction into the army proved extremely useful for him going forward. Steadily he went on to build a very large army that instilled a lot fear in Egypt\u2019s foreign enemies. Historians and Egyptologists like to believe that Thutmose\u2019s reign saw the Egyptian army reach its peak, boasting of the largest army in ancient Egypt\u2019s history.\n\nMarched his army to capture Megiddo\n\nIn what is widely recognized as Thutmose III\u2019s first campaign, the young Egyptian ruler led his army to halt the growing power of the king of Kadesh. Thutmose\u2019s army went through Jamnia before arriving at Megiddo.\n\nBefore facing off the king of Kadesh in the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose is said to have made a very brave decision of taking the most challenging route to the battle ground. Contrary to the advice of his war counsel, the Egyptian king chose to take the riskiest path through a narrow mountain pass in the Wadi Ara (present-day in Israel). The path allowed Thutmose and his army to strategically place themselves between the rear side of the enemy forces and Megiddo. The battle, which was the biggest of all the 17 campaigns of Thutmose III, ended in a resounding victory for Thutmose. The Pharaoh laid siege to the city for about eight months before bringing Megiddo to its knees. As the troops made their way back to Egypt, they helped themselves to plundering much of the resources of Megiddo.\n\nWielded control over all of Canaan and large parts of Syria\n\nThe capture of Megiddo meant that Thutmose III had placed himself in firm control of all of Canaan and many other parts of Syria. In order to maintain that firm control of those places he ordered the payment of large annual tributes to Egypt. Those foreign lands were also required to send their princes and heirs to Egypt where they were Egyptionalized so to speak. By so doing, Egypt was able to secure strong loyalty from those princes once they turned to rulers of their respective cities.\n\nConquered Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biqa valley\n\nFurthermore, Thutmose conquered many ports on the Phoenician coast, allowing him to gain greater control of Syria. After plundering the town of Ardata, he turned the place into an important strategic base for Egypt. In his sixth campaign, the Egyptian king proceeded to take and pillage many Kadesh territories. As part of his effort to prevent those conquered territories from rebelling, he sometimes plundered a lot of their resources, thereby leaving them impoverished with no ability to mount a rebellion.\n\nBrought the state of Mitanni under Egypt\u2019s control\n\nBeginning around the end of Thutmose III\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reign, Thutmose I, the rulers of Mitanni, a Mesopotamian kingdom, had started to grow in power and influence in the region. Thutmose III was bent on clipping Mitanni\u2019s rise. In his 33rd year, he led his army on an eight campaign. After crossing the Euphrates River, he took on the Mitannian forces, who were anything but ready for an invasion. The king of Mitanni fled, allowing Thutmose III to force Mitanni into complete submission. The Egyptian king is said to have taking about more than 30 members of the Mitannian\u2019s harem and several hundreds of soldiers prisoners.\n\nTo commemorate his spectacular victory, he erected a stele next to his grandfather\u2019s stele in the region. Thutmose thus became the first Egyptian monarch since Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates.\n\nA prominent builder of spectacular buildings\n\nA great patron of the arts and architecture, Thutmose III is said to have tasked his architects to build many magnificent structures, most famous among them came at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Thutmose is credited with enlarging the complex by erecting new buildings and obelisks. For example he rebuilt his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s hypostyle hall. He also built a jubilee hall to mark his reign during the Sed festival. He also built a new temple at Dayr al-Bahri, just close to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple.\n\nMore Thutmose III facts\n\nAs a result of the immense influence he had, many foreign princes and monarchs, from the Hittite region to the Mesopotamian region, frequently presented him a wide array of gifts. Rulers from as far as the Aegean and the Greek mainland sent envoys and gifts to Thutmose III.\n\nMuch of what we know about Thutmose III comes from the records of Thanuny, a royal scribe and commander in Thutmose III\u2019s army.\n\nHe was a known hunter of elephant in the land of Niy in the Orontes Valley.\n\nOften times, the prisoners of war and the loot that he took from foreign lands were presented to the god Amun (Amon).\n\nAfter conquering a foreign land, Thutmose III would deploy native rulers to govern those territories. Those rulers were required to remain loyal, keep the peace, and pay annual tributes to Egypt. During his reign, Egypt received tributes from Nubia (Sudan), Syria, and Palestine.\n\nTypical of many Egyptian pharaohs, the records of Thutmose III are a bit boastful, exaggerating the abilities of the Egyptian king.\n\nIt was during Thutmose III\u2019s reign that Egyptian artisans mastered glass making.\n\nIn his final few years on the throne, some of his courtiers, along with his heir Amenhotep II, tried to erase the records, including images and cartouches, of Hatshepsut and her reign. In some cases, Hatshepsut\u2019s achievements were appropriated to Thutmose II and Thutmose I.\n\nHe loved to bring animals and plants from far and wide into his kingdom. Some of those foreign beasts and plants can be seen on the walls of the Festival Hall at Karnak.\n\nFor quite a number of centuries, Egyptians took to inscribing the name of Thutmose III on amulets. It was believed that those amulets protected the wearer.\n\nMummy and memorial temple\n\nThutmose III was buried in a very remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in 1889. Archaeologists believe that the 21st dynasty priest-kings (1076- c. 945 BC) kept his mummy in that place in order to protect it from being desecrated.\n\nBased on his mummy, Thutmose III\u2019s height was in the region of five feet three inches (around 1.6 meters).\n\nDiscovered in 1962, Thutmose III\u2019s memorial temple was sited next to Hatshepsut\u2019s memorial temple in Dayr al-Bahri.\n\nMore Thutmose III achievements\n\nHis final military campaign saw him put down a rebellion (instigated by some exiled members of the Mitannian royal family) in the Arka plain. He also destroyed many Mitannian garrisons in the region.\n\nAround his 50th regnal year, he turned his attention to his southern borders, where he captured many Nubian territories, including Napata and Kurgus. He is famed for being the first Egyptian king to march an army as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile River.\n\nShortly after securing those Nubian regions, he erected a temple in honor of the god Amun. He also captured a number of prisoners that he would later send to the gold mines. Scholars state that the produce from those gold mines formed a significant portion of Egypt\u2019s wealth.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s consorts and children\n\nIn some texts it\u2019s noted that Thutmose III married his half-sister Neferure, who was the daughter of Thutmose II and Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. Neferure was at some point was even referred to as the God\u2019s Wife.\n\nIn another account, the great royal wife of Thutmose III was rather Merytre-Hatshepsut. By her, Thutmose III gave birth to Amenhotep II, his successor. Merytre-Hatshepsut became the chief consort of the king after the death of Satiah. Additionally, Merytre-Hatshepsut was the mother of Thutmose\u2019s successor Amenhotep II. In the course of her life, Merytre-Hatshepsut had titles like Great King\u2019s Wife, God\u2019s Wife, King\u2019s Mother, Sole One, Beloved of Ra, and First among the nobles.\n\nOther famous wives of Thutmose III include Menwi, Merti, and Menhet. Those three women were princesses from foreign lands who were sent to the royal harem of the pharaoh. Although they were regarded as minor wives of the king, the three women still held a bit of influence in the royal court, receiving titles like King\u2019s Wife.\n\nThutmose III also had the likes of Nebtu, Nebsemi and Satiah in his royal harem. It\u2019s been stated that by later, Thutmose III bore his eldest son Prince Amenemhat. Satiah was psossibly Thutmose III\u2019s first Great Royal Wife.\n\nKing Thutmose III had many children, including Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, and Nefertiri.\n\nFamily Tree of Thutmose III\n\nSuccessor\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign spanned for about 54 years; the first twenty-two years of his reign was spent serving as the co-ruler of Egypt with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut. In his final few years, he appointed his son and heir Amenhotep II as a junior co-regent.\n\nHis eldest son and heir, Amenemhat, predeceased him, possibly dying of a plague. Following the death of Amenemhat, Amenhotep II became heir to Thutmose III."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1101/thutmose-iii-at-the-battle-of-megiddo/", "page_content": "The ancient site of Megiddo was the scene of a number of battles in antiquity and is best known as the source of the word armageddon, the Greek rendering of the Hebrew Har-Megiddo ('Mount of Megiddo') from the biblical Book of Revelation 16:16. Revelation 16:16 is the only use of the word in the Bible and designates the site of the final battle between the forces of the Christian god and those of his adversary Satan. Megiddo, however, is mentioned at least 12 times in the Hebrew scriptures (the Christian Old Testament) concerning a number of military conflicts between the Israelites and various opponents.\n\nAerial View of Megiddo Photo Gallery Israeli Ministry of Tourism (CC BY-ND) Long before the Hebrew scribes wrote of these battles, however, Megiddo was already famous for an engagement involving a coalition of kings from Canaan and Syria in rebellion against the pharaoh Thutmose III (1458-1425 BCE) of Egypt. Thutmose III was one of the greatest military strategists of ancient Egypt who expanded the country's borders to establish the Egyptian Empire and elevated his nation to the status of a superpower. Although the regions which became Egyptian provinces prospered under this arrangement, they still looked for opportunities to assert their independence and regain their autonomy.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe Egyptian empire was initiated by Ahmose I (c.1570-1544 BCE) whose victory over the Hyksos of Lower Egypt marks the beginning of the period known as the New Kingdom of Egypt (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE), and every pharaoh who succeeded him maintained or enlarged the boundaries. Thutmose III, however, would go further than any others. In 20 years, he led 17 successful military campaigns, recorded on the walls of the Temple of Amun at Karnak but the most detailed account is of his first, and most famous, at Megiddo.\n\nBackground to the Battle\n\nThutmose III was the son and successor of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE), but when his father died, he was only three years old and so his step-mother, Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), held the throne as regent. Soon after assuming this position, however, Hatshepsut broke with tradition and assumed power. Thutmose III spent his youth at the court of Thebes, in military training, and pursuing the kind of education expected for a prince of the New Kingdom.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nAfter her first few years as pharaoh, Hatshepsut organized no major military campaigns but kept her forces at peak efficiency and, when he proved able, promoted Thutmose III to commander of her forces. She was one of the most powerful, resourceful, and efficient monarchs in Egypt's history and, when she died, left Thutmose III a prosperous country with a well-organized and highly-trained fighting force.\n\nThutmose III Tjflex2 (CC BY-NC-ND)\n\nHatshepsut had maintained the empire steadily throughout her reign, but when she died, the kings of Megiddo and Kadesh rebelled against her successor whom they seem to have believed was weak. It was actually fairly common in the ancient world for subject states to rise against a new ruler in order to take advantage of the transition of power to win their independence. It is possible, in fact, that Hatshepsut anticipated this in that there seems to be some evidence that Thutmose III's first campaign had been commissioned by her; this claim is disputed, however. The coalition between the Canaanites of Megiddo and the Syrians of Kadesh attracted others dissatisfied with Egyptian rule, who gathered their forces outside the city of Megiddo in late 1458 or early 1457 BCE.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nThe Battle of Megiddo\n\nThutmose III wasted no time in mobilizing his forces and marching from Thebes toward the city. The army covered 150 miles in 10 days and rested at Gaza before moving on to the town of Yehem where Thutmose III halted to confer with his senior staff. There were three roads they could take from the nearby town of Aruna to reach Megiddo: a narrow pass which would require the army to march in single file and two other broader roads which would enable faster and easier movement. The generals claimed they had intelligence that the enemy was waiting for them at the end of the narrow pass and, further, progress would be slow and difficult with the vanguard reaching the battle site while the rearguard was still on the march.\n\nThutmose III listened to their council but disagreed with their points. According to the record of the engagement kept by his military scribe Tjaneni, Thutmose III addressed his commanders, saying:\n\nI swear, as Ra loves me, as my father Amun favors me, as my nostrils are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction, my majesty shall proceed upon this Aruna road! Let him of you who wishes go upon these roads of which you speak and let him of you who wishes come in the following of my majesty! 'Behold', they will say, these enemies whom Ra abominates, 'has his majesty set out on another road because he has become afraid of us?' \u2013 So they will speak. (Pritchard, 177)\n\nThe generals instantly bowed to his decision and then Thutmose III addressed his army. He encouraged them to march swiftly on the narrow road and assured them that he, himself, would lead from the front, saying \"I will not let my victorious army go forth ahead of my majesty in this place!\" (Pritchard, 177). The chariots and wagons were dismantled and carried and the men led the horses single-file through the pass to emerge in the Qina Valley by Megiddo.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nMegiddo albedo20 (CC BY-NC-ND)\n\nThey found no enemy waiting for them, and in fact, the coalition had assumed that Thutmose III would choose either of the easier routes and had troops prepared to defend at both locations. Thutmose III's decision to choose the more difficult path gave him the advantage of the element of surprise. He could not attack at once, however, since the better part of his army was still strung along the Aruna pass. It would take the rearguard over seven hours of marching to catch up with their king.\n\nThutmose III ordered the troops to rest and refresh themselves near the Qina Brook. Throughout the night, he personally received sentry reports and gave orders for the provisioning of the troops and their placement in battle for the following day. He positioned his army so that the southern wing was on a hill above the Qina Brook and the northern wing was on a rise to the northwest of Megiddo; the king would personally command the attack and lead from the center. Tjaneni's account reads:\n\nHis majesty set forth in a chariot of fine gold, adorned with his accoutrements of combat, like Horus, the Mighty of Arm, a lord of action like Montu, the Theban, while his father Amun made strong his arms\u2026Thereupon his majesty prevailed over them at the head of his army. Then they [the enemy] saw his majesty prevailing over them and they fled headlong to Megiddo with their faces of fear. They abandoned their horses and their chariots of gold and silver so that someone might draw them up into this town by hoisting on their garments. Now the people had shut this town against them but they let down garments to hoist them up into this town. (Pritchard, 179)\n\nTjaneni's report notes how, if the army had pursued the fleeing enemy across the field and cut them down in their flight, then the battle would have ended decisively that day. Instead, the soldiers \"gave up their hearts to capturing the possessions of the enemy\" on the field and allowed their opponents to not only reach the sanctuary of the city but mount defenses (Pritchard, 179). Thutmose III ordered a moat dug around Megiddo and a stockade built around the moat. No one from inside the city was allowed out except to surrender or if called to parley by an Egyptian officer.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe siege lasted at least seven, possibly eight, months before the leaders of the coalition surrendered the city. Thutmose III offered very generous terms, which amounted to a promise from his opponents that they would not raise another rebellion against Egypt; none of the ringleaders were executed and the city was left untouched. Thutmose III did strip the ringleaders of their positions and appointed new officials, loyal to Egypt, in their place. He also took their children as hostages back to Egypt to guarantee their good behavior. Although this may sound harsh, the hostages were well cared for and continued to live at the level of comfort they were used to. The children were educated in Egyptian culture and, when they came of age, were sent back to their lands with an appreciation for and loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh.\n\nSignificance of the Battle\n\nThe list of loot carried back to Egypt from the campaign, including prisoners of war, slaves, hostages, arms and armor, gold and silver chariots, jewels and precious metals, and livestock, would have been enough to mark it an overwhelming triumph. In addition to putting down the rebellion and enriching Egypt's treasury, however, the victory also gave Thutmose III control over northern Canaan and provided him with a base from which to launch campaigns into Mesopotamia. The great princes of the Mesopotamian cities which had not joined the coalition sent tribute to Egypt of their own accord to win favor with \u2013 and hopefully buy protection from - the great warrior-king and champion of The Battle of Megiddo, and his fame became legendary quite quickly.\n\nThutmose III's triumph over the coalition at Megiddo established his reputation early & assured the success of all his future campaigns.\n\nIn the following years, he would conquer Syria and the lands of the Mitanni \u2013 both of whom had been involved in the Megiddo uprising - before turning his attention to the southern borders of Egypt to defeat the Nubians and expand Egypt's holdings in that region. As at Megiddo, he always relied on the element of surprise and was never deterred by the difficulties or obstacles to victory. His triumph over the coalition at Megiddo established his reputation early and assured that the success of all his future campaigns was all but certain as the enemy would know in advance they were facing an invincible opponent.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe battle most likely suggested itself to the writer of Revelation in that the description of the forces of Satan and God in the biblical narrative are similar to those of the coalition and of Thutmose III's army in the official inscription of Tjaneni at Karnak. In both, the writers describe the victorious forces of good over the assembled coalition of evil. There can be little doubt that the scribe who wrote the biblical work was acquainted with The Battle of Megiddo since the story of Thutmose III's great victory against the combined forces of his enemies remained well known for centuries afterwards."}, {"url": "https://journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu/jaei/article/id/992/", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nOne of the most decisive rivalries in the history of the Ancient Near East during the Late Bronze Age was between Egypt and Mitanni.

Such a vast realm could never thrive if it weren\u2019t for leaders that were bold, confident, and eager to expand their territories. One such pharaoh was Thutmose III, widely regarded as one of Ancient Egypt's greatest rulers ever. With a lengthy reign and a relentless drive towards Egyptian expansion, Thutmose ushered his realm into a new golden age. What were some defining moments in his reign?\n\nOn the Threshold of a New Golden Age with Pharaoh Thutmose III\n\nThe official regnal dates for Thutmose III are 28th April 1479 BC to 11th March 1425 BC. This means that the pharaoh ruled Egypt for roughly 54 years. That is an incredibly lengthy reign for any monarch, especially at a time when many wanted to usurp the throne. However, we must consider that Thutmose officially became a pharaoh when he was only two years old. Historians can provide such a precise number thanks to funerary inscriptions discovered within the tomb of a military commander from the time of Thutmose. This commander was Amenemheb-Mahu, and on the walls of his tomb it is recorded that Thutmose III died in his 54th regnal year.\n\nOf course, it was impossible for Thutmose III to rule so young. His father, Thutmose II, died after a relatively short reign, and was survived by his Great Royal Wife, Hatshepsut, as well as his children. Thus, the effective power was left in the hands of Hatshepsut, who declared herself to be the regent to the boy king. Soon she declared herself Pharaoh, but never attempted to oust Thutmose III or deny his right to the throne. Still, growing up, the boy had little effective power in the realm, and Egypt was ruled by Hatshepsut for roughly 21 years. During this time, the queen began numerous new building projects, and the realm prospered steadily.\n\nBecoming an able and promising young man, Thutmose III was made the foremost leader of Ancient Egypt\u2019s armies, during Hatshepsut\u2019s effective reign. This was the start of a promising military career, and the development of Thutmose\u2019s fantastic ability as a strategist and tactician. In fact, he demonstrated such great capabilities in this role, and would later prove to be an unparalleled commander. Historians today regard Thutmose III as a pure military genius, and this has earned him the nickname of \u201cthe Napoleon of Egypt\u201d.\n\nLarge Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsut. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/ CC0)\n\nA Time for Conquest and a Time for Expansion\n\nUpon the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III effectively assumed his rightful role as the Pharaoh. He was now roughly 25 years old, and already proven as a commander. Soon enough, he began a decisive expansion of Egypt\u2019s borders. He is today considered as one of the greatest conquerors in the timeline of Ancient Egypt, and was certainly an aggressive expansionist ruler.\n\nHis first successes began almost immediately after he assumed the throne: he led a campaign deep into modern-day Israel, where he won a masterful battle at Megiddo, defeating the King of Kadesh. With a daring move, he marched his armies to the rear of the Megiddo forces, crushing them decisively.\n\nSoon after this victory, Egyptian dominance was reasserted in the region called Canaan. And that was just the beginning of Thutmose\u2019s achievements. He methodically assaulted city after city, slowly beating his enemies into submission. Over the course of his lengthy reign, it is said that he captured no less than 350 cities. He conquered most of the Near East, from the River Euphrates all the way down to Nubia in the south. And we know precisely that he conducted 17 military campaigns in his reign - an impressive number.\n\nAncient Egypt quickly marched into a new Golden Age. With reasserted dominance, with expanded borders and new victories, the realm prospered in every regard. And all this thanks to the warrior Pharaoh, Thutmose III. Barely in his 30s, he was already crowned with the laurel wreath of victory, and loved by the people. Meticulously and decisively, he transformed Ancient Egypt into a true \u201cinternational\u201d superpower, reshaping it into an empire that incorporated regions of Syria, Canaan, Nubia, and others.\n\nThutmose III Sphinx sculpture, 18th Dynasty of Egypt, 1550-1295 BC. Held at the Louvre Museum. (Louvre Museum/ CC BY-SA 2.0 FR )\n\nThe Napoleon of Ancient Egypt\n\nLuckily, we know a lot about Thutmose\u2019s military achievements because of fairly detailed records that survive. Many of his triumphs were inscribed onto the walls of the Temple of Amun in Karnak, accompanied by stunning reliefs of the king subduing his enemies. Furthermore, Thutmose had a royal scribe and a loyal commander, Thanuny, who kept meticulous records of his king\u2019s campaigns. Fragments of these scripts allowed us a greater insight into methods of ancient warfare and strategy.\n\nAnother contributing factor to Thutmose\u2019s military success is a number of innovations and new technologies that placed him one step ahead of his enemies. Roughly two centuries before his time, Ancient Egypt came under the brief rule of the Hyksos, foreign invaders who brought with them new and never before seen tools and weapons. New unique swords were quickly absorbed by the Egyptians, as well as new forging techniques, as well as powerful two-wheeled war chariots. With all these innovations, the Egyptian army was well suited for conquest.\n\nSoon after winning the key battle at Megiddo, Thutmose solidified Egypt\u2019s domination in Canaan, and began a series of conquests that would lead Egypt to its greatest ever expansion. All the greatest kings of the region - of the Hittites, Babylonians, and Assyrians - gave him tribute. He then led campaigns against the powerful Phoenician ports, and the quarrelsome Mitanni to the north. Through his victories, he expanded his realm\u2019s wealth: slaves were acquired, sheep and horses, thousands of cattle, powerful stallions, money and riches, many tons of grain, quality wood from Lebanon, and noble hostages that made obedience guaranteed.\n\nRelief in the Karnak Temple showing Thutmose III slaying Canaanite captives from the Battle of Megiddo, 15th Century BC . (Olaf Tausch/ CC BY 3.0 )\n\nA Golden King in a Golden Era\n\nOver the course of 17 campaigns, most - if not all - of his enemies were subdued, the foremost being the Mitanni. But it was not all about warfare: Thutmose III was also inclined to spur other developments within Egypt as well. New construction projects were begun, and new technologies mastered. Glass-making was refined, and a number of new lavish buildings were raised in Karnak. Several monumental obelisks from this time also survive.\n\nThutmose III died in his 56th year (54th regnal year). His remains were entombed in a unique and lavish tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and his mummy survives to this day. Succeeding him was his younger son, Amenhotep II. The latter\u2019s reign was successful, but not nearly as good as his father\u2019s. Likewise, Amenhotep conducted only a few campaigns to maintain his domination.\n\nTogether with Rameses the Great , Thutmose is widely regarded as Ancient Egypt\u2019s finest pharaoh. And considering that the history of this civilization spans several thousands of years, that achievement can be considered monumental.\n\nTop image: The statue of Pharaoh Thutmose III at the Karnak Temple Complex in Luxor, Egypt.

During the Late Bronze Age, Thutmose III\u2019s ability to maintain sea control in the Eastern Mediterranean enabled him to effectively project Egyptian military power ashore in the Lebanon. It is a truism, confirmed during the Crusades, World War I, and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, that armies cannot operate effectively in the Syria-Palestine littoral without fleets controlling the adjacent Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBy the time of Thutmose III the Egyptians had a long established overland trade route across the Sinai, coupled with a strong influence over the cities of southern Palestine. They also had a mature maritime trading relationship with the coastal cities of the Lebanon, especially Byblos (about 32km north of modern Beirut).\n\nThutmose III\u2019s first campaign (Year 23 of his reign) commenced with a long gruelling march through the Sinai and Palestine. His army subsequently defeated a coalition of city states and towns under Mitannian (north east Syrian) leadership, at the Battle of Megiddo.[3] Much tribute was collected and local rulers made contributions that helped to supply the Egyptian armies in the field. Three mopping-up campaigns over subsequent years (Years 24 to 28) solidified Egypt\u2019s position as it paved the way for a more permanent occupation of Palestine.[4] Stabilisation of the region remained elusive however, as the Mitanni continued to exercise power and influence among the local princes of the Lebanon and Syria. One of these, the Prince of Kadesh, led an anti-Egyptian coalition based around the Orontes River and Naharin (the region around the upper Euphrates River in Syria). Indeed, following the Battle of Megiddo, the Mitanni and their supporters became formidable opponents whose insurgency tactics achieved local political successes against the less flexible Egyptian armies.\n\nThutmose III needed to change his strategy. Whereas the Egyptians could sustain small garrisons in Palestine and much larger forces from Egypt in order to coerce allies and defeat rebels, they were not capable of projecting Egyptian military power into the Lebanon or Syria over land. Not only would an army transiting through Palestine be a logistics burden for the cities and towns that it passed through, it was subject to potential attacks from anti-Egyptian insurgents. In addition, the transit time through Palestine would reduce the effective campaigning seasons for the Egyptian forces to such an extent that they would be incapable of operating against the Mitanni heartland in north east Syria. Sea power provided the answer.\n\nThutmose III's fifth to eighth campaigns (Years 29 to 33) in Syria-Palestine are classic examples of expeditionary operations.[5] While the Egyptians controlled the east Mediterranean Sea they were able to project power ashore, utilising mobility, access, flexibility and reach, to effectively \u2018fire\u2019 the Egyptian army at \u2018targets\u2019 on shore across the Lebanon and into north east Syria. \u201cFighting remained land based, but was now dependent upon the sea routes off the coastline of Lebanon, with Byblos and other ports serving as major staging points and supply depots.\u201d[6]\n\nThe city of Tunip was sacked during Thutmose III\u2019s fifth campaign (Year 29). Some 329 of Tunip\u2019s soldiers were captured, with many to be hired later as Egyptian mercenaries. Large quantities of silver, gold, bronze, and copper were taken as plunder. Two ships were also captured off the coast and their cargoes taken back to Egypt. \u201cAfterward his majesty returned (from the campaign) travelling by boat to Egypt, to his father Amon-Re (in Luxor), his heart in joy.\u201d[7] The Egyptian fleet was central to the successful conduct of this campaign.\n\nOn his sixth campaign, having established port facilities on the Lebanese coast, Thutmose III was able to travel from Egypt with his fleet and conduct expeditions to deter the rulers of Kadesh, Sumur and Arvad. Other cities were coerced to let their sons be raised in Egypt, to be Egyptianised. The seventh campaign was directed at the coastal cities of the Lebanon, starting by capturing and plundering the port city of Ullaza. Thutmose III then sailed along the coast, obtaining the submissions and tribute from the princes of each city and town on route. \u201cNow every harbour at which his majesty arrived supplied sweet bread and other assorted breads, with oil, incense, wine, honey and fruit...they were abundant beyond everything, beyond that which was known by his majesty\u2019s forces.\u201d[8] After assessing the harvest of Syria, and taking a proportion into the Egyptian treasury, Thutmose III sailed back to Egypt.\n\nHaving subdued the coastal cities of the Lebanon, Thutmose III was now able to embark upon his eighth and perhaps his greatest campaign (Year 33). He led an Egyptian expedition to conquer the Mitanni strongholds in north east Syria. After travelling by sea from Egypt through the port of Arvad, the expedition marched north to Aleppo and then into the land of Naharin. The king of Mitanni and the rulers of allied city states were defeated in a series of battles at Naharin, Wan (west of Aleppo), and Carchemish. \u201cNow his majesty travelled north capturing the towns and laying waste the settlements of that foe of wretched Naharin.\u201d[10] Three princes, 30 of their wives, 80 warriors, and 606 slaves (men, women and children) were taken prisoner.\n\nThe Egyptian expedition to Naharin included a bridge of boats that was used to cross the mighty Euphrates River. \u201cNow my majesty travelled to the ends of Asia. I caused many ships to be constructed of cedar on the hills of the God\u2019s Land (Lebanon), in the presence of the mistress of Byblos, they being placed on chariots (carts) pulled by oxen. They travelled before my majesty to cross that great river that flows between this foreign land and Naharin.\u201d[11] It is most likely that the Egyptian naval forces were responsible for this early feat in military engineering. Rapid movement of relatively small forces on land was the key to the successful conduct of these operations.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s campaign now turned south: sailing downstream on the Euphrates, the Egyptians attacked the cities of Niy, Sendjar, Takhsy and once again Kadesh.[12] Travelling south through the Orontes valley, the Egyptian expedition returned to the Lebanese coast. Thus the capability of the Egyptian forces to project power deep into Mitanni territory was demonstrated. Not only did the king of Mitanni give tribute to Thutmose III, but the major powers of the day recognised the might of Egypt. The Babylonian, Assyrian and Hittite kings now sent tribute to the Egyptians in the Lebanon. The following year more Syrian cities surrendered to the Egyptians adding to the list of tribute, while tribute was also received from the ruler of Cyprus.\n\nThe campaigns of Thutmose III provide an early example of the problems that must be overcome when conducting expeditionary operations. Expeditionary operations are usually most effective when they are limited to distant campaigns of short duration, against varied opponents, and with clear aims. They are by their nature also politicised. They are not efficient if they are used as a substitute to the taking and holding of land by occupation forces. While the Egyptians, under Thutmose III, were able to garrison and occupy Palestine they did not have the military or economic capabilities or the political will to permanently occupy all of Syria. After Thutmose III\u2019s eighth campaign, the forces of the Mitanni and their allies adopted a typical insurgency strategy against the Egyptians. They refused to pay tribute and revolted when and where the Egyptians were weak, while their rulers submitted when the Egyptian expeditions arrived in force. Syria was neither in peace nor at war, while cities in revolt and Egyptian reprisal campaigns almost became annual events. Thutmose III's successors inherited this unsatisfactory strategic situation in Syria, with Amenhotep II having to fight at least two campaigns in the region.\n\nThe Mitanni rulers of city states may have been morally justified in opposing Egyptian political domination of trade in Syria-Palestine, but the Egyptians themselves most likely saw their intervention as one of creating order where there was chaos. Thutmose III probably thought he acted as a force for good in the region. Sea power underpinned much of the \u2018Egyptian Empire\u2019, while the associated control of sea trade generated the wealth and luxury that characterised an Egyptian \u2018Golden Age\u2019.\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191King Thutmose III ruled Egypt for some 54 years, from 1479 to 1425 BCE.

He was the son of Thutmose II and a concubine, and son-in-law of the female pharaoh Hatsehpsut through his marriage to her daughter, his half-sister, by Thutmose II. Succeeding his father in 1479 BC, Thutmose III was overshadowed by Hatshepsut, who became the supreme ruler, giving the young king only a nominal role. After Hatshepsut died in 1458 BC, her monuments were defaced, and an apparent attempt to erase her memory was carried out. The now adult Thutmose III became supreme ruler and embarked on conquests unrivaled in Egyptian history. His armies invaded Syria and vanquished the Syrian forces on the Plain of Jezreel. The Syrians took refuge in the city of Megiddo but were defeated in 1454 BC.\n\nThutmose III later engaged in war against the state of Mitanni, which at that time largely controlled northern Mesopotamia and had fomented revolt in a number of Syrian and Phoenician cities dominated by Egypt. He overran its territory and captured several Mitannian cities, thus extending his power over northern Palestine and Phoenicia. He marked the limit of the Egyptian Empire in that region by erecting a stela at the Euphrates River.\n\nDuring his reign Thutmose III conducted 17 successful campaigns into Asia, lavishing the booty and tribute that he won on the Egyptian temples. He made important additions to the great temple at Al Karnak and had his annals inscribed on its walls. Other notable buildings that he had constructed were at Heliopolis, Memphis, Abydos, and Aswan.

During the first twenty-two years of Thutmose's reign he was co-regent with his aunt, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. While she is shown first on surviving monuments, both were assigned the usual royal names and insignia and neither is given any obvious seniority over the other.[3] He served as the head of her armies. After her death and his later rise to being the pharaoh of the kingdom, he created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen; no fewer than seventeen campaigns were conducted, and he conquered from Niy in north Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia. Officially, Thutmose III ruled Egypt for almost fifty-four years, and his reign is usually dated from April 24, 1479 BCE to March 11, 1425 BCE; however, this includes the twenty-two years he was co-regent to Hatshepsut--his stepmother and aunt. During the last two years of his reign he became a coregent again, with his son, Amenhotep II, who would succeed him. When he died he was buried in the Valley of the Kings as were the rest of the kings from this period in Egypt.

However, because he was not the son of his father's royal queen, his \"degree\" of royalty was less than ideal[5] . To bolster his qualifications, he may have married a daughter of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. It has been suggested that the daughter in question may have been Merytre-Hatshepsut, however, she is now proven not to have been a daughter of Hatshepsut's. Regardless of this, when Thutmosis II died Thutmosis III was too young to rule, so Hatshepsut became his regent, soon his coregent, and shortly thereafter, she was declared to be the pharaoh. Thutmosis III had little power over the empire while Hatshepsut exercised the formal titulary of kingship, complete with a royal prenomen\u2014Maatkare. Her rule was quite prosperous and marked by great advancements. When he reached a suitable age and demonstrated the capability, she appointed him to head her armies. After the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmosis III ruled Egypt on his own for thirty years, until the last two years of his reign, when his son became a coregent for two years. He died in his fifty-fourth regnal year. Thutmosis III had two known wives: Satiah and Merytre-Hatshepsut. Satiah bore him his firstborn son, Amenemhat, but the child predeceased his father. His successor, the crown prince and future king Amenhotep II, was born to Merytre-Hatshepsut.\n\nDates and Length of Reign\n\nThutmose III reigned from 1479 BCE to 1425 BCE according to the Low Chronology of Ancient Egypt. This has been the conventional Egyptian chronology in academic circles since the 1960s,[6] though in some circles the older dates 1504 BC to 1450 BC is preferred from the High Chronology.[7] These dates, just as all the dates of the eighteenth Dynasty, are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a Heliacal Rise of Sothis in the reign of Amenhotep I.[8] A papyrus from Amenhotep I's reign records this astronomical observation which, theoretically, could be used to perfectly correlate the Egyptian chronology with the modern calendar, however, to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known. This document has no note of the place of observation, but it can safely be assumed that it was taken in either a delta city such as Memphis or Heliopolis, or in Thebes. These two latitudes give dates twenty years apart, the High and Low chronologies, respectively. The length of Thutmose III's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the court official Amenemheb.[9] Amenemheb records Thutmose III's death to his master's fifty-fourth regnal year,[10] on the thirtieth day of the third month of Peret.[11] The day of Thutmose III's accession is known to be I Shemu day 4, and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact dates of the beginning and end of the king's reign (assuming the low chronology) from April 24 1479 BC to March 11 1425 BC respectively.[12] [edit]Thutmose's military campaigns\n\nFurther information: Djehuty (general) and The Taking of Joppa Widely considered a military genius by historians, Thutmose III made 16 raids in 20 years. He was an active expansionist ruler, sometimes called Egypt's greatest conqueror or \"the Napoleon of Egypt.\"[13] He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first Pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. His campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak, and are now transcribed into Urkunden IV. He is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of Egypt's warrior pharaohs, who transformed Egypt into an international superpower by creating an empire that stretched from southern Syria through to Canaan and Nubia.[14] In most of his campaigns his enemies were defeated town by town, until being beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a much weaker city or state one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved. Much is known about Thutmosis \"the warrior\", not only because of his military achievements, but also because of his royal scribe and army commander, Thanuny, who wrote about his conquests and reign. The prime reason why Thutmosis was able to conquer such a large number of lands, is because of the revolution and improvement in army weapons. He encountered only little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms, allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily. His army also had carried boats on dry land.\n\nFirst Campaign When Hatshepsut died on the tenth day of the sixth month of Thutmose III's twenty second year--according to information from a single stela from Armant--the king of Kadesh advanced his army to Megiddo.[15] Thutmose III mustered his own army and departed Egypt, passing through the border fortress of Tjaru (Sile) on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month.[16] Thutmose marched his troops through the coastal plain as far as Jamnia, then inland to Yehem, a small city near Megiddo, which he reached in the middle of the ninth month of the same year.[16] The ensuing Battle of Megiddo probably was the largest battle in any of Thutmose's seventeen campaigns.[17] A ridge of mountains jutting inland from Mount Carmel stood between Thutmose and Megiddo, and he had three potential routes to take.[17] The northern route and the southern route, both of which went around the mountain, were judged by his council of war to be the safest, but Thutmose, in an act of great bravery (or so he boasts, but such self praise is normal in Egyptian texts), accused the council of cowardice and took a dangerous route[18] through a mountain pass which he alleged was only wide enough for the army to pass \"horse after horse and man after man.\"[16] Despite the laudatory nature of Thutmose's annals, such a pass does indeed exist (although it is not quite so narrow as Thutmose indicates)[19] and taking it was a brilliant strategic move, since when his army emerged from the pass they were situated on the plain of Esdraelon, directly between the rear of the Canaanite forces and Megiddo itself.[17] For some reason, the Canaanite forces did not attack him as his army emerged,[18] and his army routed them decisively.[17] The size of the two forces is difficult to determine, but if, as Redford suggests, the amount of time it took to move the army through the pass may be used to determine the size of the Egyptian force, and if the number of sheep and goats captured may be used to determine the size of the Canaanite force, then both armies were around 10,000 men.[20] However most scholars do believe that the Egyptian army was more numerous. According to Thutmose III's Hall of Annals in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the battle occurred on \"Year 23, I Shemu [day] 21, the exact day of the feast of the new moon\"[21] \u2013 a lunar date. This date corresponds to May 9, 1457 BC based on Thutmose III's accession in 1479 BC. After victory in battle, however, his troops stopped to plunder the enemy and the enemy was able to escape into Megiddo.[22]. Thutmose was forced to besiege the city instead, but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months (see Siege of Megiddo).[22] This campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient Near East. By taking Megiddo, Thutmose gained control of all of northern Canaan, and the Syrian princes were obligated to send tribute and their own sons as hostages to Egypt.[23] Beyond the Euphrates, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite kings all gave Thutmose gifts, which he alleged to be \"tribute\" when he recorded it on the walls of Karnak.[24] The only noticeable absence is Mitanni, which would bear the brunt of the following Egyptian campaigns into Asia.\n\nTours of Canaan and Syria Thutmose's second, third, and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of Syria and Canaan to collect tribute.[25] Traditionally, the material directly after the text of the first campaign has been considered to be the second campaign.[26] This text records tribute from the area which the Egyptians called Retenu, (roughly equivalent to Canaan), and it was also at this time that Assyria paid a second \"tribute\" to Thutmose III.[27] However, it is probable that these texts come from Thutmose's fortieth year or later, and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all. If so, then so far, no records of this campaign have been found at all.[26].[28] This survey is dated to Thutmose's twenty-fifth year.[29] No record remains of Thutmose's fourth campaign whatsoever,[30] but at some point in time a fort was built in lower Lebanon and timber was cut for construction of a processional barque, and this probably fits best during this time frame.[31] [edit]Conquest of Syria The fifth, sixth, and seventh campaigns of Thutmose III were directed against the Phoenician cities in Syria and against Kadesh on the Orontes. In Thutmose's twenty-ninth year, he began his fifth campaign wherein he first took an unknown city (the name falls in a lacuna) which had been garrisoned by Tunip.[32] He then moved inland and took the city and territory around Ardata;[33] unlike previous plundering raids, however, Thutmose III subsequently garrisoned the area known as Djahy, which is probably a reference to southern Syria.[25] This subsequently permitted him to ship supplies and troops between Syria and Egypt.[33] Although there is no direct evidence for it, it is for this reason that some have supposed that Thutmose's sixth campaign, in his thirtieth year, commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly into to Byblos, bypassing Canaan entirely.[33] After the troops arrived in Syria by whatever means, they proceeded into the Jordan river valley and moved north from there, pillaging Kadesh's lands.[34] Turning west again, Thutmose took Simyra and quelled a rebellion in Ardata, which apparently had rebelled once again.[35] To stop such rebellions, Thutmose began taking hostages from the cities in Syria. The cities in Syria were not guided by the popular sentiment of the people so much as they were by the small number of nobles who were aligned to Mitanni: a king and a small number of foreign Maryannu.[34] Thutmose III found that by taking family members of these key people to Egypt as hostages, he could drastically increase their loyalty to him.[34] However, Syria did rebel yet again in Thutmose's thirty-first year, and he returned to Syria for his seventh campaign, took the port city of Ullaza[34] and the smaller Phoenician ports,[35] and took even more measures to prevent further rebellions.[34] All the excess grain which was produced in Syria was stored in the harbors he had recently conquered, and was used for the support of the military and civilian Egyptian presence ruling Syria.[34] This furthermore left the cities in Syria desperately impoverished, and with their economies in ruins, they had no means of funding a rebellion.[36] [edit]Attack on Mitanni After Thutmose III had taken control of the Syrian cities, the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of Mitanni, a Hurrian country with an Indo-Aryan ruling class. However, to reach Mitanni, he had to cross the Euphrates river. Therefore, Thutmose III enacted the following strategy. He sailed directly to Byblos[37] and then made boats which he took with him over land on what appeared to otherwise be just another tour of Syria,[35] and he proceeded with the usual raiding and pillaging as he moved north through the lands he had already taken.[38] However, here he continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish, and then quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats, taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise.[38] It appears that Mitanni was not expecting an invasion, so they had no army of any kind ready to defend against Thutmose, although their ships on the Euphrates did try to defend against the Egyptian crossing.[37] Thutmose III then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves (or at least this is the typically ignoble way Egyptian records chose to record it).[38] During this period of no opposition, Thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the Euphrates, next to the one his grandfather Thutmose I had put up several decades earlier.[38] Eventually a militia was raised to fight the invaders, but it fared very poorly.[38] Thutmose III then returned to Syria by way of Niy, where he records that he engaged in an elephant hunt.[39] He then collected tribute from foreign powers and returned to Egypt in victory.[37] [edit]Tours of Syria Thutmose III returned to Syria for his ninth campaign in his thirty-fourth year, but this appears to have been just a raid of the area called Nukhashshe, a region populated by semi-nomadic people.[40] The plunder recorded is minimal, so it was probably just a minor raid.[41] Records from his tenth campaign indicate much more fighting, however. By Thutmose's thirty-fifth year, the king of Mitanni had raised a large army and engaged the Egyptians around Aleppo.[42] As usual for any Egyptian king, Thutmose boasted a total crushing victory, but this statement is suspect. Specifically, it is doubted that Thutmose accomplished any great victory here due to the very small amount of plunder taken.[42] Specifically, Thutmose's annals at Karnak indicate he only took a total of ten prisoners of war.[43] He may simply have fought the Mitannians to a stalemate,[42] yet he did receive tribute from the Hittites after that campaign, which seems to indicate the outcome of the battle was in Thutmose's favor.[39] The next two campaigns are lost.[39] His eleventh is presumed to have happened in his thirty-sixth regnal year, and his twelfth is presumed to have happened in his thirty-seventh, since his thirteenth is mentioned at Karnak as happening in his thirty-eighth regnal year.[44] Part of the tribute list for his twelfth campaign remains immediately before his thirteenth begins, and the contents recorded (specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification) might indicate that it took place on the steppe around Nukhashashe, but this remains mere speculation.[45] In his thirteenth campaign Thutmose returned to Nukhashashe for a very minor campaign.[44] The next year, his thirty-ninth year, he mounted his fourteenth campaign against the Shasu. The location of this campaign is impossible to determine definitely, since the Shasu were nomads who could have lived anywhere from Lebanon to the Transjordan, to Edom.[46] After this point, the numbers given by Thutmose's scribes to his campaigns all fall in lacunae, so campaigns can only be counted by date. In his fortieth year, tribute was collected from foreign powers, but it is unknown if this was considered a campaign (i.e. if the king went with it or if it was led by an official).[47] Only the tribute list remains from Thutmose's next campaign in the annals,[48] and nothing may be deduced about it, except that it probably was another raid to the frontiers around Niy.[49] His final Asian campaign is better documented, however. Sometime before Thutmose's forty-second year, Mitanni apparently began spreading revolt among all the major cities in Syria.[49] Thutmose moved his troops by land up the coastal road and put down rebellions in the Arka plain and moved on Tunip.[49] After taking Tunip, his attention turned to Kadesh again. He engaged and destroyed three surrounding Mitannian garrisons and returned to Egypt in victory.[50] However, his victory in this final campaign was neither complete, nor permanent, since he did not take Kadesh,[50] and Tunip could not have remained aligned to him for very long, certainly not beyond his own death.[51] [edit]Nubian Campaign Thutmose took one last campaign in his fiftieth regnal year, very late in his life. He attacked Nubia, but only went so far as the fourth cataract of the Nile. Although no king of Egypt had ever penetrated so far as he did with an army, previous kings' campaigns had spread Egyptian culture that far already, and the earliest Egyptian document found at Gebel Barkal, in fact, comes from three years before Thutmose's campaign.[35]\n\nMonumental Construction Thutmose III was a great builder pharaoh and constructed over fifty temples, although some of these are now lost and only mentioned in written records.[7] He also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles, which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before. His reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture, paintings, and reliefs associated with construction, much of it beginning during the reign of Hatshepsut.\n\nArtistic developments Thutmose's architects and artisans showed great continuity with the formal style of previous kings, but several developments set him apart from his predecessors. Although he followed the traditional relief styles for most of his reign, after his forty-second year, he began having himself depicted wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and a \u0161ndyt-kilt, an unprecedented style.[52] Architecturally, his use of pillars also was unprecedented. He built Egypt's only known set of heraldic pillars, two large columns standing alone instead of being part of a set supporting the roof.[53] His jubilee hall was also revolutionary, and is arguably the earliest known building created in the basilica style.[53] Thutmose's artisans achieved new heights of skill in painting, and tombs from his reign were the earliest to be entirely painted, instead of painted reliefs.[52] Finally, although not directly pertaining to his monuments, it appears that Thutmose's artisans finally had learned how to use the skill of glass making\u2014developed in the early eighteenth dynasty\u2014to create drinking vessels by the core-formed method.[54] [edit]Karnak Thutmose dedicated far more attention to Karnak than any other site. In the Iput-isut, the temple proper in the center, he rebuilt the hypostyle hall of his grandfather Thutmose I, dismantled the red chapel of Hatshepsut, built Pylon VI, a shrine for the bark of Amun in its place, and built an antechamber in front of it, the ceiling of which was supported by his heraldic pillars.[53] He built a temenos wall around the central chapel containing smaller chapels, along with workshops and storerooms.[53] East of the main sanctuary, he built a jubilee hall in which to celebrate his Sed festival. The main hall was built in basilica style, with rows of pillars supporting the ceiling on each side of the aisle.[53] The central two rows were higher than the others to create windows where the ceiling was split.[53] Two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of Canaan which he took in his third campaign.[55]\n\nEast of the Iput-Isut, he erected another temple to Aten where he was depicted as being supported by Amun.[56] It was inside this temple that Thutmose planned on erecting his tekhen waty, or \"unique obelisk.\"[56] The tekhen waty was designed to stand alone, instead as part of a pair, and is the tallest obelisk ever successfully cut. It was not, however, erected until Thutmose IV raised it,[56] thirty five years later.[57] It was later moved to Rome and is known as the Lateran Obelisk. Another Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius I re-erected another obelisk from the Temple of Karnak in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, in 390 CE. Thus, two obelisks of Tuthmosis III's Karnak temple stand in Papal Rome and in Caesaropapist Constantinople, the two main historical capitals of the Roman Empire. Thutmose also undertook building projects to the south of the main temple, between the sanctuary of Amun and the temple of Mut.[56] Immediately to the south of the main temple, he built the seventh pylon on the north-south road which entered the temple between the fourth and fifth pylons.[56] It was built for use during his jubilee, and was covered with scenes of defeated enemies.[56] He set royal colossi on both sides of the pylon, and put two more obelisks on the south face in front of the gateway.[56] The eastern one's base remains in place, but the western one was transported to hippodrome in Constantinople.[56] farther south, alone the road, he put up pylon VIII which Hatshepsut had begun.[53] East of the road, he dug a sacred lake of 250 by 400 feet, and then placed another alabaster bark shrine near it.[53]\n\nThutmose's tomb, discovered by Victor Loret in 1898, is in the Valley of the Kings. It uses a plan which is typical of eighteenth dynasty tombs, with a sharp turn at the vestibule preceding the burial chamber. Two stairways and two corridors provide access to the vestibule which is preceded by a quadrangular shaft, or \"well\". The vestibule is decorated with the full story of the Book of Amduat, the first tomb to do so in its entirety. The burial chamber, which is supported by two pillars, is oval-shaped and its ceiling decorated with stars, symbolizing the cave of the deity Sokar. In the middle lies a large red quartzite sarcophagus in the shape of a cartouche. On the two pillars in the middle of the chamber there are passages from the Litanies of Re, a text that celebrates the later sun deity, who is identified with the pharaoh at this time. On the other pillar is a unique image depicting Thutmosis III being suckled by the goddess Isis in the guise of the tree. Thutmose III's tomb in the Valley of the Kings, (KV34), is the first one in which Egyptologists found the complete Amduat, an important New Kingdom funerary text. The wall decorations are executed in a simple, \"diagrammatic\" way, imitating the manner of the cursive script one might expect to see on a funerary papyrus rather than the more typically lavish wall decorations seen on most other royal tomb walls. The colouring is similarly muted, executed in simple black figures accompanied by text on a cream background with highlights in red and pink. The decorations depict the pharaoh aiding the deities in defeating Apep, the serpent of chaos, thereby helping to ensure the daily rebirth of the sun as well as the pharaoh's own resurrection.[58] [edit]Defacing of Hatshepsut's monuments\n\nUntil recently, a general theory has been that after the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut 'usurped' the throne from Thutmose III. Although Thutmose III was a co-regent during this time, early historians have speculated that Thutmose III never forgave his stepmother for denying him access to the throne for the first two decades of his reign.[59] However, in recent times this theory has been revised after questions arose as to why Hatshepsut would have allowed a resentful heir to control armies, which it is known he did. This view is supported further by the fact that no strong evidence has been found to show Thutmose III sought to claim the throne. He kept Hatshepsut's religious and administrative leaders. Added to this is the fact that the monuments of Hatshepsut were not damaged until at least twenty years after her death in the late reign of Thutmose III when he was quite elderly and in another coregency\u2014with his son who would become Amenhotep II\u2014who is known to have attempted to identify her works as his own. After her death, many of Hatshepsut's monuments and depictions were subsequently defaced or destroyed, including those in her famous mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri. Traditionally, these have been interpreted by early modern scholars to be evidence of acts of damnatio memoriae (condemning a person by erasure from recorded existence) by Thutmose III. However, recent research by scholars such as Charles Nims and Peter Dorman, has re-examined these erasures and found that the acts of erasure which could be dated, only began sometime during year forty-six or forty-seven of Thutmose's reign (c. 1433/2 BC).[60] Another often overlooked fact is that Hatshepsut was not the only one who received this treatment. The monuments of her chief steward Senenmut, who was closely associated with her rule, were similarly defaced where they were found.[61] All of this evidence casts serious doubt upon the popular theory that Thutmose III ordered the destruction in a fit of vengeful rage shortly after his accession. Currently, the purposeful destruction of the memory of Hatshepsut is seen as a measure designed to ensure a smooth succession for the son of Thutmose III, the future Amenhotep II, as opposed to any of the surviving relatives of Hatshepsut who may have had an equal, or better, claim to the throne. It also may be likely that this measure could not have been taken earlier\u2014until the passing of powerful religious and administrative officials who had served under both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III had occurred.[62] Later, Amenhotep II even claimed that he had built the items he defaced. [edit]Death and burial\n\nAccording to the American Egyptologist, Peter Der Manuelian, a statement in the tomb biography of an official named Amenemheb establishes that Thutmose III died on Year 54, III Peret day 30 of his reign after ruling Egypt for 53 years, 10 months, and 26 days. (Urk. 180.15) Thutmose III, hence, died just one month and four days shy of the start of his fifty-fourth regnal year.[63] When the co-regencies with Hatshepsut and Amenhotep II are deducted, he ruled alone as pharaoh for just over thirty of those years.\n\nMummy Thutmose III's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in 1881. He was interred along with those of other eighteenth and nineteenth dynasty leaders Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the twenty-first dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. While it is popularly thought that his mummy originally was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero in 1886, it was in fact first unwrapped by \u00c9mile Brugsch, the Egyptologist who supervised the evacuation of the mummies from the Deir el-Bahri Cache five years previously in 1881, soon after its arrival in the Boulak Museum. This was while Maspero was away in France, and the Director General of the Egyptian Antiquities Service ordered the mummy re-wrapped. So when it was \"officially\" unwrapped by Maspero in 1886, he almost certainly knew it was in relatively poor condition.[64] The mummy had been damaged extensively in antiquity by tomb robbers, and its wrappings subsequently cut into and torn by the Rassul family who had rediscovered the tomb and its contents only a few years before.[65] Maspero's description of the body provides an idea as to the magnitude of the damage done to the body: His mummy was not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the 20th dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the winding-sheet.[66] Of the face, which was undamaged, Maspero's says the following: Happily the face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Th\u00fbtmosis II, though with a greater show of energy.[66] Maspero was so disheartened at the state of the mummy, and the prospect that all of the other mummies were similarly damaged (as it turned out, few were in so poor a state), that he would not unwrap another for several years.[67] Unlike many other examples from the Deir el-Bahri Cache, the wooden mummiform coffin that contained the body was original to the pharaoh, though any gilding or decoration it might have had had been hacked off in antiquity. In his examination of the mummy, the anatomist, G. Eliot Smith, stated the height of Thutmose III's mummy to be 1.615m (5ft. 3.58in.).[68] This has led people to believe that Thutmose was a short man, but Smith measured the height of a body whose feet were absent, so he was undoubtedly taller than the figure given by Smith.[69] The mummy of Thutmose III now resides in the Royal Mummies Hall of the Cairo Museum, catalog number 61068.

During the first twenty-two years of Thutmose's reign he was co-regent with his stepmother, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. He hated his stepmother for talking him out of his power. While she is shown first on surviving monuments, both were assigned the usual royal names and insignia and neither is given any obvious seniority over the other.[3] He served as the head of her armies.\n\nAfter her death and his later rise to being the pharaoh of the kingdom, he created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen; no fewer than seventeen campaigns were conducted, and he conquered from Niya in north Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia. Officially, Thutmose III ruled Egypt for almost fifty-four years, and his reign is usually dated from April 24, 1479 BC to March 11, 1425 BC; however, this includes the twenty-two years he was co-regent to Hatshepsut\u2014his stepmother and aunt. During the final two years of his reign, he appointed his son\u2014and successor--Amenhotep II, as his junior co-regent. When Thutmose III died, he was buried in the Valley of the Kings as were the rest of the kings from this period in Egypt.\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II by a secondary wife, Iset.[4] Because he was the pharaoh's only son, he would have become the first in line for the throne when Thutmose II died. However, because he was not the son of his father's royal queen, his \"degree\" of royalty was less than ideal[5] . To bolster his qualifications, he may have married a daughter of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. It has been suggested that the daughter in question may have been Merytre-Hatshepsut, however, she is now proven not to have been a daughter of Hatshepsut.\n\nRegardless of this, when Thutmose II died Thutmose III was too young to rule, so Hatshepsut became his regent, soon his coregent, and shortly thereafter, she was declared to be the pharaoh. Thutmosis III had little power over the empire while Hatshepsut exercised the formal titulary of kingship, complete with a royal praenomen\u2014Maatkare. Her rule was quite prosperous and marked by great advancements. When he reached a suitable age and demonstrated the capability, she appointed him to head her armies. After the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmosis III ruled Egypt on his own for thirty years, until the last two years of his reign, when his son became a coregent for two years. He died in his fifty-fourth regal year.\n\nThutmosis III had two known wives: Satiah and Merytre-Hatshepsut. Satiah bore him his firstborn son, Amenemhat, but the child predeceased his father. His successor, the crown prince and future king Amenhotep II, was born to Merytre-Hatshepsut.\n\nStatue of Thutmosis III at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.\n\nThutmose III reigned from 1479 BC to 1425 BC according to the Low Chronology of Ancient Egypt. This has been the conventional Egyptian chronology in academic circles since the 1960s,[6] though in some circles the older dates 1504 BC to 1450 BC are preferred from the High Chronology of Egypt.[7] These dates, just as all the dates of the EighteeBold textnth Dynasty, are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a Heliacal Rise of Sothis in the reign of Amenhotep I.[8] A papyrus from Amenhotep I's reign records this astronomical observation which, theoretically, could be used to perfectly correlate the Egyptian chronology with the modern calendar; however, to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known. This document has no note of the place of observation, but it can safely be assumed that it was taken in either a Delta city such as Memphis or Heliopolis, or in Thebes. These two latitudes give dates twenty years apart, the High and Low chronologies, respectively.\n\nThe length of Thutmose III's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the court official Amenemheb.[9] Amenemheb records Thutmose III's death to his master's fifty-fourth regnal year,[10] on the thirtieth day of the third month of Peret.[11] The day of Thutmose III's accession is known to be I Shemu day 4, and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact dates of the beginning and end of the king's reign (assuming the low chronology) from April 24, 1479 BC to March 11, 1425 BC respectively.\n\nWidely considered a military genius by historians, Thutmose III made 16 raids in 20 years. He was an active expansionist ruler, sometimes called Egypt's greatest conqueror or \"the Napoleon of Egypt.\"[13] He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first Pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. His campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak, and are now transcribed into Urkunden IV. He is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of Egypt's warrior pharaohs, who transformed Egypt into an international superpower by creating an empire that stretched from southern Syria through to Canaan and Nubia.[14] In most of his campaigns his enemies were defeated town by town, until being beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a much weaker city or state one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved.\n\nMuch is known about Thutmosis \"the warrior\", not only because of his military achievements, but also because of his royal scribe and army commander, Thanuny, who wrote about his conquests and reign. The prime reason why Thutmosis was able to conquer such a large number of lands, is because of the revolution and improvement in army weapons. He encountered only little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms, allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily. His army also had carried boats on dry land.\n\nAnnals of Tuthmoses III at Karnak depicting him standing before the offerings made to him after his foreign campaigns\n\nWhen Hatshepsut died on the tenth day of the sixth month of Thutmose III's twenty second year \u2014 according to information from a single stela from Armant - the king of Kadesh advanced his army to Megiddo.[15] Thutmose III mustered his own army and departed Egypt, passing through the border fortress of Tjaru (Sile) on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month.[16] Thutmose marched his troops through the coastal plain as far as Jamnia, then inland to Yehem, a small city near Megiddo, which he reached in the middle of the ninth month of the same year.[16] The ensuing Battle of Megiddo probably was the largest battle in any of Thutmose's seventeen campaigns.[17] A ridge of mountains jutting inland from Mount Carmel stood between Thutmose and Megiddo, and he had three potential routes to take.[17] The northern route and the southern route, both of which went around the mountain, were judged by his council of war to be the safest, but Thutmose, in an act of great bravery (or so he boasts, but such self-praise is normal in Egyptian texts), accused the council of cowardice and took a dangerous route[18] through a mountain pass which he alleged was only wide enough for the army to pass \"horse after horse and man after man.\"\n\nDespite the laudatory nature of Thutmose's annals, such a pass does indeed exist (although it is not quite so narrow as Thutmose indicates)[19] and taking it was a brilliant strategic move, since when his army emerged from the pass they were situated on the plain of Esdraelon, directly between the rear of the Canaanite forces and Megiddo itself.[17] For some reason, the Canaanite forces did not attack him as his army emerged,[18] and his army routed them decisively.[17] The size of the two forces is difficult to determine, but if, as Redford suggests, the amount of time it took to move the army through the pass may be used to determine the size of the Egyptian force, and if the number of sheep and goats captured may be used to determine the size of the Canaanite force, then both armies were around 10,000 men.[20] However most scholars do believe that the Egyptian army was more numerous. According to Thutmose III's Hall of Annals in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the battle occurred on \"Year 23, I Shemu [day] 21, the exact day of the feast of the new moon\"[21] \u2013 a lunar date. This date corresponds to May 9, 1457 BC based on Thutmose III's accession in 1479 BC. After victory in battle, however, his troops stopped to plunder the enemy and the enemy was able to escape into Megiddo.[22]. Thutmose was forced to besiege the city instead, but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months (see Siege of Megiddo).[22]\n\nThis campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient Near East. By taking Megiddo, Thutmose gained control of all of northern Canaan, and the Syrian princes were obligated to send tribute and their own sons as hostages to Egypt.[23] Beyond the Euphrates, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite kings all gave Thutmose gifts, which he alleged to be \"tribute\" when he recorded it on the walls of Karnak.[24] The only noticeable absence is Mitanni, which would bear the brunt of the following Egyptian campaigns into Asia.\n\nThutmose III smiting his enemies. Relief on the seventh pylon in Karnak\n\nThutmose's second, third, and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of Syria and Canaan to collect tribute.[25] Traditionally, the material directly after the text of the first campaign has been considered to be the second campaign.[26] This text records tribute from the area which the Egyptians called Retenu, (roughly equivalent to Canaan), and it was also at this time that Assyria paid a second \"tribute\" to Thutmose III.[27] However, it is probable that these texts come from Thutmose's fortieth year or later, and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all. If so, then so far, no records of this campaign have been found at all.[26].[28] This survey is dated to Thutmose's twenty-fifth year.[29] No record remains of Thutmose's fourth campaign whatsoever,[30] but at some point in time a fort was built in lower Lebanon and timber was cut for construction of a processional barque, and this probably fits best during this time frame.\n\nThe fifth, sixth, and seventh campaigns of Thutmose III were directed against the Phoenician cities in Syria and against Kadesh on the Orontes. In Thutmose's twenty-ninth year, he began his fifth campaign where he first took an unknown city (the name falls in a lacuna) which had been garrisoned by Tunip.[32] He then moved inland and took the city and territory around Ardata[33], the town was pillaged and the wheat fields burnt. Unlike previous plundering raids, however, Thutmose III subsequently garrisoned the area known as Djahy, which is probably a reference to southern Syria.[25] This subsequently permitted him to ship supplies and troops between Syria and Egypt.[33] Although there is no direct evidence for it, it is for this reason that some have supposed that Thutmose's sixth campaign, in his thirtieth year, commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly into to Byblos, bypassing Canaan entirely.[33] After the troops arrived in Syria by whatever means, they proceeded into the Jordan river valley and moved north from there, pillaging Kadesh's lands.[34] Turning west again, Thutmose took Simyra and quelled a rebellion in Ardata, which apparently had rebelled once again.[35] To stop such rebellions, Thutmose began taking hostages from the cities in Syria. The cities in Syria were not guided by the popular sentiment of the people so much as they were by the small number of nobles who were aligned to Mitanni: a king and a small number of foreign Maryannu.[34] Thutmose III found that by taking family members of these key people to Egypt as hostages, he could drastically increase their loyalty to him.[34] However, Syria did rebel yet again in Thutmose's thirty-first year, and he returned to Syria for his seventh campaign, took the port city of Ullaza[34] and the smaller Phoenician ports,[35] and took even more measures to prevent further rebellions.[34] All the excess grain which was produced in Syria was stored in the harbors he had recently conquered, and was used for the support of the military and civilian Egyptian presence ruling Syria.[34] This furthermore left the cities in Syria desperately impoverished, and with their economies in ruins, they had no means of funding a rebellion.[36]\n\nAfter Thutmose III had taken control of the Syrian cities, the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of Mitanni, a Hurrian country with an Indo-Aryan ruling class. However, to reach Mitanni, he had to cross the Euphrates river. Therefore, Thutmose III enacted the following strategy. He sailed directly to Byblos[37] and then made boats which he took with him over land on what appeared to otherwise be just another tour of Syria,[35] and he proceeded with the usual raiding and pillaging as he moved north through the lands he had already taken.[38] However, here he continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish, and then quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats, taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise.[38] It appears that Mitanni was not expecting an invasion, so they had no army of any kind ready to defend against Thutmose, although their ships on the Euphrates did try to defend against the Egyptian crossing.[37] Thutmose III then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves (or at least this is the typically ignoble way Egyptian records chose to record it).[38] During this period of no opposition, Thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the Euphrates, next to the one his grandfather Thutmose I had put up several decades earlier.[38] Eventually a militia was raised to fight the invaders, but it fared very poorly.[38] Thutmose III then returned to Syria by way of Niy, where he records that he engaged in an elephant hunt.[39] He then collected tribute from foreign powers and returned to Egypt in victory.\n\nThutmose III returned to Syria for his ninth campaign in his thirty-fourth year, but this appears to have been just a raid of the area called Nukhashshe, a region populated by semi-nomadic people.[40] The plunder recorded is minimal, so it was probably just a minor raid.[41] Records from his tenth campaign indicate much more fighting, however. By Thutmose's thirty-fifth year, the king of Mitanni had raised a large army and engaged the Egyptians around Aleppo.[42] As usual for any Egyptian king, Thutmose boasted a total crushing victory, but this statement is suspect. Specifically, it is doubted that Thutmose accomplished any great victory here due to the very small amount of plunder taken.[42] Specifically, Thutmose's annals at Karnak indicate he only took a total of ten prisoners of war.[43] He may simply have fought the Mitannians to a stalemate,[42] yet he did receive tribute from the Hittites after that campaign, which seems to indicate the outcome of the battle was in Thutmose's favor.[39]\n\nThe next two campaigns are lost.[39] His eleventh is presumed to have happened in his thirty-sixth regnal year, and his twelfth is presumed to have happened in his thirty-seventh, since his thirteenth is mentioned at Karnak as happening in his thirty-eighth regnal year.[44] Part of the tribute list for his twelfth campaign remains immediately before his thirteenth begins, and the contents recorded (specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification) might indicate that it took place on the steppe around Nukhashashe, but this remains mere speculation.[45]\n\nIn his thirteenth campaign Thutmose returned to Nukhashashe for a very minor campaign.[44] The next year, his thirty-ninth year, he mounted his fourteenth campaign against the Shasu. The location of this campaign is impossible to determine definitely, since the Shasu were nomads who could have lived anywhere from Lebanon to the Transjordan, to Edom.[46] After this point, the numbers given by Thutmose's scribes to his campaigns all fall in lacunae, so campaigns can only be counted by date. In his fortieth year, tribute was collected from foreign powers, but it is unknown if this was considered a campaign (i.e. if the king went with it or if it was led by an official).[47] Only the tribute list remains from Thutmose's next campaign in the annals,[48] and nothing may be deduced about it, except that it probably was another raid to the frontiers around Niy.[49] His final Asian campaign is better documented, however. Sometime before Thutmose's forty-second year, Mitanni apparently began spreading revolt among all the major cities in Syria.[49] Thutmose moved his troops by land up the coastal road and put down rebellions in the Arka plain and moved on Tunip.[49] After taking Tunip, his attention turned to Kadesh again. He engaged and destroyed three surrounding Mitannian garrisons and returned to Egypt in victory.[50] However, his victory in this final campaign was neither complete, nor permanent, since he did not take Kadesh,[50] and Tunip could not have remained aligned to him for very long, certainly not beyond his own death.[51]\n\nThutmose took one last campaign in his fiftieth regnal year, very late in his life. He attacked Nubia, but only went so far as the fourth cataract of the Nile. Although no king of Egypt had ever penetrated so far as he did with an army, previous kings' campaigns had spread Egyptian culture that far already, and the earliest Egyptian document found at Gebel Barkal, in fact, comes from three years before Thutmose's campaign.\n\nThutmose III was a great builder pharaoh and constructed over fifty temples, although some of these are now lost and only mentioned in written records.[7] He also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles, which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before. His reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture, paintings, and reliefs associated with construction, much of it beginning during the reign of Hatshepsut.\n\nGlass making advanced during the reign of Thutmose III and this cup bears his name\n\nThutmose's architects and artisans showed great continuity with the formal style of previous kings, but several developments set him apart from his predecessors. Although he followed the traditional relief styles for most of his reign, after his forty-second year, he began having himself depicted wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and a \u0161ndyt-kilt, an unprecedented style.[52] Architecturally, his use of pillars also was unprecedented. He built Egypt's only known set of heraldic pillars, two large columns standing alone instead of being part of a set supporting the roof.[53] His jubilee hall was also revolutionary, and is arguably the earliest known building created in the basilica style.[53] Thutmose's artisans achieved new heights of skill in painting, and tombs from his reign were the earliest to be entirely painted, instead of painted reliefs.[52] Finally, although not directly pertaining to his monuments, it appears that Thutmose's artisans finally had learned how to use the skill of glass making\u2014developed in the early eighteenth dynasty\u2014to create drinking vessels by the core-formed method.[54]\n\n[edit]Karnak\n\nThutmose dedicated far more attention to Karnak than any other site. In the Iput-isut, the temple proper in the center, he rebuilt the hypostyle hall of his grandfather Thutmose I, dismantled the red chapel of Hatshepsut, built Pylon VI, a shrine for the bark of Amun in its place, and built an antechamber in front of it, the ceiling of which was supported by his heraldic pillars.[53] He built a temenos wall around the central chapel containing smaller chapels, along with workshops and storerooms.[53] East of the main sanctuary, he built a jubilee hall in which to celebrate his Sed festival. The main hall was built in basilica style, with rows of pillars supporting the ceiling on each side of the aisle.[53] The central two rows were higher than the others to create windows where the ceiling was split.[53] Two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of Canaan which he took in his third campaign.[55]\n\nThutmose's tekhen waty, today standing in Rome as the Lateran obelisk. The move from Egypt to Rome was initiated by Constantine the Great (Roman Emperor, 324-337) in 326, though he died before it could be shipped out of Alexandria. His son, the Emperor Constantius II completed the transfer in 357. An account of the shipment was written by contemporary historian Ammianus Marcellinus.\n\nEast of the Iput-Isut, he erected another temple to Aten where he was depicted as being supported by Amun.[56] It was inside this temple that Thutmose planned on erecting his tekhen waty, or \"unique obelisk.\"[56] The tekhen waty was designed to stand alone, instead as part of a pair, and is the tallest obelisk ever successfully cut. It was not, however, erected until Thutmose IV raised it,[56] thirty five years later.[57] It was later moved to Rome and is known as the Lateran Obelisk.\n\nAnother Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius I re-erected another obelisk from the Temple of Karnak in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, in 390 CE. Thus, two obelisks of Tuthmosis III's Karnak temple stand in Papal Rome and in Caesaropapist Constantinople, the two main historical capitals of the Roman Empire.\n\nThutmose also undertook building projects to the south of the main temple, between the sanctuary of Amun and the temple of Mut.[56] Immediately to the south of the main temple, he built the seventh pylon on the north-south road which entered the temple between the fourth and fifth pylons.[56] It was built for use during his jubilee, and was covered with scenes of defeated enemies.[56] He set royal colossi on both sides of the pylon, and put two more obelisks on the south face in front of the gateway.[56] The eastern one's base remains in place, but the western one was transported to hippodrome in Constantinople.[56] farther south, alone the road, he put up pylon VIII which Hatshepsut had begun.[53] East of the road, he dug a sacred lake of 250 by 400 feet, and then placed another alabaster bark shrine near it.[53]\n\nObelisk of Thutmosis III, at the base showing showing Theodosius the Great (Roman Emperor, 379-395). The obelisk is located in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. In 390, Theodosius had the obelisk cut into three pieces and brought to Constantinople. Only the top section survives, and it stands today where he placed it, on a marble pedestal.\n\nA scene from the Amduat on the walls of the tomb of Thutmose III, KV34, in the Valley of the Kings\n\nThutmose's tomb, discovered by Victor Loret in 1898, is in the Valley of the Kings. It uses a plan which is typical of eighteenth dynasty tombs, with a sharp turn at the vestibule preceding the burial chamber. Two stairways and two corridors provide access to the vestibule which is preceded by a quadrangular shaft, or \"well\". The vestibule is decorated with the full story of the Book of Amduat, the first tomb to do so in its entirety. The burial chamber, which is supported by two pillars, is oval-shaped and its ceiling decorated with stars, symbolizing the cave of the deity Sokar. In the middle lies a large red quartzite sarcophagus in the shape of a cartouche. On the two pillars in the middle of the chamber there are passages from the Litanies of Re, a text that celebrates the later sun deity, who is identified with the pharaoh at this time. On the other pillar is a unique image depicting Thutmosis III being suckled by the goddess Isis in the guise of the tree.\n\nThutmose III's tomb in the Valley of the Kings, (KV34), is the first one in which Egyptologists found the complete Amduat, an important New Kingdom funerary text. The wall decorations are executed in a simple, \"diagrammatic\" way, imitating the manner of the cursive script one might expect to see on a funerary papyrus rather than the more typically lavish wall decorations seen on most other royal tomb walls. The colouring is similarly muted, executed in simple black figures accompanied by text on a cream background with highlights in red and pink. The decorations depict the pharaoh aiding the deities in defeating Apep, the serpent of chaos, thereby helping to ensure the daily rebirth of the sun as well as the pharaoh's own resurrection.[58]\n\nDjeser-Djeseru is the main building of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri; designed by Senemut, the building is an example of perfect symmetry that predates the Parthenon, and it was the first complex built on the site she chose, which would become the Valley of the Kings\n\nUntil recently, a general theory has been that after the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut 'usurped' the throne from Thutmose III. Although Thutmose III was a co-regent during this time, early historians have speculated that Thutmose III never forgave his stepmother for denying him access to the throne for the first two decades of his reign.[59] However, in recent times this theory has been revised after questions arose as to why Hatshepsut would have allowed a resentful heir to control armies, which it is known he did. This view is supported further by the fact that no strong evidence has been found to show Thutmose III sought to claim the throne. He kept Hatshepsut's religious and administrative leaders. Added to this is the fact that the monuments of Hatshepsut were not damaged until at least twenty years after her death in the late reign of Thutmose III when he was quite elderly and in another coregency\u2014with his son who would become Amenhotep II\u2014who is known to have attempted to identify her works as his own.\n\nAfter her death, many of Hatshepsut's monuments and depictions were subsequently defaced or destroyed, including those in her famous mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri. Traditionally, these have been interpreted by early modern scholars to be evidence of acts of damnatio memoriae (condemning a person by erasure from recorded existence) by Thutmose III. However, recent research by scholars such as Charles Nims and Peter Dorman, has re-examined these erasures and found that the acts of erasure which could be dated, only began sometime during year forty-six or forty-seven of Thutmose's reign (c. 1433/2 BC).[60] Another often overlooked fact is that Hatshepsut was not the only one who received this treatment. The monuments of her chief steward Senenmut, who was closely associated with her rule, were similarly defaced where they were found.[61] All of this evidence casts serious doubt upon the popular theory that Thutmose III ordered the destruction in a fit of vengeful rage shortly after his accession.\n\nCurrently, the purposeful destruction of the memory of Hatshepsut is seen as a measure designed to ensure a smooth succession for the son of Thutmose III, the future Amenhotep II, as opposed to any of the surviving relatives of Hatshepsut who had an equal, or better, claim to the throne. It also may be likely that this measure could not have been taken earlier\u2014until the passing of powerful religious and administrative officials who had served under both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III had occurred.[62] Later, Amenhotep II even claimed that he had built the items he defaced.\n\nAccording to the American Egyptologist, Peter Der Manuelian, a statement in the tomb biography of an official named Amenemheb establishes that Thutmose III died on Year 54, III Peret day 30 of his reign after ruling Egypt for 53 years, 10 months, and 26 days. (Urk. 180.15) Thutmose III, hence, died just one month and four days shy of the start of his fifty-fourth regnal year.[63] When the co-regencies with Hatshepsut and Amenhotep II are deducted, he ruled alone as pharaoh for just over thirty of those years.\n\nMummified head of Thutmose III\n\nThutmose III's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in 1881. He was interred along with those of other eighteenth and nineteenth dynasty leaders Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the twenty-first dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun.\n\nWhile it is popularly thought that his mummy originally was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero in 1886, it was in fact first unwrapped by \u00c9mile Brugsch, the Egyptologist who supervised the evacuation of the mummies from the Deir el-Bahri Cache five years previously in 1881, soon after its arrival in the Boulak Museum. This was while Maspero was away in France, and the Director General of the Egyptian Antiquities Service ordered the mummy re-wrapped. So when it was \"officially\" unwrapped by Maspero in 1886, he almost certainly knew it was in relatively poor condition.[64]\n\nThe mummy had been damaged extensively in antiquity by tomb robbers, and its wrappings subsequently cut into and torn by the Rassul family who had rediscovered the tomb and its contents only a few years before.[65] Maspero's description of the body provides an idea as to the magnitude of the damage done to the body:\n\nHis mummy was not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the 20th dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the winding-sheet.\n\nOf the face, which was undamaged, Maspero's says the following:\n\nHappily the face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Th\u00fbtmosis II, though with a greater show of energy.[66]\n\nMaspero was so disheartened at the state of the mummy, and the prospect that all of the other mummies were similarly damaged (as it turned out, few were in so poor a state), that he would not unwrap another for several years.[67]\n\nUnlike many other examples from the Deir el-Bahri Cache, the wooden mummiform coffin that contained the body was original to the pharaoh, though any gilding or decoration it might have had had been hacked off in antiquity.\n\nIn his examination of the mummy, the anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith stated the height of Thutmose III's mummy to be 1.615m (5 ft. 3.58in.).[68] This has led people to believe that Thutmose was a short man, but Smith measured the height of a body whose feet were absent, so he was undoubtedly taller than the figure given by Smith.[69] The mummy of Thutmose III now resides in the Royal Mummies Hall of the Cairo Museum, catalog number 61068.\n\nThutmosis/Tuthmosis/Thutmose III, Son of Thoth, Pharaoh of Egypt, died circa 1425 BC.\n\n\n\nThutmose III was the sixth Pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty. During the first 22 years of his reign, he was co-regent with his stepmother and aunt Hatshepsut, famous for taking on the male role of Pharaoh. After her death and his later rise to pharaoh of the kingdom, Thutmose III created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen, through numerous successful campaigns. -\n\n3,400-Year-Old Underwater Temple from Era of Thutmosis III Discovered near Cairo"}, {"url": "https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/school-of-biblical-and-theological-studies/archaeology-museum/thutmoses-iii-scarab/", "page_content": "This scarab, which bears the name of Thutmose III, is one of many scarabs recovered from the ancient Near East that bear this pharaoh\u2019s name. Scarabs are distinctly Egyptian objects that were carved from various types of stones or other materials into the shape of small dung beetles. Scarabs were so common in ancient Egypt that there are many thousands of scarabs preserved today in various museums, private collections, and the antiquities market.1 While the tops of these artifacts simply resemble a beetle, their undersides were often decorated with geometric or figurative designs or inscribed with a name. Originally used in a religious context, the scarab-beetle was associated with the sun god Re and the god Atum, who was believed to have been involved in creation.2 Dung beetles were associated with the sun because of the perfect disc-shaped food balls they formed with their legs out of cattle dung. Over time, the myth developed that the sun was propelled across the sky by the forelegs of a large beetle and that these beetles appeared spontaneously from the sun.3 Scarabs, then, began being used as amulets by those who sought protection from evil.4 Although functions for scarabs expanded over the course of Egyptian history, they never lost their original use as a protective amulet.\n\nBeginning in the Middle Kingdom, names of persons often appeared on scarabs and were then used as seals, some of which were put on rings. The stamps of these seals have helped historians track the activities of the Egyptians in Palestine between the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period.5 In addition to their use as seals, the names of kings or figures of the pharaoh were also inscribed on scarabs, in hopes of bringing protection to the person possessing the scarab.6 Thus, the function of the scarab was expanded during this period, but its original use was also maintained through the invoking of the name of the king.\n\nDuring the New Kingdom, inscriptions on scarabs further broadened to include good luck sayings and other mottoes. The use of scarabs was also expanded to include various royal announcements (such as for an event or a coronation ceremony), and scarabs inscribed with the names of kings were collected at temples dedicated to deceased rulers.7 While many scarabs are inscribed with names, they only comprise a small number of scarabs as a whole (the vast majority of scarabs only depict geometric or figurative designs rather than names). In addition, from this smaller group of scarabs that are inscribed, the majority of scarabs bear the name of Thutmose III, like the one in the collection at Wheaton.8\n\nDating from the period of the New Kingdom, the scarab in Wheaton\u2019s collection that bears the name of Thutmose III could have been used as an amulet or souvenir from a religious site. Thutmose III was the sixth pharaoh during Egypt\u2019s Eighteenth Dynasty. He reigned in Egypt jointly with his aunt, Hatshepsut, for twenty-two years before becoming sole ruler of Egypt. He reigned alone for thirty-two years before sharing rule with his son, Amenhotep II, for a little more than two years before Thutmose\u2019s death. During the period of his sole reign, Thutmose III conducted military campaigns that successfully conquered all of Palestine as well as parts of Syria. The pharaoh went to great lengths to be sure his name would be remembered, such as building monuments in the Nile Valley. In the last years of his reign, he sought to eliminate the name of Hatshepsut from monuments and other structures that bore her name, replacing her name for his own or that of his son, Amenhotep II (who also assisted in this practice during the final years of his father\u2019s life).9\n\nIt seems that the majority of inscribed scarabs bear the name of Thutmose III because of his long reign and extensive military campaigns. The green stone out of which this scarab was carved is typical of many scarabs. Green scarabs were often carved out of jasper, feldspar, serpentine, and basalt.10 Although it is unknown exactly for what purpose this scarab was created, it was probably used as a good luck charm. Such scarabs were often worn by the person who possessed it (as can be visualized with the modern bead necklace attached to this scarab in Wheaton\u2019s collection).\n\n1 Sir W. M.

The Temple Mount Sifting Project has recently announced the discovery after the Israel Antiquities Authority conducted research on the amulet.\n\n\u201cWhile I was sifting, I came across a piece of pottery that was different from others I had seen, and I immediately thought that maybe I had found something special,\u201d said Neshama in the Temple Mount Sifting Project announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to find something thousands of years old from ancient Egypt all the way here in Jerusalem!\u201d\n\nIn the free eBook Ancient Israel in Egypt and the Exodus, top scholars discuss the historical Israelites in Egypt and archaeological evidence for and against the historicity of the Exodus.\n\nThe partially preserved amulet (its bottom is missing) is shaped like a pendant and measures less than an inch wide and a quarter of an inch thick. Made of clay, the pendant has a hole at the top where a string could be inserted to make a necklace. The front side of the pendant displays the cartouche of Thutmose III\u2014an oval frame that encircles the name of the pharaoh in hieroglyphs. The symbol of an eye is depicted above the cartouche, and to the right of the cartouche is the symbol of a cobra.\n\nThe sixth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty in the New Kingdom of Egypt, Thutmose III reigned from c. 1479 to 1425 B.C.E. Through his military campaigns in the Near East and Middle East, Thutmose III brought Canaan under Egyptian rule. The Egyptian pharaoh boasted of his conquests, including a decisive victory at Megiddo, on the walls of the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Egypt\u2019s authority over Canaan lasted for the next 200 years, which may explain why the amulet with the cartouche of Thutmose III was found in Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cThe amulet may have been buried in earth brought to the Temple Mount to be used as fill for the expansion of the Mount in Second Temple period,\u201d writes Zachi Dvira in the Temple Mount Sifting Project announcement. \u201cThis earth probably originated in the slopes of the Kidron Valley near the Temple Mount, an area which contained tombs of the Late Bronze Age (1550\u20131150 B.C.E.).\u201d\n\nNeshama Spielman\u2019s discovery represents the first time an amulet bearing the name of Thutmose III has been found in Jerusalem.

Thutmose III was a skilled warrior who brought the Egyptian empire to the zenith of its power by conquering all of Syria, crossing the Euphrates (see Tigris-Euphrates river system ) to defeat the Mitannians , and penetrating south along the Nile River to Napata in the Sudan. He also built a great number of temples and monuments to commemorate his deeds.\n\nIn the 22nd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, a formidable coalition was formed against Egypt , led by the king of Kadesh in northern Syria and no doubt supported by the Mitanni. At this moment of crisis, Hatshepsut died, and Thutmose as sole ruler began a series of annual military campaigns aimed at Nubia and the Levantine powers.\n\nAs he grew up, Thutmose may even have been entrusted with command of the army on campaign in Nubia ; he may have also fought in Gezer in Palestine . His grandfather Thutmose I had penetrated into northern Syria; Thutmose II, though far from a weakling, had not followed this success, and Hatshepsut may have been unwilling to send an army into the field. Thus, through inaction, Egyptian influence in Syria and Palestine declined. The sons and grandsons of the Syrian princes who had surrendered to Thutmose I no longer sent tribute, and the king of Mitanni , a powerful Mesopotamian kingdom with its capital beyond the Euphrates, was able to extend his control westward to the Mediterranean .\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II ; his mother was one of the king\u2019s secondary wives or a lesser harem queen, named Isis . Since there was no prince with a better claim to the throne, the boy was crowned king on the early death of his father; he was very young at the time. Hatshepsut \u2014the daughter of Thutmose I , the wife and sister of Thutmose II, and the mother of Thutmose III\u2019s half-sister Neferure\u2014acted as regent. By the seventh year of his reign this strong-minded and ambitious woman herself assumed the attributes, dress, and insignia of a king and to all intents and purposes reigned in his stead. As one of her courtiers says, \u201cshe directed the affairs of the whole land according to her wishes.\u201d Still, Thutmose was given an education befitting his royal station. He was taught all military skills, especially archery, which he demonstrated in public display, and horsemanship, in which he showed considerable prowess . He was later to boast that none among his followers could equal him in physical strength and in marksmanship.\n\nMilitary campaigns\n\nAfter a few months\u2019 preparation the king was ready to march at the head of his army. The first campaign is recorded in some detail on the walls of the temple he built at Karnak in Thebes, which describe the march to Gaza and thence to Yahmai south of the Carmel Range, the council of war, and the king\u2019s bold decision to surprise the enemy encamped at Megiddo, northeast of Carmel and about 18 miles (29 km) southeast of the modern city of Haifa. Thutmose\u2019s approach was by the route least expected\u2014a narrow defile over the mountain. It was successful: the enemy was defeated, and Megiddo was taken after a siege of eight months. In subsequent campaigns, which are less fully described in the annals, ports on the Phoenician coast were converted into Egyptian supply bases, and Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biq\u0101\u02bf (Bekaa) valley were taken.\n\nIn the 33rd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, the time was at last ripe for his most audacious move, an attack on the kingdom of Mitanni itself, which had grown stronger since the day when Thutmose I had taken its army by surprise. Thutmose planned the campaign well; pontoon boats were transported across Syria on oxcarts for the crossing of the Euphrates River. The ensuing encounter, which must have taken place on the eastern bank, is not described by the annalist; it resulted in the precipitate flight of the Mitannian king and the capture of 30 members of his harem and some hundreds of his soldiers. Triumphantly, Thutmose set up his commemorative inscription by the river\u2019s edge, next to that of his grandfather Thutmose I. It was his farthest point of advance. On the homeward journey he hunted elephant in the land of Niy, in the Orontes valley, and on his return he celebrated a great triumph at Thebes and dedicated prisoners and booty to the temple of the state god, Amon.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Native rulers, members of local ruling dynasties, were henceforward set to govern their own territories as vassals of Egypt and were bound by solemn oath to keep the peace, render annual tribute, and obey the Egyptian representative in the region, the \u201coverseer of foreign lands.\u201d Their sons were sent as hostages to Egypt and educated at court, so that in due course they might return to rule their inheritance, Egyptianized in outlook and sympathies. Fortresses were built, and Egyptian garrisons were stationed at key points along the coast and in the highlands.\n\nTo the south, Thutmose reaffirmed the southern boundary of Egyptian domination over Nubia as far as Kurgus, and at Napata, near Mount Barkal, he built a temple to Amon. He thoroughly subdued the turbulent Nubian tribes and employed many of them in the gold mines, which from his reign on became the basis of Egyptian wealth in foreign exchange with the princes of western Asia. For the last 12 years of his reign, he was content to enjoy the fruits of his victories. The tribute of Syria and Palestine and of the Sudan poured into his treasury; the annals list huge quantities of timber and metal ores, cattle, and grain delivered by the conquered. Minoan Crete and Cyprus, Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites sent gifts. The tombs of high officials of the reign are decorated with scenes depicting the reception of foreign envoys coming from places as far away as the Aegean and the Greek mainland to lay their rich and exotic gifts at the feet of the pharaoh. The prestige of Egypt had never been so great."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/thutmose-iii", "page_content": "Thutmose III (unknown-ca 1426 B.C.) wasted no time making a name for himself, once he was out from under the shadow of the over-reaching regent-turned-pharaoh Hatshepsut. He transformed Egypt from an inward-looking kingdom into a triumphant, conquering nation. And he established a reputation as a brilliant military strategist, one whom later historians would call the \u201cNapoleon of Egypt.\u201d\n\nJust a few months after coming to power, Thutmose III marched with an army of 20,000 soldiers to Megiddo, in modern-day northern Israel\u2014a site better known by its Greek name, Armageddon. A coalition of opponents had gathered there, outside the city. Scribes traveled with Thutmose III\u2019s forces and recorded the campaign\u2019s details, an invaluable chronicle now known as the Annals of Thutmose III.\n\n5:58\n\nThe pharaoh defied his advisers and surprised his foes by surging through a treacherous mountain pass to mount a deadly direct attack on Megiddo. He rode up front during that perilous advance to show that he trusted in the gods to protect him and his troops, and indeed, all made it through the pass unscathed. Then he entered battle at Megiddo \u201con a chariot of fine gold, decked in his shining armor,\u201d dazzling and intimidating his opponents, who soon gave up the fight and retreated to their last bastion of safety within the city walls. Thutmose III laid siege to Megiddo for seven months, mercilessly starving out its remaining inhabitants until they surrendered.\n\nThutmose III flexed his military might repeatedly: in Nubia, in Phoenician ports, in the valuable trade center of Kadesh, and in the kingdom of Mitanni, in modern-day Syria and Turkey. Over the course of 17 campaigns, he secured more territory than any other pharaoh. By the end, he controlled Egypt\u2019s largest ever empire.

But he also secured human capital from his captured lands. The sons of conquered rulers were taken to Egypt and educated at court. Acclimated to Egyptian ways, those offspring returned home sympathetic to Egyptian rule.\n\nUnlike one of his later successors, Ramses II\u2014who exaggerated his military achievements\u2014Thutmose III earned the triumphs recorded on the numerous monuments he built.

And by destroying\u2014albeit incompletely\u2014references to Hatshepsut and her reign, Thutmose III fashioned a direct line to his eponymous predecessors, strengthening his claim and his legacy as the rightful and most powerful ruler of Egypt.\n\nThis text is an excerpt from the National Geographic special issue The Most Influential Figures of Ancient History."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/Thutmose_III/", "page_content": "Thutmose III (also known as Tuthmosis III, r. 1458-1425 BCE) was the 6th king of Egypt's 18th Dynasty, one of the greatest military leaders in antiquity, and among the most effective and impressive monarchs in Egypt's history. His throne name, Thutmose, means 'Thoth is Born', while his birth name, Menkhperre, means 'Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra'.\n\nBoth of these throne names reference important deities of ancient Egypt Thoth, the god of writing and wisdom, and Ra, the supreme god of the sun. Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II and a lesser wife named Iset. Thutmose II (r. 1492-1479 BCE) was married to Queen Hatshepsut (r. 1479-1458 BCE), royal daughter of Thutmose I (r. 1520-1492 BCE) and a powerful woman who held the position of God's Wife of Amun.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Hatshepsut became regent of Egypt since Thutmose III was too young to rule. She was supposed to maintain this position but, instead, declared herself pharaoh and ruled independently. Thutmose III, when he came of age and proved himself able, was given command of the armed forces by his step-mother; a choice she would not regret as he proved himself an exceptional military strategist and charismatic leader. He is often referred to in the present day as 'the Napoleon of Egypt', but unlike Napoleon, Thutmose III never lost a single engagement, expanded and maintained his empire, and was worshiped by his people for centuries after his death.\n\nYouth Under Hatshepsut & Rise to Power\n\nThutmose III was born c. 1481 BCE and was only three years old when his father died and Hatshepsut was made regent and then reigning monarch. He grew up at the royal court of Thebes, capital of Egypt throughout most of the period of the New Kingdom (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE). Although there is little documentation of his life during this time, a great emphasis was placed on the physical and intellectual development of princes during the New Kingdom of Egypt as they were expected to one day rule over an expanding empire.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThutmose III, therefore, would have spent a great deal of time in school, at athletics, and learning about military tactics and strategies. He probably went along on the early campaigns Hatshepsut commissioned as this was a common practice among New Kingdom pharaohs to acquaint their successors with warfare at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III developed skills in archery, horsemanship, hand-to-hand combat, and athletic ability. There is no doubt that military training was his priority but his education went far beyond battle tactics and the use of weapons; his later reign makes clear he was a highly cultured and sophisticated man who was aware of the value of cultures beyond Egypt's borders, recognized the importance of art and music, and had a great respect for human life.\n\nStatue of King Thutmose III Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (Copyright)\n\nWhile he was growing up, his step-mother was reigning over one of the most prosperous periods in Egypt's history. After the initial campaigns to secure her position, there were no others throughout Hatshepsut's reign and the army was only deployed in small troops to protect trade expeditions and to maintain the borders. Hatshepsut did not allow her military to stand idle, however, or weaken as evidenced by how quickly Thutmose III was able to mobilize and lead the armies once he came to power.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nHatshepsut may have married her daughter Neferu-Ra to Thutmose III in order to secure succession but it does not seem, after his youth, that he spent much time at court. Orientalist James Henry Breasted has suggested he would have probably lived among the soldiers from a fairly early age in order to stay out of Hatshepsut's way and prove himself useful to her reign. It was common enough for noble princes to be removed at the discretion of a reigning monarch who perceived them as a threat and Thutmose III shows too great an ambition to have made himself so vulnerable.\n\nThat he succeeded in his plans is evidenced by the fact that, before the end of her reign, Hatshepsut had placed him in command of her armies. Her reign ended with her death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III came to the throne. Hatshepsut had maintained a tight control of Egypt's borders and provinces, but with her death, the kings of Egyptian-controlled states in Canaan and Syria rebelled. Thutmose III was not interested in negotiation and certainly was not going to let these provinces simply leave the empire, and so he set out on his first military campaign.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years. He ordered the details of his victories to be inscribed at the Temple of Amun at Karnak and they are considered the most extensive records of ancient Egyptian military campaigns extant. His first is his most famous \u2013 The Battle of Megiddo \u2013 and is the one described in the most exacting narrative. His later campaigns lose this form and are given with less detail, appearing more as lists of spoils than narratives of the king's victories.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years.\n\nThe reason for the decline in narrative form is not clear, but the claim of some scholars that it indicates a stronger cohesion of the state in which pragmatic lists of goods superseded narratives of a pharaoh's victory is untenable; there are a number of such narratives in the centuries following Thutmose III's reign, most notably that of Ramesses II (r. 1279-1213 BCE) concerning Kadesh and Ramesses III (r. 1186-1155 BCE) regarding his victory over the Sea Peoples. The most reasonable explanation for the brevity of the later inscriptions is simply that the writer of the Megiddo narrative died.\n\nThe story of the Battle of Megiddo was written by Thutmose III's private secretary, military scribe, and general Tjaneni (also given as Thanuny, c. 1455 BCE) who was with him throughout the event. Tjaneni kept a journal on a leather scroll (later deposited for posterity at the Temple of Amun in Thebes) which Thutmose III so admired he ordered the narrative inscribed on the walls of the temple as well as those of others throughout Egypt.\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief fully aware of his abilities and those of his troops and completely confident of victory. In the most famous passage of the account, the pharaoh calls a conference with his senior staff to discuss marching orders to Megiddo and tells them they will be taking the narrow road from Aruna, on which the army will have to march single-file, rather than either of the wider and more easily travelled roads which were available.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe generals object to this, arguing that they have intelligence the enemy is waiting for them at the pass to the plains of Megiddo from the Aruna road and their rearguard will still be marching while the vanguard is engaged with the enemy. Thutmose III hears their counsel but disagrees, telling them that they may take whatever road they choose but he will be leading his army along the Aruna road and will be leading from the front. The generals then agree to follow wherever he chooses to take them.\n\nHis decision on the Aruna road was characteristic of Thutmose III's resolve to pursue a course he considered best regardless of the difficulties. The armies would have had an easier time on the other roads \u2013 especially considering that, on the Aruna path, they had to dismantle and carry the chariots and supply wagons \u2013 but it would have cost the army the element of surprise which Thutmose III recognized as imperative.\n\nTemple of Karnak, Wars of Thutmose III Michael Lusk (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nAs it turned out, the enemy was not waiting at the end of the Aruna road but on the two easier paths which they expected Thutmose III to take at the head of so large an army. No one expected him to lead his forces along what was essentially a cattle path. After giving his army a night to rest and refresh themselves, he ordered the attack the next morning, leading from the front, and drove his opponents from the field. The report then details how his army, delighted at the victory, gathered treasures from the fallen instead of pursuing survivors and taking the city. This cost Thutmose III complete victory on the field that day because it gave the people of Megiddo time to prepare their defenses.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nEven so, Thutmose III marched on the city, surrounded it with a moat and a stockade, and lay siege to it for seven or eight months until it surrendered. He offered very generous terms to the people \u2013 none of the surviving ringleaders of the revolt were executed \u2013 which essentially came down to a promise not to incite rebellion in the future. He then turned his army around and marched back home with his enormous loot from the campaign, pausing only to harvest the crops of the defeated and bring them back to Egypt.\n\nAt Megiddo, he also initiated a policy he would adhere to throughout all his campaigns of bringing the noble children of the defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. These children were held as hostages to guarantee the good behavior of their parents but were treated with all the respect due to royalty, housed in the palace, and given many freedoms. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where, since they had now spent their youth in Egypt, they supported and encouraged Egyptian culture and the state's interests when they were elevated to positions of power.\n\nThutmose III's victory at Megiddo gave him control of northern Canaan from which he would launch his campaign into Syria to take Kadesh. He campaigned against the Mitanni and erected a stele at the Euphrates River, commemorated in his inscription at Karnak, known as Thutmose III's Hymn of Victory. His Nubian campaigns were equally successful, and by his 50th year, he had expanded Egypt's holdings beyond any of his predecessors and made the country wealthier than it had been since the beginning of the 4th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nPatron of the Arts\n\nHis reign was not only focused on military conquest, however, as his patronage of the arts shows. Thutmose III commissioned upwards of 50 temples, numerous tombs, monuments, and contributed more significantly to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than any other pharaoh. His renovations and additions to the Karnak temple, in fact, are among the most significant in that they preserve the names of past kings (whose monuments he would sometimes remove in his renovations) and provide narratives of his own campaigns and initiatives which have proven to be extremely important to scholars in the study of the culture.\n\nTemple of Amun, Karnak Dennis Jarvis (CC BY-SA)\n\nArtistic techniques and experimentation reached new heights under Thutmose III. Glass-making had been known for centuries but was now perfected to the point where drinking vessels could be made of glass. Statuary was less idealized and more realistic \u2013 a trend begun in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2040-1782 BCE) \u2013 but abandoned in favor of the traditional idealism in art established during the Old Kingdom. Thutmose III is depicted in his statuary as a tall, handsome man in excellent physical condition and this is considered a realistic portrayal in that, first, all depictions are uniform and, second, depictions of others \u2013 also consistent \u2013 are far from flattering.\n\nHis artisans produced some of the finest work in Egypt's history including elaborate tombs decorated with intricate paintings and freestanding columns as well as contributing enormous pylons to Karnak. In keeping with Egypt's respect for and love of nature, he encouraged public parks and gardens, created lakes and ponds for the people's recreation and enjoyment, and had a private garden cultivated both around his palace and at Karnak temple.\n\nDefacement of Hatshepsut's Monuments\n\nHis artistic sensibilities and respect for others are at odds with a policy almost universally ascribed to him: the desecration of Hatshepsut's monuments and the attempt to erase her name from history. Scholars are divided on when this happened in his reign but it was certainly not in the early years. Whenever it transpired, the name and images of Hatshepsut were removed from all public monuments as well as the exterior and some of the interior work at her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri.\n\nTo remove a person's name was to condemn them to non-existence; one needed to be remembered in order to continue one's eternal journey in the afterlife. Further, it was thought that the deceased needed daily sustenance in the form of food and drink offerings delivered to their tombs, where their body was preserved through mummification and statues representing them enabled their soul to visit and partake of these offerings. The so-called Execration Texts of ancient Egypt make clear that the removal of one's name was only justified if that person had committed some serious offense, but there is no evidence of Hatshepsut being involved with any such crimes.\n\nTemple of Hatshepsut, Aerial View N/A (CC BY)\n\nMost likely, Thutmose III ordered this action to prevent Hatshepsut from standing as a role model for future women who might aspire to rule. The position of the monarch of Egypt was traditionally occupied by males and, by assuming power for herself, Hatshepsut had departed from this practice. The first king of Egypt was thought to have been the god Osiris who was murdered by his brother Set and brought back to life by his sister-wife Isis. He was finally succeeded by his son Horus who defeated Set, took back the throne, and re-established order in the land. Kings associated themselves with Horus during their reign and with Osiris, who became Lord of the Dead, in the afterlife; there was no place in this narrative for a woman to hold supreme power.\n\nThe central cultural value of ancient Egypt was ma'at (harmony and balance) and this relied largely on an adherence to tradition. Ancient Egyptians are often characterized as conservative for this reason: departure from tradition could result in a loss of stability \u2013 balance \u2013 and the return of primordial chaos. It was the duty of the pharaoh to maintain ma'at and this is probably the motivation behind Thutmose III's eradication of Hatshepsut's name.\n\nHe backdated his reign to remove all evidence of her ever having ruled Egypt and replaced some of her images in her mortuary temple with his own. All of her public monuments were torn down \u2013 especially those at Karnak \u2013 and replaced by his, though, at other sites, only her name was removed. So thorough was this erasure of his predecessor that Hatshepsut's name was unknown in Egypt's history until the 19th century CE. Later kings of Egypt thought the beautiful Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri was built by Thutmose III, and many of them would claim her impressive monuments as their own.\n\nThutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly.\n\nIt has been suggested that Thutmose III had nothing to do with these actions and that they were perpetrated by his son and successor Amenhotep II (r. 1425-1400 BCE) either in the latter part of Thutmose III's reign or the beginning of his own. Although this is possible, it does not seem probable in that, by the time of Amenhotep II, Thutmose III had already ordered Hatshepsut's works at Karnak removed and replaced by his own. Further, the image and name of Hatshepsut was left intact within the interior of her mortuary temple.\n\nIf Amenhotep II, who never knew Hatshepsut, was trying to erase her from history, it is unlikely he would have spared her memory anywhere. Leaving her name and image intact, but out of the public eye, suggests that Thutmose III was only interested in maintaining the tradition of a male pharaoh in Egypt's history but did not wish his step-mother any ill will.\n\nWhen he died, of natural causes, in c. 1425 BCE, he was buried in his own mortuary temple beside that of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri. Even though he had basically claimed her temple as his own, he still would not have had his eternal resting place located so close to hers if he had sincerely believed she deserved to be sentenced to non-existence.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unfortunate result of this action is that, ever since the rediscovery of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III is as often referenced for her eradication as he is for his many accomplishments and magnificent reign. Thutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly. He elevated Egypt's status as a powerful and prosperous nation, employed the people in monumental building projects, and epitomized the ideal of the valiant Egyptian warrior-king who led his forces to successive victories.\n\nThutmose III's consideration for his enemies in defeat and gentle treatment of them made him respected far beyond the boundaries of his country. He established an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, through Syria and the Levant, down through Nubia to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile.\n\nAlthough there is little doubt that the people of these lands would have preferred their independence, they prospered under his reign through the peace he established and maintained through his military and diplomatic skills. In every respect, Thutmose III represented the ideal pharaoh to his people and his memory has endured to the present day as one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/royalty/thutmose-iii", "page_content": "(-1426)\n\nSynopsis\n\nThutmose III was born c. 1504 B.C.E.

Burial KV34 Monuments Cleopatra's Needles\n\nThutmose III (sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis III and meaning Thoth is Born) was the sixth Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. During the first 22 years of Thutmose's reign he was merely lesser coregent to his stepmother, Hatshepsut. After her death and his subsequent gain of power over his kingdom, he created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen; conducting no less than 17 campaigns and conquering from Niy in north Syria to the fourth cataract of the Nile in Nubia. After his years of great campaigns were over, he established himself as a great builder pharaoh as well. He was responsible for building over 50 temples in Egypt and building massive additions to Egypt's chief temple at Karnak. New highs in artistic skills were reached during his reign, as well as unique architectural developments never seen before and never again after his reign. When he died, he was buried in the Valley of the Kings like the rest of the kings from this period in Egypt, and was succeeded by his son Amenhotep II, with whom he seems to have had a short coregency. Thutmose III ruled for almost 54 years, and his reign is usually dated from April 24, 1479 B.C.E. , to March 11, 1425 B.C.E.\n\nFamily\n\nThutmose III was the son of Pharaoh Thutmose II and Aset (sometimes transliterated Isis), a secondary wife of Thutmose II.[2] Because he was his father's only son, he took the throne when Thutmose II died, however because he was not the son of his father's Queen, Hatshepsut, his \"degree\" of royalty, so to speak, was less than ideal.[3] To bolster his image, he may have married a daughter of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut.[4] Neferure and Merytre-Hatshepsut II have been suggested, but in the case of the former it is uncertain if they were ever married,[5] and in the case of the latter it is doubtful if Merytre-Hatshepsut was Hatshepsut's daughter.[5] Regardless of this, when Thutmose II died Thutmose III was too young to rule, so Hatshepsut became his regent and soon coregent, declaring herself to be the Pharaoh.[4] For approximately 22 years Thutmose III had little power over the empire while Hatshepsut assumed the formal titulary of kingship complete with a royal prenomen\u2014Maatkare. After the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III ruled Egypt on his own for 32 years until his death in his 54th regnal year.[6]\n\nBesides the possible marriage to Neferure, Thutmose III had two known wives. Sat-jah bore his firstborn, Amenemhet, but the child preceded his father in death.[5] His successor, Amenhotep II, was born to Merytre-Hatshepsut II, who most modern scholars think was not Hatshepsut's daughter.[5]\n\nThutmose III ruled from 1479 B.C.E. to 1425 B.C.E. according to the Low Chronology of Ancient Egypt. This has been the dominant theory in academic circles since the 1960s,[7] yet in some academic circles the dates 1504 B.C.E. to 1450 B.C.E. are still preferred.[8] These dates, like all the dates of the 18th Dynasty, are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a Heliacal Rise of Sothis in the reign of Amenhotep I.[9] A papyrus from Amenhotep I's reign records this astronomical observation which could theoretically be used to perfectly correlate the Egyptian chronology with the modern calendar, however to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known. This document has no note of the place of observation, but it can safely be assumed that it was taken in either a delta city like Memphis or Heliopolis, or in Thebes. These two latitudes give dates 20 years apart, the High and Low chronologies, respectively.\n\nThe length of Thutmose III's reign, is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the court official Amenemheb.[10] He assigns his death to his 54th regnal year,[11] on the thirtieth day of the third month of Proyet.[12] The day of his accession is known to be I Shemu day 4, and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact dates of the beginning and end of his reign (assuming the low chronology) from April 24, 1479 B.C.E. to March 11, 1425 B.C.E. , respectively.[13]\n\nThutmose's military campaigns\n\nWidely considered a military genius by historians, he was an active expansionist ruler who is sometimes called Egypt's greatest conqueror or \"the Napoleon of Egypt.\"[14] He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during 17 known military campaigns. He was the first Pharaoh to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. His campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak, and are now transcribed into Urkunden IV. He is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of Egypt's warrior pharaohs, who transformed Egypt into an international superpower by creating an empire that stretched from southern Syria through to Canaan and Nubia.[15]\n\nThutmose III appears to have first led two military excursions while he was reigning under Hatshepsut; these are not considered part of his 17 campaigns, and predate his first campaign. One appears to have been to Syria and the other apparently to Nubia. These would have been late in Hatshepsut's reign, when Thutmose was apparently growing restless.[8]\n\nMuch is known about Thutmosis \"the warrior,\" not only because of his military achievements, but also because of his royal scribe and army commander, Thanuny, who wrote about his conquests and reign. The prime reason why Thutmosis was able to conquer such a large number of lands, is because of the revolution and improvement in army weapons. His army had also carried boats on dry land.\n\nAnnals of Tuthmoses III at Karnak depicting him standing before the offerings made to him after his foreign campaigns.\n\nFirst Campaign\n\nWhen Hatshepsut died on the tenth day of the sixth month of Thutmose III's twenty second year, the king of Kadesh moved his army to Megiddo.[16] Thutmose III mustered his own army and departed Egypt, passing through the border fortress of Tjaru (Sile) on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month.[17] Thutmose marched his troops through the coastal plain as far as Jamnia, then inland to Yehem, a small city near Megiddo, which he reached in the middle of the ninth month of the same year.[17] The ensuing Battle of Megiddo was probably the largest battle in any of Thutmose's 17 campaigns.[18] A ridge of mountains jutting inland from Mount Carmel stood between Thutmose and Megiddo, and he had three potential routes to take.[18] The northern route and the southern route, both of which went around the mountain, were judged by his council of war to be the safest, but Thutmose, in an act of great bravery (or so he claims, but such self praise is normal in Egyptian texts), accused the council of cowardice and took a dangerous route[19] through a mountain pass which he alleged was only wide enough for the army to pass \"horse after horse and man after man.\"[17]\n\nDespite the laudatory nature of Thutmose's annals, such a pass does indeed exist (although it is not quite as narrow as Thutmose indicates)[20]) and taking it was a brilliant strategic move, since when his army emerged from the pass they were situated on the plain of Esdraelon directly between the rear of the Canaanite forces and Megiddo itself.[18] For some reason, the Canaanite forces did not attack him as his army emerged,[19] and his army routed them decisively.[18] The size of the two forces is difficult to determine, but if, as Redford suggests, the amount of time it took to move the army through the pass can be used to determine the size of the Egyptian force, and if the number of sheep and goats captured can be used to determine the size of the Canaanite force, then both armies were around 10,000 men.[21] According to Thutmose III's Hall of Annals in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the battle occurred on \"Year 23, I Shemu [day] 21, the exact day of the feast of the new moon\"[22] \u2013 a lunar date. This date corresponds to May 9, 1457 B.C.E. based on Thutmose III's accession in 1479 B.C.E. After victory in battle, however, his troops stopped to plunder the enemy and the enemy was able to escape into Megiddo.[23]. Thutmose was forced to besiege the city instead, but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months (see Siege of Megiddo).[23]\n\nThis campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient Near East. By taking Megiddo, Thutmose gained control of all of northern Canaan, and the Syrian princes were obligated to send tribute and their own sons as hostages to Egypt.[24] Beyond the Euphrates, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite kings all gave Thutmose gifts, which he alleged to be \"tribute\" when he recorded it on the walls of Karnak.[25] The only noticeable absence is Mitanni, which would bear the brunt of the following Egyptian campaigns into Asia.\n\nTours of Canaan and Syria\n\nThutmose's second, third, and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of Syria and Canaan to collect tribute.[26] Traditionally, the material directly after the text of the first campaign has been considered to be the second campaign.[27] This text records tribute from the area which the Egyptians called Retenu (roughly equivalent to Canaan), and it was also at this time that Assyria paid a second \"tribute\" to Thutmose III.[28] However, it is probable that these texts come from Thutmose's 40th year or later, and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all. If so, then no records of this campaign have been found at all so far.Cite error: Closing </ref> missing for <ref> tag This survey is dated to Thutmose's 25th year.[29] No record remains of Thutmose's fourth campaign whatsoever,[30] but at some point in time a fort was built in lower Lebanon and timber was cut for construction of a processional barque, and this probably fits best during this timeframe.[31]\n\nConquest of Syria\n\nThe fifth, sixth, and seventh campaigns of Thutmose III were directed against the Phoenician cities in Syria and against Kadesh on the Euphrates. In Thutmose's 29th year, he began his fifth campaign wherein he first took an unknown city (the name falls in a lacuna) which had been garrisoned by Tunip.[32] He then moved inland and took the city and territory around Ardata.[33] Unlike previous plundering raids, however, Thutmose III subsequently garrisoned the area known as Djahy, which is probably a reference to southern Syria.[34] This now permitted him to ship supplies and troops back and forth between Syria and Egypt.[33] Although there is no direct evidence for it, it is for this reason that some have supposed that Thutmose's sixth campaign, in his 30th year, commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly into to Byblos, bypassing Canaan entirely.[33] After the troops arrived in Syria by whatever means, they proceeded into the Jordan river valley and moved north from there, pillaging Kadesh's lands.[35] Turning west again, Thutmose took Simyra and quelled a rebellion in Ardata, which had apparently rebelled once again.[36] To stop such rebellions, Thutmose began taking hostages from the cities in Syria. The cities in Syria were not guided by the popular sentiment of the people as much as they were by the small number of nobles who were aligned to Mitanni: a king and a small number of foreign Maryannu.[35] Thutmose III found that by taking family members of these key people to Egypt as hostages, he could drastically increase their loyalty to him.[35] However, Syria did rebel yet again in Thutmose's 31st year, and he returned to Syria for his seventh campaign, took the port city of Ullaza[35] and the smaller Phoenician ports,[36] and took even more measures to prevent further rebellions.[35] All the excess grain which was produced in Syria was stored in the harbors he had recently conquered, and was used for the support of the military and civilian Egyptian presence ruling Syria.[35] This furthermore left the cities in Syria desperately impoverished, and with their economies in ruins, they had no means of funding a rebellion.[37]\n\nAttack on Mitanni\n\nAfter Thutmose III had taken control of the Syrian cities, the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of Mitanni, a Hurrian country with an Indo-Aryan ruling class. However, to reach Mitanni, he had to cross the Euphrates river. Therefore, Thutmose III enacted the following strategy. He sailed directly to Byblos[38] and then made boats which he took with him over land on what appeared to otherwise be just another tour of Syria,[36] and he proceeded with the usual raiding and pillaging as he moved north through the lands he had already taken.[39] However, here he continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish, and then quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats, taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise.[39] It appears that Mitanni was not expecting an invasion, so they had no army of any kind ready to defend against Thutmose, although their ships on the Euphrates did try to defend against the Egyptian crossing.[38] Thutmose III then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves (or at least this is the typically ignoble way Egyptian records chose to record it).[39] During this period of no opposition, Thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the Euphrates, next to the one his grandfather Thutmose I had put up several decades earlier.[39] Eventually a militia was raised to fight the invaders, but it fared very poorly.[39] Thutmose III then returned to Syria by way of Niy, where he records that he engaged in an elephant hunt.[40] He then collected tribute from foreign powers and returned to Egypt in victory.[38]\n\nTours of Syria\n\nThutmose III returned to Syria for his ninth campaign in his 34th year, but this appears to have been just a raid of the area called Nukhashshe, a region populated by semi-nomadic people.[41] The plunder recorded is minimal, so it was probably just a minor raid.[42] Records from his tenth campaign indicate much more fighting, however. By Thutmose's 35th year, the king of Mitanni had raised a large army and engaged the Egyptians around Aleppo.[43] As usual for any Egyptian king, Thutmose claimed a total crushing victory, but this statement is suspect. Specifically, it is doubted that Thutmose accomplished any great victory here due to the very small amount of plunder taken.[43] Specifically, Thutmose's annals at Karnak indicate he took a total of only ten prisoners of war.[44] He may have simply fought the Mitannians to a stalemate,[43] yet he did receive tribute from the Hittites after that campaign, which seems to indicate the outcome of the battle was in Thutmose's favor.[40]\n\nThe next two campaigns are lost.[40] His eleventh is presumed to have happened in his 36th regnal year, and his twelfth is presumed to have happened in his 37th, since his thirteenth is mentioned at Karnak as happening in his 38th regnal year.[45] Part of the tribute list for his twelfth campaign remains immediately before his thirteenth begins, and the contents recorded (specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification) might indicate that it took place on the steppe around Nukhashashe, but this remains mere speculation.[46]\n\nIn his thirteenth campaign Thutmose returned to Nukhashashe for a very minor campaign.[45] The next year, his 39th year, he mounted his fourteenth campaign against the Shasu. The location of this campaign is impossible to determine definitely, since the Shasu were nomads who could have lived anywhere from Lebanon to the Transjordan to Edom.[47] After this point, the numbers given by Thutmose's scribes to his campaigns all fall in lacunae, so campaigns can only be counted by date. In his fortieth year, tribute was collected from foreign powers, but it is unknown if this was actually considered a campaign (i.e., if the king went with it or if it was lead by an official).[48] Only the tribute list remains from Thutmose's next campaign in the annals,[49] and nothing can be deduced about it, except that it was probably another raid to the frontiers around Niy.[50] His final Asian campaign is better documented, however. Sometime before Thutmose's 42nd year, Mitanni apparently began spreading revolt among all the major cities in Syria.[50] Thutmose moved his troops by land up the coastal road and put down rebellions in the Arka plain and moved on Tunip.[50] After taking Tunip, his attention turned to Kadesh again. He engaged and destroyed three surrounding Mitannian garrisons and returned to Egypt in victory.[51] However, his victory in this final campaign was neither complete nor permanent, since he did not take Kadesh,[51] and Tunip could not have remained aligned to him for very long, certainly not beyond his own death.[52]\n\nNubian Campaign\n\nThutmose took one last campaign in his 50th regnal year, very late in his life. He attacked Nubia, but only went as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile. Although no king of Egypt had ever penetrated as far as he did with an army, previous kings' campaigns had spread Egyptian culture that far already, and the earliest Egyptian document found at Gebel Barkal in fact comes from three years before Thutmose's campaign.[53]\n\nMonumental Construction\n\nThutmose III was a great builder pharaoh and constructed over 50 temples, although some of these are now lost and only mentioned in written records.[8] He also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles, which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before. His reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture, paintings, and reliefs associated with his construction.\n\nArtistic developments\n\nThutmose's architects and artisans showed great continuity with the formal style of previous kings, but several developments set him apart from his predecessors. Although he followed the traditional relief styles for most of his reign, but after his 42nd year, he began having himself depicted wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and a \u0161ndyt-kilt, an unprecedented style.[5] Architecturally, his use of pillars was also unprecedented. He built Egypt's only known set of heraldic pillars, two large columns standing alone instead of being part of a set supporting the roof.[54] His jubilee hall was also revolutionary, and is arguably the earliest known building created in the basilica style.[54] Thutmose's artisans achieved new heights of skill in painting, and tombs from his reign were the earliest to be entirely painted, instead of painted reliefs.[5] Finally, although not directly pertaining to his monuments, it appears that Thutmose's artisans finally had learned how to use the skill of glassmaking, developed in the early 18th dynasty, to create drinking vessels by the core-formed method.[55]\n\nKarnak\n\ntekhen waty, today standing in Rome since the time of Constantine II in 357. C.E. Thutmose III'stoday standing in Rome since the time of Constantine II in 357. C.E.\n\nThutmose dedicated far more attention to Karnak than any other site. In the Iput-isut, the temple proper in the center, he rebuilt the hypostyle hall of his grandfather Thutmose I, dismantled the red chapel of Hatshepsut and built Pylon VI and a shrine for the bark of Amun in its place, and built an antechamber in front of it, the ceiling of which was supported by his heraldic pillars.[54] He built a temenos wall around the central chapel containing smaller chapels, along with workshops and storerooms.[54] East of the main sanctuary, he built a jubilee hall in which to celebrate his Sed Festival. The main hall was built in basilica style, with rows of pillars supporting the ceiling on each side of the aisle.[54] The central two rows were higher than the others to create windows where the ceiling was split.[54] Two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of Canaan which he took in his third campaign.[56]\n\nEast of the Iput-Isut, he erected another temple to Aten where he was depicted as being supported by Amun.[57] It was inside this temple that Thutmose planned on erecting his tekhen waty, (\"unique obelisk.\")[57] The tekhen waty was designed to stand alone, instead as part of a pair, and is the tallest obelisk ever successfully cut. It was not, however, erected until Thutmose IV raised it[57] 35 years later.[58] It was later moved to Rome and is known as the Lateran Obelisk.\n\nThutmose also undertook building projects to the south of the main temple, between the sanctuary of Amun and the temple of Mut.[57] Immediately to the south of the main temple, he built the seventh pylon on the north-south road which entered the temple between the fourth and fifth pylons.[57] It was built for use during his jubilee, and was covered with scenes of defeated enemies.[57] He set royal colossi on both sides of the pylon, and put two more obelisks on the south face in front of the gateway.[57] The eastern one's base remains in place, but the western one was transported to hippodrome in Constantinople.[57] further south alone the road, he put up pylon VIII which Hatshepsut had begun.[54] East of the road, he dug a sacred lake of 250 by 400 feet, and then placed another alabaster bark shrine near it.[54]\n\nStatuary\n\nLike earlier pharaohs, Thutmose III placed statues inside his temples to show his strength and to portray him as a devout pharaoh who worshipped the gods. Stylistically, many of his statues share many of the same features of his immediate predecessor, Hatshepsut, and the only statues with solid attributions to either pharaoh are those that were inscribed with the individual pharaoh's name. Statuary of both rulers often share the same almond-shaped eyes, arching browline, moderately aquiline nose and a gently curved mouth with a slight smile.[59] Systematic studies of the inscribed statues of these two pharaohs have been developed that provide a set of stylistic, iconographic, contextual and technical criteria necessary to identify uninscribed statues of these pharaohs with some degree of certainty.[60]\n\nThere are many examples of statues depicting Thutmose III kneeling down in an \"offering\" position, typically offering milk, wine, or some other food substance to a god. While examples of this style can be found with some of the earlier pharaohs of the New Kingdom, it is thought that the emphasis on this style marks a change in the increasingly public aspects of the Egyptian religion. These positions include the form called \"offering to an altar\" and show the pharaoh both in the kneeling and standing positions. Thutmose is shown in other statues offering geese and, possibly, oil[61]. The faces of the statues are idealized to portray both a traditional view of kings and the contemporary idea of beauty; this was apparent in statues of Hatshepsut, but is more obvious in statues of Thutmose III and his immediate descendants Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III. Another important development that relates to this form of statuary is that at least one instance of this type represents the first known royal statuette that was cast in bronze.[62]\n\nTomb image of Thutmosis III being suckled by the goddess Isis in the form of a tree.\n\nTomb\n\nThutmose's tomb, discovered by Victor Loret in 1898, was in the Valley of the Kings.It uses a plan which is typical of 18th dynasty tombs, with a sharp turn at the vestibule preceding the burial chamber. Two stairways and two corridors provide access to the vestibule which is preceded by a quadrangular shaft, or \"well.\" The vestibule is decorated with the full story of the Book of Amduat, the first tomb to do so in its entirety. The burial chamber, which is supported by two pillars, is oval shaped and its ceiling decorated with stars, symbolizing the cave of the god Sokar. In the middle lies a large red quartzite sarcophagus in the shape of a cartouche. On the two pillars in the middle of the chamber there are passages from the Litanies of Re, a text that celebrates the sun god, who is identified with the pharaoh. On the other pillar is a unique image depicting Thutmosis III being suckled by the goddess Isis in the guise of the tree.\n\nThutmose III's tomb in the Valley of the Kings (KV34) is the first one in which Egyptologists found the complete Amduat, an important New Kingdom funerary text. The wall decorations are done in a simple, \"diagrammatic\" way, imitating the manner of the cursive script one might expect to see on a funerary papyrus than the more typically lavish wall decorations seen on most other royal tomb walls. The coloring is similarly muted, executed in simple black figures and text on a cream background with highlights in red and pink. The decorations depict the pharaoh aiding the gods in defeating Apep, the serpent of chaos, thereby helping to ensure the sun's daily rebirth as well as the pharaoh's own resurrection.[63]\n\nDefacing of Hatshepsut's Monuments\n\nUntil recently, a general theory has been that after the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut 'usurped' the throne from Thutmose III. Although Thutmose III was a co-regent during this time, early historians have speculated that Thutmose III never forgave his step-mother for denying him access to the throne for the first two decades of his reign.[64] However, this theory has in recent times been reviewed as questions arise why Hatshepsut would have allowed a resentful heir to control armies, which it is known he did. This view is further supported by the fact that no strong evidence has been found to show Thutmose III was actively seeking to reclaim his throne. Added to this is the fact that the monuments of Hatshepsut were not damaged until at least 20 years after her death in the reign of Thutmose III and possibly Amenhotep II.\n\nAfter her death, many of Hatshepsut's monuments and depictions were subsequently defaced or destroyed, including those in her famous mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri. These have traditionally been interpreted to be evidence of acts of damnatio memoriae (condemning a person by erasing him or her from recorded existence) by Thutmose III. However, recent research by scholars such as that of Charles Nims and Peter Dorman have re-examined these erasures and found that the acts which could be dated started sometime during year 46 or 47 of Thutmose's reign.[65] Another often overlooked fact is that it was not only Hatshepsut who received this treatment, as the monuments of her chief steward Senenmut, who was closely associated with her rule, were similarly defaced where they were found.[66] All of this evidence casts serious doubt upon the popular theory that Thutmose III ordered their destruction in a fit of vengeful rage shortly after his accession. These days the purposeful destruction of the memory of Hatshepsut is seen as a measure designed to ensure the smooth succession of his son (the future Amenhotep II), as opposed to any of surviving relatives of Hatshepsut who may have had an equal or better claim to the throne. It may also be likely that this measure could not have been taken earlier until the passing of powerful officials who had served under both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III had occurred.[67]\n\nDeath and burial\n\nAccording to the American Egyptologist Peter Der Manuelian, a statement in the tomb biography of an official named Amenemheb establishes that Thutmose III died on Year 54, III Peret day 30 of his reign after ruling Egypt for 53 years, 10 months, and 26 days.(Urk. 180.15) Thutmose III, hence, died just one month and four days shy of the start of his 55th regnal year.[68]\n\nMummy\n\nMummified head of Thutmose III\n\nThutmose III's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in 1881. He was interred along with those of other 18th and 19th dynasty leaders Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun.\n\nWhile it is popularly thought that his mummy was originally unwrapped by Gaston Maspero in 1886, it was in fact first unwrapped by \u00c9mile Brugsch, the Egyptologist who supervised the evacuation of the mummies from the Deir el-Bahri Cache five years previously in 1881, soon after its arrival in the Boulak Museum. This was done while Maspero was away in France, and the Director General of the Egyptian Antiquities Service ordered the mummy re-wrapped. So when it was \"officially\" unwrapped by Maspero in 1886, he almost certainly knew it was in relatively poor condition.[69]\n\nIt had been extensively damaged in antiquity by tomb robbers, and its wrappings subsequently cut into and torn by the Rassul family who had originally rediscovered the tomb and its contents only a few years before.[70] Maspero's description of the body provides an idea as to the magnitude of the damage done to the body:\n\nHis mummy was not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the 20th dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the winding-sheet.[71]\n\nOf the face, which was undamaged, Maspero's says the following:\n\nHappily the face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Th\u00fbtmosis II, though with a greater show of energy.[71]\n\nMaspero was so disheartened at the state of the mummy, and the prospect that all of the other mummies were similarly damaged (as it turned out, few were in as poor a state), that he would not unwrap another for several years.[72]\n\nUnlike many other examples from the Deir el-Bahri Cache, the wooden mummiform coffin that contained the body was original to the pharaoh, though any gilding or decoration it might have had had been hacked off in antiquity.\n\nIn his examination of the mummy, the anatomist G. Elliot Smith stated the height of Thutmose III's mummy to be 1.615m (5ft. 3.58in.).[73] This has led people to believe that Thutmose was a short man, but Smith measured the height of a body whose feet were absent, so he was undoubtedly taller than the figure given by Smith.[74] The mummy of Thutmose III now resides in the Royal Mummies Hall of the Cairo Museum, catalog number 61068.\n\nLegacy\n\nThutmose III's name lives on in the monuments and architectural legacy, which have survived into modern times. His military feat in extending the Egyptian Empire helped to ensure the longevity of that ancient civilization. His reconquest of Syria and Nubia mark him as one of the most successful of Egypt's rulers. His defaming of Hatshesut after her death, though, may be a blemish on his record although he is generally considered to have been a fair ruler.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences and further reading\n\nBeckerath, Jurgen Von, and Edward F Wente. 1998. \"Chronologie Des Agyptischen Neuen Reiches.\" Journal of Near Chronologie des Pharaonischen \u00c4gypten ISSN 0022-2968.\n\nISSN 0022-2968.

Pharaoh Thutmose III's military scribe inscribed it in hieroglyphs at Thutmose's temple at Karnak, Thebes (now Luxor). Not only is this the first extant, detailed battle description, but it is the first written reference to the religiously important Megiddo: Megiddo is also known as Armageddon.\n\nThe Ancient City of Megiddo\n\nHistorically, Megiddo was an important city because it overlooked the route from Egypt through Syria to Mesopotamia. If an enemy of Egypt controlled Megiddo, it could block the pharaoh from reaching the rest of his empire.\n\nIn approximately 1479 B.C., Thutmose III, pharaoh of Egypt, led an expedition against the prince of Kadesh who was in Megiddo.\n\nThe prince of Kadesh (which is on the River Orontes), backed by the king of Mitanni, made a coalition with the heads of Egypt's vassal cities of northern Palestine and Syria. Kadesh was in charge. After forming the coalition, the cities openly rebelled against Egypt. In retaliation, Thutmose III attacked.\n\nThe Egyptians March on Megiddo\n\nIn the 23rd year of his reign, Thutmose III went to the plains of Megiddo where the prince of Kadesh and his Syrian allies were stationed. The Egyptians marched to the bank of Lake Kaina (Kina), south of Megiddo. They made Megiddo their military base. For the military encounter, the Pharaoh led from the front, brave and impressive in his gilded chariot. He stood in the center between the two wings of his army. The southern wing was on the banks of the Kaina and the northern wing to the northwest of the town of Megiddo. The Asian coalition blocked Thutmose's path. Thutmose charged. The enemy quickly gave way, fled from their chariots, and ran to the Megiddo fortress where their fellows pulled them up the walls to safety. The prince of Kadesh escaped from the vicinity.\n\nThe Egyptians Plunder Megiddo\n\nThe Egyptians could have pushed on to Lebanon to deal with the other rebels, but instead stayed outside the walls at Megiddo for the sake of plunder. What they had taken from the battlefield may have whetted their appetite. Outside, on the plains, there was plenty to forage, but the people within the fortress were unprepared for a siege. After a few weeks, they surrendered. The neighboring chiefs, not including the prince of Kadesh, who had left after the battle, submitted themselves to Thutmose, offering valuables, including princely sons as hostages.\n\nThe Egyptian troops entered the fortress at Megiddo to plunder. They took almost a thousand chariots, including the prince's, more than 2000 horses, thousands of other animals, millions of bushels of grain, an impressive pile of armor, and thousands of captives. The Egyptians next went north where they captured 3 Lebanese fortresses, Inunamu, Anaugas, and Hurankal.\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistoryedu.com/thutmose-iii-history-military-campaigns-greatest-achievements/", "page_content": "Thutmose III, one of ancient Egypt\u2019s greatest rulers, was the 6th pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reign, which spanned from around 1479 to 1425 BC, was one marked by his unrelenting thirst for dominance and power. Arguably Egypt\u2019s greatest warrior king, Thutmose III built upon the laurels and works of predecessors like his stepmother Hatshepsut and his father Thutmose II.\n\nWith a total of 17 military campaigns, this powerful king was able to stretch the boundaries of Egypt, turning Egypt into the most dominant power in the region. It is generally accepted among Egyptologists and scholars alike that Egypt reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III. What were some of his most famous military campaigns? And how did Thutmose III bring the mighty Mitannians to submission?\n\nBelow, World History Edu explores the life, family tree, military campaigns, and major achievements of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nQuick facts about Thutmose III\n\nBirth: c. 1481 BC\n\nDied: c. 1425 BC\n\nAged: 56\n\nBurial place: Valley of the Kings, Luxor, Egypt\n\nReligion: Ancient Egyptian religion\n\nFather: Thutmose II\n\nMother: Iset\n\nSiblings: Neferure\n\nSpouses: Satiah, Nebtu, Menwi, Menhet, Merti, Nebsemi\n\nChief consort: Merytre-Hatshepsut\n\nChildren: Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, Siamun, Nefertiri, Amenemhat, Amenhotep II\n\nReign: 1479-1425 BC\n\nDynasty: 18th\n\nPredecessor: Queen Hatshepsut\n\nSuccessor: Amenhotep II\n\nEpithets: \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d, \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d\n\nOther names: Thutmosis (\u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d or \u201cThoth is born\u201d)\n\nMost known for: Steering ancient Egypt to its zenith ever\n\nConquests: northern Syria, parts of Nubia, Palestine, Niya Kingdom\n\nBirth and early life\n\nSon of Egyptian ruler Thutmose II and Queen Iset, Thutmose III was born around 1481 BC. Following the death of his father in 1479 BC, he was the most eligible person to rise to throne. However, he was only just child at the time. Hence his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut ruled on his behalf as regent of Egypt.\n\nGrowing up, the young boy-king received the best of education befitting of an Egyptian monarch. Thutmose III also received training in military tactics, horse and chariot riding, archery, and among others. Right from an early age, he had a knack for horsemanship, as he was very well built and a good marksman.\n\nNames and epithets\n\nAs it was common for ancient Egyptian kings and queens, Thutmose III went by a number of names and epithets. His two main names were associated with major Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth. For example his name Tuthmosis or Thutmose evokes the meaning of \u201cThoth is born\u201d or \u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d. The god Thoth was the Egyptian deity of the moon, time, and wisdom.\u2019\n\nThutmose III\u2019s other name mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02c1 \u1e0f\u1e25wty-ms means \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d or \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d. Egyptians believed that the sun god Ra, also known as the chief of the Egyptian pantheon, steered his sun barge through the sky bringing sunlight to land.\n\nThutmose II \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s father\n\nThutmose II was the father of Thutmose III. Born to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Mutnofret, Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is said to have started in 1493 and ended upon his death in 1479. During his reign he achieved a number of things, including quelling revolts in the Levant and Nubia.\n\nIn addition to Iset, Thutmose III\u2019s mother, Thutmose II had a number of consorts. Upon his death in 1479, Thutmose II\u2019s chief consort Queen Hatshepsut succeeded him to the throne.\n\nQueen Iset \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s mother\n\nWith Hatshepsut taking the role as the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, Queen Iset was the secondary wife of Thutmose II. Iset\u2019s name was derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian mother goddess Isis. In some ancient texts and inscriptions, Iset is referred to as the chief consort of Thutmose II. Thutmose III\u2019s mother\u2019s name appears on his mummy wrappings as well as a statue of the king in the Karnak Temple Complex. Upon her son\u2019s coronation as the sole ruler of Egypt in 1458 BC (i.e. after the death of Queen Hatshepsut), Iset received the epithet \u201cKing\u2019s Mother\u201d.\n\nA number of Iset\u2019s images and depictions can be found in the tomb of Thutmose III at the Valley of the Kings. Many of those depictions see her revered as the manifestation of the Egyptian goddess Isis. In one depiction, she can be seen standing behind Thutmose III on a boat.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut\u2019s regency, co-regency and ultimate rule\n\nFollowing the death of Thutmose II around 1479 BC, the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut became regent Thutmose II\u2019s only son Thutmose III, who was too young to reign as king. Even long before the death of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut\u2019s power in the kingdom was quite immense, with some describing her as the real power behind Thutmose II\u2019s reign. Thutmose II, a lesser son of Thutmose I, had to marry Hatshepsut in order to consolidate his power.\n\nAbout seven years into her regency, Hatshepsut will go from regent of Egypt to co-ruler of the kingdom until her death in 1458 BC. She thus co-ruled with her stepson Thutmose III. Upon her death, Thutmose III became the sole ruler of Egypt.\n\nHatshepsut assigned herself full titles of a pharaoh. She donned clothes similar to the ones Egyptian pharaohs wore. Bent on dominating the affairs of land of Egypt, she also assumed the insignia of the Egyptian pharaoh. Effectively ruling as pharaoh from c. 1479 to 1458 BC, Hatshepsut, who was also known as \u201cForemost of Noble Ladies\u201d, steered Egypt to great heights.\n\nRead More: 10 Greatest Accomplishments of Queen Hatshepsut\n\nThutmose III and Hatshepsut\n\nUpon attaining the age of maturity, Queen Hatshepsut appointed Thutmose III as the commander of her army. Egyptologists note that Thutmose III served as the co-ruler of Egypt throughout the reign of Hatshepsut. There was hardly any grudge between the two as they worked in tandem. Both rulers had royal names and insignia.\n\nAs a matter of fact their different leadership traits complemented perfectly. Some scholars have noted that the co-rulership of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III proved extremely beneficial for the latter\u2019s sole reign over Egypt.\n\nMajor achievements of Thutmose III\n\nLike many 18th Dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III benefited a lot from the technology transferred to Egypt during the reign of Hyksos rulers [Fifteenth Dynasty (c. 1650-1550 BC)]. Armed with military innovations like the horse and chariot, the sickle sword and the composite bow, Thutmose III embarked on many military campaigns and conquests. By so doing, he was able to wield tremendous influence in the region, from southern Syria and Canaan to the east to Nubia to the south. Ancient Egypt was truly a superpower during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nDuring his reign from 1479 BC to 1425 BC, Thutmose III was able to accomplish a lot of outstanding things. Some of his major accomplishments are as follows:\n\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon\n\nEgyptologists often opine that there was hardly any ancient Egyptian ruler that could rival the expansionist ambitions of Thutmose III. It\u2019s been estimated that he spent more than twenty years of his thirty-year reign as Egypt\u2019s sole ruler campaigning in foreign lands. It is for this reason some historians like to refer to him as ancient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon.\n\nThutmose III embarked upon a total of 17 campaigns in foreign territories, capturing several hundreds of cities in the process. By the time he was through, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s influence and dominion to places as far as the Near East, Nubia in the south, and the Euphrates.\n\nAn astute commander of Egypt\u2019s army\n\nAs co-ruler and commander of Egypt\u2019s army, Thutmose III prepared himself adequately to reassert Egypt\u2019s influence in northern Syria, Nubia and Palestine. For many years since his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s conquest of those regions, Egypt\u2019s hold over those regions had gradually faded. During his father Thutmose II\u2019s reign, the tributes that Egypt received from those foreign rulers steadily fell.\n\nAnd the fact that Egypt was left with a boy-king following the death of Thutmose II in some way emboldened those foreign Syrian princes to rebel against Egypt\u2019s influence in the region. The task of bringing those regions back under Egypt\u2019s control fell squarely on Thutmose III. Realizing this, co-ruler Queen Hatshepsut was right in naming her stepson and co-ruler Thutmose III the commander-in-chief of Egypt\u2019s army.\n\nBy his mid-20s, he had grown into a fine warrior, knowledgeable in many military tactics and skilled at weapon handling. Thutmose was ready to begin his military campaigns in Syria and other surrounding regions in Mesopotamia.\n\nThutmose III led what was possible the mightiest and largest Egyptian army ever\n\nThutmose III\u2019s early introduction into the army proved extremely useful for him going forward. Steadily he went on to build a very large army that instilled a lot fear in Egypt\u2019s foreign enemies. Historians and Egyptologists like to believe that Thutmose\u2019s reign saw the Egyptian army reach its peak, boasting of the largest army in ancient Egypt\u2019s history.\n\nMarched his army to capture Megiddo\n\nIn what is widely recognized as Thutmose III\u2019s first campaign, the young Egyptian ruler led his army to halt the growing power of the king of Kadesh. Thutmose\u2019s army went through Jamnia before arriving at Megiddo.\n\nBefore facing off the king of Kadesh in the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose is said to have made a very brave decision of taking the most challenging route to the battle ground. Contrary to the advice of his war counsel, the Egyptian king chose to take the riskiest path through a narrow mountain pass in the Wadi Ara (present-day in Israel). The path allowed Thutmose and his army to strategically place themselves between the rear side of the enemy forces and Megiddo. The battle, which was the biggest of all the 17 campaigns of Thutmose III, ended in a resounding victory for Thutmose. The Pharaoh laid siege to the city for about eight months before bringing Megiddo to its knees. As the troops made their way back to Egypt, they helped themselves to plundering much of the resources of Megiddo.\n\nWielded control over all of Canaan and large parts of Syria\n\nThe capture of Megiddo meant that Thutmose III had placed himself in firm control of all of Canaan and many other parts of Syria. In order to maintain that firm control of those places he ordered the payment of large annual tributes to Egypt. Those foreign lands were also required to send their princes and heirs to Egypt where they were Egyptionalized so to speak. By so doing, Egypt was able to secure strong loyalty from those princes once they turned to rulers of their respective cities.\n\nConquered Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biqa valley\n\nFurthermore, Thutmose conquered many ports on the Phoenician coast, allowing him to gain greater control of Syria. After plundering the town of Ardata, he turned the place into an important strategic base for Egypt. In his sixth campaign, the Egyptian king proceeded to take and pillage many Kadesh territories. As part of his effort to prevent those conquered territories from rebelling, he sometimes plundered a lot of their resources, thereby leaving them impoverished with no ability to mount a rebellion.\n\nBrought the state of Mitanni under Egypt\u2019s control\n\nBeginning around the end of Thutmose III\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reign, Thutmose I, the rulers of Mitanni, a Mesopotamian kingdom, had started to grow in power and influence in the region. Thutmose III was bent on clipping Mitanni\u2019s rise. In his 33rd year, he led his army on an eight campaign. After crossing the Euphrates River, he took on the Mitannian forces, who were anything but ready for an invasion. The king of Mitanni fled, allowing Thutmose III to force Mitanni into complete submission. The Egyptian king is said to have taking about more than 30 members of the Mitannian\u2019s harem and several hundreds of soldiers prisoners.\n\nTo commemorate his spectacular victory, he erected a stele next to his grandfather\u2019s stele in the region. Thutmose thus became the first Egyptian monarch since Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates.\n\nA prominent builder of spectacular buildings\n\nA great patron of the arts and architecture, Thutmose III is said to have tasked his architects to build many magnificent structures, most famous among them came at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Thutmose is credited with enlarging the complex by erecting new buildings and obelisks. For example he rebuilt his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s hypostyle hall. He also built a jubilee hall to mark his reign during the Sed festival. He also built a new temple at Dayr al-Bahri, just close to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple.\n\nMore Thutmose III facts\n\nAs a result of the immense influence he had, many foreign princes and monarchs, from the Hittite region to the Mesopotamian region, frequently presented him a wide array of gifts. Rulers from as far as the Aegean and the Greek mainland sent envoys and gifts to Thutmose III.\n\nMuch of what we know about Thutmose III comes from the records of Thanuny, a royal scribe and commander in Thutmose III\u2019s army.\n\nHe was a known hunter of elephant in the land of Niy in the Orontes Valley.\n\nOften times, the prisoners of war and the loot that he took from foreign lands were presented to the god Amun (Amon).\n\nAfter conquering a foreign land, Thutmose III would deploy native rulers to govern those territories. Those rulers were required to remain loyal, keep the peace, and pay annual tributes to Egypt. During his reign, Egypt received tributes from Nubia (Sudan), Syria, and Palestine.\n\nTypical of many Egyptian pharaohs, the records of Thutmose III are a bit boastful, exaggerating the abilities of the Egyptian king.\n\nIt was during Thutmose III\u2019s reign that Egyptian artisans mastered glass making.\n\nIn his final few years on the throne, some of his courtiers, along with his heir Amenhotep II, tried to erase the records, including images and cartouches, of Hatshepsut and her reign. In some cases, Hatshepsut\u2019s achievements were appropriated to Thutmose II and Thutmose I.\n\nHe loved to bring animals and plants from far and wide into his kingdom. Some of those foreign beasts and plants can be seen on the walls of the Festival Hall at Karnak.\n\nFor quite a number of centuries, Egyptians took to inscribing the name of Thutmose III on amulets. It was believed that those amulets protected the wearer.\n\nMummy and memorial temple\n\nThutmose III was buried in a very remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in 1889. Archaeologists believe that the 21st dynasty priest-kings (1076- c. 945 BC) kept his mummy in that place in order to protect it from being desecrated.\n\nBased on his mummy, Thutmose III\u2019s height was in the region of five feet three inches (around 1.6 meters).\n\nDiscovered in 1962, Thutmose III\u2019s memorial temple was sited next to Hatshepsut\u2019s memorial temple in Dayr al-Bahri.\n\nMore Thutmose III achievements\n\nHis final military campaign saw him put down a rebellion (instigated by some exiled members of the Mitannian royal family) in the Arka plain. He also destroyed many Mitannian garrisons in the region.\n\nAround his 50th regnal year, he turned his attention to his southern borders, where he captured many Nubian territories, including Napata and Kurgus. He is famed for being the first Egyptian king to march an army as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile River.\n\nShortly after securing those Nubian regions, he erected a temple in honor of the god Amun. He also captured a number of prisoners that he would later send to the gold mines. Scholars state that the produce from those gold mines formed a significant portion of Egypt\u2019s wealth.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s consorts and children\n\nIn some texts it\u2019s noted that Thutmose III married his half-sister Neferure, who was the daughter of Thutmose II and Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. Neferure was at some point was even referred to as the God\u2019s Wife.\n\nIn another account, the great royal wife of Thutmose III was rather Merytre-Hatshepsut. By her, Thutmose III gave birth to Amenhotep II, his successor. Merytre-Hatshepsut became the chief consort of the king after the death of Satiah. Additionally, Merytre-Hatshepsut was the mother of Thutmose\u2019s successor Amenhotep II. In the course of her life, Merytre-Hatshepsut had titles like Great King\u2019s Wife, God\u2019s Wife, King\u2019s Mother, Sole One, Beloved of Ra, and First among the nobles.\n\nOther famous wives of Thutmose III include Menwi, Merti, and Menhet. Those three women were princesses from foreign lands who were sent to the royal harem of the pharaoh. Although they were regarded as minor wives of the king, the three women still held a bit of influence in the royal court, receiving titles like King\u2019s Wife.\n\nThutmose III also had the likes of Nebtu, Nebsemi and Satiah in his royal harem. It\u2019s been stated that by later, Thutmose III bore his eldest son Prince Amenemhat. Satiah was psossibly Thutmose III\u2019s first Great Royal Wife.\n\nKing Thutmose III had many children, including Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, and Nefertiri.\n\nFamily Tree of Thutmose III\n\nSuccessor\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign spanned for about 54 years; the first twenty-two years of his reign was spent serving as the co-ruler of Egypt with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut. In his final few years, he appointed his son and heir Amenhotep II as a junior co-regent.\n\nHis eldest son and heir, Amenemhat, predeceased him, possibly dying of a plague. Following the death of Amenemhat, Amenhotep II became heir to Thutmose III."}, {"url": "https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/ancient-history/anc-thutmose-iii-reading-1/", "page_content": "In this article, we will take a closer look at the life and achievements of Thutmose III. We will also explore how he helped to shape Ancient Egyptian culture and society.\n\nThere are many great Pharaohs in Ancient Egyptian history, but Thutmose III stands out as one of the most impressive. He was a successful warrior and leader who accomplished a great deal during his reign.\n\nEarly life\n\nThutmose III was born around 1481 BC to Pharaoh Thutmose II and Queen Isis. His father died when Thutmose III was about two-years old. While he was technically now pharaoh, Thutmose III was too young to actually rule. Therefore, his stepmother, Hatshepsut, was a assigned as his regent. This meant that she could exercise all of the powers of the pharaoh until he was old enough to take over (usually around the age of 15 or 16).\n\nHowever, Hatshepsut was not simply content being a regent. In the early years of her regency, she actually took the position of pharaoh for herself. This included holding her own coronation ceremony and having statues built with her royal name inscribed on them.\n\nThe seizure of power by his stepmother meant that as he grew up, Thutmose III did not rule as pharaoh. Regardless, Hatshepsut allowed Thutmose III to live on in the royal household and was given a good education. Young Thutmose was taught how to read and write, learned about military tactics and strategy, and enjoyed all of the benefits of a royal prince.\n\nWhen Thutmose turned 15, which was an age where he could take back power, Hatshepsut continued to rule as pharaoh in his place. It wasn't until Hatshepsut finally died in 1458 BC that Thutmose III became Pharaoh again, at around the age of 22.\n\nOnce in power, Thutmose made it clear that his reign had begun in 1479 BC, when he was 2 years old. This effectively removed the 20 years during which Hatshepsut claimed the throne. Many historians even claim that upon taking the throne, Thutmose III sought to erase the memory of Hatshepsut from history. This is because, at some time during his reign, her names were deliberately removed from many of her monuments.\n\nHowever, there is no clear evidence that Thutmose III was directly responsible for this erasure, which had led some scholars believe that Thutmose III actually respected his stepmother."}, {"url": "https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Thutmose-III", "page_content": "\n\nThe name of the god Thoth is an ancient Greek transcription of the original name Djehuty. Thutmose is a modern compromise between the Greek transcription Thutmosis and Djehutimes. His 54-year reign includes the first 22 years as co-regent with Hatshepsut, where neither had any obvious seniority over the other, and Thutmose III was head of the army, while she was the de facto ruler. After her death, his military genius created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.\n\nHis name in Manetho's king list is Mephramuthosis, which is a shortened Greek transcription of his throne and birth names.\n\n\n\nReign of Thutmose III AE Chronology 1479\u20131425 von Beckerath 1479\u20131425 Shaw 1479\u20131425 Dodson 1479\u20131424 Malek 1479\u20131425 Arnold 1479\u20131425 Grimal 1479\u20131425 Redford 1504\u20131452 Manetho (Josephus) 25y 10m Manetho (Africanus) 26 years Manetho (Eusebius) 26 years Manetho (Jerome) 26 years Highest attestation Year 54"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thutmose-III/Adornment-of-Egypt", "page_content": "Adornment of Egypt\n\nThe new prosperity was reflected in the remarkable program of building undertaken by the king\u2019s architects. The Temple of Amon at Karnak in particular was enlarged and enriched by many new buildings and a number of obelisks. Two of the splendid granite obelisks that he erected there are now in Istanbul and Rome; of the two, now known as Cleopatra\u2019s Needles, with which he adorned the temple of the sun god at Heliopolis, one is in New York City\u2019s Central Park and the other on the Thames embankment in London. During Thutmose III\u2019s reign, art and craftsmanship received new impetus from his patronage. The exotic birds, beasts, and plants that he brought back from his campaigns in Asia are depicted on the walls of his Festival Hall at Karnak; among the gifts sent him from abroad were a live bear, an elephant, a giraffe, and \u201cbirds that give birth every day\u201d\u2014probably domestic hens, which were rare in the Middle East at that time.\n\nThe last decade of his reign is marked by the building of a new temple at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b, next to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple. At the same time, a systematic program was instituted by Thutmose III to erase the record of her kingship and to ascribe her monuments to her immediate predecessors, Thutmose I and Thutmose II. The motive for Hatshepsut\u2019s proscription at such a late date is not fully understood, but most of her cartouches and images vanished from public view.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Thutmose appointed his son Amenhotep II, the son of his second wife, Meryetre, as coregent. When he died, in 1426 bce, he was laid to rest in a remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. The mummy of the pharaoh was one of those discovered in 1889, in a hiding place where the priest-kings of the 21st dynasty (1075\u2013c. 950 bce) had put them for safety. Of the rich furniture that must originally have been placed in the tomb, only a few fragments were found. A memorial temple, which he built on a terrace at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b beside that of Hatshepsut, was discovered in 1962.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the western Theban mountain, the burial place of three members of his harem was found; judging by their names, they were Asiatic princesses, and though of minor rank their jewelry and equipment were extremely lavish.\n\nOf all the kings of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III is perhaps the one who, for the modern historian, most nearly comes to life. His records, though couched in the boastful and extravagant terms thought befitting a pharaoh\u2019s exploits, leave little doubt not only of his ability as a soldier and a statesman but also of his abilities as an athlete and a hunter of lion, wild cattle, and elephant. From his mummy it is known that he was a small man, not above five feet three inches (1.6 metres) in height. His statues show a youthful, smooth face with a large, high-bridged nose and pleasantly smiling mouth.\n\nHis fame lived after him. His name inscribed on countless amulets was thought to bring power and protection to the wearers. A popular hymn celebrating his triumphs became a model for later paeans of victory.
