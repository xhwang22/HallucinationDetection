{"In 2003, Flanagan was elected Mayor of Cranston.": [{"url": "https://www.ric.edu/news-events/news/tale-two-mayors", "page_content": "In recent years, Rhode Island College alumni have increasingly emerged in political leadership positions around the state. Nowhere is this more evident than in Rhode Island\u2019s second-largest city, where both the current and former mayors are RIC alumni. The current mayor of Cranston, Ken Hopkins, graduated in 1978, while the former mayor of Cranston, Allan Fung, graduated in 1992. Their paths are strikingly similar.\n\nFung served four terms as mayor of Cranston, from 2009-2021. Hopkins, then serving as citywide councilman, won the 2020 election to succeed Fung. Before he was elected mayor, Fung also served in the citywide council seat.\n\nBoth men also remember their alma mater fondly. Fung enjoyed his time as a student. He says, \u201cRIC was an amazing educational and social experience. I was your typical RIC commuter but was still able to get involved in student government, become class treasurer, play on the tennis team and hang out with friends in the Student Union.\u201d\n\nLike many RIC students, he also faced challenges. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges was trying to maintain a work-life balance,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned to be organized. RIC had a lot of resources to help with that. Friends and networks also helped. I have the same friends in my life to this day.\u201d\n\nAlong the way, Fung also learned crucial lessons about his future career in public service. \u201cHelping my fellow classmates by being involved in student government really opened my eyes to the needs of others,\u201d he says. \u201cThat experience stoked my passion for public service.\u201d\n\nEven though Fung graduated nearly 30 years ago, his experiences at RIC still influence him today. \u201cRIC provided me with a solid educational foundation in political science and business,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are lessons I still apply, whether in my former position as mayor or in my current role as a partner at a major law firm. My passion for helping others began on campus, and I carry this with me every day of my life.\u201d\n\nFung (top) and Hopkins (below) in their RIC student portraits for the 1992 and 1978 yearbooks\n\nPrior to entering politics, Hopkins was a well-known figure to generations of Cranston residents. He was a teacher at Cranston High School East, the athletic director for the city\u2019s schools and a longtime coach before being elected to the Cranston City Council in 2016. He was re-elected two years later.\n\nHopkins initially enrolled at RIC to play baseball as a pitcher. \u201cI had been recruited by a number of colleges to pitch for their baseball programs. The coaches at RIC appealed to me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI had some friends who were already there. I turned down scholarships from other schools to go to RIC because of my friendship with RIC coaches \u2013 Dave Stenhouse, in particular.\u201d\n\nCollege was also the place where Hopkins found love \u2013 in more ways than one. \u201cOnce I got to RIC, I fell in love with the place,\u201d he says. \u201cI met my future wife, too. I was actually out looking for food at about two o\u2019clock in the morning and knocked on her door \u2013 she\u2019s fed me for over 40 years now. Going to RIC was a good choice.\u201d\n\nLike his predecessor, Hopkins maintains a sense of gratitude for his time in college. His RIC experiences as both a student and a baseball player has kept him involved with RIC long after graduation.\n\n\u201cI coached at RIC for many years. I was the head women\u2019s basketball coach for 13 years and head baseball coach,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a place near and dear to my heart and I fully support the school and its mission to create the educators of the future. Education gave me a great career, and it started with that foundation at Rhode Island College.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://ballotpedia.org/Allan_Fung", "page_content": "Email *\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nPlease complete the Captcha above"}, {"url": "https://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/RI/ofc/cranston.html", "page_content": "PoliticalGraveyard.com\n\n\n\nMayors and Postmasters of Cranston, Rhode Island\n\nThe Political Graveyard is a web site about U.S. political history and cemeteries.

Jim Langevin in Congress.\n\n\"I'm back,\" the 51-year-old Republican said in a news release announcing his campaign.\n\n\"Today, like so many of you, I sense that our nation is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"From record-setting inflation that is robbing you of your hard-earned dollars in the grocery stores and at the gas pump, to a feeling that we are less safe at home, it's just not working for your family or mine.\"\n\nFung immediately fills a centrist lane in the still-evolving GOP primary field and brings name recognition and experience running and raising money for statewide campaigns.\n\nHis base in Cranston, the state's second-largest city, gives him an edge in a congressional district encompassing the state's western half.\n\nFung is the third Republican to say they are running for the Second Congressional District seat, following former state Rep. Robert Lancia and state Sen. Jessica de la Cruz.\n\n\"Allan is a nice man but I think it's time for a fresh face,\" de la Cruz told the Journal on Friday. \"I just left Cranston where there was great excitement about me mounting a campaign for Congress.\"\n\nFung has been working as an lawyer at Johnston law firm Pannone Lopes Devereaux & O\u2019Gara LLC since leaving the Cranston mayor's office in January 2021 after 12 years. Before running for mayor, he was a special assistant attorney general and worked in government relations for MetLife insurance.\n\nBorn in Providence, the son of Chinese immigrants, Fung graduated from Classical High School and Rhode Island College.\n\nHis parents owned the Kong Wen restaurant in Cranston, and when Fung won a City Council seat in 2002, he was reported to be the first Asian-American elected in Rhode Island.\n\nPreviously: Outgoing Cranston Mayor Allan Fung looks back, looks ahead\n\nThen-Mayor Allan Fung at Garden City shopping center in Cranston in 2020.\n\nCurrently: Former Cranston Mayor Allan Fung joins Johnston law firm\n\nFung ran for governor in 2014 and 2018, losing both times to Democrat Gina Raimondo, who is now U.S. commerce secretary.\n\nThe second campaign, during the 2018 midterms, faced strong national headwinds for Republicans with then-President Donald Trump particularly unpopular in Rhode Island.\n\nA photo of Fung wearing a Trump hat at the inauguration in Washington turned into a liability in the campaign as he struggled to answer questions about it. Raimondo took 53% of the vote to Fung's 37%.\n\nIf he wins the GOP Second Congressional District nomination this year, Fung is sure to be linked to Trump by whichever Democrat he faces.\n\nIn fact, minutes after Fung's campaign announcement, Seth Magaziner tweeted the Trump hat photo in a fundraising message that said Fung's first vote \"would be to give control of the House to extreme DC Republicans who care more about doing Trump's bidding than helping working people.\"\n\nAlthough Rhode Island remains overwhelmingly Democratic, the national electoral environment should be better for Fung, and likely all Republicans, than it was in 2018.\n\nThe party that controls the White House typically suffers in midterm elections, and Democratic President Joe Biden's poll numbers are low.\n\nEven Rhode Islanders who don't like Trump may not want to be constantly reminded of him in Democratic attack ads now that he is out of office,.\n\n\"We do not need more hyper-partisan politicians,\" Fung said in his campaign news release. \"We need a problem solver.\"\n\nAfter the 2018 camapign, Fung helped his wife Barbara Ann Fenton-Fung oust House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello from his Cranston House seat, ending his tenure in a seat some regard as the most powerful in state government.\n\nFenton-Fung is among the most moderate of the General Assembly's Republicans. She supported Democrat K. Joseph Shekarchi for speaker and does not share the minority caucus office suite.\n\nLangevin announced last month that he will not seek reelection, setting off a wild scramble among Democrats to find a replacement who can retain the seat in a difficult year.\n\nSo far, five Democrats have said they are running: Magaziner, Omar Bah, Edwin Pacheco, Michael Neary Jr. and Joy Fox.\n\npanderson@providencejournal.com\n\n(401) 277-7384\n\nOn Twitter: @PatrickAnderso_\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Allan Fung running for Congress in Jim Langevin's seat"}, {"url": "https://www.cranstonri.gov/about/mayor-of-cranston/", "page_content": "City of Cranston Mayor Kenneth J.

Education: Attended Bowdoin College and Harvard Business School.\n\nADDRESSES:\n\nHome\u2014Cranston, RI. E-mail\u2014[email protected]\n\nCAREER:\n\nBusinessperson, mayor, and writer. Morgan Keegan (investment banking firm), TN, president and chief operating officer; mayor of Cranston, RI, 2002-06; ran for Republican nomination for U.S. senator in 2006.\n\nWRITINGS:\n\nPrimary Mistake: How the Washington Republican Establishment Lost Everything in 2006 (and Sabotaged My Senatorial Campaign), Sentinel (New York, NY), 2007.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nSteve Laffey grew up in a working-class family in Cranston, Rhode Island, and went on to become president and chief operating officer of Morgan Keegan, a large investment banking firm headquartered in Tennessee with 2,000 employees and 500 million dollars in revenue. When the firm was sold in 2001, Laffey returned to Cranston and decided to run for mayor. As the Republican mayor of Cranston, Laffey earned a reputation for taking on special interests and for turning around a city in financial crisis. When Laffey took office, Cranston had the lowest bond rating in the United States and the largest cumulative deficit in Rhode Island history. During his term, Laffey turned the bond rating around, raising it eight notches to investment grade, and funded the pension system. He also produced the largest cumulative surplus in Rhode Island history.\n\nDuring his second term in office\u2014he was reelected by an overwhelming margin in 2004\u2014Laffey decided to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. senate race in 2006. He went up against incumbent Lincoln Chafee and soon found himself fighting Republican power elites who, despite Chafee's liberal stance on many issues, worked to prevent Laffey from winning the nomination. Laffey tells his story of the battle, and of a Republican Party gone wrong, in his book Primary Mistake: How the Washington Republican Establishment Lost Everything in 2006 (and Sabotaged My Senatorial Campaign).\n\n\"It's a fun book,\" Laffey told David Weigel in an interview for Reason magazine. \"I could have written the book at the 40,000 foot level, at the academic level. \u2026 I knew someone would do that, but I didn't know it would be Alan Greenspan, a week after me, from the same publisher! \u2018Republicans put power over principle and they deserved to lose.\u2019 That's a direct quote from his book, and he's right. But I wanted to write a book from the crop-duster level.\"\n\nIn his book\u2014which Inside Politics Web site contributor Darrell M. West called \"smart, energetic, and hard-hitting\"\u2014Laffey recounts his battle for the nomination as being indicative of everything that was wrong with the GOP (\"Grand Old Party\") in 2006. Laffey also discusses what he believes the Republican Party needs to do to recover in the future.\n\nWriting in the book's introduction, Laffey outlines his view of what happened to the Republican Party once it gained power in the mid 1990s. \"The Reagan Republicans who came into office in 1994 on a wave of small-government adrenaline had become puppets of the special interests,\" Laffey writes, adding that \"corruption exploded.\" Laffey went on to write in his introduction: \"This book is filled with many funny stories, but the message of this book isn't funny at all. There is nothing funny about millions of disappointed Republicans. There is nothing funny about hardworking taxpayers disgusted with their elected officials.\"\n\nLaffey also describes in the introduction his life growing up in Cranston and compares his background to Chafee's, noting: \"Unlike my opponent, Senator Lincoln Chafee, I had nothing handed to me simply because of my last name. The Chafees were one of the first five families in Rhode Island; mine was one of the last to get off the boat. My father wasn't a U.S. senator or a governor, but a blue-collar worker who sometimes worked two jobs to keep us fed and clothed.\"\n\nLaffey goes on in his book to reveal the inside story of the race and names the powerful people who, according to the author, felt so threatened that they first tried to bully him to keep him from running and then resorted to lies and threats. The Republican insiders then went on to give all of their support and millions of dollars to Chafee. In his book, Laffey remarks on the many Republicans' efforts to slander him to the press, which, writes Laffey, meant they were breaking late President Ronald Regan's eleventh commandment of one Republican never speaking badly of another Republican. Laffey writes that many conservative activists throughout the country were outraged at how Laffey was being treated and showed their support of him with thousands of e-mails, phone calls, and small donations.\n\nAlthough Laffey ultimately lost to Chafee, the incumbent Republican Senator went on to lose his seat to his rival, Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat. Laffey ends the book with a chapter titled \"A Prescription for the Future,\" in which he outlines how the Republican Party should and can return to the ideals set forth by one of Laffey's heroes, President Reagan. In Laffey's eyes, the true conservative viewpoint of Republicans must remain focused on tax cuts, reducing tariffs, simplifying the tax code, and eliminating nondefense discretionary spending.\n\nReferring to Primary Mistake as \"passionate,\" a Publishers Weekly contributor went on to note in the same review: \"The text alternates between colorful anecdotes about the campaign and vitriolic attacks on his adversaries.\" A Kirkus Reviews contributor noted: \"Laffey is forceful and avuncular, lacing his firm opinions with gotta-laugh stories from the campaign.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nLaffey, Steve, Primary Mistake: How the Washington Republican Establishment Lost Everything in 2006 (and Sabotaged My Senatorial Campaign), Sentinel (New York, NY), 2007.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Spectator, October 1, 2007, James W.
