In 2002, the PGA opened the PGA Historical Center [later the PGA Museum of Golf] at PGA Village in Port St. Lucie, Florida. This paved the way for the first home for the PGA Hall of Fame. The inaugural ceremony was conducted Sept. 8, 2005, as the Association recognized all PGA Members who have made significant and lasting contributions to building the PGA of America and the game of golf. In 2015, the PGA of America reinstituted its original Hall of Fame requirements to include non-PGA Members who have served as ambassadors of golf.

He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.liveabout.com/world-golf-hall-of-fame-members-1563626", "page_content": "Below is the alphabetical list of all members of the World Golf Hall of Fame, plus a second list in which the members are organized by year of induction.\n\nMost of the members of the World Golf Hall of Fame were elected on the strength of their accomplishments as tournament golfers.

During his stint with the company, Billy became involved in nearly all aspects of the production process; from malting to fermentation, distillation and maturation, blending to warehousing, and even bottling!\n\nBilly\u2019s next step was a move to Inver House Distillers in 1976 where he took up the position of Master Blender for six years. At Inver House he was given enormous freedom to be able to experiment and learn more about different wood types and the part they play in the final product.\n\nIn 1982, Billy moved on to spend 20 years with Burn Stewart Distillers \u2013 a small company that he describes as having \u201cvery few facilities but very clever minds\u201d. Eventually there was a management buyout of the business which allowed for the purchase of Deanston and Tobermory distilleries. Both required recommissioning which brought great excitement to a young and entrepreneurial Billy, sensing the opportunity to resurrect distilleries which were not receiving the attention he felt they deserved. Eventually the company was sold, leaving Billy to consider his next move.\n\nOn to the next distilleries\u2026\n\nBilly, along with his two business partners, set his sights on a new distillery to revive. In 2004, there were around 20 mothballed or closed distilleries, presenting a clear opportunity to business-minded Billy. He had a conversation with Chivas Brothers (Pernod Ricard\u2019s whisky arm), leading to the acquisition of BenRiach Distillery. It came with very interesting inventory which Billy enjoyed becoming familiar with, spending countless hours discovering the personality of the distillery and spirit. At the time, the boutique single malt sector of the whisky industry was experiencing growing consumer interest, and this was where BenRiach looked to sit.\n\nBilly was always keen to seek out new and exciting opportunities, and his strong relationship he had built with Chivas brought about the next one: the GlenDronach distillery. At the time, BenRiach was seeing good levels of growth and so the timing felt right to Billy and he seized the chance to acquire the distillery. GlenDronach had been closed for around 6 years from the late 90s into the millennium. This resulted in an inventory challenge for Billy to manage with the gap in stocks, but with his innovative outlook, he perceived it more as an opportunity than a challenge. Between 2008 and 2016, he was intently focussed on moving the brand back to a significantly sherried style of whisky.\n\nIn 2013, another opportunity came up, this time to purchase Glenglassaugh distillery. Billy was extremely keen to get it, with its spectacular coastal location, and different, more maritime spirit style. The entirety of the maturation was done on-site \u2013 as with all his distilleries \u2013 meaning Billy expected that the microclimates of each would deliver some interesting nuances on the slumbering spirit.\n\nIn 2016, ownership of BenRiach, GlenDronach and Glenglassaugh was passed over to Brown-Forman, meaning Billy was confronted with yet another conundrum\u2026 what to do next.\n\nThe GlenAllachie Distillers Co. was born\n\nAfter consulting with his team, Billy purchased the GlenAllachie distillery, as well as MacNair\u2019s Blended Malt and White Heather Blended Scotch Whisky brands. And so The GlenAllachie Distillers Company was formed \u2013 one of the few remaining independent and 100% Scottish owned and managed Scotch whisky firms.\n\nGlenAllachie was the main target for Billy in seeking out a new distillery to revive. It was particularly appealing to him as from a blending perspective he was very familiar with the liquid. It was not a shy spirit; in fact, it was full-bodied and muscular. Moreover, it was an ideal prospect as Billy was very keen to work on a distillery and brand that was totally unexposed to the market \u2013 a blank canvas.\n\nNow over three years into ownership, Billy has continued to demonstrate his hands-on approach and experimental wood management policy, releasing Limited Editions under the GlenAllachie Wood Finishes, Virgin Oak Series, and Single Casks. Billy still believes the GlenAllachie can be taken a step further with ambitions for it to become the best single malt in Speyside \u2013 now there\u2019s a challenge!\n\nWhisky Magazine\u2019s Hall of Fame\n\nIn February 2020, Billy was inducted into Whisky Magazine\u2019s prestigious Hall of Fame. Inspired by the 100 greatest whisky figures in history, the Hall of Fame is a permanent tribute to individuals who have made a lasting contribution to the world of whisky.\n\nWith almost half a century\u2019s tenure under his belt, Billy has undoubtedly left his mark on both the distilleries he has resurrected and the people who have worked around him.

Ronald LaParl was elected to Membership in the PGA of America on June 16, 1945 and elected to the Half Century Club in 1995. Before the age 10, Ron knew he wanted to be a PGA Professional. Without the guidance of a Mother or Father, Ron accomplished his childhood ambition. During his nearly 70 years as a PGA Professional, Ron has been a PGA leader, an outstanding player, an outstanding Teacher, mentor, and a tremendous contributor to his community. As a PGA leader, Ron served the Western Chapter as President and as a Member of the Polcy Board for many years. Ron served on the Michigan Section Board of Directors for 23 consecutive years and 30 years in all. During that time, Ron served the Michigan Section as a Delegate to the PGA of America Annual Meeting on several occasions. On one occasion, in cooperation with former PGA of America President, Horton Smith, Ron and fellow Delegate, Warren Orlick, presented a Resolution to abolish the Caucasian Only Clause in the PGA of America Constitution, for the first time. Although the Resolution was defeated that year, the discussion was started and the Resolution was presented again, by another Section, and passed the next year. Ron was honored by the Michigan Section as Golf Professional of the Year, in 1969, the Horton Smith Award, in 1980, and Teacher of the Year, in 1989. As an outstanding player, Ron won the the Western Chapter Championship over one of Michigan\u2019s all time best players, John Barnum. Ron qualified for the National PGA Championship, 3 times, and also qualified for the US Open. In the 1940\u2019s, playing in an exibition at Cadillac Country Club, Ron shot a 63, to win medalist honors against all time greats, Byron Nelson, Chick Harbert, and Marv Stahl. An outstanding Teacher, Ron has guided the development of many players of all levels, from beginners to outstanding Champions. Most notably, those who competed on Tour. Sharon Miller, Sue Ertl, Randy Erskine, and John Morse are among those who have benefitted from his guidance. As a mentor, Ron is a Pro\u2019s Pro. He represented the PGA and his beloved Battle Creek Country Club in the most Professional manner, and expected all who were guided by him to do the same. This years fellow Michigan PGA Hall of Fame Nominees, Greg Matthews and Dave Kendall, are among the many who have worked for Ron and benefitted from his example. Of all of his accomplishments, Ron may be most proud of his contributions to his community. In 1954, Ron was instrumental in starting the Michigan Section VA Tournament. A World War II Veteran himself, Ron organized the VA Championship, that is still contested annually, for the benefit of the patients of the VA Hospital in Battle Creek. He also organized visits by the patients to Battle Creek Country Club, many of whom were very seriously injured in combat. His relationship with his fellow PGA Professionals, and others in the golf business, created the design of a golf course on the grounds of the Hospital and annual contributions of cash, equipment and apparel, at no cost to the patients. Upon retiring, after 35 years as the Head Professional at Battle Ceeek Country Club, Ron started a scholarship fund that has awarded no less than two scholarships a year ever since.\n\nRay Bolo \u2013 Bolo was the head professional at Western Golf and Country Club in the Detroit area for 37 years, teaching the game, building it through junior golf and making time to play at a high level, too. Bolo, retired and living in South Carolina, was a four-time Michigan PGA Seniors champion, scored an international senior professional division win in Scotland\u2019s International Four Ball Tournament in 1983, and was also part of a winning pro-am team in the celebrated AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 1983. Ben Davis \u2013 A graduate of Detroit Northern High School, Ben distinguished himself as a player and instructor at a time few African-Americans were encouraged to participate in golf. His years of devotion to the game and his playing ability made him a role model. Davis was the first black golf professional given membership in the Michigan Section of the PGA and won the 1974 Michigan PGA Seniors title. He began teaching in 1936 at the Pine Crest Driving Range in Ferndale and few golf professionals anywhere have given more lessons than Davis. Ray Maguire \u2013 \u201cFrom the time I was in knee pants, I knew what I wanted to be and what I was going to be \u2013 a golf pro,\u201d said Maguire. His knee pants start was as a 10 year old caddie at Oakland Hills. \u201cThey said I was too young and too small initially but I got a job the next year.\u201d Maguire eventually served as an assistant professional at Oakland Hills and then spent three decades as head professional at Birmingham Country Club. Maguire was a quintessential professional, teaching, running tournaments, always on hand. Maguire did not chase the pro circuit but he made national news during the 1949 US Open Qualifying Event at Plum Hollow where he aced the 205-yard fifth hole with a 2-iron shot and then holed out again on the 164-yard 14th with a 4 iron. Larry Mancour \u2013 You\u2019ve heard of sneaky long players. Larry Mancour is sneaky good, quietly winning championships, quietly teaching from juniors on up, quietly beginning and coaching a high school team at Alanson in northern Michigan, quietly designing courses including award-winning Dunmaglas at Charlevoix and Chestnut Valley at Harbor Springs and quietly rescuing the Buick Open. Mancour came up the old-fashioned way, caddying at 11-years-old and then working five years on the greens crew at Atlas Valley, mowing fairways and greens and raking bunkers. He moved to California after two years at Flint Junior College and worked as the night waterman at Castlewood Country Club so he could practice and play during the day. He turned pro, taught at Golden Gate Fields driving range with Tony Lema, played on the PGA Tour and built nine holes at Lake Tahoe CC where he spent four years as the professional and teacher. He also won the Arizona Open while playing western events and returned to hometown Flint to play the 1967 Buick Open. That hooked him to stay in Michigan. Mancour built and then managed Grand Blanc Golf Club for three years and it was there, with Buick dealer Vern Parsell, he started the Little Buick Open in 1969 after General Motors surprisingly dropped sponsorship of one of golf\u2019s biggest and most popular events. Billy Casper, Julius Boros, Jack Burke, Tony Lema and Tom Weiskopf, winners of 11 major championships, had won the Buick. Mancour moved from Grand Blanc to the Flint Elks, his home for 20 years, and more local dealers joined him to keep the Buick name alive with the Little Buick Open. \u201cIt was funny watching these Tour guys playing next to a cornfield,\u201d Mancour said of his Elks layout. Finally GM\u2019s Goodwrench Division signed on for the Buick-Goodwrench Open in 1977 and it was played and won by South African Bobby Cole at the Flint Elks. Peter Oosterhuis, now a familiar voice on golf telecasts, tied for third. The tournament returned to Warwick Hills in 1978 with Mancour credited for the restoration. For all of his work in his hometown, building courses, staging tournaments and supporting juniors, Mancour was named to the Flint Area Sports Hall of Fame. As a player Mancour won numerous state tournaments including the Michigan PGA, the Senior PGA and Senior Open. He played in six National PGA Championships, six National PGA Senior Championships and 14 Club Professional Championships. He was twice Michigan Player of the Year and twice Golf Professional of the Year. He won the Quarter Century Championship and the Senior Championship of the PGA Winter Series in Florida. He went to England and finished eighth in the 1992 British Senior Open at Royal Lytham & St. Annes. For all that, Mancour said one of his proudest achievements was seeing seven of his former \u201cBag Boys\u201d follow him to become PGA Head Professionals. Jeff Roth \u2013 Jeff Roth has won 15 Michigan PGA sanctioned major championships, which ties him for the all-time lead with Al Watrous. Below is a partial list of Jeff\u2019s accomplishments: GAM Junior Champion 1973\n\nMichigan All-State High School Team 1974, 1975\n\nMichigan Open Champion 1998, 2004\n\nMichigan PGA Champion 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003\n\nMichigan PGA Senior Championship 2008, 2009\n\nMichigan PGA Match Play 2006, 2007\n\nMichigan PGA Tournament of Champions 1995, 1996, 1999, 2008, 2012\n\nYamaha Golf Classic Champion 1987, 1988\n\nQualified 5 times National PGA Championship\n\nFuller Cup Team 18 times\n\nPGA Cup Team 3 times Jeff is the Michigan\u2019s Section PGA leader in career money won and cumulative Player of the Year Points. Jeff has won 25 PGA sanctioned events over his career. As a golf professional beginning in 1979, he has almost 50 victories to his credit. His 54 hole, no bogey 67-65-66 total of 198 in the 2001 Michigan PGA, for a 9 shot victory, stands out as a career highlight. Winning the last point in the 1996 PGA Cup Matches to win the Cup for the United States Team was possibly his greatest golf moment. Jeff won the last 4 holes to come from 2 down with 4 to play for the winning point at Gleneagles in Scotland. Jack Seltzer \u2013 Jack Seltzer watched on television when Arnold Palmer won the 1964 Masters Tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s when I took up golf,\u201d Seltzer said. Seltzer turned 13 a month before and he lived five blocks from the Swartz Creek municipal golf course. The neighborhood kids played golf and took Seltzer to the course. \u201cThey had a range and the kids showed me how to hold the club and swing. I was hooked from Day 1. Growing up in Flint was great. It was said Flint had the biggest junior golf program in the country. If you were under 16 or over 60 you could play for 60 cents all day. I ripped them off, 54 holes a day,\u201d Seltzer said, laughing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long before I was better than the kids who taught me. I made the varsity at Southwestern High School as a sophomore and won the state championship that year. Eighty guys went out for the team and you had to play.\u201d \u201cI cut 10 lawns on Saturdays and Sundays, $4 a yard. Forty bucks. I was a millionaire!\u201d Seltzer won the Flint Junior Golf Association Championship and the Junior College Championship in 1971 and 1972 and turned professional in 1973. Seltzer\u2019s winning touch got even better as a pro. He won all of the state\u2019s major titles, the PGA, the Match Play and the Open where his ace on the watery ninth hole at the Bear at Grand Traverse Resort became ESPN\u2019s Shot of the Day. It was thanks to a small white deposit by a sea gull at the back of the green. Usually on the final round the hole was cut toward the front. The cup positions are marked the night before with a white dot. But the person who cut the hole that morning mistook the sea gull\u2019s drop for the dot. Seltzer finished at six-under-par, the first player to break par for the championship on the Bear and the local television station sent it national. Seltzer\u2019s performance in the final round of the PGA Cup series against Great Britain & Ireland, the club pros\u2019 Ryder Cup, wasn\u2019t as much a crowd pleaser. In the closing singles he met John Chillas at Muirfield, Scotland. Chillas was unbeaten in three team matches. He lived nearby and a crowd of 300 to 400 was at the tee. \u201cWe hit our tee shots and I looked back and they were all following us. I hit a 7-iron to 10 feet on the first hole and only one person applauded \u2013 my wife, Pam. I made the putt, was 1-up and won 5 and 4,\u201d Seltzer said. Seltzer has continued to win as a senior but his focus is on teaching. It began at home with his son, John Jr.. Dad has taught 38 high school youngsters who made All-State, one Miss Golf Michigan and 11 Dream Team players. Currently he\u2019s working with the Elite Junior Program at the Kendall Academy in Ypsilanti. \u201cThe kids are sponges. It\u2019s great to work with them.\u201d Rick Smith \u2013 In 1996, then Michigan Governor John Engler named Rick Smith Michigan\u2019s \u2018Golf Ambassador\u2019. Engler commended Smith, a world renowned, highly respected and multi-talented golf professional, for his passion and commitment to the sport of golf, golf instruction and his constant efforts to promote the game in the state. Sixteen years ago Engler did a great job recognizing Smith\u2019s career achievements and contributions to the game of golf and the state of Michigan. Smith has and is still making an indelible mark in golf in both Michigan and around the world. As a golf professional and instructor, Smith has risen to become the state\u2019s most acclaimed and nationally recognized figure. In the last 20 years, Golf Digest magazine has regularly ranked Smith among its Top 10 teachers in America. During this time, Golf Digest has consistently ranked Smith top golf instructor in the state. Additionally, Smith has been honored three times by the Michigan PGA Section as its Teacher of the Year. Rick Smith is recognized as one of the top sounding boards for advice by professional golfers. His students, who have won a combined seven major championships and countless PGA Tour victories have included some of the most celebrated names in golf, such as Phil Mickelson, Lee Janzen, Rocco Mediate, Greg Norman and golfer of the century Jack Nicklaus. As a course designer, Smith has also garnered national and state honors. His Arcadia Bluffs design resulted in Michigan\u2019s most celebrated public and resort course, ranked by Golf Digest as No. 10 in its America\u2019s \u2018Greatest Public Golf Courses for America\u2019 list and No. 1 in Michigan. Smith\u2019s other notable designs are Wuskowhan Players Club, the Oakland University Golf Course and a trio of courses at Treetops Resorts including Threetops that gained fame when Smith hosted a nationally televised prime-time skins event on ESPN. The affable and always upbeat Smith exudes class and charisma \u2013 he has established himself as a national media personality and communicator. From co-hosting the first two seasons of the now iconic Big Break series on the Golf Channel, to his teaching tips series on television and video, to his guest interviews on networks at major championships and PGA Tour events, Rick Smith remains a tireless advocate and ambassador for golf and for the state of Michigan. Buddy Whitten \u2013 Whitten was born in Florida and went to school in Mississippi but after Army duty in Vietnam he worked his way to Michigan and an illustrious career in both state and national golf. Whitten played 20 years in the Club Professional Championship and won in 1979. He followed that with a 4-1 record in helping the United States to a 15-6 victory over Great Britain & Ireland in the PGA Cup Matches at Oak Tree in Edmond, Ok. Whitten\u2019s CPC victory earned him a year on the PGA Tour and he also qualified and played on the Champions Tour after hitting his 50th birthday. The Blythefield CC professional was dominant in state golf in the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s, earning Player of the Year honors five times from 1977 to 1990. Whitten was a two-time winner of the Michigan Open, and the PGA stroke and match play championships."}, {"url": "https://www.newjersey.pga.com/halloffame.html/", "page_content": "Bob Ross\n\nClass of 2003\n\nBob Ross the longtime Head Professional at Baltusrol GC hosted (2) US Opens during his tenure 1980 & 1993.

The list of artists who have yet to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame includes some artists you probably just assumed were already in there, such as Freddy Fender, Tanya Tucker and The Judds.\n\nAs Peter Cooper, senior director, producer and writer for the Country Music Hall of Fame, explains in this informative video, each year three individuals or groups are elected into the Hall \u2014 one in each of three categories. The veterans era category is for artists who first achieved national prominence 40 or more years ago. The modern-era artist category is open to any artist who first achieved national prominence 20 or more years ago. Then there\u2019s a rotating category: a non-performer one year, a songwriter the next year and a recording or touring musician the year after that.\n\nHere are 30 artists who are eligible for the Country Music Hall of Fame in one of the two artist categories \u2014 15 in each \u2014 but have yet to get that coveted call. Many will, in time. But as the sheer volume of worthy choices shows, it may take a while. The Country Music Hall of Fame had a \u201ccatch-up\u201d year in 2001, in which they had 12 honorees (rather than the usual three). They may need to have another catch-up year.\n\nAs noted, the Country Music Hall of Fame will consider an act after just 20 years. The Hall should consider changing that restriction to 25 years, which would bring it in line with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame. (For the record, the Songwriters Hall of Fame uses a 20-year standard.) Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, The Chicks, Lee Ann Womack and LeAnn Rimes all qualify for the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2014 they all debuted between 20 and 25 years ago \u2014 but they all seem too current to really be considered.\n\nAfter each artist\u2019s name we show the month and year they first cracked Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart to give you a rough idea of when they first achieved national prominence.

No CMA Awards, but 11 nominations, including single of the year for \u201cTennessee Flat Top Box\u201d (1988). Her legendary father, Johnny Cash, was inducted in 1980. The Cashes would be the first father and daughter to each be inducted. (Pam Tillis and Lorrie Morgan could also achieve this distinction if they join their already inducted fathers Mel Tillis and George Morgan.)\n\nJessi Colter: First charted: November 1970. One CMA Award: album of the year for Wanted! The Outlaws, a collab with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Tompall Glaser.

I'd first read about him in 2007 in a press release from National High Five Day, a group that was trying to establish a holiday for convivial palm-slapping on the third Thursday in April. Apparently, Sleets had been reluctantly put in touch with the holiday's founders, and he explained that his father, Lamont Sleets Sr., served in Vietnam in the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry -- a unit nicknamed The Five. The men of The Five often gathered at the Sleets home when Lamont Jr. was a toddler. They'd blow through the front door doing their signature greeting: arm straight up, five fingers spread, grunting \"Five.\" Lamont Jr. loved to jump up and slap his tiny palms against their larger ones. \"Hi, Five!\" he'd yell, unable to keep all their names straight. Years later, Sleets started high-fiving his Murray State teammates, and when the Racers played away games, other teams followed. In short, Lamont Sleets was both the inventor of the high five and its Johnny Appleseed.\n\nThe low five had been a fixture of African-American culture since at least World War II. It might seem impossible to pinpoint when the low five ratcheted itself upright and evolved into the high five, but there are countless creation myths in circulation. Magic Johnson once suggested that he invented the high five at Michigan State. Others trace it to the women's volleyball circuit in the 1960s. But the Sleets story quickly shot around the Internet and into local newspapers, displacing, or at least undermining, all other claims. Sleets was budging his way atop the high-five hierarchy.\n\nWhen he answered my phone call, Sleets sounded tired. He was on his way to work, he said, and told me to try back at 4:30 that afternoon. So I did. But he never picked up my call again. In the following weeks, I dialed him more than a dozen times. I pleaded in voice mails and texts. I combed local newspaper archives and funeral notices, looking in vain for someone who knew him. Gradually, the man attained an elusive, gurulike aura in my mind.\n\n\"He was kind of a private person\" was all his Murray State coach, Ron Greene, could tell me. (Greene said his memory is so fuzzy that he \"couldn't confirm or deny\" the high-five story.) Old-timers in Eminence, I was told, still point to invisible marks on the high school basketball court from where Sleets routinely sank jumpers -- spots well beyond where the three-point line has since been painted. Steve Frommeyer, Eminence High's principal, said everyone asked about the high five when the school inducted the guard into its hall of fame four years ago, but Sleets didn't show up for the ceremony. Years ago, Frommeyer added, the school retired Sleets' jersey, but it was mysteriously stolen off the gymnasium wall shortly thereafter.\n\nIn search of a definitive lead, I reached out to the founders of National High Five Day: Conor Lastowka, a comedy writer, and Greg Harrell-Edge, who was once named \"Laziest Person in America\" in a nationwide search by Jimmy Kimmel Live! Talking to them, I suddenly had the good sense to ask whether the Sleets story was even true.\n\n\"You know,\" Harrell-Edge said, \"you are actually the first person to ask us that.\"\n\nIt was all a hoax, a publicity stunt. They'd concocted the whole story, then scoured college basketball rosters to plug in a name. \"We just found the guy and made up a story about his dad,\" Lastowka said. He seemed amused that I'd gotten the actual Lamont Sleets on the phone, if only briefly.\n\nPART TWO: THE HIGH FIVE OF LIFE\n\nIF THIS PRANK HAS A VICTIM, it's Glenn Burke, a young outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the late 1970s whose astonishing physique and 17-inch biceps earned him the nickname King Kong.\n\nFor at least a generation before the Sleets story surfaced, the conventional wisdom had been that Burke invented the high five on Oct. 2, 1977, in front of 46,000 screaming fans at Dodger Stadium.\n\nLamont Sleets says the high five came from his dad, who served in the 5th Infantry.\n\nIt was the last day of the regular season, and Dodgers leftfielder Dusty Baker had just gone deep off the Astros' J.R. Richard. It was Baker's 30th home run, making the Dodgers the first team in history to have four sluggers -- Baker, Ron Cey, Steve Garvey and Reggie Smith -- with at least 30 homers each. It was a wild, triumphant moment and a good omen as the Dodgers headed to the playoffs. Burke, waiting on deck, thrust his hand enthusiastically over his head to greet his friend at the plate. Baker, not knowing what to do, smacked it. \"His hand was up in the air, and he was arching way back,\" says Baker, now 62 and managing the Reds. \"So I reached up and hit his hand. It seemed like the thing to do.\"\n\nBurke then stepped up and launched his first major league home run. And as he returned to the dugout, Baker high-fived him. From there, the story goes, the high five went ricocheting around the world. (According to Dodgers team historian Mark Langill, the game was not televised, and no footage survives.)\n\nThe high five was a natural outgrowth of Burke's personality. The Oakland native was an irrepressibly charismatic man who, even as a 24-year-old rookie that season, had become the soul of the Dodgers' clubhouse. He did Richard Pryor standup from memory and would stuff towels under his shirt and waddle bowlegged around the dugout, imitating Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. \"He was a joyous, gregarious person,\" sports agent Abdul-Jalil al-Hakim says of Burke, a friend since childhood. \"He could high-five you without necessarily going through the motion with his hand.\"\n\nWhat most people didn't know was that Burke was gay. Following his retirement in 1980, he became the first major leaguer to come out. Even though he tried to keep his sexuality a secret during his playing days, there had been rumors in the clubhouse. And as the 2010 television documentary Out: The Glenn Burke Story revealed, Dodgers executives scrambled to squash those rumors at all costs: In the off-season of 1977, team VP Al Campanis offered Burke $75,000 to get married. (The Dodgers executive later explained the offer not as a bribe but as a \"helpful gesture\" to pay for Burke's honeymoon.) According to a friend, Burke rejected the marriage deal with a mix of wit and rebelliousness. He told Campanis, \"I guess you mean to a woman.\"\n\nIt was around that time that Burke struck up a relationship with Spunky Lasorda, aka Tommy Lasorda Jr. Spunky was a lithe young socialite who frequented West Hollywood's gay scene, smoking cigarettes from a long holder. A 1992 GQ profile of Spunky portrays his homosexuality as an open secret. But his father was in staunch denial and remained so even after Spunky's death in 1991 from pneumonia. GQ reported that the death certificate said his illness was likely AIDS-related. \"My son wasn't gay. No way,\" Lasorda Sr. told the magazine.\n\nBurke and Spunky's relationship didn't become public until years later and remains ambiguous. Burke's sister, Lutha Davis, insists the two men were just close friends. In his 1995 memoir Out at Home, co-authored with Erik Sherman, Burke went out of his way to leave the true nature of their relationship unclear. \"That's my business,\" he wrote. He also explained that Lasorda Sr.'s homophobia was something he and Spunky commiserated about. Burke described them turning up together at Lasorda's house one night, done up in pigtails and drag, hoping to stage a kind of gay Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. They chickened out before knocking on the door.\n\nBurke often high fived Dodgers teammate Dusty Baker.\n\nWhatever the case, Burke's association with Spunky marks the point at which his big league career took an irrevocable left turn. Lasorda stopped being amused by the player's dugout antics and, according to Burke, once turned on him and chewed him out. \"Glenn had such an abundance of respect and love for Tommy Lasorda,\" says Burke's sister. \"When things went bad at the end, it was almost like a father turning his back on his son.\" Early in the 1978 season, the Dodgers abruptly dealt Burke to the Oakland A's, among the most lackluster teams in baseball, for Billy North, an outfielder past his prime. LA sportswriters described the trade as sucking the life out of the Dodgers' clubhouse. A couple of players were seen crying at their lockers.\n\nTo be fair, North was a proven player, whereas Burke wasn't yet delivering on his potential. And that's how Campanis explained the deal at the time. But for Burke, and several teammates, the trade had everything to do with his sexuality -- though the outfielder sounded off to the press about it in only the most cryptic terms. \"I never got a chance here,\" he said. \"I felt I was supposed to kiss ass and I didn't. As far as getting along with Lasorda, that didn't work out too well.\"\n\nAfter unproductive years in 1978 and '79, Burke hoped for a fresh start in 1980 under new A's manager Billy Martin. But the gay rumors followed him to Oakland. Martin threw the word \"faggot\" around the clubhouse and didn't play Burke. Some teammates even avoided showering with him. Burke, accustomed to being the heart of the clubhouse, felt crippled by the discomfort he was causing. His unhappiness was compounded by a knee injury and a demotion to Triple-A. After playing just 25 games in the minors in 1980, he abruptly retired, feeling it was his only option.\n\nHe was 27 years old. \"It's the first thing in my life I ever backed down from,\" he later said.\n\nBurke started hanging around San Francisco's Castro district. He became a star shortstop in a local gay softball league and dominated in the Gay Softball World Series. \"I was making money playing ball and not having any fun,\" he said of his time in the majors. \"Now I'm not making money, but I'm having fun.\" Jack McGowan, a friend in the Castro who has since passed away, once said of Burke: \"He was a hero to us. He was athletic, clean cut, masculine. He was everything that we wanted to prove to the world that we could be.\"\n\nIn the Castro, Burke's creation of the high five was part of this Herculean mystique. He would regularly sit on the hood of a car -- whichever one happened to be parked in front of a gay bar called the Pendulum Club -- flash his magnetic smile and high-five everyone who walked by. In 1982, Burke came out publicly in an Inside Sports magazine profile called \"The Double Life of a Gay Dodger.\" The writer, a gay activist named Michael J. Smith, appropriated the high five as a defiant symbol of gay pride. Rising from the wreckage of Burke's aborted baseball career, Smith wrote, was \"a legacy of two men's hands touching, high above their heads.\"\n\nBy that time, however, Burke was struggling with a drug habit. It escalated in 1987, when a car plowed into him as he was crossing a street, breaking his right leg in four places and stealing his athleticism. He couldn't hold a job. He went broke. He did some time at San Quentin for grand theft. Then in 1993, he tested positive for HIV. He passed away on May 30, 1995, after a sharp and grisly decline. One obituary noted that, at the end, the man who invented the high five \"could barely lift his arm.\"\n\nAs Burke's life sputtered downward, the high five madly ascended. Even by 1980, the Dodgers were selling \"High Five\" T-shirts with a trademarked logo of two upraised hands connecting. A promotional poster explained: \"The 'High Five' salute has become the Dodgers' standard salute during the 1980 season. It is given customarily following a home run, good defensive play or Dodger victory.\"\n\nIt wasn't just LA. The high five was being celebrated as a welcome injection of style throughout sports. In 1981, the Canadian magazine Maclean's noted that, thankfully, \"when a black guy has hit a home run,\" the players scoring ahead of him don't just stand around anymore and \"shake his hand like a bunch of Rotarians at lunch on a Tuesday.\"\n\nBurke's friend Abdul-Jalil al-Hakim argues: \"The high five liberated everybody. It gave you permission to enjoy your high points.\" And not just in sports but at your kid's spelling bee or your office after a killer PowerPoint presentation. In this interpretation, Burke didn't just add a bit of flair to baseball -- he uncorked a repressed longing for personal expression and connection in all of American society.\n\nBurke's sister, Lutha Davis, says Burke himself was pleased to see the high five spilling out of sports to punctuate smaller, everyday joys. \"Now when something great happens in life, people do the high five,\" she says. \"I call it 'the high five of life.'\"\n\nYears after her brother died, Davis was watching Jeopardy! when a question about the inventor of the high five popped up. People who knew Glenn have always known \"the truth,\" she told me, but it was gratifying to watch some anonymous, Midwestern-looking contestant buzz in right away and say, with unflappable certainty, \"Who is Glenn Burke?\"\n\nPART THREE: THE FOUR-FINGERED MAN\n\nBURKE DIED BELIEVING THE HIGH FIVE was his legacy, and the more I learned about him, the more tragic the Sleets hoax seemed. It's nice to believe that something as magnificent as the high five could be invented only once, in a romantic, unforgettable flash. The truth is, such things are invented many times, by many people -- there are multiple mythologies rewritten over time. I've come to realize this because I happened upon a third, entirely credible story of the high five. It goes like this:\n\nAt a University of Louisville basketball practice during the 1978-79 season, forward Wiley Brown went to give a plain old low five to his teammate Derek Smith. Out of nowhere, Smith looked Brown in the eye and said, \"No. Up high.\"\n\nThe Cardinals were known as the Doctors of Dunk. They played above the rim. So when Smith raised his hand, it clicked for Brown: He understood how the low five went against the essential, vertical character of their team. \"I thought, yeah, why are we staying down low? We jump so high,\" says Brown, now head coach at Indiana University Southeast. Brown insists it's Smith who invented the high five and Smith who spread it around the country.\n\nIn fact, high fives turn up in highlight reels of the 1978-79 Louisville team. Occasionally, they're jerky, thrusting fives -- more like spears thrown perpendicularly at the other guy's torso -- but they're clearly among the first high fives ever broadcast into American living rooms. Midway through the second half of the 1980 NCAA Final against UCLA, Brown posted up against Kiki Vandeweghe and overpowered him, banking in a shot and drawing the foul. In footage of the game, Brown immediately rams his left arm up to slap Smith five. (Brown always made a point of high-fiving with his left hand because as a kid he had his right thumb amputated and it somehow didn't feel right to high-five with four fingers.) The announcer, Al McGuire, shouts: \"Mr. Brown came to play! And they're giving him the high-five handshake. High five!\"\n\nBoth Derek Smith and Wiley Brown grew up in small, poor towns in southern Georgia. Smith is said to have arrived on the Louisville campus as a shy stutterer with all of his possessions in one bag. According to Brown, Smith was always blown away that someone with an undistinguished background like his could make an indelible impact on the entire world. \"He'd talk about the high five constantly,\" Brown says. \"It was one of those things he was most proud of, right up there with getting his degree, having his kids and marrying his beautiful wife.\"\n\nI couldn't ask Derek Smith about his invention of the high five. After a respectable NBA career, he died suddenly in 1996 from an undiagnosed heart condition. (His son, Nolan Smith, was drafted out of Duke by the Trail Blazers in June.) But Brown told me about one particular day at Louisville, after Smith got a call about the high five from a big-city newspaper. \"Derek was talking about how this was going to go down in history,\" Brown says. \"It would be something we could tell our kids and grandkids about. I've got a smile on my face now just talking about it.\""}, {"url": "https://www.portcolborne.ca/en/recreation-and-leisure/sports-wall-of-fame.aspx", "page_content": "Umbo Concessi\n\nBorn on April 13, 1918, Umbo Concessi started playing Lions Minor Hockey in 1929.

All through his childhood he faced many dif\ufb01culties such as having to limp and needing a special pair of \u201cboot shoes\u201d one in size 5 with a lift, and the other in size 7 1/2, and yet never once complained. He loved the game of hockey and even though he ached to lace up a pair of skates, he never bemoaned the fact that he would never be able to do so. Instead he would hike down to White\u2019s Arena and did what he could by becoming a member of the team as their stickboy, and held that and other positions with many teams during his youth. That love of hockey never waned and once the Westside Arena opened in January 1960, Ray became the trainer for the Port Colborne Intermediate Sailors which he held until the team disbanded in the late 1970's. In addition to being the trainer for the Sailors, Ray also operated the skate sharpening concession at the arena for many years. Known as \u201cBricky\u201d or \u201cUncle Bricky\u201d to the youngsters, he loved kids and spent any spare minute he had at the Westside Arena. Bricky never turned down anyone who needed their skates sharpened regardless of whether or not they could pay. It was a pleasure and it made his day to see the smile on the face of that aspiring young hockey player.\n\nRay \u201cBricky\u201d Leavere is the perfect example showing that we are capable of doing anything we put our minds to, as positive thinking is just another term for faith.

In 1923, the nifty centreman became a stalwart with the Humberstone Juniors. Nicknamed the \u201cHopper\u201d, Billy Mountain was described as being the \u201cfastest man on the ice\u201d during the O.H.A. Junior Playoffs of 1926 against Kitchener. A successful Junior career lifted the speedy centreman onto the Port Colborne Intermediate \u201cA\u201d team for the 1927-28 Season and in 1928 he formed part of a very talented team that won the O.H.A. Intermediate Championship. Later, he went on to play Senior \u201cA\u201d for Port Colborne and went to the \ufb01nals in 1931 for the Allan Cup before losing to Hamilton.

After WW1, local hockey businessmen, Tommy Lannan and Harold Foote, recruited \u201cAmby\u201d to come to Port Colborne and play for the Sailors. In 1920-21, after \u201cAmby\u201d had retired as a player, he was Secretary/Treasurer of the Junior Hockey Club that became the O.H.A. Champions. He settled in Port Colborne, married a local girl, Florence Amenthe Reeb and raised two sons, Kenneth Ambrose and Allen Vincent. He became Division Court Clerk in 1922 and began a successful insurance business which continues to operate to this day.\n\nHis love of hockey had \u201cAmby\u201d as coach of the Port Colborne Lions Provincial Midget Champions in 1940-41. This team included his son Allen and future NHL stars Don Gallinger (Boston Bruins) and Ted \u201cTeeder\u201d Kennedy (Toronto Maple Leafs).

G. Marsh\n\nThe main force behind the construction of the Port Colborne Humberstone Community Centre or more commonly known as the \u201cWestside Arena\u201d was Ernie Marsh. Through his efforts and those of others, the arena became a reality, as it opened January 27th, 1960. A tireless worker, he chose not an easy path. Under no obligation, on so many occasions he could have easily given up. He could have said, \u201cwhat\u2019s the use of trying?\u201d But not Mr. Marsh. He had a job he wanted to do and stuck to it.\n\nFor every door that was closed in his face, he opened a new one. For three years (3) Mr. Marsh volunteered his time into the building of the Arena until it opened in 1960. It was more than \ufb01tting that Mr. Marsh is the Chairman Of The Charter Board of Directors of the Arena. As it was said in 1960 and should be now \u201cThank you Ernie, thank you!\u201d\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nRobert \u201cNipper\u201d Wilson\n\n\u201cNipper\u201d Wilson was one of the most colourful \ufb01gures in this area in the coaching circles. A native of Port Colborne, \u201cNipper\u201d was known as a sportsman and hockey coach from coast to coast in Canada and Western New York State. He was known as a dynamic person, a hard \ufb01ghter and one in the company of whom there could be few dull moments.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nFlorent Cloutier\n\nBorn in Quebec in 1941, \u201cFlo\u201d moved to Port Colborne in 1968. In 1970, Flo started Club Frontenac Hockey. From a four (4) team, 60 player league, the Organization now operates four (4) divisions of Hockey, with 25 teams and over 400 players, including an Oldtimers Division. Flo was an Olympic 1988 award winner as a volunteer for exemplary service to the recreational interests in Port Colborne. Through his diligent efforts, Club Frontenac has been a major \ufb01nancial contributor to the Teeder Kennedy Youth Arena in capital improvements, scoreclock, penalty/timers box and north and south end glass. He has spent countless hours in the Arenas, ensuring that Club Frontenac Hockey continues to be a success for the next 25 years!\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nJames H.

Woods will turn 45 in December and a player is eligible if he or she is the minimum age by the year of the ceremony.\n\nThe minimum for induction is 15 wins combined on the major tours. Given that Woods has 15 majors among 82 total wins, he will be a lock to be inducted.\n\n\"We believe these changes will enhance the Hall of Fame in many ways and bring greater attention to the most deserving players at a time in their careers when they are still competing at the highest level,\" said Greg McLaughlin, the World Golf Foundation CEO. \"We look forward to the future of the Hall of Fame as we ensure it remains a meaningful way to recognize the game's greats.\"\n\nThe Hall has undergone several changes over the years, including induction age. For a time it was age 40, which is why players such as Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els were inducted long ago. It was then changed to 50 and now back to 45.\n\nBesides Woods, other players who will now be eligible in 2021 include Jim Furyk, Padraig Harrington, Lee Westwood and Henrik Stenson. Women who will be eligible are Dottie Pepper, Jane Geddes, Sophie Gustafson and Liselotte Neumann.\n\nBubba Watson, Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott and Justin Rose would be eligible in 2023.\n\nTo be eligible, a player must also have a minimum of 15 official victories (on any of the world tours) or a minimum of two wins among the major championships and the Players Championship.\n\nWoods, who is playing his first tournament of 2020 this week at Torrey Pines, would nearly be eligible just on his California tour wins alone. He has 14 PGA Tour wins in the state, including eight at Torrey Pines. He will be trying to set the PGA Tour career record of 83 wins this week."}]}
