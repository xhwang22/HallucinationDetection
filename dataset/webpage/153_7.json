This was at the National Aquatic Centre, Beijing, China, yesterday.\n\nA silver medallist in the 100-metre individual medley on Thursday night, the 29-year-old Bovell, a four-time Olympian, went one better in the 50m freestyle splash when he raced home in 20.98 seconds from lane four, his fourth straight sub-21 clocking to take gold and the US$1,500 winners prize to up his World Cup earnings to US$14,500.\n\nHis main rival, USA\u2019s 2000 Olympic champion, Anthony Ervin and winner of the three other 50m freestyle finals, got silver from lane three in 21.19 while Australian Cameron Mc Evoy took bronze in 21.46 from lane five.\n\nSpeaking after his win, the T&T swimmer said, \u201cI fought back tonight (yesterday) with another sub-21 effort to win the 50m free. The American Anthony Ervin wasn\u2019t able to match my speed as I answered his challenge from Berlin.\n\nThe score of the rivalry now stands at 3-3 with two stops to go. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite as fast as I had been in Stockholm as there were a few minor errors but anytime I can swim below 21, I will take it and be thankful. It\u2019s not easy, but my consistency is paying off here\u201d, said Bovell III.\n\nThe 2004 Athens Greece bronze medallist now has 12 medals (five gold, seven silver). He also won gold in the 50m freestyle in Sweden (20.82), a new national record and Moscow (20.90) in back-to-back meets while his other sub-21 clocking came in Berlin last month, 20.97, in a silver swim.\n\nHis time of 20.82 also puts him as the second fastest swimmer in the 50m freestyle behind 2008 Olympic champion, Brazilian Cesar Cielo. The other finishers in the gold medal splash were Finland\u2019s Ari-Pekka Liukkonen (21.63), Aussie duo Kyle Richardson (21.73) and Tomasso D\u2019Orgogna (21.80), and Chinese swimmers, Zhiwu Lu (22.00) and Yang Shi (22.16).\n\nEarlier on in the morning heats, the USA-based top T&T swimmer and seventh placed finisher in the men\u2019s 50m freestyle final at the London Olympic Games, won the fifth and final heat 21.55 ahead of Mc Evoy (21.57), D\u2019Orgogna (21.71), Chinese Taipei\u2019s Kuo-Chi Chang (22.43), China\u2019s Tengfei Shi (22.55), Russian, Viacheslav Prudnikov (22.92) and home town duo, Zhaochen Liu (23.09) and Enjian Zhang (23.33).\n\nBovell III\u2019s time was also the top qualifier for the finals ahead of Mc Evoy while D\u2019Orgogna has the fourth fastest time. Ervin won heat three in 21.68 for the third best time while Richardson was second in the heat in 21.80 and fifth best overall, and Shi, third in 22.22 for the eight and final top qualifying time. Liukkonen (21.83) and Lu (22.10) were the top two swimmers from heat three.\n\nPrior to the meet in China, Bovell had 92 points to trail To (110) while Japan\u2019s Daiya Seto was next with 81 and with his gold and silver swim, the T&T swimmer was expected to close the gap at the top even more with two more legs to come in Tokyo, Japan, on Tuesday and Wednesday followed by Singapore on Saturday and Sunday, after which the top ranked swimmer will get US$100,000, second US$50,000 and third, US$30,000.\n\nBy Nigel Simon\n\nSource: www.guardian.co.tt"}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2021/07/07/kelly-ann-baptiste-joins-george-bovell-iii-as-most-capped-trinidad-and-tobago-olympian/", "page_content": "Kelly-Ann Baptiste joins George Bovell III as most capped Trinidad and Tobago Olympian\n\nKelly Ann Baptiste -\n\nWOMEN\u2019S track and field sprinter Kelly-Ann Baptiste will join legendary swimmer George Bovell III as the most capped TT Olympian, as she is set to make her fifth appearance at the 2020 Tokyo Games, from July 23-August 8.\n\nA media release by the TT Olympic Committee (TTOC) on Wednesday, said, \u201cBovell made five consecutive appearances starting with the 2000 Sydney Olympics followed by his historic bronze medal effort at the 2004 Athens Games (in the 200-metre individual medley), team TTO\u2019s sole medal for that edition of the Olympics.\u201d\n\nBovell III did not let an injury deter him from continuing his swimming career as he switched focus to another event.\n\n\u201cAfter an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury in September 2004, Bovell was forced to change his specialty from the endurance-testing 200m individual medley to the 50m freestyle dash. He still qualified and splashed into action in the 2008 Beijing Games (semi-final) and 2012 London Games (seventh) before hanging up his goggles and cap following a first round exit at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Baptiste\u2019s Olympic career the release said, \u201cBaptiste will also be making five consecutive appearances in a record that saw her making her Olympic debut as part of the women\u2019s 4x100m relay team at the 2004 Athens Games when the powerful Tobago-native led off the relay team that failed to carry the baton all-the way round and were disqualified in the first round.\n\n\u201cFour years later at the 2008 Beijing edition, she reached the second round in the individual event while another baton mishap saw another disqualification in the women\u2019s 4x100m relay.\u201d\n\nShe had her best showing at the 2012 Games. \u201cBaptiste\u2019s best Olympic performance came at the 2012 London Games where she finished sixth in the final but Team TTO\u2019s women\u2019s relay woes continued with another failed trip, and in 2016 Rio, she exited at the second round.\u201d\n\nBaptiste, 34, will again line up in the women's 100m dash and women's 4x100m relay team.\n\nBaptiste is being described as the \u201cstateswoman\u201d of the TT Olympic contingent.\n\nOn Tuesday, the TTOC announced the full TT team that covers seven sporting disciplines including track and field, boxing, cycling, judo, rowing, sailing and swimming. TTOC president Brian Lewis hinted that TT may make history by naming its first women\u2019s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.\n\n\"To date, the TTOC has never had a female flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of a Summer Olympic Games,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that a female athlete will be chosen by the chef de mission Lovie Santana to carry the TT flag during the opening ceremony in Tokyo 2020.\"\n\nTT will have Santana, the experienced TTOC senior administrative officer, at the helm while TTOC project officer, athletes services and programmes, Rheeza Grant will serve as TT's covid19 liaison officer. TT will also rely on a strong medical staff of nine led by Dr Rudranath Ramsawak.\n\nAfter the Games were rescheduled due to the pandemic, Lewis said, \"The TTOC acknowledges the perseverance, dedication and determination of every athlete who tried their best to qualify for the covid19 pandemic impacted games, the first Olympic Games in history to be postponed.\"\n\nThis year's Olympic Games also hold special significance for the TTOC as it coincides with its 75-year anniversary."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/31930301/swimmer-caeleb-dressel-powers-4th-gold-victory-50-meter-freestyle-tokyo-olympics", "page_content": "Securing his place as one of the biggest stars of the Tokyo Games, Caeleb Dressel became just the fifth swimmer to win five gold medals at a single Olympics.\n\nDressel won two more golds Sunday at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, first winning the men's 50-meter freestyle in an Olympic-record time of 21.07 seconds, then returning about an hour later to swim the butterfly leg and help the U.S. set a world record in winning the 4x100 medley relay, a race the Americans have never lost.\n\nWith his fifth victory, Dressel joined Americans Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi, as well as East Germany's Kristin Otto, as the only swimmers to win as many as five golds at one Olympics. Phelps did it three times.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself. I feel like I reached what my potential was here at these games,'' Dressel said. \"It was just really fun racing.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to savor his triumph for long, right on par for a guy who said a few days ago that \"swimming was a lot more fun when no one knew who I was.''\n\nThey certainly know who he is now.\n\n\"I give myself a pat on the back and then I just want to go home, put it away and move forward,\" Dressel said.\n\nIn the 50 free, Dressel cruised to a relatively easy victory in the frenetic dash from one end of the pool to the other. France's Florent Manaudou repeated as the Olympic silver medalist in 21.55 and Brazil's Bruno Fratus claimed the bronze in 21.57, edging out American Michael Andrew for the final spot on the podium.\n\nCaeleb Dressel joined Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, Matt Biondi and Kristin Otto as the only swimmers to win as many as five golds at one Olympics.

Just like that, he blew by Britain and Italy with a blistering leg of 49.03 seconds, more than a second faster that anyone else.\n\nZach Apple made the lead stand up on the freestyle to give the Americans a world record of 3 minutes, 26.78 seconds, eclipsing the mark of 3:27.28 they set at the 2009 Rome world championships in rubberized suits.\n\nRyan Murphy and Andrew joined Dressel and Apple on the winning team, ensuring the Americans remained unbeaten in the medley relay, the final swimming event at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre.\n\nBritain won silver, and Italy won bronze.\n\nDressel entered the day with golds in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay, 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly, in which he set the world record.\n\nAmerican Bobby Finke used a strong finishing kick to win the grueling men's 1,500-meter freestyle race for his second gold medal of the Olympics.\n\nJust as he did in winning the 800-meter freestyle, Finke stayed closed throughout the 30-lap race and turned on the speed at the end. He touched in 14:39.65.\n\nUkraine's Mykhailo Romanchuk took the silver in 14:40.66, and the bronze went to Germany's Florian Wellbrock in 14:40.91. Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri faded to fourth in 14:45.01.\n\nThe top four were close nearly the entire race, often separated by less than a second at the turns. But that was right where Finke needed to be. After his closing lap in the 800, he knew he had the speed at the end to beat everyone else.\n\n\"I was confident in my ability to come home,\" Finke said.\n\nFinke was perhaps the biggest American surprise at the pool. Relatively unknown before the U.S. trials, he became the first American male to win the 1,500 since Mike O'Brien at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\n\"I came in not really expecting to get a medal or anything,\" Finke said, \"and I come out of it with two golds.\"\n\nAustralia's Emma McKeon made history Sunday by winning her sixth and seventh medals in Tokyo, the most ever in a single Olympics by a female swimmer. The only men to do it are Phelps, Spitz and Biondi.\n\nMcKeon won the women's 50-meter freestyle in an Olympic-record time of 23.81 seconds. Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom won the silver, and Denmark's Pernille Blume, the defending Olympic champion, took bronze. American Abbey Weitzeil was last in the eight-woman field.\n\nLess than an hour later, McKeon got her historic seventh medal when she took the butterfly leg and helped the Aussies win the 4x100 medley relay in an Olympic-record 3:51.60. Weitzeil couldn't quite hold off Cate Campbell, leaving the U.S. with a silver at 3:51.73. The bronze went to Canada (3:52.60).\n\nMcKeon is only the second woman in any sport to win seven medals at an Olympics, joining Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya, who claimed two golds and five silvers at the 1952 Helsinki Games.\n\n\"It still feels very surreal,'' said McKeon, a 27-year-old from Brisbane, Australia. \"It's going to take a little bit to sink in.

But Ledecky swam the fastest leg in the event, and the United States finished 0.40 seconds behind China\u2019s world-record time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so easy to get up for a Team U.S.A. relay, so I wasn\u2019t as nervous, maybe,\u201d Ledecky said, surrounded by teammates, all draped in silver medals. \u201cI just knew I was going to let it go and go for it, each lap of that race.\u201d\n\nIt capped a big day for the Americans, as Caeleb Dressel won his first Olympic gold medal for an individual race on Thursday, setting an Olympic record of 47.02 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle and beating out rival Kyle Chalmers of Australia by six-hundredths of a second.\n\nDressel sprang out of the blocks six-hundredths of a second faster than Chalmers \u2014 the final margin at the finish.

She raced past Australia to nearly catch China, claiming silver for the United States.\n\nThe usual strategy, she said afterward, is to pace yourself through the first 100 meters, saving a dose of energy for the final sprint to the finish. Ledecky hit the water at full speed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough experience at that relay to know that even when I try to pull back that first 100, it\u2019s still really fast and I can still come home,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I just kind of let it go.\u201d\n\nAustralia was a big favorite with Ariarne Titmus, who won the individual 200 and 400 freestyles, ahead of Ledecky both times.\n\nThe Aussies came to Tokyo looking to lower the world record of 7:41.50 that it established in 2019. Australia\u2019s swimmers had already won the 4x100 free relay on Sunday, setting a world record.\n\nIn Tokyo, so far, Ledecky has a gold and two silver medals, plus a fifth-place finish. She has spent a career raising gold-or-bust expectations, and is now swimming with the curse of having to explain that she does not win every race.\n\nLedecky\u2019s come-from-behind leg, faster than any rivals and lifting her team, showed that there would be no shame in silver."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/sports/olympics/swimming-dressel-finke-relays-results.html", "page_content": "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to be able to process things,\u201d Finke said afterward. \u201cI came into to this meet not really expecting to medal for anything.\u201d\n\nDressel had entered the meet with much higher expectations. He opened the session by winning his fourth gold medal of the Games with a lung-busting sprint to victory in the 50 free. Diving off the blocks, he surfaced in the lead and never gave it up \u2014 or took a breath \u2014 as he finished in 21.07 seconds, an Olympic record. Florent Manaudou of France finished second in 21.55 seconds, and Bruno Fratus of Brazil (21.57) came in third.\n\nWhen Dressel learned that he had won, he flexed his left bicep and then hustled out of the pool to prepare for the day\u2019s final race, the 4x100 medley relay.\n\nDressel had entered the pool Sunday having already won three gold medals at the Games, in the 4x100 freestyle relay, the 100 free and the 100 butterfly. His time in the 100 butterfly, 49.45 seconds, was also a world record."}, {"url": "https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/jamaica-trinidad-60/george-bovell-splashed-his-way-to-the-top-of-swimming/", "page_content": "George Richard Lycott Bovell is a pioneering Olympic Games swim medalist who will go down as one of the greatest from the Caribbean.\n\nBorn on July 18, 1983, Bovell is a five-time Olympian who claimed a bronze medal in the men\u2019s 200m Individual Medley at the 2004 Olympic Games to become the ninth medalist from his country.
