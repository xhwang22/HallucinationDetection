The documentary, a Queen City Pictures film production distributed by 1091 Pictures, follows the band through their last-ever tour, concluding with their much talked about final show that took place June 18, 2016 at the Worcester Palladium. Focusing on the members of BANE, Aaron Bedard (vocals), Aaron Dalbec (guitar), Zach Jordan (guitar), James Siboni (bass), and Bob Mahoney (drums), the film closes the chapter on 21 years as a band. Holding These Moments serves as an emotional love letter to the band, their fans, and their legacy, while examining the challenges of living and creating art on your own terms. To coincide with the digital release of the film on October 13th, Equal Vision Records has launched an exclusive physical pre-order available on a VHS shaped USB drive which is available for purchase here.\n\nBANE and Equal Vision Records first joined forces in 1998 with a compilation release of the band\u2019s earlier work titled Holding This Moment. Throughout their 21 year course as a band, BANE released four full-lengths through the label including It All Comes Down to This (1999), Give Blood (2001), The Note (2005), and their final send-off Don\u2019t Wait Up (2014). Formed in 1995, the band has made a lasting impact on the hardcore community, from playing shows across the world to the infamous BA | NE hoodie. Holding These Moments marks the end of over two decades for BANE and serves as a backward glance at the all-or-nothing decision to end the band with a final album and tour.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.equalvision.com/artists/bane/", "page_content": "The bittersweet final album comes nearly twenty years after Bane\u2019s first release, which led the band on countless tours and earned them widespread respect for being one of the hardest working bands in the business.

Since their inception, they've become one of the scene's hardest working bands touring the world over and releasing the full lengths, \"It All Comes Down To This\" and 2001's critically acclaimed \"Give Blood,\" an album that breathed life into the then-stagnant hardcore scene. Returning with their first album in three years, Bane offer up \"The Note\" - an album that embodies the spirit, the community, and the love of traditional hardcore that Bane has become synonymous with. In stark contrast with many of its contemporaries \"The Note\" is not laden with trends but with powerful, energetic and passionate performances that serve as a wake up call for modern day hardcore.\n\n\n\nProduced and recorded by Brian McTernan (Hot Water Music, Thrice, Cave In) \"The Note\" is a ten-track, super charged, much needed shot of hardcore. Fans of Bane will recognize the high-octane vocals of Aaron Bedard, which are complemented by a frenzy of raucous riffs furious enough to ignite circle pits. This is an album of anthems that'll inspire hardcore kids to rise above, to crawl over each other's heads, reaching, grabbing and clawing to share the mic with Bedard, to sing lyrics like \"These are the only crowded rooms / I don't feel alone in\" (from 'My Therapy') and to feel connected to the band and to this scene. About The Note, bassist Pete Chilton says, \"We wanted to be true to what Bane has always been. We didn't want The Note to sound like anything in particular, other than Bane. We didn't sit down and think, 'Oh, we want this song to sound like Gorilla Biscuits or Youth Of Today, or where hardcore separated from punk.' We write songs that we like. It's what we think hardcore is.\"\n\n\n\nThe album's second track, \"Pot Committed\" is classic Bane and even has a piano interlude. While it doesn't brim with mosh parts, it's a clear-cut symbol of Bane doing what Bane wants to do. \"Lyrically, it's about being a band for so long, asking for a non-violent scene to play our music in, because that is something we believe in, even if kids give us shit about it on the Internet or whatever, because we don't want people getting hurt when dancing at shows,\" Chilton reveals. \"That has always been our view. We're too committed to that ethos that we can't back down now. That's what we're all about.\"\n\n\n\nChilton projects that \"My Therapy\" will be a fan favorite, especially live. The song is about how the hardcore scene keeps the people within it stay sane. Chilton says, \"This is all we know. We don't know what else to do other than this. We've been doing it so long, so this scene is what's in us now. We're a part of it. It's where we relate, it's a community, and it's where people understand us.\"\n\n\n\nWhile hardcore has never left the public eye or consciousness, the traditional hardcore genre has come and gone in waves and cycles. \"Metal-sounding hardcore is huge and is on the verge of being mainstream, with bands like Bleeding Through and Killswitch Engage and Throwdown, who came from the hardcore scene, playing metal,\" Chilton says. \"They are nearing the mainstream, where more fast paced, punk sounding hardcore was in submission, but it's growing back. We've been around so long, and we've seen the waves of styles. We never intended to be anything else. There are a lot of mid-tempo songs on the new record, and some faster ones. We're not trying to be anything.\"\n\n\n\nAfter all these years, Bane still identify with the concept of a unified hardcore scene, and the power of three surging chords. \"The Note\" can help resurrect the golden days of sweaty, hardcore matinees, with lyrics that meant something, and shows that were the highlight of a working class kid's week. Bane have stayed true to a singular sound, ignoring trends, and continuing to make the same music they started out making over a decade ago. But consistency did not give way to same-ness or predictability. In a genre that's full of soundalikes and copycats, Bane are the standouts, playing raw, surging hardcore not unlike forefathers Judge and Burn. The proverbial 'they' say that you have to evolve in order to prosper, and Bane evolves and prospers without ever changing their focus or aesthetic goal. All you need is one listen to \"The Note\" for proof of that."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bane-mn0000146477/biography", "page_content": "Biography Bane Follow Artist +\n\nFormed in Massachusetts, Bane began as a side project between Aaron Dalbec and members of Converge.

Every day since the announcement, the band inches closer to the last time they will take stage together. The set will conclude two decades of fast-paced, heartfelt and high-energy hardcore. Although the date has yet to be set, it freezes vocalist Aaron Bedard to his core. It\u2019s no longer an abstract idea but an ever-approaching reality inducing recurring, uncomfortable nightmares. Bane gifted him self-worth. They\u2019ll probably fall apart when that final show comes to fruition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Bedard and guitarist Aaron Dalbec won\u2019t stay strong until the end. Since the last record dropped, they have toured the United States, Asia and Australia. They insist that this summer will feature the most bonkers Bane set the world will ever see at the band\u2019s final This Is Hardcore Festival appearance in Philadelphia. Sure, the guys have aged since the days when Dalbec was juggling his then side-project Bane with shredding on Converge cult-favorite Jane Doe. But the members of Bane have always maintained the same mission statement.\n\nAaron Bedard\u2019s goal has always been to stay true to himself. When a member of Crippled Youth (who later became Bold) taught him about Cro-Mags, Underdog, and Youth of Today, he knew instantly what he wanted to commit his life to. While some would argue that our nation's problems are vastly different now than they were in the 1980s, many of youth crew hardcore's principles still apply. Equality, justice and a healthy lifestyle are still Bane's core values, and the band hopes to pass them onto the next generation, who'll do the same in due time.\n\nWhile Dalbec says he was always too self-conscious to approach bands as a kid, Bedard attributes much of his inspiration to his time spent hanging in parking lots with the members of Youth of Today. And while he just feels like a regular dude, he\u2019s finally starting to come to terms with stepping into the shoes of the guys he once idolized. We spoke to both of Bane\u2019s Aarons about the upcoming This Is Hardcore Festival, aging off the stage, and the mushy inner workings of supposed tough-guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s your history with This Is Hardcore?\n\nAaron Bedard: It\u2019s a big deal to us. Joe, who runs it, is a close friend of the band, and he\u2019s been supporting Bane since our earliest releases, since our earliest trips through Philly. It\u2019s the biggest fest that\u2019s basically in our backyard. We\u2019ve always been real proud to be a part of it, and for whatever reason that town just responds real strongly to Bane. We\u2019ve never had even an average set at This Is Hardcore. It\u2019s always been bonkers. It was definitely on the bucket list of things we wanted to do one last time before we break up.\n\nWhat about the lineup?\n\nBedard: The lineup is ill. This Is Hardcore never does anything but come a hundred percent with the lineup. I never thought I was going to get to see the fucking Exploited in my life.\n\nAaron Dalbec: It\u2019s all hardcore kids. No bullshit, just everyone having fun.\n\nBedard: It has this authentic grassroots feel to it, and I\u2019ve seen it grow. You step back and see that there\u2019s literally 2,000 hardcore kids packed in a room. It\u2019s a pretty amazing thing to see hardcore at that level. When that many kids from all over the globe get psyched about this one style of music, this one attitude that we hold in our hearts.\n\nSo after this fest you\u2019re out with Terror, Turnstile, and Backtrack. Is that your final tour?\n\nBedard: Nope, we\u2019ve got a little left to go. The plan when Don\u2019t Wait Up came out was to stay busy and tour for the entirety of 2015. Now it\u2019s spilling into 2016, the way it\u2019s looking is we\u2019ll do this festival, The Life and Death Tour, then go to Japan in September, then our final European tour will be November/December. I think in December we\u2019ll do our 20th anniversary party in Worcester, MA, at the Palladium. The next thing will be the final US tour, and that will be in the spring of next year. When it\u2019s gonna be the last Bane tour ever it\u2019s going to be pushed that way, you won\u2019t be confused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019ve got the 20 years coming up and you\u2019re looking to celebrate. Did you guys ever think that this would last or you\u2019d commit this long?\n\nDalbec: Not at all. When Bane started, I thought if we could do a US tour, then we\u2019ve done everything. If Bane lasted five years, in reality five years for a hardcore band is like a lifetime\u2026\n\nBedard: I\u2019d never been in a band that lasted two years, left Massachusetts or made an actual record before. I had no idea what was waiting for us. Aaron was in Converge. Bane was clearly gonna be a side project. We never would\u2019ve imagined that this could\u2019ve happened. The craziest part is that it went by so fast. It\u2019s ridiculous to even hear the number 20. I still feel giddy inside that I get to be in this band.\n\nDalbec: When you say 20 years it seems insane, because it still feels like five years ago.\n\nWhere do you think you guys would be had Bane never happened?\n\nBedard: God, that question haunts me in the dark moments man. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done, how I would\u2019ve found an outlet for all my aggression and anger and confusion and this need to be heard and understood. I was 25, pretty late in the game and feeling pretty panicked about my prospects for life. I knew I wasn\u2019t cut out for the nine-to-five. I don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve made it. I was pretty fucking angsty. I got this opportunity, and I suddenly felt like I belonged.\n\nDalbec: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doing either. I was still in Converge for the next five or six years after Bane started, but I can almost guarantee I wouldn\u2019t still be in that band even if Bane didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid you think about that when you were younger? The notion that this had an expiration date and you needed a back-up plan.\n\nDalbec: My wife and I were having this conversation, because I obviously think about what\u2019s gonna happen when Bane is done. She asked, \u201cWell, what did you want to do when you were younger?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI wanted to be in a band and tour.\u201d Now what?\n\nBedard: I had a good long stretch of panic, once I got a look at what this life is. Realizing how much I liked it, it was what I had always been waiting for. There were years that would go by that I would be so scared of what was gonna happen when it ended. Now I feel ready to deal with that question. Years ago, I did whatever I could to patch up any rips in the seams, to keep us moving and from completely crumbling.\n\nIn the past this wasn\u2019t something you were able to deal with. You\u2019ve addressed how you\u2019re getting older and facing the physicality issue now, where you feel like you may not always be able to give the crowd the level of intensity they deserve. What was it like to finally sift through those feelings and grapple with the fact that this was coming to an end?\n\nBedard: To be brutally honest, it\u2019s still a work in progress. There\u2019s still a lot of ebbs and flows to those feelings, there are times where I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck are we doing? What am I gonna do next? This is the only thing that I love!\u201d Then there are more rational times where my knees are just completely screaming at me. I feel myself getting winded more readily. This is a young man\u2019s game and I want to be able to respect that. I don\u2019t want to be embarrassing what\u2019s expected of a hardcore band when they hit the stage. When we decided that we were gonna make one more record and give it our all for one more year, that felt like as good of a compromise as I could ask. Guys in the band are having families. I needed to be understanding of that. But on my day-to-day I\u2019m not walking around head held high feeling completely great that I\u2019m leaving the thing in my life that I\u2019ve loved the most. It has given me the greatest return on my investment.\n\nDalbec: We\u2019ve made the decisions that we wanted to in order to end the band.\n\nBedard: It\u2019s literally writing our own final chapter. We\u2019re steering this ship. Nothing is happening because of outside forces. There aren\u2019t a lot of bands that get that luxury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou've expressed in the past that you didn\u2019t want to be that dude that you saw on stage that looked past his prime, shaking your head in disapproval like they should\u2019ve thrown in the towel years ago.\n\nBedard: \u201cI remember when they were good\u2026\u201d\n\nYou never want to feel insecure in your presence?\n\nBedard: Yeah. I think that speaks a lot about me and my insecurities. Maybe it\u2019s a foolish thing to be as pre-occupied with as I have been. But it never goes away, the bands that I hold in highest regard and closest to my heart just brought it live. It\u2019s always been in my head that I can feel myself losing the step, it makes me crazy, [laughs], I hate that the forces of fucking gravity get to win this fucking battle.\n\nDoes that scare you? Being a cautionary tale?\n\nDalbec: Unfortunately, I feel like if you\u2019re in a hardcore band, and you\u2019re in your late 40s or 50s, in a weird way you can\u2019t stop. You can\u2019t really go and do anything else because you\u2019ve been doing it for so long.\n\nBedard: We maybe don\u2019t need to be breaking up right now. I just don\u2019t want to pass that line. You don\u2019t see the line when you get there, you just one day watch a Youtube video. \u201cOh my fucking god, is that we look like now?\u201d I don\u2019t want to have that day.\n\nHow has your interaction with young hardcore kids changed?\n\nBedard: For me, it has changed in some strange way that I can\u2019t quite even articulate properly. There was a time when we would tour when all we wanted to do was just hang with the crowd, we would make friends with the kids. We didn\u2019t know them before the show started and afterwards we would be out getting tacos and friendships were made. That happens for us less and less these days, and I know that part of the blame falls on us. Maybe part of the blame falls on that younger kids can tell that we\u2019re older. It saddens me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t want to interact, but it\u2019s because you have been doing it for so long and reached this higher status. They don\u2019t just see you guys as the kids from Massachusetts\u2026\n\nBedard: Or we\u2019re just old guys\u2026\n\nDalbec: [laughs]\n\nBedard: When I was younger going to shows, I would feel weird going up to the old dudes who just got out of the van. You don\u2019t know how cranky they are. I completely understand that hesitance. That\u2019s a really nice way to think about it, that they\u2019re thinking \u201cWhoa those are the guys from Bane!\u201d But anytime anyone tries to come at us with that attitude we try to break right through that.\n\nHave you come to terms with the fact that you have made such an impression?\n\nDalbec: It\u2019s pretty hard to see, for me personally.\n\nBedard: I don\u2019t want to be too foolish and make it seem like we\u2019re not aware that we\u2019ve had an impact on kids. We\u2019ve done more here than we\u2019ve ever intended to. I\u2019m not gonna pretend that hasn\u2019t dawned on us. But at the same time, you don\u2019t want to get too caught up in that. We\u2019re still a band. We\u2019re still active and we\u2019re still hungry. I don\u2019t want to spend too much time weighing out the legacy of Bane or how much we\u2019ve meant on the grand scheme of things. I do believe that there will be a time where I\u2019ll be able to look back and be like, \u201cFuck man, we really did it\u2026\u201d and really assess from afar but it\u2019s hard to do it now. But yes, to be completely candid with you, I am aware that we have been very lucky that there are kids that really fucking care about our band. And it\u2019s not lost on any of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour songwriting is a way to get out aggression and send your message to the world. Are you afraid that you're going to lose that outlet to express yourself when Bane ends?\n\nBedard: I am afraid of losing that. I felt that I was pretty good at. It has challenged me mentally and made me dig inside myself creatively. I don't think I'm gonna lose that? I think it's ingrained in me and that I'm always going to have to find a way to express myself? I have this need to be heard and to create. Bane made that really easy. It just fucking dulled all those feelings that I'm never gonna matter, that I'm never gonna do anything special. It took that away. I don't know what next year is gonna look like when I have to ask myself, \"What\u2019s next? How are you gonna get your voice out there? Is it still as important to you as it used to be?\"\n\nYou said you've been learning a lot about yourself in this past year and you wouldn't have been able to without making this last record. I'm curious, what have you learned about yourself?\n\nBedard: I had real demons in my closet, real sick family stuff that I had gone through as a kid and had just buried away and never talked about. I thought that I could survive just by being strong, even though I saw that it had a very different impact on the other members of my family who went through the same thing. Outside of Bane, I don't want to say I'm a mess, but emotionally and my relationships, there's a lot of stuff that's pretty fuckin' sloppy in my life. Bane has allowed me to stay moving. When it was time to write Don't Wait Up and say the last things I was ever going to say in the band I decided I was gonna touch that stuff. Look at what I'd been through as a kid and how it had affected me. It led me down a pretty bumpy road but it also led me into getting a therapist and really being honest with myself and looking at how it has affected every area of my life and realizing, \"God damn, this has it's fucking claws in everything!\" It's been difficult, but it's been wonderful too.\n\nIn \"Final Backwards Glance\" you say, \"I've never been much good at saying goodbye.\" You haven't really wanted to talk to anyone much about legacy, but what do you really want to be remembered for?\n\nBedard: The only thing I care about is that we're hardcore kids who stayed honest and just fuckin' stayed ourselves. We never got ahead of ourselves. We never forget where we came from. We never forgot the bands that we loved and that they were the reason that we were in a band ourselves. Obviously we grew and matured, and life did what life does to us, but in our hearts, we're still kids who fucking love hardcore and that's why Bane never broke up or jumped to a major label or went through a major sound change. We just got back from touring Australia, and every time we walked into a venue there were barriers and we knew that kids weren't gonna be able to stagedive. We felt the same disappointment that we would've felt in the first six months. If there's any legacy, I'd like that to be it.\n\nBane kept it real.\n\nBedard: [laughs] Yeah, I guess I could've said it in four words."}, {"url": "https://www.deezer.com/us/track/15978383", "page_content": "Lyrics\n\nI can still see the reasons that I opened my eyes to this scene in the first place I can still feel my beliefs growing stronger everyday I can still count the ways But for you it's all over the meaning is gone and you're moving on And tearing us down with you You've shed your past, grown up fast Demanding that we all mature at your pace, but here I remain refusing to change Remembering when we were the same I support your decision, I believe in change and you find Just what it is that you are looking for?
