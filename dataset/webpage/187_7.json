The talented guard was selected by the World Champion Detroit Pistons in the second round with the 54th pick. Detroit just happens to be Paulding's home town. Paulding will also join former Missouri Associate Head Coach and current Pistons' Vice President of Basketball Operations John Hammond in the ranks of the Mizzou basketball family who have reached the NBA.\n\n\"Detroit is a great team and organization and I want to contribute in any way I can,\" Paulding said from his home in Detroit. \"It has always been a dream to play in my home town with the Pistons and be apart of their great tradition. It's a really good opportunity and I am looking forward to proving myself in the coming months.\"\n\nPaulding is the third player to be drafted to the NBA during head coach Quin Snyder's five-year tenure at Mizzou. Keyon Dooling was the 10th pick in the 2000 draft by the Orlando Magic (who then traded Dooling to the Los Angeles Clippers the same night) and Kareem Rush was the 20th pick in the 2002 draft by the Toronto Raptors (who then traded Rush to the Los Angeles Lakers on the night of the draft).\n\n\"We are very excited for Rickey and I think he has a good chance to be successful in Detroit,\" Missouri Head Coach Quin Snyder said. \"He's entering a great situation and he will be around a lot of familiar faces in his home town. Rickey needs to attack this chance to play at the next level with the same competitive fire he has shown during his time at Mizzou.\"\n\nPaulding wrapped up a tremendous career at Mizzou with a crowning achievement in May as he received his degree. He finished his basketball career as the eighth leading scorer in Mizzou history (1,673 points) and finished fifth in three point field goals made with 187. Paulding seemed to especially love NCAA Tournament time, as he finished his career as Mizzou's all-time leader in points scored in the tourney with 145 (18.1 per game) in eight games played. The two-time second team All-Big 12 selection was one of six players from Big 12 Conference schools taken in the draft."}, {"url": "https://www.rp23athletics.com/aboutus", "page_content": "OUR COACHES\n\nRickey Paulding is a former professional basketball player from Detroit, Michigan.

He spoke to germanhoops.com about the incredible career of Rickey Paulding.\n\nThanks Keith for talking to germanhoops.com. Where are you at the moment and how is basketball life treating you?\n\nHey Miles. I\u2019m currently in Pau, France right now preparing to play the second game of quarterfinals. We lost the first game at home two days ago so our back is against the wall today. Our roster has some serious injury depletion, but we\u2019ll still come out and compete hard of course.\n\nYour playing this season with Boulogne-Levallois Metropolitans (France-Betclic ELITE ProA) and have reached the playoffs. Your having another great season. How would you compare the France Pro A with the easyCredit BBL? Which league would you say is the skill level better?\n\n\n\nI would say the French league is a bit tougher. It\u2019s more physical and athletic from what I\u2019ve experienced, although the BBL might take the cake in the basketball IQ department. They\u2019re similar levels, and I do think if I\u2019d played last year in the BBL under normal circumstances with full fans and heightened emotional environments, the level of play may have been naturally higher.\n\nYour once again shooting out the lights. Did some of your incredible accuracy from last season carry over to this season?\n\nHaha I\u2019d hope so. I never go into a season with the die hard goal of shooting an incredible percentage. It\u2019s just kind of happened. I\u2019ll say this year it\u2019s more impressive , because many of my shots have been more difficult. A lot more pin downs and off the dribble threes as opposed to more catch and shoots last year in Oldenburg. I also adore the Spalding basketball the French league plays with much like the BBL.\n\nRickey Paulding is playing his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nLegend and genetic specimen! Haha Although Rickey would never like to be called a legend or anything so boast worthy becuase he\u2019s so unbelievably humble.\n\nHave you ever seen a player who has been able to play so well at a high level at his age?\n\nNo. Not even close. He turned 38 last season when I was with him and was doing things on the court that players 10-15 years younger couldn\u2019t do. That\u2019s why I call him a genetic specimen. Guys built like Rickey don\u2019t come around too often.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you met him? Was his smile and personality instantly infectious?\n\nMy first impression was that he was soft spoken and quiet. He can obviously be vocal, but I wouldn\u2019t call him an extrovert who wears his emotions on his sleeve. He\u2019s a kind soul, but on the court he has a killer instinct that\u2019s engrained deep within him. Oh and his smile. Yes, it\u2019s infectious. When Rickey laughs, it\u2019s contagious.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you saw him on the court? What was the first thing that really stuck out?\n\nMy first impression was that he has an incredible ability for making difficult shots. I suppose that comes with almost two decades of professional experience. I\u2019d be matched up with him many times in practice , and I\u2019d know exactly what he was about to do on offense, and he\u2019d still find a way to score on me. I would contest the hell out of him, and it would still go in many times. He\u2019d go down the court grinning at times, and me (in frustration) couldn\u2019t help but do the same. Guarding him made me a stronger defender. He was also so nice. If he fouled you in practice he\u2019d apologize if it seemed too rough\n\nYou played a whole season with him. Is there anything specific that you feel you were able to take from his presence on the court?\n\n\n\nIt was a successful season with him. One thing I can take away from him is the influence he can have on you during games and he wouldn\u2019t even know it. There\u2019d be times I\u2019d be dead tired during games, and I\u2019d glance at Rickey and see him still going full tilt 100%. I\u2019d be thinking \u2018if Rickey can find the energy right now , then I have no business succumbing to fatigue and being tired\u2019\n\nIn your season he had so many great games. For instance exploding for 36 points in a loss against Crailsheim or hitting Bamberg and Munich for 36 points. What game will you most remember from him?\n\n\n\nThat Crailsheim game was unreal. We ended up losing, but we may have lost by 40 if Rickey wasn\u2019t playing at god-like levels. Everything he threw up seemed to go in.\n\nWhat is your fondest moment with him on and off the court that you will never forget?\n\nHis buzzer beater in Game 2 of the playoffs last year against Ulm was great. We all ran up to him and gave him the normal \u2018buzzer beater\u2019 treatment. Rickey is one of those guys where when he does great things, you can\u2019t help but want to share the moment with him and make it even better.\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you believe will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL? Do feel that there will ever be another American that will be able to reach his longevity in that league?\n\n\n\nI think Rickey is one of a kind. A one and done. There will never be another American player like Rickey in the BBL. To have such loyalty to one club for fifteen seasons is incredible unique and I don\u2019t see that happening again. Never say never of course, but the chances are slim. Maybe we\u2019re experiencing the start of the next Rickey right now in the BBL and we just don\u2019t know it yet\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\n\n\nHe knows who the real Tiger are.

What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nA legend. He is a good friend of mine and I respect him a lot.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you met him? Was his smile and personality instantly infectious already there at Missouri in the two years where you were teammates?\n\nThe first time I met him was on the campus of Missouri when I came in as a freshman. I remember that I was very small when I came to Missouri. I was something like 180 pounds. I talked to him about the college life. I wasn\u2019t afraid, but I was weary of not being strong enough. He was very understanding and told me you will get stronger and that everything will be all right. I will never forget that.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you saw him on the court? What was the first thing that really stuck out?\n\nHow he competed and what it took to win. He was the best offensive player, but also the best defensive player on the team. He always guarded the other teams best player. That really opened my eyes. He was an incredible athlete and was always number one in the sprints. But even more he was a great person that took me under his wing.\n\nYou played two seasons with him at the University of Missouri from 2002-2004. What was your fondest moment on the court with him?\n\nIt was my freshman year when we played Marquette and Dwayne Wade. He had something like 36 points. He only had something like one mistake in the game. I remember the game was on the line and I was open, but opted to take the last shot and missed. The game went into overtime. This is one of those games that I will never forget.

He had a God\u2019s gift and he wanted Rickey to be the kind of player that he would be.\n\nDo you think your record against him in the BBL was above or below 500?\n\n\n\nIt is below 500.\n\nThat is correct.Your record against Jimmy was 6-11 not including cup games. What was it like playing against your ex teammate and friend?\n\nIt was always tough playing against him. He was the focal point and they always had a good team around him. It was bitter sweet. On one hand I was playing against a friend, but at the same time, I wanted to win. But I was always happy to see him do great things. But I always wanted to beat him.\n\nWas there a specific game that you will never forget?\n\n\n\nThe first time we played against each other in Frankfurt.\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you believe will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL? Do feel that there will ever be another American that will be able to reach his longevity in that league?\n\nI don\u2019t think it will ever happen again. It is like if someone would beat Steph Curry\u2019s 3 point shooting records. I think that if someone could do it then Quantez Robertson. I don\u2019t know if he can. He is close though.

I want to thank him for taking a kid from St Louis and taking him under his wing and showing me the ropes.

Upside: He's a very athletic slasher who uses his athleticism to elevate over his opponents. His vertical leap is off the charts. Has a nice mid-range jumper. A good ball handler. Good lateral quickness should allow him to be a decent defender in the pros. Has a good body. Downside: Consistency and that outside shot. Paulding took a 158 threes this season, but made just 34 percent. Last year he was much more effective from downtown. This year he was just streaky. Made four or more threes five times during the season. Missed four or more threes eleven times. Insider Projection: The biggest problem was consistency. The Tigers never knew who was going to show up. Paulding was huge in several big games this year including a 31 point performance (shooting 5-fot-7 from three) against Oklahoma State. But he also had a number of nine point stinkers against Kansas, Kansas State and Texas A&M. Scouts feel that his game is a better fit in the NBA than it was in college. However, he didn't stand out at all at the Chicago pre-draft camp. The fact that he measured at just 6-foot-4 also didn't help things. Will he even be drafted?\n\n\n\n"}]}
