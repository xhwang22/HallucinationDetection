Steve had everything that Rod was looking for, something different and not doing the standard 4/4 time signature. Rod and Steve eventually formed Dixie Dregs. We also talked about how the band had a rough time getting signed, being turned down, how their music was difficult to market because they were a jazz fusion band with no vocals, odd timing, and that their music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and classical influences. The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983. The band has been nominated six times for a Grammy award.\n\nDregs Success and Breakup\n\nIn Part Two, we discuss the ongoing success of the Dixie Dregs, Rod\u2019s career highlights with the band, and funny moments. After the Dregs disbanded in 1983, Rod joined Steve Morse\u2019s new band and stayed for two albums before wanting a musical change. Rod tells us how he came back to the NYC area to look for work and his auditions for George Michael, Billy Idol, Joe Lynn Turner, and others. He talks about being a professor, teaching percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.

Rod is a professor, teaching percussion at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Massachusetts. Recently offering, Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum-set playing. He is also a columnist for Modern Drummer magazine.\n\nThe beginning of the Dregs started in 1973, when he attended the University of Miami in Florida. There he met Steve Morse, Andy West, and Allen Sloan, playing under the official Studio Music and curriculum title of, Rock Ensemble II. At the university, The Dregs recorded their first album in 1975, The Great Spectacular, as a class project.\n\nThe Dregs had a rough time getting signed and were turned down and told their music was difficult to market because they were a jazz fusion band had no vocals, odd timing, and that their music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and classical influences. The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983. Rod then joined Steve Morse\u2019s new band and stayed for two albums before wanting a musical change to try something both new and challenging. The Dregs last reunion was a tour in 2018.\n\nWinger and Other Projects\n\nRod moved back to New York City and began auditioning for jobs, one of them turned out to be a band that Kip Winger was forming. Two months later, Rod received a call from the band, and they were off to record their self-titled, debut album, Winger, in 1988. It went double platinum. Winger followed up in 1990 with In the Heart of the Young. In 1993, they released the album, Pull, as grunge came in and changed the music scene. The band decided to take a break, but got back together in 2002, and have had sporadic reunions since, and continue to do so as time permits. Winger will be releasing a new album in 2021.\n\nRod\u2019s other projects include the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire, Jordan Rudess, with two albums to their credit. Rod is is involved with jam band, Jazz Is Dead, which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Another project is, Platypus, whose two recordings feature: John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X), and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor, and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, \u20182\u2019 was released in 2004.\n\nInterview with Rod Morgenstein (Part 1)"}, {"url": "http://www.rodmorgenstein.com/product.html", "page_content": "Other Products and Cool Stuff CD Releases on Dregs Records For the first time since its limited release on vinyl in 1975, the Dixie Dregs Great Spectactular album is now available on CD.

Being a drummer who suffers from hearing damage (\"This could never happen to ME\"), Rod developed the dB22 and SIH1 Isolation Headphones with the Vic Firth Co. These comfortable full ear-cup phones reduce ambient sound (surrounding noise levels) significantly, allowing for hours of hassle-free jamming. As an added plus, the headphones give the drums a deep, rich, crisp tone. The dB22 is strictly a hearing protector while the SIH1 is a high-quality stereo headset, perfectly suited for studio recording or playing along with your favorite tunes on your stereo or walkman. The difference between the SIH1 and a standard, conventional headset is that you no longer need to blast the music (risking serious damage to your hearing) in order to compete with the sheer volume of your drums. The isolation properties of the SIH1 headphones allow you to hear the music at a pleasant, comfortable volume while playing your drums as dynamically LOUD (or soft) as you desire. In a recording environment, the SIH1 headphones are also a life-saver for engineers, in that they eliminate annoying bleed-thru problems which occur when using a standard, conventional headset. Quite often, the high volume of sound coming from a conventional headset is picked up by virtually every mic in the kit, thus defeating the whole purpose of individually miking each drum for total isolation and control. Kidphones (KIDP) are non-electronic headphones specially sized for children and reduce overall noise levels by 22 decibels From the start, caring for kids' hearing is important! At present, Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, Kenny Aronoff and a host of others are using the Vic Firth SIH1 isolation headphones. Just remember - hearing loss is PERMANENT. Be kind to your ears!

Check them out on Winger's Pull, Dixie Dregs Bring 'Em Back Alive and Full Circle, Kip Winger's This Conversation Seems Like A Dream and the recently released Rudess-Morgenstein Project. And hear why drummers like Doane Perry (Jethro Tull) and Nicko McBrain (Iron Maiden) are pounding on these versatile drum heads. For further information contact: Premier Percussion at www.premier-drums.com Rod Morgenstein Signature Drum Sticks\n\n----Vic Firth Inc. This versatile stick was designed for switching back and forth between jazz, fusion and rock formats. The overall size is a cross between a standard 5B and 2B, with a length of 16 1/8\" and a thickness of .610\". The tip achieves maximum cymbal definition and response, while the shoulder is full for high impact playing.

Great stuff all around. Rod gets 5 stars ! - Keyboard Magazine\n\nPower Rock is fabulous; not only are the riffs and fills inspirational, it's fun just listening to the sequences. - Craig Anderton, EQ Magazine 1997 Buyer's Guide\n\nProgressive Rock - Some of his lightning blasts in this progressive rock section might make your module smoke. Tom and bass driven monsters (check out Locoline ) , odd time signatures and arm-twisting polyrhythms abound. Rod gets 5 stars! - Keyboard Magazine\n\nProgressive Rock - These are midi drums for the adventurous. -\n\nCraig Anderton, EQ Magazine These are real-time midi drum performances played by Rod in complete song form. Each of the two disks, Power Rock and Progressive Rock contain 20 complete songs, each with intros, verses, choruses, bridges, solo sections and endings. Songs can be used in their entirety or cut and pasted to your heart's content. Since this is midi information, the user has unlimited options for tailoring the drum and cymbal sounds to suit his or her personal and musical taste and needs. The range of grooves and feels on each disk is diverse, giving the songwriter/midi user well in excess of one hour of real time drumming by a real, live drummer.

The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004.\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years.\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d"}], "Rod Morgenstein has also performed and recorded with Steve Morse Band, Jordan Rudess, and many other artists.": [{"url": "https://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Rod_Morgenstein.html", "page_content": "Rod\u2019s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan.

It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\n\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\n\n\nAnd so, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band\n\n\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. And offshoot of Platypus is Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their first release is due out in 2001.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Premier Percussion (Rod Morgenstein Signature Drumheads), Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been and endorser for many, many years.\n\n\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.innerviews.org/inner/steve-morse", "page_content": "Steve Morse\n\nSpirit Core\n\nby Anil Prasad\n\n\n\nPhoto: DiMarzio\n\nSteve Morse is one of very few guitarists who have an instantly identifiable sound. His singular approach involves alternate picked arpeggios, creative harmonics and highly-complex chord structures. The combination of that and his prolific and inventive compositions have yielded a storied and diverse 45-year career.\n\nWhile Morse is capable of going virtually anywhere on his instrument, he\u2019s also focused on serving the music. It\u2019s why he\u2019s Deep Purple\u2019s longest-serving guitarist. He joined in 1994 and remains a core fixture of the group, which just released Whoosh!, Morse\u2019s seventh album with the band and its twenty-first, overall.\n\nMorse began his professional life as a musician with The Dixie Dregs, the revered jazz-rock group that first formed in 1975 in Miami, Florida. Its 10 releases across its intermittent existence remain among the genre\u2019s strongest recordings. In 2018, the group reunited its 1977 lineup featuring Morse, Steve Davidowski, Rod Morgenstein, Allen Sloan, and Andy West for an American tour.\n\nThe Steve Morse Band, a jazz-rock power trio, has also existed in parallel with The Dixie Dregs and Deep Purple. It formed in 1983 with Jerry Peek and Rod Morgenstein, and later included Dave LaRue and Van Romaine. As with The Dixie Dregs, its eight releases are infused with myriad influences, including classical, folk and Americana.\n\nFlying Colors is another band Morse currently records and performs with. Also featuring Dave LaRue, Neal Morse, Casey McPherson, and Mike Portnoy, the group has put out three albums of intelligent songcraft infused with complex, yet melodically-focused arrangements and playing. In addition, it has three live recordings to its credit, including its new Third Stage: Live in London release.\n\nOther significant bands Morse has been a part of include Kansas and Living Loud. Between 1985-1989, Morse participated in the former, recording two albums, 1986\u2019s Power and 1988\u2019s In the Spirit of Things. Morse was a core contributor to Kansas\u2019 output, arrangements and performances during this period, with In the Spirit of Things regarded as a late-period highlight.\n\nLiving Loud is the brainchild of Ozzy Osbourne classic rhythm section Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake. Together with Morse and Jimmy Barnes, the quartet came together from 2003-2005 to reinterpret Osbourne tracks Daisley and Kerslake had co-written for Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. The band was partly motivated by Osbourne replacing their contributions on the original albums after the two sued him for missing royalty payments. The group recorded a self-titled debut and live album, both combining Osbourne covers with new hard rock material.\n\nInnerviews spoke to Morse on the phone from his home Ocala, Florida, where like every musician during this challenging period, he was contemplating life in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHow has the COVID-19 situation affected you?\n\nWell, every day is a surprise, with this whole COVID-19 restructuring of the music business, not to mention the state of the country and the world. Every day you\u2019re waking up to something new.\n\nOne thing it\u2019s been good for is forcing a different reality on me. That's one thing I tell people to do\u2014get out of a rut, musically, by forcing yourself into different limitations. For instance, if you\u2019re used to playing in box patterns on guitar, in which you\u2019re doing shapes with your left hand, maybe try playing a melody using only three strings\u2014or even two strings. That forces you to go up and down the neck. And if you\u2019re used to playing electric guitar, try playing more acoustic guitar to come up with different ideas and approaches.\n\nOne of my new limitations is suddenly having no gigs and no way to make gigs happen, except for making iPhone videos and sharing them. It\u2019s given me a different perspective. Suddenly, I can say \u201cLet\u2019s go hang out with the whole family on Friday,\u201d because I\u2019m going to be there for a change. Instead of being away on tour all the time, recovering from a tour, or planning for the next tour, now there\u2019s time to catch up on things. In that sense, the situation is good. In another sense, it\u2019s been kind of funny. Because people know I\u2019m home, I get lots of requests to do stuff, including things for friends and family.\n\nElaborate on what you mean by the restructuring of the music business.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if people are going to go to gigs in the same numbers when this is over. There was already a delicate balance between expenses and ticket sales before. People might have looked at a musician and said \u201cThat guy\u2019s successful for sure,\u201d when in reality they were on the borderline of whether or not to tour at all, because they couldn\u2019t make the numbers add up. In my case, by the time I pay everybody, get the plane tickets, hotels, equipment, and commissions, there may not be much left. I think a lot less people will be touring after COVID-19. I also think people that do tour will do gigs that are more community-based. They\u2019ll play where they can drive their own vehicle to the gig. Maybe they\u2019ll carry a smaller rig and do solo stuff.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to look like, especially when we also know a certain percentage of people will be scared to go to a crowded theater, even when this is over. And when concerts are happening again, I think the ticket-buying population is also going to be very price-conscious in terms of how much they\u2019re willing to pay.\n\nThe other part of this is thinking about all the people that don\u2019t get covered by all those government plans that involve printing money. A self-employed person with no employees doesn\u2019t qualify for any of that small business stuff.\n\nDeep Purple, 2020: Steve Morse, Don Airey, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, and Ian Paice | Photo: Ben Wolf\n\nDeep Purple had plans for a lot of 2020 touring for the new Whoosh! album. How is the band recalibrating?\n\nWell, 2020\u2019s gone. It\u2019s like it never happened. What was supposed to happen in 2020 looks like it\u2019s being rebooked for 2021. We\u2019re going to do a full tour, eventually. After decades of touring, the promoters know us. But after a year-and-a-half of nothing, there are going to be fewer opportunities to play for a while. But musicians are very adaptable. In general, people are very adaptable. Look at all these people finding ways to work from home. It\u2019s awesome if you have a job as a lawyer or you\u2019re with some agency in which you can adjust to working with just a computer and phone.\n\nWith Flying Colors, we did a little subscription webinar showing us getting together and doing a writing session online. Necessity is the mother of invention. But I don\u2019t see how anyone\u2014unless they\u2019re computer and marketing geniuses\u2014could come up with a way to make a living doing this. Yet, there are people doing that. I guess the situation is weeding out folks like me who aren\u2019t versatile in that way. I don\u2019t sing. I don\u2019t do cameos like Ron Bumblefoot or Steve Lukather, who are great singers as well.\n\nAll in all, it is what it is. Everybody across the board is affected. I worry the most about people who are on the edge of making it\u2014people who don\u2019t know if they can pay their bills and mortgages. They\u2019re feeling a huge amount of stress right now. They already had as much as they could deal with before, and now it\u2019s worse than ever. I feel terrible for all of them. But this is the reality we all face\u2014musicians and everyone else. As a musician, my livelihood is so dependent on the road. And music listeners lose the communal experience of attending those gigs.\n\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on how Whoosh! builds on Deep Purple's previous two albums Infinite and Now What?!\n\nIt\u2019s more of a fun album. Bob Ezrin, to his great credit, addressed the band at the beginning and said \u201cYou guys know the drill. No-one\u2019s going to play this on the radio. It\u2019s never going to be a top hit. Let\u2019s just make a record we like and that the people who follow the band will like.\u201d Of course, he\u2019s preaching to the choir. I haven\u2019t made career decisions with the idea that \u201cOh, people will love this. This will be a mass hit.\u201d My career has always been kind of the opposite. In my case it\u2019s more \u201cThat sounds too much like an obvious thing. Let\u2019s not do that.\u201d Purple naturally does stuff that has some point its fans can relate to.\n\nWhoosh! Is a lot like the last album Infinite in that it\u2019s a collection of tunes with a wide variety of styles. It\u2019s got a generally upbeat attitude. We even did a new version of one of the very first things Purple ever recorded back in the \u201860s called \"And the Address.\u201d It\u2019s something people would say to each other after somebody made a certain kind of bodily function noise. [laughs] It\u2019s an obscure British joke. So, we re-did the tune with fairly authentic sounds. It\u2019s a little piece of history and I thought it was fitting to do.\n\nDeep Purple, 2014 | Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, and Steve Morse | Photo: Ear Music\n\nBetween 2017-2019, Deep Purple was engaged in The Long Goodbye Tour. Is Whoosh! likely to be the final studio album?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bet on these guys dying before the age of 150, the way they\u2019re going. [laughs] So, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I used to know. I thought Infinite was the last album. I want to be part of the very last Deep Purple album and tour, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to live long enough. [laughs] We\u2019ll see.\n\nI think the guys went and got some health tune-ups or some kind of vitamins. I don\u2019t know what they did, but they want to keep going. I love the band. I\u2019ve always stayed busy with things like Flying Colors and we did a Dregs reunion tour a couple of years ago. I\u2019m always writing bits for something or other. It\u2019s usually not me that says \u201cYou know what? We need to do this whole Deep Purple cycle of writing, recording and touring again.\u201d But here we are. The band\u2019s gung ho on going forward. And I can tell you, after months and months of not playing live, and knowing there won\u2019t be any gigs for a long time, I sure do miss it.\n\nThis is the third album in a row Bob Ezrin has produced for Deep Purple. You also worked with him on Kansas\u2019 In the Spirit of Things in 1988. What does he bring to the table that serves the band so effectively?\n\nHe\u2019s like the designated chairman of the board when it comes to discussions. He throws in his opinion, but it carries a little bit more weight because he\u2019s done so many great albums. He\u2019s also one of the smartest guys you\u2019ll ever meet in terms of memorizing the complicated details of a tune and what you played within it. He can hear all kinds of possibilities in his head. He\u2019s always willing to jump in there and help you if you can\u2019t come up with an idea you like. But in general, we write on our own and then he comes in and says \u201cHere\u2019s what I like. Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t like.\u201d That\u2019s been helpful to us, because it helps improve the arrangements.\n\nBehind the scenes, when the rest of the band isn\u2019t there, Bob seems to really get a lot out of Ian Gillan. One story I love is when Ian and Roger Glover were talking about lyrics and melodies amongst themselves in the rehearsal room, a voice from across the room, 50 feet away, would go \u201cI\u2019m not liking this.\u201d [laughs] Bob would be looking at his iPad or laptop and typing and look up and tell you what he thinks with that big city, no-nonsense voice he has. But it\u2019s serious enough to definitely make them stop and rethink what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s also simply frank and inoffensive when he does that. He\u2019ll do that to me too when I\u2019m trying to do a line, melody or solo. If it\u2019s too complicated, he\u2019ll say something like \u201cMorse, save it for your solo album. Give me something solid.\u201d [laughs] He\u2019s sort of like the drill sergeant you love.\n\nAs for how he\u2019s changed across the three albums, I think he knows what I\u2019m going to do before I do it now. And he wants me to play more like David Gilmour would and less like I would. In other words, he wants something spectacularly melodic and simple. That\u2019s a huge challenge. What ends up happening is I do what I do and to some extent, I do bend to his wishes. He\u2019ll take out a couple or even several solos. He\u2019ll cut out pieces he thinks sound closer to what he\u2019s envisioning. So lately, I end up with solos that are more clean and simple.\n\nIt\u2019s a trust thing. I have to trust that his decisions make the song better. In a band in which everybody\u2019s throwing in ideas\u2014and I throw in a lot of ideas\u2014you can\u2019t be right most of the time. People will have their views. It\u2019s more comfortable for me to just play in my style and relax. That\u2019s what I do. But in a band, you have to take the support role most of the time. Everything I do is based around what\u2019s going to fit the song in the eyes of the producer.\n\nSteve Morse performs with Jon Lord during the 1996 Purpendicular tour | Photo: BMG\n\nYou\u2019re Deep Purple\u2019s longest-serving guitarist. What contributes to making things work so well?\n\nWe have the luxury of good chemistry and that may be luck or it\u2019s just the nature of the other guys. They were all pulled from other groups when they joined the band because they were great musicians. Roger and Ian Gillan were roommates and had a band before Deep Purple. They sort of came as a pair. Ian Paice has always been in every version of the band. Jon Lord was there from the very beginning, too. Don Airey and Jon have some eerie similarities. They both have incredible ears and love to mix styles of music, including classical with rock.\n\nI keep talking about Jon as if he\u2019s still here. Both Don and Jon can improvise like jazz players, which I love. That\u2019s been an important element in keeping things interesting\u2014having such complex possibilities with keyboards. Ian puts that swing in his playing that fits perfectly with rock. I love having those little bits of swing, all the time. It makes everything so comfortable to play.\n\nThe guys love to have a good time. They consciously try to avoid strife. They rely on their British behavioral traditions. None of it is written or spoken out loud. It\u2019s just the way it is. There are traditional ways the band addresses and prepares for things. For instance, when we\u2019re leaving the hotel to go for a flight, even though the flight won\u2019t leave without one of us, if you\u2019re even five minutes late, it\u2019s a huge deal. If you\u2019re on time\u2014exactly on time\u2014you\u2019ll find everybody in cars, sitting and waiting for you. That\u2019s why I came up with my famous phrase \u201cIn Purple, if you\u2019re on time, you\u2019re late.\u201d [laughs]\n\nSo, we have traditions in the band. But everybody respects each other greatly. If you do anything that seems like you\u2019re not respecting the other guys, that causes a breakdown in the mood, which is always a bad thing. And it should be remedied as quickly as possible, but it\u2019s very rare for it to happen.\n\nThe secret to this lineup\u2019s longevity is that it\u2019s comfortable to play with, but challenging. They love to give you room to do your own thing, but they rely on you to have respect for the band and its history, and to edit what you do to an appropriate length, so you\u2019re not overdoing your personal thing too much. And as human beings, they generally like to keep a light mood. A half-hour before every gig, there\u2019s always a little section of conversation that shifts to soccer scores and jokes.\n\nPhoto: Bob Mussell\n\nHow do you look back at your first album with Deep Purple, 1996\u2019s Purpendicular?\n\nI like it a lot. In fact, it\u2019s my favorite Purple album. It was groundbreaking in every way. When we were making it, I was just kind of tuning up one day, playing this little harmonic idea and noodling around, with the amp off. Roger heard it and then Jon heard him talking about it. He joined in and I started playing through the amp. By the end of the day, we had recorded \u201cSometimes I Feel Like Screaming.\" Those kind of organic moments aren\u2019t planned.\n\nRoger\u2019s the guy I talk to the most. He has a real sort of innocence and genuine interest in the idea of \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to get.\u201d You can hear that in the songs \u201cA Touch Away\u201d and \u201cThe Aviator\u201d as well, which are fantastic and I love. Of course, the band\u2019s hardcore fans wanted to kill me, because they were doing stuff that was outside of the normal wheelhouse of Deep Purple.\n\nBut to me, personally, I thought the album was really cool. I was envisioning how Jimmy Page would play steel guitar or acoustic. You\u2019d also hear mandolins in some of Led Zeppelin\u2019s tunes. I thought Deep Purple\u2019s scope should be broader. So, Purpendicular was an experiment that went \u201cLet\u2019s try anything that sounds good and see where we end up.\u201d For all those reasons, I love Purpendicular.\n\nYou\u2019ve been dealing with osteoarthritis in your right wrist. How are you doing these days?\n\nI\u2019m genetically predisposed to having osteoarthritis. For the last 50 years, I\u2019ve been playing with a technique in which I bend my wrist on two different axes, as I twist it, in order to keep the heel of my right hand against the strings so I can create an open space in which every string is muted, except the string I\u2019m playing on. I use two fingers and a thumb, and an arched hand position. It worked great for string skipping, single-note arpeggios and lots of things. It also really improved my accuracy and gave me a different style of playing than most people.\n\nHowever, playing 10,000 notes a day for 50 years apparently wears out the cartilage between the bones. It destroys the ends of the bones and you get painful inflammation and lose mobility.\n\nI\u2019m developing a strong technique that involves basically not using my wrist anymore. I\u2019m using my arm as one unit for most of my practice, picking from the elbow and changing my grip. There are three different grips I have to use to keep from cramping up or losing strength. I also have a lot of different picks, including experimental picks like bent ones, formed ones, and others in which I put a piece of foam on. I also pick with my fingers sometimes. And for fast picking, I still use alternate picking, but I\u2019m picking more from the elbow, not the wrist. All of these are tools to get through the day, but the osteoarthritis is definitely talking to me.\n\nMy left hand is still doing pretty good, but when I play gigs, I use a lot of topical painkiller and technology. I\u2019ve even changed my diet drastically. I\u2019m also looking at getting stem cell therapy. I looked into surgery but didn\u2019t like the alternatives I was offered. So, it\u2019s about trying different things and adapting my techniques.\n\nI still practice every day and always have, so that when I have to do something challenging, I\u2019ll have a better chance of doing it.\n\nIs the COVID-19 break from touring helping your wrist at all?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem any different. Practicing and getting ready for a tour is just as stressful as doing the tour. It\u2019s not getting any better by not playing gigs. So, I feel like I do need to play these shows while I can, because arthritis is an advancing disease.\n\nIs the possibility you\u2019ll have to stop performing live in the coming years something weighing heavily on you?\n\nYeah. I take playing live pretty seriously. People go to a lot of trouble to come to a show and pay a lot of money. When they\u2019re in front of me, I know what they\u2019ve gone through to be there. I don\u2019t ever want to be in the position of having someone in the audience say \u201cI should have stayed at home.\u201d That\u2019s not where I want to be. I think it\u2019s going to feel bad when I stop, but better to quit while you\u2019re ahead. The doctors told me \u201cYou\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nReflect on the 2018 Dawn of the Dregs reunion tour.\n\nThat tour was my biggest challenge. I wrote almost all of that music when I was in my twenties. Things were just so easy then, but there were still parts of the Dregs set that were hard to play even when I was 20. Now, imagine, with everything going on with me, trying to get ready for that. It was the biggest setup I\u2019ve ever done in terms of trying to get parts mastered that I hadn\u2019t been playing constantly for a long time. Mounting that challenge was huge, but I really, really wanted to do it, because we had the rare opportunity of having an entire early version of the band that we started our recording careers with together. Being able to do a tour with every single person from Free Fall was amazing.\n\nDixie Dregs, 2018: Steve Davidowski, Steve Morse, Andy West, Rod Morgenstein, and Allen Sloan | Photo: Dixie Dregs\n\nHow did you choose the set list for the tour?\n\nWe had everyone from Free Fall, so we picked a lot of stuff from that album. There were some songs from What If, even though Steve Davidowski wasn\u2019t on that album. We also did stuff from Night of the Living Dregs that we had in our repertoire or were working on when Steve was with us the first time around. We were mainly choosing from that music. I also wanted to do the song \u201cDay 444\u201d from Unsung Heroes, which we had never played live before. It was a studio production. We took that on as a big challenge and I\u2019m really glad we did.\n\nWhat do you experience as part of the Dregs that you can't with any other band?\n\nIt\u2019s the comfortable history we have. Andy West and I had a connection going back to high school. We were working on music back then. There\u2019s also the shared humor of the band and not fitting in with the music business, but trying to make a living anyway.\n\nRod Morgenstein is also the nicest guy you\u2019d ever want to meet, as well as being one of the most talented musicians. He has effortless talent. You don\u2019t even have to talk when you\u2019re making music with him. He just knows what to play and what will fit, and he can do it differently from anyone else. It\u2019s just wonderful to be around him. Allen Sloan really loves his parts and is really committed to learning every nuance about every melody. Steve Davidowski also impressed me with his effort and the results he got playing live. By the time we did the Dawn of the Dregs tour, Steve was 75 years-old, carrying this heavy keyboard up and down flights of stairs between the stage and dressing room, so he could warm up between sound check and the gig. He wouldn\u2019t let anyone else carry it for him. He played so well, as did everybody.\n\nDixie Dregs, 1981: Steve Morse, Mark O'Connor, Rod Morgenstein, Andy West, and T Lavitz | Photo: Arista Records\n\nDo the Dregs have a future beyond the last tour?\n\nI thought it was a great reunion and I was very happy with it. I don\u2019t know how easy it would be to top it, other than to play bigger gigs. The tour checked all the boxes for me, except for maybe having all the other existing members of the other versions of the Dregs there. It would have been nice to have had Jerry Goodman, Dave LaRue, Jordan Rudess, and Mark O\u2019Connor with us. Mark sat in with us during one gig on the last tour. Jimmy Herring did as well. I like the sort of community jamming approach the Dregs have always been open to, as well.\n\nIn terms of future shows, I don\u2019t know right now. It\u2019s something you have to plan long in advance. Right now, there\u2019s such a logjam with COVID-19. Whenever we get through this, it\u2019s going to be like people in a line trying to get past a wreck or road construction. When they finally get past it, they\u2019re all going to put their foot on the gas harder than ever to try and make up for lost time.\n\nWhat\u2019s the status of the Steve Morse Band?\n\nI don\u2019t know, because I\u2019ve sort of lost the impetus to do it. I have so many other outlets for writing now, in which I can have more instruments. With the other projects I do, I can have strings, horns and virtual instruments. With Flying Colors, we have lots of other writers. Same with Purple. It\u2019s a different world for me now. I love playing and working out stuff with Dave LaRue, so I think that\u2019s the way through which anything would happen. It would be us organically getting together, having fun and rekindling things.\n\nI have a great amount of respect for the guys in the band. I really wanted to write to their strengths and that was the main focus in putting those albums together. I think we had a really good touring trio with both versions of the band. They\u2019re wonderful people, so talented and easy to deal with. But life is moving along. Looking back, I do think \u201cMy God, what a lucky find being able to play with Jerry Peek, Rod Morgenstein, Dave LaRue, and Van Romaine. These guys also do a lot on their own. The band was a really wonderful setup and I remember it all fondly.\n\nFlying Colors: Neal Morse, Steve Morse, Casey McPherson, Mike Portnoy, and Dave LaRue | Photo: Music Theories\n\nFlying Colors has proven to be a project with legs for you. Describe how it fits into your current framework.\n\nBefore Flying Colors, I had done a little bit of cooperative writing in the past, especially with Kansas. With Flying Colors, I\u2019ve had to do the most hustling with my writing ever because Casey McPherson and Neal Morse are so quick with their ideas. Their speed of writing is hard to keep up with. They go 100 miles an hour and it\u2019s a really different environment for me in a good way. I like those kinds of challenges. It\u2019s a similar thing with Purple, but that\u2019s less frantic than Flying Colors. Everything we do with Flying Colors is always under the gun, time-wise, because it\u2019s a part-time thing for everybody.\n\nPeter Collins produced the first Flying Colors album. I understand that was a really positive working relationship for you. Tell me about it.\n\nFirst of all, he likes guitar. It was great to see him smiling when we did something guitar-based that was instrumental and not necessarily just support for the vocals. He really loved hearing motifs and melodies on guitar. When I tried things like harmonizing or playing baritone guitar, he was always up for it. He was a very pleasant guy to be around and his smile was an indicator of how things were going. The happier he got, the better you were doing.\n\nI think Peter also helped slow the band down, take stock of things and put some pauses in strategic places, too. I would have loved to have him mix the album, but it didn\u2019t exactly work out. For me, it was all positive with him. I never had a moment with Peter in which I thought \u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d I always thought \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s here.\u201d He had such exuberance for the music and positive energy. He celebrated each good thing we came up with.\n\nI\u2019d like to name some albums from across your career that you contributed to and have you tell me the first thing that comes to mind. Let\u2019s start with The Dixie Dregs\u2019 Great Spectacular (1976).\n\nThe preparation for that album is the part I liked best. We were together as an ensemble and playing\u2014usually for free\u2014somewhere on campus at the University of Miami or around the city of Miami. The recording itself was stark and unpolished. We had to record it in one night after a long day of school and classes. It was done late at night. We were 19-20 years-old. It wasn\u2019t really a studio. They just put the recording equipment in a live concert hall. We were set up in there with headphones. My amp was in an elevator shaft. The violin, Fender Rhodes and bass went direct. The drums were on stage. It was bizarre. We had to trudge upstairs to the very back where the projectionist would be in the movie theater and do the mix there. So, there was nothing great about the sound. But the preparation was the magic. The songs were in a good place because we had come together as a band.\n\nDregs\u2019 Unsung Heroes (1981).\n\nUnsung Heroes is the peak of me getting the most out of the band\u2014certainly as a producer. I got a chance to try out all the stuff I learned from Ken Scott on previous albums. So, a lot of work and attention to detail happened. It was a very satisfying project for me.\n\nThe Introduction photo shoot, 1984 | Photo: Mark Tucker\n\nSteve Morse Band\u2019s The Introduction (1984).\n\nThat was me trying to crawl back into the music business with a touring band. Thank God Rod agreed to do it, as well as Jerry Peek from a band called 3PM. He was the P in 3PM. So, we had three guys all willing to set a time to rehearse and play gigs to get ready for the recording session. The Morris brothers down in Tampa let us use Morrisound Studios very, very affordably. They bent over backwards and gave me a great deal. It cost us very little to make the record, but it took time. It was aptly named. \u201cHere\u2019s my band. Now, this is what I\u2019m doing. This is the introduction.\u201d\n\nTriumph\u2019s Surveillance (1987).\n\nBeing invited to be on a couple of tracks on that album out of the clear blue was a really big honor. I think it was all Rik Emmett\u2019s doing. He invited me to do an event called Night of a Thousand Guitars in Toronto, with players from all over Canada and some from the US there.\n\nI love Rik. He\u2019s so full of talent and positive energy. There are people who can organize festivals, group get togethers and parties, and are just natural entertainers. He\u2019s one of those people. I\u2019m obviously not. I\u2019m not a natural entertainer. I\u2019m more of a writer that plays gigs.\n\nI really enjoyed working with Rik. We also played a duet version of the Dregs\u2019 \u201cUp in the Air\u201d live on a Canadian TV show during one of my trips to Toronto. He learned the parts and it was \u201cHere we go. Everybody\u2019s watching. No second takes.\u201d He did an excellent job.\n\nKansas\u2019 In the Spirit of Things (1988).\n\nI thought there was some good stuff on that album. \u201cBells of Saint James\u201d is on it, which is one of my favorite Kansas tunes. Some of the moody stuff I didn\u2019t quite relate to as much, but I liked the upbeat stuff. I loved having Bob Ezrin there. He\u2019s always such a challenge, in a good way, because he doesn\u2019t accept the status quo. He pushes me and we joke around with a lot of dry humor. Writing-wise, that album didn\u2019t happen as easily as Power, but because Bob was there, I think it turned into a good product.\n\nDixie Dregs, 1992: Rod Morgenstein, Dave LaRue, Steve Morse, T Lavitz, and Jerry Goodman | Photo: Allan Youngblood\n\nDixie Dregs\u2019 Bring 'Em Back Alive (1992).\n\nWe recorded that in Atlanta at two shows. It was a lot of work, but I enjoyed making it very much, including mixing it. My favorite memory of that is my son being at crawling age. We had moved to Florida and were in a new house. The studio wasn\u2019t built yet. The studio was in the airplane hangar and I was mixing in the garage. I\u2019d set up my machines and a whole mixing area in the garage.\n\nMy son was with me when making it and I loved that. He was a very bright and inquisitive toddler. He loved watching the lights on the tape machine and how flipping a switch would make them change from green to red. Once, while I was setting up a bounce to put a reverb effect on something, he reached the tape recorder and put it into record, and it changed lights. He did it with precision\u2014all eight tracks. So, when I went to do the bounce, instead of bouncing to track one, whatever I was doing went to all the bottom tracks, including some of the drums, which got erased for a few seconds. I stopped the machine as soon as I heard something was wrong, but a chunk of the drums were taken out when that happened.\n\nSo, of course, I can\u2019t be mad at my little boy. I gave him something else to do. I showed him how to put wire ties on a guitar stand. That was his task. He covered the guitar stand with them. But it took me hours with a two-track machine to find a suitable replacement for those few seconds of missing drums and fly them in, and sync them up by trial and error. So, somewhere on that album, the drums are gone and flown in using some early digital editing technology.\n\nMichael Manring's Thonk (1994).\n\nIt was a surprise to be invited to do that because Michael was from another part of the music business that was more celebrated and welcomed by the media. I was surprised he wanted to have a weird guy like me put his music into a different place. But musicians are very flexible and adaptable. He turned out to be wonderful to work with and very inspiring to be around. I have nothing but good things to say about him.\n\nLiving Loud\u2019s self-titled debut (2004).\n\nI loved that. Lee Kerslake, Bob Daisley and I worked together as a trio for most of the writing and arranging. Near the end, we got Jimmy Barnes to come over and he sat down and wrote lyrics without even trying. He\u2019s such a good writer. Lee and Bob were amazing. Bob was a natural producer, so he was a little hard to please. He got more out of me as a result. Lee was just full of melodies. He could whistle them.\n\nLiving Loud came out of them wanting to record some of their songs they had written with Ozzy Osbourne they didn\u2019t get any credit for. The unfortunate side of that is it led me to playing songs that Randy Rhoads had done. Randy did such a great job on the originals. It really, really brought out the haters. People said \u201cWhat\u2019s Morse trying to do? That doesn\u2019t sound like Randy at all.\u201d Bob explained what they wanted to do as \u201cLet\u2019s do it our way. Let\u2019s re-do the songs.\u201d Everybody thought we were trying to do copy versions of the Ozzy recordings, because Bob and Lee were taken off some of them as some kind of payback for insisting on getting credit.\n\nIt seemed like a good cause, but I said \u201cI don\u2018t want to do something where I\u2019m just doing Randy Rhoads\u2019 parts.\u201d They said \u201cWe agree, just do it your way.\u201d I said \u201cWell, that sounds better. What about some original tunes?\u201d They agreed. So, we did one original song for every Ozzy cover tune. It turned out to be one of my favorite albums I\u2019ve done. The sheer amount of talent working with those guys was eye-opening. Don Airey was also on the record as a studio musician and sounded fantastic.\n\nWe ended up playing two gigs and that was it. But they were great gigs.\n\nT Lavitz\u2019s School of the Arts (2007).\n\nT was so talented and his talent was so relaxed. It was very enjoyable to work with him on things he initiated or that he would approve. He had been having to deal with me for so many years. I enjoyed turning that around and trying to support him. That was cool. I think I played clean electric on that album. Writing with him was very natural. I felt less pressure because he made the calls. I could just react musically, without having to consider anything else.\n\nSteve Morse and Sarah Spencer, 2010 | Photo: Jonpaul Douglass\n\nAngelfire, your duo album with Sarah Spencer (2010).\n\nThat started when a friend, who\u2019s a guitar player and a doctor, said \u201cCan you give my family some advice? Our daughter wants to be a singer.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve got to hear her sing, first.\u201d He brought over some recordings and I said \u201cOh, she\u2019s got a great voice.\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice is a really pure voice that\u2019s not full of attitude. It\u2019s beautiful.\n\nI said \u201cI like this. I\u2019d like to write some stuff for Sarah, actually.\u201d So, over the next couple of years, we\u2019d get together to write and record. It was my idea of music that was relaxing for me to listen to. Of course, I was never thinking about what the music industry wants. It\u2019s not country. It\u2019s not mainstream dance music. It\u2019s not any of that. But I thought it was cool, because it was something different. Sarah\u2019s an amazing talent.\n\nYou were the opening act for Joe Zawinul\u2019s 1986 Dialects tour. Tell me about that experience and what it meant to you.\n\nJaco Pastorius was a friend. He was someone I knew in Miami when I was attending the University of Miami\u2019s School of Music. One of the highlights of my time there was going to his place and jamming with him. When he joined Weather Report, it became one of my favorite bands.\n\nGetting the opportunity to tour with Joe Zawinul was really intense. I decided to do just do my thing\u2014what was appropriate for me, and not try to be closer to what he was doing. I had a good amount of variety in my set. It was like \u201cHere\u2019s a piece of music I\u2019ve written for classical guitar. Now, here\u2019s another one with me jamming over a loop.\u201d I was doing that before I met Joe. It turned out to be a neat mix.\n\nI have great respect for Joe. He was super easy to work with and be around. We were kind of separate on tour. I did my thing and he did his thing, but I think it worked well for the audience.\n\nThe highlight of the tour was playing Carnegie Hall. Peter Frampton came by and did a duet with me on one song. He did a great job and took it seriously. He\u2019s a very talented guy. People know him for singing songs and playing the hits, but they forget that if you give him an instrumental job, he can nail it.\n\nReflect on your friendship with Jaco Pastorius.\n\nHe ended up going through a real bad phase, but he was very coherent and sincere with me back when we were in school. He had so much energy. He literally couldn\u2019t play it off. If he was in a band and they did a gig with five or six sets a night, that still wasn\u2019t enough for him. He was an absolute powerhouse and he had this natural energy that infected everyone around him. He was a lot of fun.\n\nOne time, he sat in with the Dregs and started playing a solo. We hadn\u2019t planned on that or anything. It was during the end of our set. Jaco just kept going on and on and on until we finally put down our instruments and walked off stage. And then he just kept on playing! [laughs] That was Jaco. He was into his thing and he couldn\u2019t stop playing.\n\nWhen I jammed with Jaco, he was hard to keep up with. He would fly in and keep changing the starting point of what we were doing, but I enjoyed being around such an amazing talent.\n\nJaco used to always give me ideas for the Dregs. Once, he said \u201cHere\u2019s a thing I think you guys would be great at doing.\u201d I said, \u201cJaco, we don\u2019t have horns.\u201d He replied \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s just that one part. You can do it.\u201d A lot of his ideas didn\u2019t fit us. He\u2019d often give us horn charts and stuff to play, but we never did. I said \u201cLook, I\u2019m just doing my thing with this, but I appreciate it.\u201d\n\nI really hated seeing him lose his perspective and kind of go overboard. I hate what happened to him. It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s something I\u2019m sure could have been straightened out with some kind of prescription\u2014something to mellow him out a little bit. He was an uncontainable force. He literally had too much to say to the world. He was such an incredible player when he was in a band. Nobody could see him play and not just start smiling.\n\nJohn McLaughlin, Steve Morse, Al Di Meola, and Paco de Lucia, 1983 | Photo: Philips\n\nAnother major opening slot for you was touring with John McLaughlin, Al Di Meola and Paco de Lucia in 1983. What was that like?\n\nThat was a huge deal for me. Originally, I was going to replace Al, because he couldn\u2019t do a tour in Australia. I had played with them as a trio in rehearsals. Then, at the last minute, whatever needed to be worked out was worked out, and he was doing the tour. Instead of firing me after all the work I\u2019d done to get ready, they said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open for us?\u201d And then at the end of the show, we\u2019d all play on the same song and trade off between the four of us. That was super intense. It was really good for me in terms of upping my confidence. John McLaughlin is one of my all-time heroes. Obviously anyone that listens to Mahavishnu Orchestra and the Dregs knows there\u2019s a lot of influence from that band on the Dregs.\n\nYou\u2019ve been outspoken in your support for having Native American communities better cared for by the government and society as a whole. Tell me about your commitment to them.\n\nI\u2019m an outsider looking in, but with the history America has, there are parts that even as a kid made me feel uncomfortable. I\u2019d think \u201cHow could we do that? How was it possible? How can we love our country and still do things to people that are horribly unjust?\u201d\n\nIn my old age, I\u2019ve come to realize written history isn\u2019t always accurate and doesn\u2019t always tell the whole story. Bad things have happened to entire cultures and civilizations. Right now, the country is extremely aware of what happened to the people and cultures from Africa. The indigenous people of this country also have a lot of stories.\n\nBig government doesn't always do the right thing when it comes to trying to change how and where people live. We all should show the most respect possible for each other. People should work things out, together. As I travel the world, I see it for myself. People can work things out between them a lot better than government edicts can.\n\nI got to know a family and an elder woman that were being displaced because of a government change. It had something to do with mineral rights underneath her land. Her whole way of life was being taken away. I did a benefit for them and learned a lot about the situation. I also was partners with a guy making holistic vitamins, and he had a medicine woman who was also a doctor formulating the supplements. I was taking them. I liked them a lot and thought they were beneficial.\n\nThat\u2019s how I got more into this stuff. We have a little place out in New Mexico that we go out to. We enjoy interacting with the native people. We love the native cooking. I go out of my way to find places that serve Navajo-style food.\n\nIn general, I feel we need to watch what we do, and tread more lightly and respectfully as a society.\n\nHow does spirituality inform your music and life?\n\nMy father was a minister and I was brought up as a Presbyterian. I\u2019m still a non-denominational Christian, but I am very tolerant of other people\u2019s beliefs. I believe we\u2019re all taught what we\u2019re taught and that bowing in the presence of God makes us better people\u2014and certainly better when we deal with other people. It\u2019s important to not worship people as much, but rather bow to the presence and creations of God, and follow the good teachings. This works for a lot of different religions.\n\nMy main man is Jesus, because I was raised that way. He was a man of tolerance according to scripture and was slow to anger. Those are wonderful things to emulate.\n\nWhen it comes to music, it\u2019s a universal language that reaches across all cultures. If you play from the heart and play something moving, it\u2019s most likely going to be moving for people in other cultures. You have to play from your spirit core. If you do that, you\u2019ll reach more people. You\u2019ll find more common ground and more acceptance.\n\nSpecial thanks to Brian Moritz."}, {"url": "https://www.musictimes.com/articles/84582/20220419/rod-morgenstein-now-2022-age-net-worth-current-work-winger.htm", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein is turning 69 years old today!

The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004.\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years.\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://rodmorgenstein.com/index.html", "page_content": "After years of noodling with the idea of creating specialty tools for drummers, to help with the handful of pesky issues all drummers face at one time or another, the first tool - Wing Thing - has finally come to fruition.

Rod is a professor, teaching percussion at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Massachusetts. Recently offering, Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum-set playing. He is also a columnist for Modern Drummer magazine.\n\nThe beginning of the Dregs started in 1973, when he attended the University of Miami in Florida. There he met Steve Morse, Andy West, and Allen Sloan, playing under the official Studio Music and curriculum title of, Rock Ensemble II. At the university, The Dregs recorded their first album in 1975, The Great Spectacular, as a class project.\n\nThe Dregs had a rough time getting signed and were turned down and told their music was difficult to market because they were a jazz fusion band had no vocals, odd timing, and that their music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and classical influences. The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983. Rod then joined Steve Morse\u2019s new band and stayed for two albums before wanting a musical change to try something both new and challenging. The Dregs last reunion was a tour in 2018.\n\nWinger and Other Projects\n\nRod moved back to New York City and began auditioning for jobs, one of them turned out to be a band that Kip Winger was forming. Two months later, Rod received a call from the band, and they were off to record their self-titled, debut album, Winger, in 1988. It went double platinum. Winger followed up in 1990 with In the Heart of the Young. In 1993, they released the album, Pull, as grunge came in and changed the music scene. The band decided to take a break, but got back together in 2002, and have had sporadic reunions since, and continue to do so as time permits. Winger will be releasing a new album in 2021.\n\nRod\u2019s other projects include the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire, Jordan Rudess, with two albums to their credit.
