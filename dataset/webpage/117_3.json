It contains one of the band's signature songs \"Have a Nice Day\" which charted at number five in the UK. In 2003 the band released \"Maybe Tomorrow\", the second single from You Gotta Go There to Come Back (2003). It became one of Stereophonics' best charting singles in the UK, peaking at number three. \"Dakota\" was released in 2005 and brought Stereophonics their only UK number one single; its parent album Language. Sex. Violence. Other? (2005) became the band's fourth consecutive number-one album that same year. The single would also lend its name to their first live album a year later, Live from Dakota (2006).

After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded in 2010 the band took a break from releasing an album every two years,[9] this resulted in their next studio album to be released in 2013. Graffiti on the Train (2013) brought back critical favor but failed to repeat the commercial success of their first few albums.[10] It was also the first of two volumes,[11] the second of which, Keep the Village Alive (2015), brought Stereophonics their first number-one album in eight years and their sixth overall."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Stereophonics", "page_content": "About Stereophonics\n\nStereophonics are a Welsh rock band that formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in Cynon Valley.

The Welsh band, currently made up of Kelly Jones, Richard Jones, Jamie Morrison and Adam Zindani, are hit the road later in 2022 in support of their new album.\n\nBut how did Stereophonics get famous? And how did they get their band name? We've taken a trip down memory lane to pull out the band's biggest moments right here.\n\nStereophonics: How did they get famous?\n\n1992: The band is born Kelly and Stuart lived on the same street in Cwmaman, Wales, and began jamming together as teenagers, recording a demo under the name Zephyr. After going their separate ways, Kelly and Stuart reunited a few years later, bringing in Richard Jones as bass guitarist - and thus, the line-up was complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, the trio - then known as Tragic Love Company - began to write together, performing in working men's clubs before landing a gig at the Borderline Club in London. They were spotted by producers Marshall Bird and Steve Bush, and recorded demo 'A Thousand Trees'.\n\n1992 - 1996: Career beginnings and name change Promoter Wayne Coleman organised gigs in South Wales after hearing their demo, and whilst he loved the music - he hated the band name, and said they wouldn't play if they kept it. He then spotted a gramophone manufacturer called Falcon Stereophonic, and the band became The Stereophonics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played the Coliseum Theatre in nearby Aberdare with Catatonia, and were approached by John brand afterwards who immediately became their manager. Just two months later, they were the first artists to sign to label V2, dropping 'The' from the band name.\n\n1997: Debut album and BRIT Award The band's debut album 'Word Gets Around' was released in August 1997, spawning singles 'A Thousand Trees', 'Local Boy in the Photograph' and 'Traffic' to name but a few. In 1998, they won the Best New Group BRIT Award, and released 'The Bartender and the Thief' - the first single from their follow-up, 'Performance and Cocktails', which in turn was released in March 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band played to 50,000 people at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea that year, and also collaborated with Welsh legend Tom Jones on a cover of 'Mama Told Me Not To Come'. They toured Europe, Australia and America in 1999, and performed at Cardiff Castle - later released on DVD.\n\n2001: 'Have A Nice Day' After headlining Reading and Leeds in 2000, third album 'Just Enough Education to Perform' was released in 2001, featuring two of their most famous songs: 'Have a Nice Day' and a cover of 'Handbags and Gladrags', which was included in the re-release in 2002. The band performed a two-day festival, 'A Day at the Races', at Donington Park and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to promote the album, and also headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2002, as well as V Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band put out their fourth album 'You Gotta Go There to Come Back' in 2003, spawning singles 'Maybe Tomorrow', 'Madame Helga' and 'Since I Told You It's Over'. This was the last album to feature drummer Stuart Cable, who was let go from the band in September 2003. They also had their first headline slot at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2004, which they returned to in 2009.\n\n2005: A new line-up Stereophonics released their fifth album 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' in 2005, the first to feature new drummer, Javier Weyler. The album's single 'Dakota' became their first UK Number 1, and they performed that year at Live 8 in Hyde Park, London.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly pictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009.\n\n2007: Kelly goes it alone Kelly also released his first solo album, 'Only the Names Have Been Changed', in 2007. He explained how it came about, \"We were recording the sixth Stereophonics album... And in-between takes I started doing these songs off the cuff. Three or four tracks in I realised that this could actually be something... Strange how it's always little things that makes big things happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly is pictured performing at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2007 - 2010: \u2018Pull The Pin\u2019 'Pull the Pin' was released in October 2007, spawning single 'It Means Nothing' which was written about the London 7/7 attack. Kelly told The Guardian it was \"about the feeling of unease in the city and people realising what was important in their lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey performed at the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver, and released seventh album 'Keep Calm and Carry On', playing a UK tour throughout 2010 to promote it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band are pictured here at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2010: Stuart Cable's death Sadly, former member Stuart Cable passed away in June 2010, and Kelly decided to take a break from writing and releasing albums every two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band released song 'Before Anyone Knew Our Name' in 2017 in memory of Stuart. Kelly said of the song, \"I think, you know, Stuart left the band and we were still friends for seven years. And then he passed away tragically, and of course people have opinions about what happened and all this sort of stuff. We kept it very private because we were like brothers.\"\n\n2009: Isle of Wight Festival We met the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009, where they kindly signed a guitar for us. It's still up on the wall.\n\n2011: New music and another personnel change The band announced on Facebook in 2011 that they were back in the studio, but in 2012 announced that Javier had left the group. Jamie Morrison of The Noisettes replaced him, and they released eighth album 'Graffiti on the Train' in March 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at Hyde Park in 2012 at the Olympics Opening Ceremony concert.\n\n2012: Isle of Wight Festival Our presenter Sarah Champion caught up with Kelly backstage at the Isle of Wight festival 2012 and the pair chatted away in our camper van. As you do.\n\n2015: 'Keep the Village Alive' Stereophonics impressively released a ninth album in September 2015, entitled 'Keep the Village Alive' which topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained singles 'C'est la Vie' and 'I Wanna Get Lost with You'. They also performed a set for us at the Dingwalls venue in Camden (pictured).\n\n2016: Backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival We had a chat with the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016 - but there was a slight mishap when guitarist Adam Zindani fell through the deck chair...\n\n2016: Backstage at Isle of Wight Festival take two Thankfully, we were able to get Adam a different chair and complete the interview... Oops!\n\n2017: 'Scream Above the Sounds' The band made their 10th album in 2017, releasing 'Scream Above the Sounds' in October. This realised Kelly's dream that they would put out their 10th studio album in the 20th anniversary year of their debut, instead of releasing a Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016.\n\n2019: 'Kind' But they didn't stop there, getting straight back in the studio to record their eleventh album, 'Kind', which was released in October 2019 and reached Number 1 in the UK. They also embarked on their tour to promote the album, kicking off in Liverpool on 18th January and concluding in Cardiff on 15th March.\n\n2020: Kelly Jones 'Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day' 2020 saw frontman Kelly Jones release his album 'Don't Let The Devil Take Another Day'. The work contained 21 reworked tracks from throughout the Stereophonics' career, and even had its own documentary! The 90-minute feature tells the heartfelt story of the Stereophonics frontman/songwriter, following his personal uphill battle as he rediscovered his voice.\n\n2022: Stereophonics release 12th album 'Oochya!' and UK tour On 6th September 2021, Stereophonics announced that their 12th studio album will be titled 'Oochya!', and released it on Friday 4th March 2022! They later went on a huge tour to support the album's release throughout March and April.\n\n2023: Far From Saints Kelly teamed up with Austin's Patty Lynn and Dwight Baker to create new band Far From Saints, who released their debut single 'Let's Turn This Back Around' in January 2023. They're planning to release their album later this year and also preparing to tour the new music.\n\n\n\nNOW WATCH: Kelly Jones \u2013 Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day (Documentary Teaser)\n\nYou can hear Stereophonics on the Absolute Radio playlist.\n\nNow read:\n\nStereophonics: All your questions answered\n\nThe changing sound of Arctic Monkeys' albums through the years\n\nFeeder: A guide to the anthemic indie-rockers\n\nHow to listen to Absolute Radio:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio on DAB nationwide, on our free app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen, via your smart speaker (\u201cPlay Absolute Radio\u201d) and on Freeview, Sky, and Virgin Media TV."}, {"url": "https://www.radioswisspop.ch/en/music-database/band/626846371a2cd749c007700984782f15308a6/biography", "page_content": "Stereophonics are a Welsh rock band that formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in the Cynon Valley. The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Richard Jones (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums, percussion) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992\u20132003) and then Javier Weyler (2004\u20132012) on drums. Stereophonics have released ten studio albums, including six UK number one albums. Their latest album is Scream Above the Sounds (2017). A successful compilation album, Decade in the Sun, was released in November 2008 and charted at number two in the United Kingdom.\n\nDescribed as \"classic UK rock delivered with whiskey vocals\"[8], the band have been summarised as possessing a sound akin to the genres of alternative rock and \"British traditional rock\".[9] Stereophonics' debut album, Word Gets Around, was released in August 1997 and charted at number six in the UK, aided by the singles \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" and \"A Thousand Trees\". The band reached mainstream success with the release of Performance and Cocktails (and its promotional singles \"The Bartender and the Thief\", \"Just Looking\" and \"Pick a Part That's New\") in 1999 and have achieved a total of ten top-ten singles as well as one number one: \"Dakota\" (2005). Having sold around 10 million copies worldwide,[10][11] Stereophonics are one of the most successful Welsh rock acts. Upon their release of Pull the Pin, they became the eighth group to achieve five consecutive UK number one albums (after the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, ABBA, Genesis, Oasis, Blur and U2).\n\nThe band have also been praised for their live performances, which have landed them headlining slots at many of the UK and Ireland's most high-profile music festivals, including Reading and Leeds in 2000, Glastonbury in 2002, V festival in 2002, the Isle of Wight in 2004 and 2009, and Oxegen in 2010. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation and early years (1986\u20131991)\n\nKelly Jones and Stuart Cable lived on the same street[12] in the Welsh village of Cwmaman.[13] Jones heard Cable played drums so asked if he wanted to jam together.[14] After some time practising in Jones' dad's garage, Nicholas Geek joined in on guitar. Later,[b] Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and keyboards, respectively.[15] Cable recalls he was the one who suggested that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported Roy Orbison.[15] In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name \"Zephyr\". When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways.[12] Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R&B band called \"Silent Runner\" while Cable joined a glam-rock band named \"King Catwalk\" on drums.[16]\n\nA few years later,[b] Cable got sacked from the band and a few weeks after that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who was standing at a bus stop and waved back.[17] It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush.[18] They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed.[18] The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.[19]\n\nEverett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend Richard Jones to fill in for Everett.[19] Stunned by Richard's appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett.[19] The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in, but didn't stay in the band; he did, however, become Kelly's guitar technician.[20] The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde.[21] Neither stayed for long. Hyde did however play harmonica on \"Rooftop\" for the band's 2001 album Just Enough Education to Perform.[21] After Hyde left, the band stuck as a three-piece act.[21]\n\nName change and V2 Records (1992\u20131996)\n\nKelly, Richard and Cable began writing and performing music in working men's clubs together in 1992 as a band known as \"Tragic Love Company\", a name inspired by their favourite bands (the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company).[22] After Tragic Love Company supported Smalltown Heroes in the Borderline Club, London, they met Marshall Bird and Steve Bush who were interested in producing for the band. The band agreed and recorded a demo for \"A Thousand Trees\".[23]\n\nWayne Coleman organised a series of concerts throughout South Wales, he was sent a demo from the band. Wayne liked it a lot but hated the band name and told them they wouldn't be performing unless they changed it.[24] After Cable read the manufacturer name of a gramophone, \"Falcon Stereophonic\", he told Kelly and the band agreed to change their name to \"the Stereophonics\".[25] In March 1996, the band played a gig at their local Coliseum Theatre, Aberdare with Catatonia and the Pocket Devils.[25] When the band finished their slot, John Brand approached them and he became their manager.[26] Brand managed to get over 35 record companies in the UK interested in signing the Stereophonics.[27] In May 1996, they signed with V2,[28] the first artists to be signed to newly formed record label.[29] Upon signing, they dropped \"the\" from their name and simply became \"Stereophonics\".\n\nDebut album and ascent to fame (1997\u20132000)\n\nIn August 1997, the band released their first studio album, Word Gets Around, which reached number six in the UK charts, from which five singles were released. Afterwards, the band embarked on a successful world tour.\n\nIn February 1998, the band received a BRIT Award for Best New Group. In the same week, the band re-released the single \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", which in turn reached number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart. The band's debut album, Word Gets Around, also went gold in the UK.\n\nIn November 1998, \"The Bartender and the Thief\" (the first single from the album Performance and Cocktails) was released, eventually reaching number three on the UK charts. \"Just Looking\" was released next and reached number four in March 1999. In that same month, the album was released, entering at number one and going platinum within three weeks. Later that year, the band played in front of 50,000 people at Morfa Stadium in Swansea. The concert was filmed and released on DVD the following year. They also collaborated with Tom Jones on a cover of the Randy Newman song \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\", for the Tom Jones album Reload.\n\nThroughout 1998 and 1999, the band toured in Europe, Australia and the US. On 12 June 1998, Stereophonics played to over 10,000 spectators in the grounds of Cardiff Castle in Wales. Footage of the concert was released on VHS and DVD, titled Live at Cardiff Castle.\n\nMainstream success (2001\u20132004)\n\nThe band released their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform, in April 2001. The album included the track \"Mr. Writer\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \"Have a Nice Day\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, Just Enough Education to Perform, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called A Day at the Races. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.\n\n2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled You Gotta Go There to Come Back. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \"Cable TV\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler.[30] Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with Rip It Up magazine, Kelly Jones admitted to the difficulty of the situation.[31]\n\nTowards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a live version of \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003\u20132004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.\n\nDrummer change and Stuart Cable's death (2005\u20132010)\n\nTheir fifth studio album, Language. Sex. Violence. Other? was released in March 2005. It marked their first recording with new drummer Javier Weyler. The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album's first single, \"Dakota\". The second single from the album was \"Superman\". However, that song did not repeat the success of \"Dakota\", peaking at number thirteen. After \"Superman\" came \"Devil\", featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a Pop Factory award at the end of the year, losing out to Feeder's Pushing the Senses.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support Oasis for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics' first live album, Live from Dakota. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band's albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled \"Jayne\", later released as part of Kelly Jones' solo album, Only the Names Have Been Changed.\n\nPull the Pin was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; \"Bank Holiday Monday\". The track was also available for free to people who pre-ordered tickets for the band's concerts in 2007. The album was written and recorded by November 2006 but held back for release until late 2007.[32] \"It Means Nothing\" was the first single of the album, released in September before the LP was released a week later on 15 October. The album contains twelve songs and reached number one in the UK's official album chart. The next single, \"My Friends\", reached number thirty-two in the UK charts, their poorest chart performance since \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" from their debut album.\n\nOn 20 May 2007, at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston, the band were joined on stage by Casino frontman Adam Zindani. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the Pull the Pin tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He has been credited for writing and performing on two of the band's new tracks, \"You're My Star\" and \"My Own Worst Enemy\". On \"You're My Star\", he sings backing vocals and plays lead guitar, whereas on \"My Own Worst Enemy\" he only plays lead guitar. In November 2008, Stereophonics released their first greatest hits compilation, Decade in the Sun.\n\nOn 8 December 2009, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games announced the line up for performers for the nightly Victory Ceremonies.[33] These ceremonies included 30 minutes of entertainment from the evening's host province/territory, 30 minutes of medal presentations, and a one-hour performance by a musical talent. Stereophonics performed their song \"I Got Your Number\" at this event on 20 February - Yukon Night. The band's seventh album, titled Keep Calm and Carry On, was released on 16 November 2009. They decided on this name after seeing a poster in the White Horse pub in Richmond where they spent a lot of time whilst recording the album.[34] The album's debut single was \"Innocent\".[35] The second single from the album, \"Could You Be the One?\", was released on 15 February 2010. The band embarked on a seven-date tour to support the new album in March 2010 playing at Aberdeen, Newcastle, Glasgow, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and London.[34] with support from Glasgow band Hip Parade.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium with support from unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic, followed by Kids in Glass Houses and Doves. The concert, known as \"Summer in the City\", was played to a sold-out audience of 30,000. Two days later, original drummer Stuart Cable was found dead in his home in Aberdare having choked on his own vomit after binge drinking.[36] After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded, and their contract with Universal at an end, Kelly Jones wanted to change the way the band works and so decided to take a break from writing and recording an album every two years.[37]\n\nGraffiti on the Train, Keep the Village Alive and Scream Above the Sounds (2011\u2013present)\n\nOn 3 March 2011, Stereophonics announced on their Facebook page that they were working on new music in the studio.[38] In July 2012 it was announced that Weyler and the band had parted company. The announcement was made on the band's Facebook page, though no reason was given for his departure.[39] It was announced on 24 September 2012 that Jamie Morrison, former drummer for Noisettes, had replaced Weyler in the band.[40] On 8 October 2012, Stereophonics released the video to a track titled \"Violins and Tambourines\" from the upcoming album.[41] On 4 November, the first single from the new album, \"In a Moment\", was released as a free download from the band's website.[42] On the same day, NME.com reported that the album would be titled Graffiti on the Train.[43] The album was released on 4 March 2013.[44] Second single preceding the album, \"Indian Summer\" was released in January 2013; by 10 March it had peaked at number 30 in the UK, making it their group's first UK top-40 single since 2007. A third single, the album's title track, was released on 13 May.[45]\n\nIn late September 2014, it was announced via their Twitter page that a new album has been mixed and that it should be released in 2015.[46] On 21 March 2015, Stereophonics performed in Bristol and in London's Royal Albert Hall and debuted 3 new songs \"C'est La Vie\", \"I Wanna Get Lost With You\" and \"Song for the Summer\" which are to be on their 9th album Keep the Village Alive with the release date of 11 September. \"C'est la Vie\" was released as the first single of the album. [47] In September 2015 the band appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland.[48] During the Keep the Summer Alive Tour, Kelly Jones announced he would like to release the band's tenth studio album \"before next summer\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Word Gets Around, rather than release a compilation album.[49][50]\n\nOn 27 July 2017 the band announced Scream Above the Sounds as the title for the album and will be released on 27 October 2017. It became available to pre-order on the same day. The band released \"All In One Night\" on the same day as the lead single from it. On 4 September 2017 \"Caught By The Wind\" was released as the second single from the album followed by \"What's All The Fuss About?\" as the third single on 4 December 2017. They will embark on a tour in 2018\n\nOther projects\n\nOn 9 October 2007, a retrospective DVD was released in the United States, Rewind: The First 10 Years. The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the You Gotta Go There to Come Back album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones' hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band's fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the Language.Sex.Violence.Other? DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, Pull the Pin.\n\nIn 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled Only the Names Have Been Changed, while recording the band's sixth studio album, Pull the Pin. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song \"Jayne\", a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album Live from Dakota and the Rewind DVD.\n\nStereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series Long Way Round.

From its inception in 1992 under the name Tragic Love Company (thank goodness they changed it) through to their 11th album 'Kind' in 2019, the Welsh rockers have remained a staple of the genre.\n\nAs we look forward to new music from the group that brought us 'Dakota' and 'Have A Nice Day', fans are understandably wondering when they can hear new music from Stereophonics - and we don't have to wait too long, with their upcoming 12th album 'Oochya!' being set for release on Friday 4th March 2022!\n\nWhat will Stereophonics' 12th studio album be called?\n\nThe upcoming 12th studio album from Stereophonics will be called 'Oochya!' and will contain 15 tracks.\n\nThe first taster of \u2018Oochya!\u2019, 'Hanging On Your Hinges', was premiered by the band on 6th September 2021. Take a listen here...\n\nThe band even announced that they will be taking the new album on tour in 2022, touring the UK throughout March and April.\n\nKelly Jones announces that Stereophonics have finished work on their 12th studio album\n\nKelly, who released his solo album \u2018Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day\u2019 in 2020, shared a short video from the recording studio on Stereophonics\u2019 social channels on 22nd June, confirming that the album will come out before the end of 2021.\n\nWhen will Stereophonics' 12th album be released?\n\nStereophonics' 12th studio album 'Oochya!' will be released on Friday 4th March 2022!\n\nSitting alongside mixer Al Clay, who Stereophonics have previously worked with on 1999\u2019s \u2018Performance and Cocktails\u2019 and 2019\u2019s \u2018Kind\u2019, Kelly said: \u201cSo, there you have it folks. We\u2019ve just finished mixing the 12th album in the 25th year \u2013 Mr Alistair Clay; \u2018Al\u2019 to his friends and \u2018Big Al\u2019 to Hans Zimmer.\n\n\u201cSo here we are. It will be coming to you\u2026 unfortunately (we have to wait) another five months, but we had to get it out now to Germany to meet the vinyl cutting deadline after Brexit. I won\u2019t bore you with it. Adios Amigos!\u201d\n\nStereophonics\u2019 last album \u2018Kind\u2019 was released in October 2019 and it became the band\u2019s seventh Number 1 album in the UK shifting more than 30,000 copies in its first week.\n\nThree months after its release, Stereophonics played a very special concert for Absolute Radio at London\u2019s O2 Forum Kentish Town ahead of their UK arena tour.\n\nYou can watch extended highlights from the Absolute Radio gig below featuring \u2018Superman\u2019, \u2018Maybe Tomorrow\u2019, \u2018Bust This Town\u2019, \u2018Fly Like An Eagle\u2019, \u2018Boy On A Bike\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day\u2019, \u2018Have A Nice Day\u2019, \u2018Indian Summer\u2019, \u2018Make Friends With The Morning\u2019, \u2018C\u2019est La Vie\u2019, \u2018This Life Ain\u2019t Easy (But It\u2019s the One That We All Got)\u2019 and \u2018Dakota.\u2019\n\nWatch extended highlights of Stereophonics' Absolute Radio concert:\n\nKelly Jones released his solo album \u2018Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day\u2019 and a documentary of the same name shortly before Christmas 2020.\n\nBoasting 21 tracks, the \u2018Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day\u2019 album features reimagined, stripped back versions of Stereophonics classics and solo tracks recorded during Kelly Jones\u2019 June and July 2019 UK tour.\n\nThe 23 worst original names of famous bands:\n\nStereophonics - Tragic Love Company Members of various bands in their hometown of Cwmaman in the late eighties and early nineties, Kelly Jones, Stuart Cable and Richard Jones eventually became a trio in 1992 and started gigging as Tragic Love Company. The moniker was taken from the name of three of their favourite bands at the time; the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company. After they recorded an early demo of their seminal anthem 'A Thousand Trees', local promoter Wayne Coleman booked them to play a series of shows across South Wales on the provision they changed their name. Late-great drummer Stuart Cable got the final name from the 'Falcon Stereophonic' gramophone.\n\nThe Stone Roses - The Angry Young Teddy Bears According to producer John Leckie, who helmed The Stone Roses' seminal self-titled 1989 debut album, the band almost called themselves The Angry Young Teddy Bears. \"That's ('The Angry Young Teddy Bears') what the Roses were thinking of calling themselves when I met them,\" Leckie told Q Magazine in 2016. \"It sort of suits them in a funny way. The thing with the Roses is that even though there is a punk heritage, they're hippies. Ian especially. It sounds corny, but there's a lot of love there, and you don't really get that with other Manchester bands.\" They ultimately opted for The Stone Roses and the rest, they say, is history.\n\nKaiser Chiefs \u2013 Runston Parva When Nick Hodgson, Andrew White and Ricky Wilson formed the band in 1996, they took their bizarre Runston Parva moniker from the name of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. With Nick Baines and Simon Rix later in their ranks, they dumped the 'Runston' and they were signed up to the Beggars Banquet Records subsidiary label Mantra Records. However, despite four single releases, Parva were left label-less when Mantra folded in 2003 and their album '22' went unreleased. Fed up with their bad luck, they renamed themselves Kaiser Chiefs after the South African football club Kaizer Chiefs.\n\nMuse \u2013 Rocket Baby Dolls When frontman Matt Bellamy and drummer Dominic Howard's former band Gothic Plague (surprisingly not a death metal group) split following a series of rifts, they enlisted new bassist Chris Wolstenholme and changed their name to Rocket Baby Dolls. Soon realising it was woeful, after just one gig \u2013 their triumphant battle of bands performance at Broadmeadow Sports Centre in Teignmouth in 1994 \u2013 they switched it for Muse.\n\nGoo Goo Dolls \u2013 The Sex Maggots Originally a covers band, Goo Goo Dolls were known as the Sex Maggots when they were gigging around Buffalo, New York in 1986. However, they were reportedly forced to find a new moniker when a local promoter refused to put their band name on his marquee. They took their name from a toy called a Goo Goo Doll that they stumbled across in an advert in True Detective magazine. Singer Johnny Rzeznik has since quipped: \"It's the best we came up with, and for some reason it stuck. If I had five more minutes, I definitely would have picked a better name.\"\n\nColdplay - Starfish When future Coldplay frontman Chris Martin met Welsh guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London in 1996, the musical kindred spirits formed a group called Pectoralz. With bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion joining their ranks the following year, they changed their name to Starfish. The band performed their debut show at the now closed Laurel Tree pub in Camden in January 1998 as Starfish and had a number of equally terribly titled songs including the cringey 'Ode to Deoderant'. Several weeks later they changed their name to Coldplay after a good chum called Tim Crompton kindly agreed they could nick the moniker of his own group.\n\nElbow - Mr Soft Formed in Bury in 1990, Guy Garvey, Mark Potter, Richard Jupp and bassist Pete Turner called themselves Mr. Soft in homage to the character in the Trebor Softmints advert in the late eighties that was soundtracked by Cockney Rebel's song of the same name, 'Mr. Soft'. Soon shortened to just Soft, the band redubbed themselves Elbow in 1997 and took inspiration from the BBC TV drama The Singing Detective where a character called Philip Marlow calls the word \"elbow\" as the prettiest word in the English language.\n\nPearl Jam \u2013 Mookie Blaylock Keen aficionados of the legendary New York Jets basketball player Mookie Blaylock, Eddie Vedder and co. decided to name their band in his honour. After playing a series of shows as Mookie Blaylock, they renamed themselves Pearl Jam in October '90 after signing to Epic Records. The origins of the name are somewhat cloudy, related either to Eddie Vedder's great grandmother Pearl / seeing Neil Young \"jam\" live / a naughty euphemism, depending on who you talk to... Mookie himself is said to be a big fan of Pearl Jam's music.\n\nNirvana \u2013 Pen Cap Chew Previously a member of the delightfully named Fecal Matter \u2013 aka Brown Towel \u2013 Kurt Cobain already had a history of hilariously bad band names before starting his new outfit with Krist Novoselic. After trialling a few dodgy names including Skid Row, Ted Ed Fred and, most notably, Pen Cap Chew, they had a eureka moment and settled on Nirvana. Kurt told Rolling Stone in 1992: \"I wanted a name that was kind of beautiful or nice and pretty instead of a mean, raunchy punk name like the Angry Samoans.\" A superb choice.\n\nRadiohead \u2013 On A Friday Formed while students at Abingdon School, Oxfordshire in 1985, Thom Yorke, Philip Selway, Ed O'Brien, Johnny Greenwood and Colin Greenwood called themselves On A Friday in reference to the rehearsal day in their school's music room. The name stuck for six years until they signed a six-album deal with EMI Records in 1991 and the label requested they ditched it. They opted for Radiohead after the 1986 Talking Heads song 'Radio Head'.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers - Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem Founded at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles in 1983, Anthony Kiedis, Hillel Slovak, Flea and Jack Irons gave themselves the flabbergasting name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. According to Kiedis, the name was intended to reflect the \"majestic and chaotic\" nature of the band. After two shows as Tony Flow\u2026 in November of '83 the group opted for the comparatively normal moniker Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - The Golliwogs Originally named The Blue Velvets, when the band recorded some tracks for Fantasy Records in 1964, label co-owner Max Reiss decided to change it to The Golliwogs after the minstrel doll of the same name. Late rhythm guitarist Tom Fogarty said: \"I think, at least to Max anyway, 'Golliwogs' sounded sort of British. We always hated the name but Max owned the label and we were new and wanted very much to make records, so we went along with things.\" Three years later the name was thankfully dropped.\n\nNickelback \u2013 Village Idiots When the young Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake, Mike Kroeger and former drummer Brandon Kroeger formed a covers band in the early 1990s largely pilfering from Metallica, Led Zeppelin and Megadeth's back catalogue, they dubbed themselves the Village Idiots. Realising it would make them a laughingstock on the bigger stage, they later changed it to Nickelback in reference to the nickel in change Mike often gave his customers while working at Starbucks \u2013 \"Here's your nickel back.\"\n\nBlack Sabbath \u2013 The Polka Tulk Blues Band It's almost impossible to think of a more inappropriate band name as The Polka Tulk Blues Band to fit with Sabbath's crushing heavy metal sounds. Fortunately, they saw sense and abandoned the name in the late 60s with a scathing Iommi telling Ozzy: \"Every time I hear it, all I can picture is you, with your trousers around your ankles, taking a f***ing dump. It's crap.\" Black Sabbath was inspired by three things - the Boris Karloff film of the same name, a dark vision bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler once had, and the work of occult novelist Dennis Wheatley.\n\nSnow Patrol \u2013 Shrug Four years before the formation of Snow Patrol, singer Gary Lightbody and bassist Mark McClelland along with drummer Michael Morrison formed the rather indifferent monikered band Shrug. They self-released the brilliantly titled demo 'The Yogurt vs Yogurt Debate' in 1994 and changed their name to Polarbear in 1996 after discovering there was already an American band called Shrug. Following an EP called 'Starfighter Pilot' in 1997 and the exit of Morrison, the band morphed into Snow Patrol the following year.\n\nKISS \u2013 Wicked Lester Binning their Rainbow moniker when they discovered there was already another band with the same name, in 1971 the group renamed themselves Wicked Lester. During their brief existence the folk/pop/rock group played in public just twice before Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley decided to delve into rock and roll and recruit new members. With Ace Frehley on board by Christmas '72 they changed their name to KISS and played their first live show a month later.\n\nVan Halen \u2013 Rat Salad Van Halen originally called themselves Genesis until they found out a certain British progressive rock band shared then name. The band then redubbed themselves Mammoth\u2026 only to discover that was being used too! Still predominately a covers band, the Van Halen brothers toyed with Rat Salad (after the Black Sabbath song) but Dave Lee Roth countered with their surname. Originally worried about it sounding self-absorbed, the whole band eventually agreed to adopt it.\n\nCreed \u2013 Naked Toddler The astonishingly atrocious and inappropriate band name was suggested by guitarist Mark Tremonti in the mid-nineties after he read a story in the press about an abducted child. Unable to settle on a suitable band name at the time, they often performed under a name taken from the headlines in that day's newspaper. Naively adopting Naked Toddler for one show at a club called Yanni's, Scott Stapp revealed in his 2012 autobiography that it was rightfully met with indignation. \"The name didn't go over well. Girls hated it and said it made them think of paedophilia. They had a point.\" We couldn't have put it better ourselves\u2026\n\nU2 - Feedback/The Hype When drummer Larry Mullen posted a notice looking for band members at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, the resulting group were called The Larry Mullen Band \"for about ten minutes\" before Bono swept aside the idea. They then opted for Feedback, after the screeching sound that came out of their amps, only to switch it for the decidedly pop band-esque name The Hype in 1977. Eventually they settled on U2 for its \"ambiguity and open-ended interpretations.\"\n\nBlur \u2013 Seymour Formed from the ashes of Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon and Alex James' previous group Circus, the band called themselves Seymour in December 1988 after J. D. Salinger's 1963 novella 'Seymour: An Introduction'. When they were signed to Food Records in 1990, the imprint wisely rejected the terrible name and the band decided on Blur after drawing up a list of alternatives.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel \u2013 Tom & Jerry When they were just 15 years old in 1956, the fresh-faced Paul Simon and Arthur Garfunkel assumed the name Tom & Jerry seemingly in reference to the hit Hanna and Barbera cartoon of the same name. Simon even dubbed himself Tom Graph and Garfunkel took on the name Jerry Landis. The pair scored a minor hit called 'Hello Schoolgirl' before going their separate ways. In 1964 they reconvened as a duo and decided to use their real names to stay \"true\" to themselves.\n\nLinkin Park \u2013 Xero Formed by high school chums Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon and Brad Delson in 1996, with Joe Hahn and singer Mark Wakefield recruited later that year, Linkin Park were somewhat regrettably originally known as Xero - a name that sounds more like a brand of photocopier than a band. After recording a self-titled EP, Wakefield quit the group when tensions grew when they failed to secure a record deal. Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington in 1999 and they changed their name to Hybrid Theory before eventually settling on Linkin Park in homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park.\n\nPink Floyd \u2013 Screaming Abdabs Pink Floyd were formed from the ashes of a band that had a series of bizarre transitory names. First called Sigma 6 (there were six members including Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Nick Mason), in 1964 they adopted a series of short-lived but gloriously ridiculous names including Leonard's Lodgers, the Meggadeaths and the Screaming Abdabs. A year later Syd Barratt coined Pink Floyd after finding inspiration from the Piedmont blues musicians Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nStereophonics: All your questions answered\n\nStereophonics through the years: A look back at their career\n\nWatch Stereophonics perform 12 songs exclusively for Absolute Radio\n\nHow to listen to Absolute Radio:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio on DAB nationwide, on our free app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen, via your smart speaker (\u201cPlay Absolute Radio\u201d) and on Freeview, Sky, and Virgin Media TV."}, {"url": "https://returnofrock.com/stereophonics-albums-ranked/", "page_content": "Stereophonics are a British rock band that formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in the Cynon Valley, Wales.

Keep Calm And Carry On (2009)\n\n\u201cMore catchy and tuneful poppy stuff from everyone\u2019s favorite welsh working class millionaire rock band. Sung, played and produced excellently. Not exactly stretching the boundaries but who cares, just Carry On! Will keep all Stereos\u2019 fans happy, me included. Nice keyboard touches here and there.\u201d\n\n9. Scream Above The Sounds (2017)\n\n\u201cStereophonics have released a sizable amount of alums, but remains one of the most consistent rock bands by managing to great constantly good music with a sprinkle of great songs on each. They are not the most lively or attention grabbing music, but Kelly\u2019s raw lyrics make it some of the best relaxing alt-rock around.\u201d\n\n8. Keep The Village Alive (2015)\n\n\u201cAnother strong album by the Stereophonics, building on their last \u201ccomeback\u201d release, Graffiti On A Train. The whole album rocks along quite nicely, with plenty of foot tappers and head nodders to keep the listener interested. In fact the only bad thing about this record is the cover!\u201d\n\nSee more: Alt-J Albums Ranked\n\n7. You Gotta Go There To Come Back (2003)\n\n\u201cThe best album so far. After three albums music matured from album to album Stereophonics introduced a blend of strong riff pieces like \u201cHelp Me (She\u2019s out of her Mind)\u201d with peaceful subdued \u201cI Miss You Now\u201d. The release include the biggest hit, and the band showcase piece \u201cMaybe Tommorow\u201d. Let\u2019s hope that the band will be able to maintain the current condition for next albums.\u201d\n\n6. Decade In The Sun: Best Of Stereophonics (2008)\n\n\u201cStereophonics are much maligned by the snobbier elements of the music press as well as the general music consuming public. Their sales don\u2019t seem to suffer and perhaps this is part of why they are rarely given any credit.\u201d\n\n5. Graffiti On The Train (2013)\n\n\u201cStereophonics have released a sizable amount of alums, but remains one of the most consistent rock bands by managing to great constantly good music with a sprinkle of great songs on each. They are not the most lively or attention grabbing music, but Kelly\u2019s raw lyrics make it some of the best relaxing alt-rock around.\u201d\n\nSee more: Portugal, The Man Albums Ranked\n\n4. Language. Sex. Violence. Other? (2005)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for another commercial success noticed by Stereophonics. With the single \u201cDakota\u201d, which incidentally became another showcase of the band next to \u201cHave A Nice Day\u201d and \u201cMaybe Tommorow\u201d, the band promoted the album, a little worse than the previous one, but very equal musically. All of the songs on the disc maintain a good level, which was so lacking on the first albums.\u201d\n\n3. Just Enough Education To Perform (2001)\n\n\u201cHow can you not be touched by such a story? Or by the one about the guy that drives \u201ca truck that carries money\u201d and loves his family? Or by the one about the caravan holiday? I really do NOT get the low ratings. Kelly Jones is a great storyteller, and the melodies are so relaxed they actually make me happy. Love this record, a desert island pick without any doubt.\u201d\n\n2. Performance And Cocktails (1999)\n\n\u201cPost Britpop we had the Stereophonics brand of Brit Rock which hit its peak with this record. It\u2019s not just got some good singles but as an album it\u2019s very complete and very consistent as well as being well produced and well put together. The riffs and hooks stick in your head for the most part but lyrics are not the strong point of this record. A couple of nice stories in a few of the songs but a lot of trite lines. One or two tracks you\u2019ll skip over but all in all plenty to enjoy here.\u201d\n\n1.

Indeed, their roots are actually traceable back to the mid-80s, when the band\u2019s guitar and vocal frontman Kelly Jones and original drummer Stuart Cable recorded an initial demo in their first band, Zephyr.\n\nDuring their formative years, Jones and Cable lived on the same street in the small town of Cwmaman in Mid-Glamorgan, and, while Zephyr soon blew away into history, the pair eventually joined forces for a second time.

After a lot of slogging, they secured a support slot to the long-forgotten Smalltown Heroes, at London\u2019s small but well-respected Borderline Club (off the Tottenham Court Road), where they met a suitably impressed production team, Marshall Bird and Steve Bush.\n\nOverseen by Bird and Bush, the band demoed one of Kelly Jones\u2019 self-penned songs, \u2018A Thousand Trees\u2019, and changed their name to The Stereophonics; reputedly after Cable had seen the manufacturer name \u201cFalcon Stereophonic\u201d on a hi-fi system. The band\u2019s demo helped secured them further local gigs and also bagged them a manager, John Brand, who first saw the group perform supporting another up-and-coming Welsh act, Catatonia, at Aberdare\u2019s Coliseum Theatre in March 1996. With Brand handling management, record companies began taking an interest and, later in 1996, the band \u2013 now known simply as Stereophonics \u2013 became the first artists to sign to Virgin Records\u2019 new offshoot label, V2 (now part of Universal Music UK).\n\nThe band\u2019s initial rise to prominence was timed to perfection. With Britpop holding sway and a group of exciting, if relatively disparate young Welsh acts such as Super Furry Animals, 60 Ft Dolls and the aforementioned Catatonia scooping column inches in the rock weeklies, Stereophonics\u2019 raw, but melodic guitar pop chimed with the times. Their debut LP, Word Gets Around (released in August 1997), shot to No.6 in the UK Top 40.\n\nLargely well-received by the critics, the LP was stuffed with Kelly Jones\u2019 observational, human-interest story songs, many of which centred upon the vagaries of life in Stereophonics\u2019 home town, Cwmaman. One of the LP\u2019s quintet of 45s, the edgy \u2018More Life In A Tramp\u2019s Vest\u2019 was a rumination on life as seen through the eyes of a supermarket bag boy, while the band\u2019s first Top 30 hit, \u2018A Thousand Trees\u2019, relayed the story of a highly respected athletics coach falling from grace after an unfortunate sexual encounter with one of his students. Arguably the record\u2019s most memorable track, however, was the atypically poised ballad \u2018Traffic\u2019 (also a Top 20 hit), which showed that Stereophonics had more to offer than punchy, arena-ready anthems.\n\nStereophonics toured extensively after their debut was released, receiving a Brit Award for Best New Group in February 1998, the same week their re-released 45, \u2018Local Boy In The Photograph\u2019, became their biggest hit to date, charting at No.14 in the UK.\n\nWord Gets Around went gold in the UK and Stereophonics were on a roll. Their second LP, Performance And Cocktails, was released in March 1999 and drastically exceeded commercial expectations, selling 120,000 copies in its first week and going straight to No.1 in the UK charts. Again produced by Bird and Bush, the album eventually went on to sell over 2.5 million copies, gaining multi-platinum status and yielding three consecutive British Top 5 hits courtesy of \u2018The Bartender & The Thief\u2019, \u2018Just Looking\u2019 and the infectiously poppy \u2018Pick A Part That\u2019s New\u2019.\n\nStereophonics were rarely off the road as 1998 turned into \u201999, touring widely in Europe, Australia and the US. Their schedule included a couple of triumphant homecoming gigs: shows at Cardiff Castle (12 June 1998) and Swansea\u2019s Morfa Stadium, in \u201999 (the latter before an audience of 50,000 people) were both filmed and recorded for separate DVD releases.\n\nThe band seemed unstoppable around the time the world ushered in the new millennium, releasing their third LP, Just Enough Education To Perform, in April 2001. Again topping the UK charts, the record was another phenomenal success, becoming the fourth best-selling British album of 2001 and going on to achieve multi-platinum sales in the UK, double-platinum sales in mainland Europe, and even sneaking on to the US Billboard 200 at No.188.\n\nThe album also spawned three Top 10 UK hits in the vitriol-tinged, anti-critic paean \u2018Mr Writer\u2019, the breezy \u2018Have A Nice Day\u2019 and the band\u2019s emotive cover of the Mike d\u2019Abo-penned \u2018Handbags & Gladrags\u2019, which Rod Stewart previously recorded for his 1969 LP, An Old Raincoat Won\u2019t Ever Let You Down. Stylistically, the record was Stereophonics\u2019 most mature outing to date, with elements of blues-rock (\u2018Watch Them Fly Sundays\u2019) and gospel (\u2018Vegas Two Times\u2019) infiltrating the raw, instantly recognisable indie-rock sound they\u2019d patented on Word Gets Around and Performance And Cocktails.\n\nStereophonics enjoyed further multi-platinum success with 2003\u2019s Kelly Jones-produced You Gotta Go There To Come Back (their third consecutive LP to top the UK charts), though it would be their last record to feature original drummer Stuart Cable, who had begun to forge a parallel media career which involved him presenting a TV show named Cable TV.\n\nNew drummer Javier Weyler was announced as Cable\u2019s replacement, and Stereophonics played a successful world tour during 2003 and \u201904, which featured a celebratory Christmas show at Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium and a well-received appearance at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004. Weyler consequently made his debut on Stereophonics\u2019 fifth LP, Language. Sex Violence. Other?, which was released in March 2005. Though notably more urgent and abrasive than the laid-back blues-influenced rock dominating You Gotta Go There To Come Back, the album nonetheless put up an impressive critical showing, with trailer single \u2018Dakota\u2019 topping the UK charts and the album following suit, selling 100,000 copies in its first week of release. The record also attracted praise from the critics, most of whom dug the band\u2019s rekindled aggression and the brashness displayed by the LP\u2019s best cuts, such as \u2018Girl\u2019 and the crunching \u2018Doorman\u2019.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, Stereophonics appeared at the globally televised Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, and, the following year, issued their first officially sanctioned live LP, Live From Dakota: a two-disc compilation capturing some of the highlights from their 2005 world tour. They returned to action in 2007 with a new studio LP, Pull The Pin: a slick, accomplished outing which again topped the UK charts and went gold. Arguably the LP\u2019s stand-out moment, the first single \u2018It Means Nothing\u2019, related to the notorious 7/7 terrorist attacks in London. Despite the song\u2019s hard-hitting subject matter, it climbed to No.12 in the UK charts.\n\nFeaturing two brand new tracks, \u2018You\u2019re My Star\u2019 and \u2018My Own Worst Enemy\u2019, the band\u2019s 40-track, platinum-selling career anthology Decade In The Sun: Best Of Stereophonics followed in 2008 before they re-entered the fray with November 2009\u2019s Keep Calm And Carry On, their first record to feature recently recruited second guitarist Adam Zindani. The album stalled at No.11 on the UK charts, but it again went gold and spawned two well-received singles, \u2018Innocent\u2019 and \u2018Could You Be The One?\u2019. Drafted in to co-produce with Kelly Jones, Arctic Monkeys\u2019 producer Jim Abbiss removed some of the gloss of Pull The Pin, but the stripped-down approach suited many of the album\u2019s best tracks, including the lithe \u2018She\u2019s Alright\u2019 and the spirited \u2018I Got Your Number\u2019.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium, with support from Doves and unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic. Advertised as \u2018Summer In The City\u2019, the event attracted a sold-out audience of 30,000 people, though the band\u2019s euphoria was dampened somewhat by the sudden death of their old friend and former drummer Stuart Cable, only two days later.\n\nStereophonics were back working on their next album during 2011, though before it was released, Jamie Morrison (ex-Noisettes) had replaced Javier Weyler on drums. Recorded primarily at ICP Studios in Brussels, the long-awaited album \u2013 Graffiti On The Train \u2013 finally arrived in March 2013, peaking at No.3 on the UK chart and selling an impressive 300,000 copies. The LP\u2019s exhilarating second single, \u2018Indian Summer\u2019, reacquainted the band with the UK Top 30 singles chart, and the album itself attracted a brace of highly positive reviews, with critics lauding the record\u2019s diversity and the quality of tracks, such as the orchestrally inclined titular song and the country/soul flavoured \u2018Been Caught Cheating\u2019.\n\nAnother worldwide promotional trek followed after the release of Graffiti On The Train but, by February 2014, Stereophonics were already ensconced in the studio working on new material. Released through their own Stylus label, the seemingly inexhaustible Welsh band\u2019s ninth album, Keeping The Village Alive, was released in September 2015 and immediately shot to No.1 in the UK, as well as climbing to an impressive No.17 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Album Chart. Another highly confident return, its 10 tracks threw a few intriguing curveballs, including the baroque-flavoured \u2018Sunny\u2019 and the sinewy, disco-inflected \u2018Fight Or Flight\u2019, but mostly it was highly credible business as usual, with soaring anthems such as \u2018C\u2019est La Vie\u2019 and \u2018Sing Little Sister\u2019 showing exactly why Stereophonics will inevitably continue to connect on the world stage.\n\nWords: Tim Peacock\n\nUK English Format:UK English"}, {"url": "https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/stereophonics-set-to-claim-eighth-uk-number-one-album/41420616.html", "page_content": "The rock group have released 12 studio albums in total.\n\nAdam Zindani, Richard Jones, Kelly Jones and Jamie Morrison of the Stereophonics, are on track to claim their eighth Number One album (Lia Toby/PA Images)\n\nThe Welsh rock band released their new album, Oochya!, on March 4 and it is currently outselling its closest competition by 2:1, according to Official Charts Company data.\n\nThe band \u2013 made up of Kelly Jones, Richard Jones, Adam Zindani and Jamie Morrison \u2013 have recorded 12 studio albums in total, seven of which have reached number one in the UK charts previously.\n\nPerformance And Cocktails, 1999, Just Enough Education To Perform, 2001, You Gotta Go There To Come Back, 2003, Language Sex Violence Other, 2005, Pull The Pin, 2007, Keep The Village Alive, 2015 and Kind, 2019, all reached number one in the official charts.\n\nThere are three new entries for the top five UK charts this week, including rock band Marillion who are sat at number two with their 20th studio album, An Hour Before It\u2019s Dark, which is also likely to be their highest-charting since their 2004 album, You\u2019re Gone.\n\n(Lia Toby/PA)\n\nThe 20-year anniversary remastered edition of The Coral\u2019s eponymous debut, which was first released in 2002, is also set to re-enter the charts at number three.\n\nIt includes the original tracks plus some previously unreleased songs, and if its current trajectory continues, it could beat its previously highest held slot of number five.\n\nEd Sheeran has maintained a position in the top five, at number four with his album Equals, and Tears For Fears are at number five with The Tipping Point, which missed out on the top spot last week after rapper Central Cee got a late surge with his second record, 23.\n\nWe need your consent to load this Social Media content.

The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Richard Jones (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums, percussion) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992\u20132003) and then Javier Weyler (2004\u20132012) on drums. Stereophonics have released ten studio albums, including six UK number one albums. Their latest album is Scream Above the Sounds (2017). A successful compilation album, Decade in the Sun, was released in November 2008 and charted at number two in the United Kingdom.\n\nDescribed as \"classic UK rock delivered with whiskey vocals\"[8], the band have been summarised as possessing a sound akin to the genres of alternative rock and \"British traditional rock\".[9] Stereophonics' debut album, Word Gets Around, was released in August 1997 and charted at number six in the UK, aided by the singles \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" and \"A Thousand Trees\". The band reached mainstream success with the release of Performance and Cocktails (and its promotional singles \"The Bartender and the Thief\", \"Just Looking\" and \"Pick a Part That's New\") in 1999 and have achieved a total of ten top-ten singles as well as one number one: \"Dakota\" (2005). Having sold around 10 million copies worldwide,[10][11] Stereophonics are one of the most successful Welsh rock acts. Upon their release of Pull the Pin, they became the eighth group to achieve five consecutive UK number one albums (after the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, ABBA, Genesis, Oasis, Blur and U2).\n\nThe band have also been praised for their live performances, which have landed them headlining slots at many of the UK and Ireland's most high-profile music festivals, including Reading and Leeds in 2000, Glastonbury in 2002, V festival in 2002, the Isle of Wight in 2004 and 2009, and Oxegen in 2010. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation and early years (1986\u20131991)\n\nKelly Jones and Stuart Cable lived on the same street[12] in the Welsh village of Cwmaman.[13] Jones heard Cable played drums so asked if he wanted to jam together.[14] After some time practising in Jones' dad's garage, Nicholas Geek joined in on guitar. Later,[b] Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and keyboards, respectively.[15] Cable recalls he was the one who suggested that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported Roy Orbison.[15] In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name \"Zephyr\". When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways.[12] Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R&B band called \"Silent Runner\" while Cable joined a glam-rock band named \"King Catwalk\" on drums.[16]\n\nA few years later,[b] Cable got sacked from the band and a few weeks after that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who was standing at a bus stop and waved back.[17] It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush.[18] They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed.[18] The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.[19]\n\nEverett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend Richard Jones to fill in for Everett.[19] Stunned by Richard's appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett.[19] The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in, but didn't stay in the band; he did, however, become Kelly's guitar technician.[20] The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde.[21] Neither stayed for long. Hyde did however play harmonica on \"Rooftop\" for the band's 2001 album Just Enough Education to Perform.[21] After Hyde left, the band stuck as a three-piece act.[21]\n\nName change and V2 Records (1992\u20131996)\n\nKelly, Richard and Cable began writing and performing music in working men's clubs together in 1992 as a band known as \"Tragic Love Company\", a name inspired by their favourite bands (the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company).[22] After Tragic Love Company supported Smalltown Heroes in the Borderline Club, London, they met Marshall Bird and Steve Bush who were interested in producing for the band. The band agreed and recorded a demo for \"A Thousand Trees\".[23]\n\nWayne Coleman organised a series of concerts throughout South Wales, he was sent a demo from the band. Wayne liked it a lot but hated the band name and told them they wouldn't be performing unless they changed it.[24] After Cable read the manufacturer name of a gramophone, \"Falcon Stereophonic\", he told Kelly and the band agreed to change their name to \"the Stereophonics\".[25] In March 1996, the band played a gig at their local Coliseum Theatre, Aberdare with Catatonia and the Pocket Devils.[25] When the band finished their slot, John Brand approached them and he became their manager.[26] Brand managed to get over 35 record companies in the UK interested in signing the Stereophonics.[27] In May 1996, they signed with V2,[28] the first artists to be signed to newly formed record label.[29] Upon signing, they dropped \"the\" from their name and simply became \"Stereophonics\".\n\nDebut album and ascent to fame (1997\u20132000)\n\nIn August 1997, the band released their first studio album, Word Gets Around, which reached number six in the UK charts, from which five singles were released. Afterwards, the band embarked on a successful world tour.\n\nIn February 1998, the band received a BRIT Award for Best New Group. In the same week, the band re-released the single \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", which in turn reached number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart. The band's debut album, Word Gets Around, also went gold in the UK.\n\nIn November 1998, \"The Bartender and the Thief\" (the first single from the album Performance and Cocktails) was released, eventually reaching number three on the UK charts. \"Just Looking\" was released next and reached number four in March 1999. In that same month, the album was released, entering at number one and going platinum within three weeks. Later that year, the band played in front of 50,000 people at Morfa Stadium in Swansea. The concert was filmed and released on DVD the following year. They also collaborated with Tom Jones on a cover of the Randy Newman song \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\", for the Tom Jones album Reload.\n\nThroughout 1998 and 1999, the band toured in Europe, Australia and the US. On 12 June 1998, Stereophonics played to over 10,000 spectators in the grounds of Cardiff Castle in Wales. Footage of the concert was released on VHS and DVD, titled Live at Cardiff Castle.\n\nMainstream success (2001\u20132004)\n\nThe band released their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform, in April 2001. The album included the track \"Mr. Writer\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \"Have a Nice Day\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, Just Enough Education to Perform, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called A Day at the Races. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.\n\n2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled You Gotta Go There to Come Back. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \"Cable TV\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler.[30] Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with Rip It Up magazine, Kelly Jones admitted to the difficulty of the situation.[31]\n\nTowards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a live version of \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003\u20132004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.\n\nDrummer change and Stuart Cable's death (2005\u20132010)\n\nTheir fifth studio album, Language. Sex. Violence. Other? was released in March 2005. It marked their first recording with new drummer Javier Weyler. The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album's first single, \"Dakota\". The second single from the album was \"Superman\". However, that song did not repeat the success of \"Dakota\", peaking at number thirteen. After \"Superman\" came \"Devil\", featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a Pop Factory award at the end of the year, losing out to Feeder's Pushing the Senses.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support Oasis for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics' first live album, Live from Dakota. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band's albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled \"Jayne\", later released as part of Kelly Jones' solo album, Only the Names Have Been Changed.\n\nPull the Pin was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; \"Bank Holiday Monday\". The track was also available for free to people who pre-ordered tickets for the band's concerts in 2007. The album was written and recorded by November 2006 but held back for release until late 2007.[32] \"It Means Nothing\" was the first single of the album, released in September before the LP was released a week later on 15 October. The album contains twelve songs and reached number one in the UK's official album chart. The next single, \"My Friends\", reached number thirty-two in the UK charts, their poorest chart performance since \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" from their debut album.\n\nOn 20 May 2007, at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston, the band were joined on stage by Casino frontman Adam Zindani. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the Pull the Pin tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He has been credited for writing and performing on two of the band's new tracks, \"You're My Star\" and \"My Own Worst Enemy\". On \"You're My Star\", he sings backing vocals and plays lead guitar, whereas on \"My Own Worst Enemy\" he only plays lead guitar. In November 2008, Stereophonics released their first greatest hits compilation, Decade in the Sun.\n\nOn 8 December 2009, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games announced the line up for performers for the nightly Victory Ceremonies.[33] These ceremonies included 30 minutes of entertainment from the evening's host province/territory, 30 minutes of medal presentations, and a one-hour performance by a musical talent. Stereophonics performed their song \"I Got Your Number\" at this event on 20 February - Yukon Night. The band's seventh album, titled Keep Calm and Carry On, was released on 16 November 2009. They decided on this name after seeing a poster in the White Horse pub in Richmond where they spent a lot of time whilst recording the album.[34] The album's debut single was \"Innocent\".[35] The second single from the album, \"Could You Be the One?\", was released on 15 February 2010. The band embarked on a seven-date tour to support the new album in March 2010 playing at Aberdeen, Newcastle, Glasgow, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and London.[34] with support from Glasgow band Hip Parade.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium with support from unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic, followed by Kids in Glass Houses and Doves. The concert, known as \"Summer in the City\", was played to a sold-out audience of 30,000. Two days later, original drummer Stuart Cable was found dead in his home in Aberdare having choked on his own vomit after binge drinking.[36] After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded, and their contract with Universal at an end, Kelly Jones wanted to change the way the band works and so decided to take a break from writing and recording an album every two years.[37]\n\nGraffiti on the Train, Keep the Village Alive and Scream Above the Sounds (2011\u2013present)\n\nOn 3 March 2011, Stereophonics announced on their Facebook page that they were working on new music in the studio.[38] In July 2012 it was announced that Weyler and the band had parted company. The announcement was made on the band's Facebook page, though no reason was given for his departure.[39] It was announced on 24 September 2012 that Jamie Morrison, former drummer for Noisettes, had replaced Weyler in the band.[40] On 8 October 2012, Stereophonics released the video to a track titled \"Violins and Tambourines\" from the upcoming album.[41] On 4 November, the first single from the new album, \"In a Moment\", was released as a free download from the band's website.[42] On the same day, NME.com reported that the album would be titled Graffiti on the Train.[43] The album was released on 4 March 2013.[44] Second single preceding the album, \"Indian Summer\" was released in January 2013; by 10 March it had peaked at number 30 in the UK, making it their group's first UK top-40 single since 2007. A third single, the album's title track, was released on 13 May.[45]\n\nIn late September 2014, it was announced via their Twitter page that a new album has been mixed and that it should be released in 2015.[46] On 21 March 2015, Stereophonics performed in Bristol and in London's Royal Albert Hall and debuted 3 new songs \"C'est La Vie\", \"I Wanna Get Lost With You\" and \"Song for the Summer\" which are to be on their 9th album Keep the Village Alive with the release date of 11 September. \"C'est la Vie\" was released as the first single of the album. [47] In September 2015 the band appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland.[48] During the Keep the Summer Alive Tour, Kelly Jones announced he would like to release the band's tenth studio album \"before next summer\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Word Gets Around, rather than release a compilation album.[49][50]\n\nOn 27 July 2017 the band announced Scream Above the Sounds as the title for the album and will be released on 27 October 2017. It became available to pre-order on the same day. The band released \"All In One Night\" on the same day as the lead single from it. On 4 September 2017 \"Caught By The Wind\" was released as the second single from the album followed by \"What's All The Fuss About?\" as the third single on 4 December 2017. They will embark on a tour in 2018\n\nOther projects\n\nOn 9 October 2007, a retrospective DVD was released in the United States, Rewind: The First 10 Years. The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the You Gotta Go There to Come Back album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones' hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band's fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the Language.Sex.Violence.Other? DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, Pull the Pin.\n\nIn 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled Only the Names Have Been Changed, while recording the band's sixth studio album, Pull the Pin. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song \"Jayne\", a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album Live from Dakota and the Rewind DVD.\n\nStereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series Long Way Round. The song's lyrics were slightly altered for the follow-up series, Long Way Down.\n\nPersonnel\n\nCurrent members Kelly Jones \u2013 lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards, piano (1992\u2013present)\n\nRichard Jones \u2013 bass, piano, backing vocals (1992\u2013present)\n\nAdam Zindani \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2007\u2013present)\n\nJamie Morrison \u2013 drums (2012\u2013present) Former members Stuart Cable \u2013 drums, percussion (1992\u20132003; died 2010)\n\nJavier Weyler \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals (2004\u20132012) Current touring musicians Tony Kirkham \u2013 keyboards, piano, harmonica, backing vocals (1999\u2013present) Former touring musicians Scott James \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2001\u20132004)\n\nAileen McLaughlin \u2013 backing vocals (2002\u20132003)\n\nAnna Ross \u2013 backing vocals (2002\u20132003)\n\nSteve Gorman \u2013 drums, percussion (2003\u20132004; member of the Black Crowes)\n\nSam Yapp \u2013 drums, percussion (2012; member of Casino)\n\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\n\nWord Gets Around (1997)\n\n(1997) Performance and Cocktails (1999)\n\n(1999) Just Enough Education to Perform (2001)\n\n(2001) You Gotta Go There to Come Back (2003)\n\n(2003) Language.

Keep Calm And Carry On (2009)\n\n\u201cMore catchy and tuneful poppy stuff from everyone\u2019s favorite welsh working class millionaire rock band. Sung, played and produced excellently. Not exactly stretching the boundaries but who cares, just Carry On! Will keep all Stereos\u2019 fans happy, me included. Nice keyboard touches here and there.\u201d\n\n9. Scream Above The Sounds (2017)\n\n\u201cStereophonics have released a sizable amount of alums, but remains one of the most consistent rock bands by managing to great constantly good music with a sprinkle of great songs on each. They are not the most lively or attention grabbing music, but Kelly\u2019s raw lyrics make it some of the best relaxing alt-rock around.\u201d\n\n8. Keep The Village Alive (2015)\n\n\u201cAnother strong album by the Stereophonics, building on their last \u201ccomeback\u201d release, Graffiti On A Train. The whole album rocks along quite nicely, with plenty of foot tappers and head nodders to keep the listener interested. In fact the only bad thing about this record is the cover!\u201d\n\nSee more: Alt-J Albums Ranked\n\n7. You Gotta Go There To Come Back (2003)\n\n\u201cThe best album so far. After three albums music matured from album to album Stereophonics introduced a blend of strong riff pieces like \u201cHelp Me (She\u2019s out of her Mind)\u201d with peaceful subdued \u201cI Miss You Now\u201d. The release include the biggest hit, and the band showcase piece \u201cMaybe Tommorow\u201d. Let\u2019s hope that the band will be able to maintain the current condition for next albums.\u201d\n\n6. Decade In The Sun: Best Of Stereophonics (2008)\n\n\u201cStereophonics are much maligned by the snobbier elements of the music press as well as the general music consuming public. Their sales don\u2019t seem to suffer and perhaps this is part of why they are rarely given any credit.\u201d\n\n5. Graffiti On The Train (2013)\n\n\u201cStereophonics have released a sizable amount of alums, but remains one of the most consistent rock bands by managing to great constantly good music with a sprinkle of great songs on each. They are not the most lively or attention grabbing music, but Kelly\u2019s raw lyrics make it some of the best relaxing alt-rock around.\u201d\n\nSee more: Portugal, The Man Albums Ranked\n\n4. Language. Sex. Violence. Other? (2005)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for another commercial success noticed by Stereophonics. With the single \u201cDakota\u201d, which incidentally became another showcase of the band next to \u201cHave A Nice Day\u201d and \u201cMaybe Tommorow\u201d, the band promoted the album, a little worse than the previous one, but very equal musically. All of the songs on the disc maintain a good level, which was so lacking on the first albums.\u201d\n\n3. Just Enough Education To Perform (2001)\n\n\u201cHow can you not be touched by such a story? Or by the one about the guy that drives \u201ca truck that carries money\u201d and loves his family? Or by the one about the caravan holiday? I really do NOT get the low ratings. Kelly Jones is a great storyteller, and the melodies are so relaxed they actually make me happy. Love this record, a desert island pick without any doubt.\u201d\n\n2. Performance And Cocktails (1999)\n\n\u201cPost Britpop we had the Stereophonics brand of Brit Rock which hit its peak with this record. It\u2019s not just got some good singles but as an album it\u2019s very complete and very consistent as well as being well produced and well put together.
