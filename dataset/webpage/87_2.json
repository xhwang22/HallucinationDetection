Gilles Paradis explains: \"It's a matter of discipline and cohesiveness between the troops. Imagine, for instance, you send 10 soldiers in the field on patrol, and it's a very dangerous mission. The [commanding officer] is a a sergeant and he has a relationship with one his female soldiers, and he has to send someone ahead on a dangerous path where you could find some explosive device, and he never chooses that person. He always sends someone else. What would be the impact amongst his 10 soldiers, knowing that there's a personal relationship which has developed between those two. The other soldiers will lose confidence and will come to think that he is protecting his girlfriend.\"\n\nM\u00e9nard was charged with two counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, in violation of the National Defence Act.\n\nOne charge related to an alleged \"intimate personal relationship\" with a corporal under his command; the second charge was for allegedly trying to impede a military police investigation into the affair.\n\nLawyers for M\u00e9nard and the military jointly recommended a reduction in rank to colonel, which is symbolic as he is retired, and a fine of $7,000. On Thursday afternoon, a judge agreed to those penalties.\n\nM\u00e9nard was initially also charged with four counts of obstructing justice, which were withdrawn before Thursday's hearing.\n\nM\u00e9nard apologized to his wife and children when he pleaded guilty at a court martial in Montreal.\n\n\"I was humiliated and lost my reputation in my community,\" he said. \"I deeply regret my conduct.\"\n\nM\u00e9nard served as top officer for Task Force Kandahar beginning in November 2009 but was relieved of duty following allegations that he had a sexual relationship with a subordinate, Master Cpl. Bianka Langlois. His guilty plea came at the start of his military trial.\n\nA former senior military official told CBC News earlier that if M\u00e9nard behaved as alleged, and did so during a mission, he should be punished.\n\nMaster Cpl. Bianka Langlois was charged with violating military fraternization regulations. (Courtesy of Global TV) \"I can probably name a half-dozen generals who have married, divorced and married, junior ranks people and such, so the question of fraternization is a very broad one,\" said Pat Stogran, the former Veterans Ombudsman and a retired Canadian colonel who went on several missions.\n\n\"But in an operational theatre, absolutely no question, it's reprehensible conduct of the highest order and you know he's got no business being in command.\"\n\nM\u00e9nard, who had been based at CFB Valcartier near Quebec City, resigned on Dec. 17, 2010.\n\nLanglois was convicted of one count of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline. She was reprimanded and fined $700.\n\nIn May 2010, M\u00e9nard was fined $3,500 for mishandling a weapon.\n\nHe was handed the fine \u2014 the stiffest fine ever levied on a soldier for this offence \u2014 after pleading guilty to an offence under the National Defence Act in a court in Gatineau, Que.\n\nThe incident occurred as M\u00e9nard and his boss, Gen. Walt Natynczyk, were about to board a Blackhawk helicopter at Kandahar Airfield.\n\nM\u00e9nard said he was loading his C8 carbine, when it went off.

In 2010, he was dismissed from command of Task Force Kandahar in Afghanistan following an affair with a subordinate, and subsequently retired from the military.[2]\n\nHe entered the private sector in 2011 as managing director for Afghanistan with security company GardaWorld. In January 2014 he was arrested in Kabul following licensing issues under Afghanistan's strict regulations for private security contractors, but was released without charges after several weeks.[3] He has since worked as an executive at several Quebec-based companies.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nDaniel M\u00e9nard studied military and international studies at the Canadian Forces College while enlisted.[4] He earned his masters in International Management from the University of Quebec.[4]\n\nMilitary career [ edit ]\n\nM\u00e9nard joined the Canadian Army in 1984. He was initially posted to the 3rd Battalion of the Royal 22nd Regiment as a platoon commander.[2][5] M\u00e9nard served in the United Kingdom, Germany, Haiti, and Bosnia.[2][5] In 2005, as a lieutenant-colonel, he was the commanding officer of a unit stationed at CFB Valcartier in Quebec.[6]\n\nFrom September 2008 to July 2009, he was a colonel in command of the 5th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group.[7] He was promoted to brigadier general later that year at the age of 43, making him one of the youngest general officers in the Canadian Armed Forces at the time.[1][8]\n\nAfghanistan [ edit ]\n\nM\u00e9nard was deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009 as commander of NATO's Joint Task Force Afghanistan and Task Force Kandahar, officially succeeding Brigadier General Jonathan Vance on November 19th.[9][10][11] He was the sixth Canadian and second French Canadian commander of Task Force Afghanistan since Canadian troops were deployed to Afghanistan in 2006.[11] He was initially in charge of 2800 Canadian soldiers, including units from Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, as well as 1200 American troops seconded to Canadian command.[5][12]\n\nBy December 3rd, that had increased to 2000 American troops. At that time, he announced that a unit from the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army would be seconded to Canadian command in Kandahar to assist with stabilizing the city.[13] On December 18th, The Montreal Gazette reported that three American units had been seconded to M\u00e9nard's command, bringing his brigade to a total of 5,800 troops.[14] On January 29th, it was announced that a squadron from the US Army's 71st Cavalry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, would be joining M\u00e9nard's so-called \"super brigade\".[15]\n\nOn March 1, 2010, a car bomb was set off on the Tarnak River Bridge near the city of Kandahar, killing multiple civilians and one American soldier.[8] American war correspondent Michael Yon blamed the Canadian forces for failing to secure the bridge, specifically singling out M\u00e9nard for negligence.[8] The Canadian military denied that it had full responsibility for the bridge and described it as being in \"a messy gray area that has changed hands a few times\".[8]\n\nOn March 25, 2010, M\u00e9nard accidentally fired his C8 carbine rifle as he was boarding a helicopter at Kandahar Air Field, discharging two bullets into the ground.[16] At the time, he was loading the gun and had neglected to switch on the safety.[2][5] He reported the incident and ordered an investigation, which confirmed an accidental discharge had occurred, triggering an automatic court-martial.[5][16] He was found guilty of accidentally discharging his weapon in late May, and was fined $3,500.[5][17]\n\nAffair with subordinate [ edit ]\n\nIn late May 2010, shortly after his accidental discharge conviction, M\u00e9nard was accused of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a subordinate, Master Corporal Bianka Langlois.[17][18] The relationship began in Canada in 2008 and continued after they were deployed to Afghanistan, where it was reportedly an open secret among personnel in Kandahar.[2][19] After Yon blogged about the affair in early 2010, military officials began an internal investigation, as Canadian military regulations forbid sexual relationships during active deployments.[2][19] Evidence of the affair was discovered in the pair's emails, and they were questioned.[2] Langlois admitted the relationship to investigators, although M\u00e9nard pressured her to delete her emails and recant.[20] According to court documents, he \"lied twice about the affair when confronted\".[19]\n\nLieutenant General Marc Lessard, commander of Canada's military abroad, stripped M\u00e9nard of his command of Task Force Kandahar on May 30.[17][18] It was the first time since World War II that a Canadian general had been dismissed on the battlefield.[2] Vance resumed command shortly after M\u00e9nard's removal.[5][21]\n\nM\u00e9nard was charged on July 12, 2010 with four counts: three from the National Defence Act relating to the inappropriate conduct and obstruction of justice, and one from the Criminal Code of Canada relating to obstruction of justice.[18] M\u00e9nard was sent home to Canada and assigned a desk job in Ottawa.[2][22] He resigned from the military effective December 2010.[2][23] On July 21, 2011, he pled guilty to two counts relating to inappropriate conduct; the obstruction charges were dropped.[19] He was fined $7,000 and demoted to the rank of corporal, although his resignation rendered the demotion symbolic.[23] The incident resulted in public debate in Canada about the Canadian military's rules about fraternization as well as workplace relationships in general.[24][25][26]\n\nPrivate sector [ edit ]\n\nGardaWorld [ edit ]\n\nSecurity company GardaWorld hired M\u00e9nard in November 2011 as their managing director for Afghanistan, working out of Afghanistan and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.[2][27] Canada's Department of National Defence paid $40,000 for him to relocate from the Montreal area to the United Arab Emirates to take up the job, under a policy which allows retired members with at least 20 years of service to claim the cost of one post-retirement move.[28]\n\nOn January 10, 2014, M\u00e9nard was arrested in Kabul following a meeting with Afghan officials. He was accused of possessing military equipment \u2013 129 rifles and 148 radios \u2013 without a license.[2] Afghan authorities described the charges as \"gun smuggling,\" but GardaWorld described the situation as an administrative issue relating to licensing for the equipment, as Afghanistan strictly regulates the licensing of military equipment to private military contractors.[2][29][30] M\u00e9nard was kept in a holding facility until he was released without charges on February 19.[3] He departed the country for Dubai shortly after.[31]\n\nSubsequent positions [ edit ]\n\nAfter spending nearly 6 years with GardaWorld, M\u00e9nard resigned in early 2017 to assume the position of chief operations officer with Quebec-based supply chain, Groupe Robert.[32] M\u00e9nard later served as the chief executive officer of Montreal-based security technology company Octasic.[4] As of 2023 , M\u00e9nard is the chief operating and financial officer at Voti Detection, a Montreal-based company which specializes in 3D X-ray security scanning.[33]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nM\u00e9nard is married with two children.[34] His wife was a major in the Canadian Armed Forces.[22]"}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ex-general-daniel-m%C3%A9nard-s-move-to-uae-cost-national-defence-40k-1.2541044", "page_content": "National Defence paid nearly $40,000 to move a disgraced general to the United Arab Emirates after he was court-martialled for having sex with a subordinate and trying to cover it up, expense records for the military's top brass show.\n\nThe revelation about former brigadier-general Daniel M\u00e9nard is in the same set of records that show retired lieutenant-general Andrew Leslie was allowed to claim more than $72,000 for a move within Ottawa after he left the military.\n\nM\u00e9nard, who was relieved in 2010 as combat commander in Kandahar, had already resigned from the military when he pleaded guilty in 2011 to having improper relations with a corporal under his command, and trying to impede an investigation into their affair.\n\nHis name recently reappeared in the headlines after M\u00e9nard was detained in Afghanistan in his current role as an executive for a private security company.\n\nThe Department of National Defence allows a retiring member of the Canadian Forces up to two years to claim a final relocation expense, which is then approved and audited.

His tenure in the country was cut short in 2010 when he was charged with fraternization for having a sexual liaison with a female subordinate.\n\nHe was charged and later pleaded guilty to two counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, in violation of the National Defence Act.\n\nBy the time he was convicted, M\u00e9nard had already left the military, but was symbolically reduced in rank. He was also fined $7,000.\n\nTough rules\n\nAfghanistan has tough rules for private military contractors regarding the possession and use of weapons and other military gear.\n\nIt's those rules \u2013 and the way the Afghan government enforces them \u2013 that Canadian security consultant Alan Bell says could be to blame for M\u00e9nard's detention.\n\nBell's Globe Risk International has done security work in Afghanistan on behalf of clients like the Canadian Foreign Affairs department. In fact, Bell says he once even reported to M\u00e9nard during a stint in Kandahar province.\n\nAfghanistan's rules for private security contractors were toughened significantly several years ago.\n\n\"This was for licensing purposes and for generating revenue for the Afghanistan government,\" Bell said. \"It was also a way of tying a weapon to an individual if that weapon was ever used illegally.\"\n\nIt's happened to a lot of companies. - Alan Bell, security consultant\n\nThat Afghan system's rules require security companies to keep accurate, detailed records of all military equipment uses in Afghanistan including rifles, radios, ballistic helmets and other gear. Bell says those records are sent to Afghanistan's Interior Ministry along with licence fees.\n\nAfghan officials frequently audit security companies to ensure they only have the weapons they have licences to support.\n\nBell says these audits can frequently cause trouble for security companies in Afghanistan, in part because the requirements are onerous, but also because the Afghan system frequently doesn't operate with the same business ethics that Western companies are used to.\n\n\"It's happened to a lot of companies. These people turn up out of the blue and try to audit their weapons and what they have what they don't have,\" Bell said. \"When there is an audit and they find you've got X amount of weapons that haven't been listed or licensed, they take that very seriously.\n\n\"If you get caught, then you have a problem. They will arrest usually the country manager because is the one that is on the ground all the time,\" Bell said.\n\n\"They've arrested a lot of [expatriates] over the years and they fine then, they fine the company. They usually confiscate the equipment that wasn't registered with them, and then you carry on business as normal.\n\n\"Then [Interior Ministry officials] go on to another company and do the same things.\"\n\nIt appears it's a situation similar to this that has M\u00e9nard spending time in jail. GardaWorld does lots of work in Afghanistan, including, at times, for the Canadian government.\n\nIt's also had more than one rules run-in with Afghan authorities.\n\nGardaWorld faced similar problem in 2012\n\nIn 2012, two British employees of GardaWorld were arrested by Afghan authorities and faced similar accusations after being found with 30 allegedly unlicensed AK-47s. At the time, GardaWorld maintained its employees were planning to buy the weapons but wanted to test their functionality on a range first.\n\nGardaWorld also faced a forced shutdown of its operations as a result of those arrests.\n\nThat dispute occurred in the early days of an Afghan government plan to take over and \"Afghanize\" most of the work undertaken by private security contractors in the war-torn country.\n\nBell says these latest accusations levelled against GardaWorld and M\u00e9nard remind him of that 2012 dispute.\n\n\"This is down to hard cash at the end of the day and whether Garda did have equipment that wasn't registered or not,\" Bell said. \"[Garda] obviously had their reason for doing that, now they've been found out so consequently they will have to pay the fines and then it will be business as usual and next week it will be another company.\n\n\"This has happened so many times with so many companies. It isn't rare.\"\n\nCanada's Foreign Affairs Department said it is aware of the arrest, and that \"consular services are being provided to a Canadian citizen who has been detained in Afghanistan.\""}]}
