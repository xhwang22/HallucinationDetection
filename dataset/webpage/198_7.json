I thrived to continue a legacy of innovation and consistently championed for creativity and diversity, in order to always keep Burberry moving forward.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nToday, like most days, the gym-honed 45-year-old \u2013 \u201cI am Leo with a moon ascending Gemini\u201d \u2013 wears a black T-shirt of his own design with TB (Thomas Burberry) logo, black basketball shorts and well-worn, even slightly bobbly, black Nike socks with swoosh. He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother. Rooftops in London are all very well but for Tisci, there\u2019s still no place like home."}, {"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/riccardo-tisci-burberry-ss22-interview", "page_content": "On Wednesday afternoon, a few hours after his Spring 2022 Burberry menswear collection debuted on Instagram, Riccardo Tisci perched in a tented room, the sun pouring in through the windows and the blue skies framing him like an angel at the center of Renaissance fresco. He was beaming, voluble, and overwhelmed with emotion. \u201cOf course, every show is emotional,\u201d he said, \u201cbut sometimes, there is one that has the magic. And this one had the magic. A very strong magic.\u201d\n\nBurberry\u2019s heritage is so iconic it can be almost oppressive: the trench, the plaid, the rain. Tisci\u2019s early collections at the brand, which he joined as chief creative officer in 2018, were sprawling, even overwhelming. \u201cThat was, like, me looking at myself,\u201d he said, \u201ctrying to find myself.\u201d But starting with his Fall 2021 collection, and more profoundly, with the one shown Wednesday, he seems to have found his way. These clothes are extraordinarily Riccardo. \u201cI started feeling much more what I wanted to do,\u201d he said of the past year.\n\nPart of this was evident in his formal inventions for this collection. He has long been thinking, he said, about how Burberry is really a winter brand, known for its outerwear and clothing attuned to the English climate. (Hence the trench.) This presents an obvious challenge for warm-weather designs\u2014one that Tisci seemed to crack this season. Here, he worked with a number of wobbly shapes\u2014\u201cvery cartoony,\u201d he explained\u2014turning one such illustration into a buckled harness top. \u201cI want to make it sexy,\u201d he recalls thinking, \u201cbecause in the summer, everybody wants to be sexy, wants to be naked.\u201d Also new and notable (and sexy!): cargo pants with oversize flaps, a fitted square-neck sleeveless shirt with sheer-paneled pants, and trench coats turned into sleeveless leather jackets. Me-yow, mate!\n\nCourtesy of Burberry. Courtesy of Burberry.\n\nAs Tisci wisely put it, a \u201chalf-naked human is much more near nature.\u201d He said that while he always enjoys attention from celebrities and magazine press, his proudest achievement has been seeing people wearing his clothes in the streets. \u201cSo I\u2019m really waiting to see all these boys wearing these pieces!\u201d\u2014especially that backless halter bib.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become much more sexy, much more summery,\u201d Tisci said of his Burberry. But it\u2019s also become beefier, less stiff, and more wearable. It\u2019s aggressive and vicious, in a way that will please fans who have been in Tisci\u2019s pocket since his years at Givenchy, but will also appeal to those who see and appreciate all that is snarling, chaotic, and sardonic in British culture.\n\nCourtesy of Burberry. Courtesy of Burberry.\n\nThe video was also a personal high for Tisci. \u201cI want to do a dream that\u2019s a rave of freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cBurberry freedom, for everybody in the world, that is about celebrating life\u2014be raw and be real and be young.\u201d Models, covered in face piercings and with freaky hair done by the great stylist Jawara, stalked through a crunchy sand expanse, then burst into dance to the music of the psybient innovators Shpongle, of whom Tisci is a longtime fan. (I was hoping someone would do something really whole hog with their soundtrack this year, and this was that moment.)\n\nFor the legions of Tisci-heads, who appreciate that his tenure at Givenchy presaged the era of streetwear-fueled luxury, this collection will feel like a homecoming. \u201cYou can do a dream,\u201d he says, \u201cbut a dream does not become reality if you are not successful in your dream. I\u2019m celebrating right now. I\u2019m very emotional, because finally we got together with everything.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/workplace-talent/riccardo-tisci-is-the-new-creative-director-of-burberry/", "page_content": "LONDON, United Kingdom \u2014 Burberry has named Riccardo Tisci its new creative officer, effective March 12, 2018. Tisci succeeds Christopher Bailey, who announced his departure in October 2017 after 17 years with the company.\n\nTisci joins the British megabrand after more than a decade as creative director at Givenchy, where he is credited with resurrecting the LVMH-owned couture house with his dark, sensual and subversive collections. The Italian designer left the brand on January 31, 2017 when his contract ended. He was replaced by Clare Waight Keller.\n\nIn his new role, Tisci will be based in London and direct all of Burberry\u2019s collections, presenting his first outing for the brand in September 2018. The announcement sent the company's share price up more than five percent.\n\n\"Riccardo is one of the most talented designers of our time. His designs have an elegance that is contemporary and his skill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today's luxury consumer. Riccardo's creative vision will reinforce the ambitions we have for Burberry and position the brand firmly in luxury,\u201d said Marco Gobetti, Burberry\u2019s chief executive who joined the company on July 5, 2017, from LVMH-owned C\u00e9line.\n\n\"I have an enormous respect for Burberry's British heritage and global appeal and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand,\u201d added Tisci. \u201cI am honoured and delighted to be joining Burberry and reuniting with Marco Gobbetti.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this is not the first time Tisci and Gobbetti have worked together. Gobetti, who was previously president and chief executive at Givenchy from 2004 to 2008, was responsible for hiring the designer, who was then relatively unknown. Tisci breathed much-needed life into Givenchy's womenswear, menswear and accessories.\n\nSince joining Burberry in 2001, Bailey worked with former chief executive Rose Marie Bravo and her successor Angela Ahrendts to save the British stalwart \u2014 best known for its classic, durable trench coats \u2014 from a period of brand dilution.\n\nDuring his tenure, Burberry became a new star of the global luxury industry. By 2011, the company was generating \u00a31.5 billion in revenue \u2014 a 27 percent increase over the previous year \u2014 with a market capitalisation of \u00a35.8 billion. That was twice the rate of growth of LVMH\u2019s revenue and market value over the same period. At the same time, Burberry gained recognition for its digital savvy. But it\u2019s no secret that in recent years Burberry has struggled to maintain its momentum, with the company\u2019s sales growth lagging its peers.\n\nTaking Burberry Upmarket\n\nLast November, Gobbetti outlined an ambitious three-pronged plan to elevate the British brand's positioning, placing the label \"firmly in the luxury segment, the most enduring and rewarding part of the industry.\" As part of the strategy, Gobbetti plans to enhance the brand's leather goods offering, bring greater newness to its collections, tighten distribution by scaling back its lower-end wholesale partnerships, refresh stores and use its reputation as a digital innovator to better communicate its new product offering.\n\n\u201cBy re-energising our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market,\u201d Gobbetti said in a statement that coincided with the announcement of first-half results for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nBurberry is betting that Tisci's expertise in elevating casual wear to high-fashion status will increase the label's relevancy amongst luxury consumers, according to a source close to the brand. (Burberry has already entered the streetwear category with conviction, unveiling a partnership with skater-inspired label Gosha Rubchinskiy for Spring/Summer 2018.) It's a strategy with validity: High-end streetwear helped boost global sales of luxury personal goods by 5 percent this year to an estimated \u20ac263 billion, and the sector is projected to grow 5 percent through 2020, according to a report from consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n\"The contemporary street style orientation of Riccardo Tisci is a great match to relaunch the image of Burberry,\" wrote Mario Ortelli, senior analyst of luxury goods at Stanford C. Bernstein, in a note. \"We believe that Burberry's management will try to emulate the action plan of Gucci.\" This includes the clearance of previous collections in the next two to three quarters; launching new campaigns and initiatives; presenting an impactful and bold collection at London Fashion Week in September; extend the new style to other product lines and lowering price points to reach a wider consumer base; and renewing the store network progressively.\n\nThe main questions now, said Ortelli, are whether Tisci\u2019s style will resonate among industry insiders and opinion makers, and if Burberry\u2019s management will be able to manage the pace of its new action plan. \u201cA star designer like Riccardo can have demanding requests about the new store format and the timing to deploy it,\u201d he added.\n\nFinancial analysts were tough on Gobbetti when he presented Burberry's third-quarter results in January 2018. Retail revenue was \u00a3719 million in the three months to December 31, 2017, down from \u00a3735 million in the same period in 2016. The company said retail revenue was up 1 percent on an underlying basis, while comparable store sales rose 2 percent, below analysts' expectations.\n\nComparable store sales grew by a mid-single figure percentage in Asia Pacific and mainland China, and by a low single digit in the Americas. However, they fell by a low single figure in its Europe division, hurt by a larger fall in the UK.\n\nTisci left his hometown of Taranto in southern Italy to study at Central Saint Martins in London, graduating in 1999. In September 2004, he set up an eponymous ready-to-wear label, showing his first collection in Milan for the Autumn/Winter 2005 season.

He has enhanced our creative language, modernised and elevated our product offer and brought a new generation of luxury customers to our brand. On behalf of everyone at Burberry, I would like to thank him for his creative leadership and wish him the very best for the future.\u201d\n\nUpon announcing his departure, Tisci left the company and the public with a statement of gratitude for his time as Chief Creative Director:\n\n\u201cBurberry is a very special place with a magical past and a very promising future.

Tisci first joined Burberry in 2018 as then chief creative officer Christopher Bailey's successor, following a successful stint at Givenchy \u2013 where the designer spent 12 years in the top job and honed his dark and gothic creative vision, producing seasonal collections with sporty, sell-out appeal that caught the gaze of Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Madonna and Rihanna. While there is no word if Tisci will go to another brand, his successor has already been announced. Daniel Lee, the buzzy British name who is best known for transforming the fortunes of Italian label Bottega Veneta in recent years, has been announced as the newly-appointed Chief Creative Officer of the brand.\n\nAt Burberry, Tisci also brought his star power to the brand \u2013 the likes of Naomi Campbell, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Irina Shayk became regulars on the catwalk since his first show for Spring/Summer 2019. But it wasn't just celebrity friends that he brought to Britain's most famous designer label \u2013 under his tenor Burberry had a total revamp and its long-standing logo was replaced with a boxy, Helvetica one designed by art director and graphic designer Peter Saville.\n\nAdditionally, Tisci introduced a new monogram, which was a riff on Thomas Burberry's initials and was implemented across bags, T-shirts, trainers and outerwear. Meanwhile, the designer, while still producing the core pieces that have shaped Burberry's heritage such as gabardine trench coats and tailored-to-perfection suiting, brought that aforementioned gothic glamour to the brand that historically erred on the side of being whimsical. Case in point: in Tisci's Spring/Summer 2023 collection, which is his last and was unveiled on Monday, there were lace gloves and corset-like bodices, trenches were cinched at the waist, the iconic Burbs check was given a deep rust-hued wash and the final men's look comprised a midnight black double-breasted suit.\n\n\u201cThe chapter I was asked to write in its long story is one that I am incredibly proud of and one I have decided would culminate with my show on Monday,\" Tisci said this morning. \"I thrived to continue a legacy of innovation, and consistently championed for creativity and diversity, in order to always keep Burberry moving forward.

Kim Kardashian West Instagram\n\nGivenchy did not provide any timelines for naming a successor and declined all comment on potential candidates.\n\nTisci\u2019s exit is the latest tremor as creative upheaval spreads through the top ranks of international fashion.\n\nOver the past year, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino, Marni, Lanvin, Chlo\u00e9, Jil Sander, Ermenegildo Zegna, Roberto Cavalli, Oscar de la Renta, Salvatore Ferragamo and Carven have all made changes in creative leadership.\n\nAs Givenchy draws up its list of potential candidates, it could draw on such well-known designers on the market as Hedi Slimane, Alber Elbaz, Peter Dundas, Clare Waight Keller, Rodolfo Paglialunga and Peter Copping. Buzzy designers like Balmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing could also be on its radar.\n\nIn a statement, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Givenchy\u2019s parent, lauded Tisci\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThe chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the house of Givenchy over the last 12 years represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution to the house\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Tisci said, \u201cI have very special affection for the House of Givenchy and its beautiful teams. I want to thank the LVMH Group and Monsieur Bernard Arnault for giving me the platform to express my creativity over the years. I now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions.\u201d\n\nJeweled everything at Givenchy\u2019s spring 2012 couture show. Penske Med/REX/Shutterstock\n\nA bundle of creative energy forever shod in Nike sneakers, Tisci was a daring, uncharacteristic hire for LVMH, which has a track record of casting media stars to helm its fashion brands, which also include Fendi, C\u00e9line, Kenzo, Loewe and Pucci.\n\nTisci was relatively unknown, and just 30, when he was recruited by then Givenchy ceo Marco Gobbetti, who is to assume the management helm of Burberry later this year.\n\nTisci succeeded a string of designers who, to varying degrees, encountered some bumps on the road to brand rejuvenation following the 1995 retirement of founder Hubert de Givenchy.\n\nAfter a brief stint by John Galliano, who moved on to Dior, Alexander McQueen tried his hand. But his eclectic collections \u2014 space aliens one season, rockabilly the next \u2014 failed to galvanize the house. Next up was Julien Macdonald, who went back to a style rooted in French elegance and sophistication, but did not win much acclaim.\n\nTisci brought stability \u2014 and heat \u2014 to the storied name, immediately making inroads with the world\u2019s leading specialty stores and spawning a series of hit leather goods, kicking off with the Nightingale bag.\n\nHe took on design duties for men\u2019s wear three years later, and helped ignite the streetwear trend with his T-shirts printed with snarling Rottweilers or big stars, among his fetish motifs.\n\nSetting a daring template informed by the energy of the club scene and tinged with sexual provocation, Tisci quickly became one of men\u2019s wear\u2019s most influential and original designers.\n\nHe had recently expressed a desire to extend Givenchy\u2019s reach as a lifestyle brand, having introduced a range of clothes for babies and children that is slated for July delivery.\n\nAccording to market sources, Givenchy increased more than sixfold in size during the Tisci era, and the brand\u2019s revenues are now north of 500 million euros, or $540 million at current exchange. The number of employees has risen to more than 930 from 290 in 2005.\n\nPhilippe Fortunato, ceo of Givenchy, has been spearheading its recent expansion thrust and credited Tisci\u2019s \u201cvisionary qualities that led to a strong growth of the brand.\u201d\n\nFueled by Tisci\u2019s design chops, powerful communication skills and clutch of A-list celebrity friends, the brand has been tracking strong sales momentum and profitability, sources said. Once dependent on wholesale, Givenchy continues its retail rollout, with a Rome boutique slated to open this year and a London flagship in the works for early 2018.\n\nMore: Riccardo Tisci\u2019s Givenchy Gang: Celebrity Squad Pictures\n\nThe company also recently took over direct distribution of its collections in two key luxury markets: Dubai and Singapore.\n\nGivenchy today boasts 72 freestanding stores, compared to only seven in 2005 when Tisci arrived.\n\nSomething of a fashion wunderkind, Tisci grew up poor in Taranto, Italy, and Como during the boom years for Versace, Armani and Valentino.\n\nAt 16, fresh out of art school, he landed a job designing fabrics for an Italian textile firm, at which point his destiny became clear. A year later, he was at Central Saint Martins and earning British scholarships that allowed him to finish his degree.\n\nHis first work experiences were in Italy, with Stefano Guerrero, Antonio Berardi, Coccapani and Ruffo Research, while he nurtured his signature label with a strong following in London. When Ruffo went bankrupt, he went soul-searching in India, gathered up his strength and returned to Milan and staged a show that would all but seal his employment contract at Givenchy.\n\nTisci, a friend of Madonna\u2019s, has designed looks for the singer\u2019s tours and other events. Here is the duo at 2016\u2019s Met Gala, outfitted in Givenchy. David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOnce installed at the couture house, he brought a dark, Goth-tinged fierceness and severity, which he ultimately married to more romantic inclinations, clashing together such disparate influences as Victorian dressing and chola culture to produce runway fireworks.\n\nTisci would seem a natural for Versace, given his penchant for bold prints, demonstrative hardware and tough chic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mature, and I\u2019m different, but I was born a daring designer and I\u2019m going to die as a daring designer. That is me,\u201d he told WWD last year.\n\nAs reported, Versace is rethinking the timing of its initial public offering as it embarks on a significant expansion plan ahead of a listing.\n\nAsked on Jan. 19 about Tisci\u2019s potential arrival at the company, a spokesman said, \u201cDonatella Versace is the creative director of the company and at this time we do not have any plans to change that. Beyond that, of course, we do not comment on rumors.\u201d\n\nWere Donatella Versace to welcome a designer of Tisci\u2019s stature, it would be in line with her past efforts to champion young talent. Versace tapped Christopher Kane in 2009 to help relaunch the Versus line and, when the two parted ways, she forged a new path for the brand, developing it into a seasonless line with a strong digital component, with the intention of working with young designers with a fresh approach. In 2013, she tapped Anthony Vaccarello as a guest designer for Versus, and then named him its creative director until he departed to join Saint Laurent.\n\nTo be sure, a leading designer such as Tisci would ramp up the brand\u2019s \u201ccool factor,\u201d social media reach and appeal. The designer boasts 1.8 million followers on Instagram.\n\nTisci posted on his account following the news that he was leaving Givenchy: \u201cA giant heartfelt thank you to #givenchy, #lvmh, my incredible team, the magical atelier and everyone who made these 93 collections possible and all the other crazy adventures. Your love and support, in the day and in the night, will forever remain in my heart. #love #givenchy #forever\u201d\n\nWhen Donatella Versace appeared in the Givenchy ads, Tisci told WWD: \u201cThere\u2019s no jealousy and no competition between us. It\u2019s a real, pure friendship: Somebody who\u2019s part of my gang, part of my family. We want to give a message of friendship and love.\u201d\n\nMore: Riccardo Tisci\u2019s Most Memorable Givenchy Campaigns: A Look Back\n\nAt that time, Versace echoed the sentiment, and gave a resounding endorsement to her Paris-based counterpart: \u201cRiccardo Tisci is extremely talented and, above all, my dear friend. We are family. I want to get rid of the old system, work together, support each other and make fashion a true global community.\u201d\n\nThe Blackstone Group bought a 20 percent stake in Versace in 2014. Family members hold the rest of the equity.\n\nVersace\u2019s own stores are increasingly becoming the engine behind the brand\u2019s growth, as shown by its performance in 2015, when retail sales were up 28.9 percent to 400.7 million euros, or $440.7 million.\n\nIn 2015, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 19.9 percent to 81 million euros, or $89.1 million. The Milan-based group saw revenues increase 17.5 percent to 645 million euros, or $709.5 million.\n\nDollar figures were converted from the euro at average exchange rates for the periods in question."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/t-magazine/fashion/riccardo-tisci-givenchy-quit-highlights.html", "page_content": "2) He Was Something of a Red-Carpet Whisperer\n\nTisci\u2019s designs became practically synonymous with award shows, galas \u2014 or, really, wherever a celebrity was wearing clothes. He has dressed countless celebrities, including Michelle Obama, Cate Blanchett and Julia Roberts. Madonna sported his designs on red carpets (she wore a design with no derri\u00e8re to the Met Gala), at her concerts (Tisci created pieces for her 2008 \u201cSticky & Sweet\u201d tour) as well as at the Super Bowl (he outfitted her for her 2012 performance, above center). Beyonc\u00e9 wore his designs to the Met Gala for five years in a row, most notably a dress made entirely out of latex (above left) last year.

(She has also thrived outside the walls of the French fashion house, becoming the first transgender face of Redken and even appearing on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show.\u201d) Tisci championed untraditional ideas of beauty across the board \u2014 booking the albino model Stephen Thompson and countless androgynous talents."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/fashion/burberry-riccardo-tisci.html", "page_content": "After months of speculation, Burberry has named Riccardo Tisci as its new chief creative officer. He will be responsible for all of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s wear collections and accessories as the brand looks for a turnaround in fortunes after several years of stagnant sales.\n\nMr. Tisci, who was creative director at Givenchy from 2005 to 2017, will replace Christopher Bailey, who ended 17 years at Burberry\u2019s creative helm with a final runway collection during London Fashion Week last month.\n\nMr. Tisci, 43, a graduate of Central St. Martins in London, will start in the role March 12 and be based at the Burberry headquarters in London. Other names that had been touted for the position \u2014 one of the most powerful in British fashion \u2014 included John Galliano, creative director at Maison Margiela; Kim Jones, former men's creative director at Louis Vuitton; Phoebe Philo, former artistic director at C\u00e9line, and Stuart Vevers, creative director at Coach."}, {"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/burberry-riccardo-tisci-debut", "page_content": "When it was announced earlier this year that Riccardo Tisci would be Burberry\u2019s new creative director, jokes about a new, \u201cgoth\u201d Burberry started pinging around Fashion Twitter. All this because the Italian designer spent the last 12 years remaking the label Givenchy in his own dark, moody image\u2014and, helpfully, reviving its fortunes along the way. A label once known for Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s was now known as one of the vanguards of the haute-streetwear movement. So the real question was: Could Tisci make lightning strike twice? And for a label with an entirely different ethos?\n\nTo raise the stakes even more, this was never sold as a mere designer changeover. After former chief creative officer Christopher Bailey left last year, Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti was brought in to help the entire Burberry brand reposition itself as top-tier luxury powerhouse\u2014to be the kind of label that could compete to compete with French brands like Louis Vuitton and Hermes. That put a massive amount of pressure on Tisci. His job wasn't just to design a collection, but to help usher in a new era for the multi-billion dollar brand, and Britain\u2019s largest. As if to add to all that, Burberry started using the hashtag #NewEra to promote Tisci\u2019s debut.\n\nToday, in London, Tisci unveiled his complete vision for the label, following teases like a revived logo and some pricey graphic T-shirts. But instead of a throwing down of the gauntlet, today felt more like the laying down of a foundation, one on which the designer can build out a more expansive idea of what Burberry is today.\n\nModels on the catwalk during the Burberry London Fashion Week SS19 show held at The South London Mail Centre.

(Photo by Isabel Infantes/PA Images via Getty Images) Isabel Infantes - PA Images\n\nThe men\u2019s designs hewed to a smart two-prong approach, which allowed Tisci to appeal to two sorts of customer. His first round of menswear looks were heavy on tradition: tailoring was at its core (a nod, no doubt, to England\u2019s rich suiting history) layered under some impressive outerwear (Burberry\u2019s bread and butter) like paneled anoraks and bombers. Shown in a reserved palette of navy, black, gray and khaki (a nod to the brand's iconic trench coat, the looks were reserved and classic in the best possible sense, a clean, sharp, and familiar aesthetic to the Burberry fan.\n\nLater in the show (which featured more than 100 looks between men\u2019s and women\u2019s), he revealed a sort of second half of the collection, which played to Tisci\u2019s strengths. It had a distinctly streetwear vibe, with looser silhouettes, street style-worthy prints (cheetah prints, and signature Tisci graphics), a palette that included mint green and peach, and lots of workwear-meets-atheticwear pieces. This isn't necessarily for Burberry fans. Instead, this is the stuff that Tisci fans, of which there are many, will not only recognize, but will want to purchase.\n\nAnd Tisci, who has proven that he\u2019s able to intuit what people want many times before, knew that people would want the new Burberry right away. So he delivered: a \u201cdrop\u201d system has been implemented and pieces, like a mesh bomber with Burberry written across the back, are already available to purchase on Instagram."}]}
