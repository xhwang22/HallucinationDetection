{"Torry Castellano started playing drums at the age of 11.": [{"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/musicradar-podcast-torry-castellano-142129", "page_content": "Since forming in 1993 to perform for an eighth-grade lunchtime talent show, The Donnas (Brett Anderson, vocals; Maya Ford, bass; Allison Robertson, guitar; and Torry Castellano, drums) have been handing it back to the boys big-time with their kick-ass, let's-party brand of rock and roll.\n\nBig breaks came easy for the California-based band. Before they graduated high school, they had toured Japan. A deal with Lookout! Records led to the band signing to Atlantic in 2001. Albums such as 2002's Spend The Night and 2004's Gold Medal garnered critical raves and won the band fans at all points on the globe, but not enough of them to maintain a major-label deal. Unbowed, The Donnas formed their own Purple Feather Records label, and in 2007 released their most bracing album yet, Bitchin'.\n\nThrough it all, the driving force behind The Donnas is Torry Castellano. The petite powerhouse rocks her Pearl kit with an almost tectonic force. Perhaps the reason she plays with such passion is the fact that she's lucky to be playing at all: In 2003 an acute case of wrist tendinitis (caused by holding her sticks wrong) almost ended her musical career. But through surgery, physical therapy, and a new approach to drumming, Castellano is back on the throne, and better than she's ever been.\n\nMusicRadar caught up with Torry Castellano backstage for a podcast interview before a recent Donnas show in New York City. Listen to the podcast below, and there's more information on The Donnas' official website.\n\nPart one - Torry discusses the band's formation, growing pains, and being tagged as 'punk.'\n\nPart two - She talks about maturing musically, her almost career-ending tendinitis, and future plans."}, {"url": "https://www.moderndrummer.com/2008/01/torry-castellano-2/", "page_content": "Torry Castellano: The Grip Of Death\n\nAlthough Donnas drummer Torry Castellano still encourages the idea of being a self-taught musician, she\u2019s quick to admit that she had to learn the hard way that improper technique can cause serious problems. A few years ago after a bout with tendinitis rendered Torry out of commission for several months. After touring for over a year on her pop-punk band\u2019s 2002 release, Spend The Night, Castellano\u2019s problems became so severe that she had to undergo surgery and physical rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to physical therapy, they called it \u2018the grip of death,\u2019\u201d Torry recalls. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh no, you do that?\u2019 But it all ended up being really good. I learned a different technique, and I think I\u2019m a better drummer because of it. It\u2019s all about letting the stick do the work. That way you\u2019re not going crazy, holding the stick so tightly that you\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d\n\nBesides applying the new technique, Torry began doing warm-up exercises and reconfigured her four-piece Pearl kit. Since then she\u2019s successfully (read: pain-free) recorded and toured behind two more Donnas albums, including 2004\u2019s Gold Medal and their latest, the arena rock\u2013flavored Bitchin\u2019.\n\nCastellano credits producer Jay Ruston (Meatloaf, Polyphonic Spree) for helping to shape her performance on this latest recording. \u201cHe definitely encouraged that four-on-the-floor type beat,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich was a really good direction because I love that beat. But I was asking, \u2018Should I really put it in more than one song?\u2019 He was like, \u2018It sounds great.\u2019 And when we play those songs live, the rhythm really gets into people.\u201d\n\nWaleed Rashidi"}, {"url": "https://stanfordmag.org/contents/drummer-hits-the-books", "page_content": "When the day arrived last summer for new transfer students to visit Stanford, the sense of anticipation grew. \"I am looking forward to meeting the former rock star,\" an admissions staffer told Sally Mentzer, who coordinates the advising program for transfers.\n\nAs Mentzer notes, that was perfectly accurate, yet someone still could have gotten the wrong impression. To meet Torry Castellano, whose career as a drummer has spanned recording studios, the set of Saturday Night Live and stages in Barcelona, Paris and Tokyo, is to realize how unconcerned she is with popular acclaim.\n\nIn fact, Castellano, '13, was somewhat intimidated by her new surroundings, and she recognized similar feelings among the other 18 transfers. To help cope, she tried to bring them together for karaoke, but then found a better lure: dinner at Mom's. \"Pasta and meatballs,\" explains Castellano. \"About 15 of them were there.\"\n\nMom is a Palo Altan, as was Castellano when she was growing up with the three female friends who became her bandmates, the Donnas. A pop-punk act reminiscent of the Runaways, an all-girl band of the 1970s, the Donnas have been recording and touring since the mid '90s. Plans were announced at the start of the year for a new album, but it will have to be made without Castellano. The victim of uncorrectable shoulder pain from tendonitis and repetitive strain injury, Castellano became one of rock's most youthful retirees last year. She turned 32 in January.\n\nShe didn't surrender her drumsticks easily. But months of rest hadn't worked. Over time, another part of her Los Angeles-based life grew in importance. She had enrolled at Santa Monica College\u2014she took one final online when the band was on tour in Brazil\u2014and began giving serious thought to full-time studies at a university, where she could reinvent herself. She applied to various schools that seemed like reasonable objectives, plus Stanford.\n\n\"I really didn't think I was going to get in,\" says Castellano. \"When I got the acceptance email, I was shaking. And I didn't totally trust it, because it was email. I was crying. I had my mom read it.\"\n\nNo matter how accomplished transfers are before arriving on the Farm\u2014Castellano's contingent includes a former Green Beret, a former radio DJ and a former professional dancer\u2014there's enormous apprehension that comes with entering such an imposing environment. \"That's particularly true,\" says Mentzer, \"if they are transferring from a community or junior college,\" as Castellano did.\n\nWith the Donnas (www.thedonnas.com), Castellano shared a juicy image: \"Pabst-swilling, sex-crazed party animals\" was how a Los Angeles Times writer once distilled it. In reality, the article went on to disclose, they appeared to be \"just regular girls\" who liked iced tea, candy and watching TV.\n\nLooking back, Castellano says, \"There have been many crazy nights, many crazy tours. I don't want to kill the fantasy image of rock 'n' roll life. But there's also a lot of work that goes into being successful, and I was always involved in the business decisions.\"\n\nThe fall quarter at Stanford was partly about solitary nights of keeping up with assignments. But the rest of the experience, in class or almost any conversation on campus, played to her like an intellectual concert. \"Politics, or religion, or philosophy. Everything!\" Her first set of grades: an A and two A-minuses.\n\nBy winter quarter, she had declared a major in political science. That made sense, she said, because she now is thinking ahead\u2014drum roll, please\u2014about possibly applying to law school."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/torry-castellano/", "page_content": "Torrance Heather \"Torry\" Castellano (born January 8, 1979, in San Francisco, California) is the former drummer of The Donnas, announcing her retirement in July 2010.\n\nShe met future bandmates Maya Ford, Brett Anderson and Allison Robertson in junior high school. They formed a band in 8th grade called Ragady Anne, later calling themselves The Electrocutes at Palo Alto High School.\n\nBefore the release of The Donnas' album Gold Medal, Castellano developed tendonitis.

MTV has stated that the band offers \"a good old-fashioned rock & roll party\". After gathering a cult following in the punk scene since their 1997 debut, the band achieved major label commercial success in the early 2000s and afterward as their music mixed punk, metal and classic rock sounds.

Specifically, I was watching Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart's faux romance evolve into something real in Drive Me Crazy, when Grenier flexes by taking Hart to see The Electrocutes\u2014which is essentially the band The Donnas were before they made The Donnas their primary concern. Decked ou in their (very 90s) glitter tops, their give-a-fuck Riot Grrrl informed attitude palpable in every hair flick and riff. Grenier's love for the band showed off his rebellious qualities and made him a brooding bad boy you wanted to whisk you off to a show. (The band later appeared on Charmed too).\n\nNoisey: How did you come up with the name The Donnas? Brett Anderson: It was rearranging the McDonald's logo. It's pretty random.We had actually started in 1993 when we were in middle school. We were in two bands: The Electrocutes and The Donnas.\n\nAfter seeing the film, I took a deep dive into The Donnas discography. It was 1999, and the band had released three albums since forming in 1993, but it was enough to get me started. The Donnas were badass young women whose aesthetic was a studied blend of The Ramones and The Runaways, while their lyrics were thrillingly, unabashedly brazen, introducing me to slang terms for doing drugs (\"Everybody's Smoking Cheeba\") and plotting to kill a crush's girlfriend (\"Get Rid Of That Girl\"). Best known for 2002's Spend the Nightvia Atlantic Records\u2014and the still seminal bossy pop of \"Take It Off\" \u2014The Donnas self-titled debut LP was full of lo-fi melodies and three chord anthems, mixing sassy teenage rebellion with a punk snarl. With no single song clocking over three minutes it's the the kind of music perfect for playing on your walkman as you snuck out of your parents' house for a night on the town. This year their debut celebrates its 20th anniversary. Since The Donnas' last show in 2012, lead singer Brett Anderson has been studying at Stanford, playing in a band called The Stripminers, and working on her own music (she's recently signed a publishing deal). We caught up with her to discuss The Donnas' oft overlooked debut, 9/11, downloading, and what it was like having two different band identities.\n\nWhat were you guys listening to when you made your self-titled debut LP? The influences for that LP were the Ramones. For The Electrocutes, it was like Free Kitten, all the Riot grrrl stuff, Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, L7, Sonic Youth, Faith No More, Metallica, KISS, Poison, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and David Lee Roth. We were all over the place.\n\nWere you spearheading the songwriting effort, or was it more collaborative? Yeah, it was definitely always collaborative. We always wrote from a group perspective. We called ourselves the \"Fun Generation.\" Whenever I wrote lyrics, I would try to focus on something that represented all four of us. When someone else would write lyrics, I always tried to be really open to trying to make it a group identity.\n\nWait, so you guys were really The Electrocutes? So the Drive Me Crazy director didn't make that up? Yeah! The director used our other band's name. He was a fan of our band and was like \"wouldn't it be cool if we used your secret name?\" We have a record out as The Electrocutes called Steal Your Lunch Money. When we put out the black and white The Donnas record, we were still doing The Electrocutes. The Donnas were more Ramones-style punk rock, and The Electrocutes were more thrashy. We were really into Sonic Youth. We actually played at Stanford on the radio station as The Donnas and then we left and The Electrocutes played. The Electrocutes was our real band, and The Donnas was our side project. People really started liking The Donnas, so we ended up merging the bands together. American Teenage Rock 'n' Roll Machine was really when our bands were merged together. I think the music changed a lot by that record.\n\nWhat were your favorite songs to write and perform on the black and white record?\n\nAt that time, we were writing with producer Darin [Raffaelli]. That record almost feels like oldies to me. I love oldies. \"Let's Rab\" and \"Let's Go Mano\" were songs we wrote with Darin. \"Rab\" is a word our friend at school used to say, so we made it into a slang word for that song. \"Mano\" was a made-up slang word too. \"Last Chance Dance\" was interesting because the intro of the song is our 8th grade geometry teacher who was actually giving a real-life announcement. I can't remember if we wrote that song because of the dance or if it was a coincidence. I just remember Allison asking if we could use it for the song.\n\nDid you start to find success from your self-titled record, or did that start happening with Spend the Night ?\n\nThis record feels obscure to me still. I felt like no one knew who we were really yet. I do remember \"Huff All Night\" was one of my favorite songs. It was really fun to play, and it was really fun to write. It was one of the first times that I ever thought about how the melody and chorus structure went together."}, {"url": "https://drummerszone.com/artists/torry-donna-c-castellano/456/profile/?language=1", "page_content": "Artist biography Torry \"Donna C.\" Castellano\n\nTorry Castellano is best known as Donna C., skinshitter in The Donnas.

Specifically, I was watching Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart's faux romance evolve into something real in Drive Me Crazy, when Grenier flexes by taking Hart to see The Electrocutes\u2014which is essentially the band The Donnas were before they made The Donnas their primary concern. Decked ou in their (very 90s) glitter tops, their give-a-fuck Riot Grrrl informed attitude palpable in every hair flick and riff. Grenier's love for the band showed off his rebellious qualities and made him a brooding bad boy you wanted to whisk you off to a show. (The band later appeared on Charmed too).\n\nNoisey: How did you come up with the name The Donnas? Brett Anderson: It was rearranging the McDonald's logo. It's pretty random.We had actually started in 1993 when we were in middle school. We were in two bands: The Electrocutes and The Donnas.\n\nAfter seeing the film, I took a deep dive into The Donnas discography. It was 1999, and the band had released three albums since forming in 1993, but it was enough to get me started. The Donnas were badass young women whose aesthetic was a studied blend of The Ramones and The Runaways, while their lyrics were thrillingly, unabashedly brazen, introducing me to slang terms for doing drugs (\"Everybody's Smoking Cheeba\") and plotting to kill a crush's girlfriend (\"Get Rid Of That Girl\"). Best known for 2002's Spend the Nightvia Atlantic Records\u2014and the still seminal bossy pop of \"Take It Off\" \u2014The Donnas self-titled debut LP was full of lo-fi melodies and three chord anthems, mixing sassy teenage rebellion with a punk snarl. With no single song clocking over three minutes it's the the kind of music perfect for playing on your walkman as you snuck out of your parents' house for a night on the town. This year their debut celebrates its 20th anniversary. Since The Donnas' last show in 2012, lead singer Brett Anderson has been studying at Stanford, playing in a band called The Stripminers, and working on her own music (she's recently signed a publishing deal). We caught up with her to discuss The Donnas' oft overlooked debut, 9/11, downloading, and what it was like having two different band identities.\n\nWhat were you guys listening to when you made your self-titled debut LP? The influences for that LP were the Ramones. For The Electrocutes, it was like Free Kitten, all the Riot grrrl stuff, Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, L7, Sonic Youth, Faith No More, Metallica, KISS, Poison, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and David Lee Roth. We were all over the place.\n\nWere you spearheading the songwriting effort, or was it more collaborative? Yeah, it was definitely always collaborative. We always wrote from a group perspective. We called ourselves the \"Fun Generation.\" Whenever I wrote lyrics, I would try to focus on something that represented all four of us. When someone else would write lyrics, I always tried to be really open to trying to make it a group identity.\n\nWait, so you guys were really The Electrocutes? So the Drive Me Crazy director didn't make that up? Yeah! The director used our other band's name. He was a fan of our band and was like \"wouldn't it be cool if we used your secret name?\" We have a record out as The Electrocutes called Steal Your Lunch Money. When we put out the black and white The Donnas record, we were still doing The Electrocutes. The Donnas were more Ramones-style punk rock, and The Electrocutes were more thrashy. We were really into Sonic Youth. We actually played at Stanford on the radio station as The Donnas and then we left and The Electrocutes played. The Electrocutes was our real band, and The Donnas was our side project. People really started liking The Donnas, so we ended up merging the bands together. American Teenage Rock 'n' Roll Machine was really when our bands were merged together. I think the music changed a lot by that record.\n\nWhat were your favorite songs to write and perform on the black and white record?\n\nAt that time, we were writing with producer Darin [Raffaelli]. That record almost feels like oldies to me. I love oldies. \"Let's Rab\" and \"Let's Go Mano\" were songs we wrote with Darin. \"Rab\" is a word our friend at school used to say, so we made it into a slang word for that song. \"Mano\" was a made-up slang word too. \"Last Chance Dance\" was interesting because the intro of the song is our 8th grade geometry teacher who was actually giving a real-life announcement. I can't remember if we wrote that song because of the dance or if it was a coincidence. I just remember Allison asking if we could use it for the song.\n\nDid you start to find success from your self-titled record, or did that start happening with Spend the Night ?\n\nThis record feels obscure to me still. I felt like no one knew who we were really yet. I do remember \"Huff All Night\" was one of my favorite songs. It was really fun to play, and it was really fun to write. It was one of the first times that I ever thought about how the melody and chorus structure went together."}, {"url": "https://www.stereogum.com/1968443/brett-anderson-talks-life-since-the-donnas-scoring-commercials-and-shooting-tv-pilots-that-never-aired/interviews/tracking-down/", "page_content": "Welcome to the latest installment of \u201cTracking Down,\u201d a new Stereogum franchise in which we talk to artists who have been out of the spotlight for a minute.\n\nThe Donnas\u2019 greatest song, \u201cGet Rid Of That Girl\u201d was released two decades ago, and it\u2019s still charming as ever in its ramshackle garage-pop way. In under two minutes these expert Ramone clones figure out how they\u2019re gonna dispatch a \u201cfine\u201d boy\u2019s girlfriend (\u201cI\u2019m gonna drag her by the hair all over town\u201d) and sum up one teenage jealousy dilemma in its most compact form: \u201cHer hair\u2019s so blonde and her nails so long / So I put my Maybellines record on.\u201d The whole thing is perfect brat-pop down to the off-beat \u201ckill kill kill\u201d backing vocals and endearingly DIY cardboard-robot video.\n\nBut they definitely advanced from there, as 1999\u2019s Get Skintight amped up the songcraft and originality more than a bit, finding the quartet at a crossroads of Brill Building (\u201cYou Don\u2019t Wanna Call\u201d), hopped-up post-Runaways glam (\u201cHook It Up\u201d) and hair metal (literally M\u00f6tley Crue\u2019s \u201cToo Fast For Love\u201d). The Donnas Turn 21 in 2001 jacked up the AC/DC quotient and the tunes increasingly left behind headlong pop-punk for arena-rock nuggets with guitar solos, which culminated in a major-label debut, Spend The Night and an actual MTV hit, \u201cTake It Off,\u201d the next year. By now, as one of their best early songs put it, the Donnas were unquestionably a \u201cRock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Machine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since the last Donnas album, the Jett-black Aquanet tribute Bitchin\u2019, and Stereogum caught up with singer Brett Anderson (aka Donna A.) about what she and her bandmates have been doing over the last decade, and how they headed off the social-media boom at the pass.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Sorry if my voice, like, randomly creaks. I started getting sick yesterday.\n\nANDERSON: Oh no! Well, I\u2019m the last person who would ever judge anyone on their voice. I\u2019ve had a nodule since I was six years old. Of course, I ended up in a career that depended completely on the most defective part of my body.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Did it ever actually hinder you singing?\n\nANDERSON: It constantly hindered my singing! In all our reviews it was like, \u201cHer nicotine-tinged voice\u2026\u201d and I was like, \u2018No, I don\u2019t smoke, I just have a fucked-up voice.\u2019 [Laughs.] I had to do rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. There\u2019s no way I was gonna be any kind of singer.\n\nSTEREOGUM: How long have the Donnas been inactive? Was it a formal hiatus?\n\nANDERSON: I think our last show was in 2012. And no, we just started playing fewer shows and people started doing other stuff gradually, and after a while it was like\u2026 hmm, we haven\u2019t played a show in a long time.\n\nSTEREOGUM: I know you\u2019re studying psychology now.\n\nANDERSON: I just saw Torry [Castellano, drummer], she just moved to Israel to do some kind of fellowship. She also went to Stanford, and then to Harvard. I think she had not taken the bar yet\u2026I think she\u2019s doing this fellowship before she takes the bar. I\u2019m inspired by her path; I came to Stanford after her. Our band has a 100% yield rate so that would look good on my application. \u201cIf you admit us, we come! So that would look good for your numbers!\u201d\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, just a confluence of many, many cultural and economic and political factors combining, which just made it harder and harder to be a working musician. When we started, it was like, you could put songs on the radio, you could have videos on MTV, and we did all those things and it was super exciting. And then Napster happened, and in a way it was really cool because it evened the playing field so that other people could get exposure, and you didn\u2019t need, like, a record label to get your song on the radio. But it didn\u2019t technically turn out like that.\n\nThe reality is that there\u2019s alliances between media conglomerates, so I don\u2019t think that happened quite as much as it could or should have. And it made selling our music \u2014 making money off the thing that we make \u2014 impossible, so our sales went down. So we had to start trying to earn money in all these peripheral ways, like selling merchandise or the experience of a live show: all just much more difficult, more labor-intensive ways to make money than on the thing you create.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Nothing sucks more than having an artist you like who can\u2019t afford to create.\n\nANDERSON: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. And then social media and that component started becoming really central to being successful, so you have to constantly provide content\u2026I don\u2019t want to speak for the other people in my band but I think none of us want to put our whole lives out there, I think we all value privacy. And it just seemed very against my nature to have to be constantly updating all that shit.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Your first album turned 20 this year, how does it feel to look back on two decades of being a successful band?\n\nANDERSON: It\u2019s surreal, I kind of don\u2019t believe it in a way. We were like 13 when we started, and you never think it\u2019s going to turn into anything real, and then when we signed to Lookout! it was like, oh my god, we\u2019re on a record label! And then when we signed to Atlantic it was like, holy shit, this is real! I still feel as surprised about that as the day it happened. So now the fact it\u2019s like history is surreal.\n\nSTEREOGUM: What was your major-label experience like?\n\nANDERSON: I think Atlantic is a great label. Obviously they have a great history in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll: Zeppelin, AC/DC. The problem is, when we signed, we had a great team that we got to know, and we chose to work with that label because of those people and the amount of control we were offered versus the advance. And then all those people left and a whole new group of people came in and we\u2019re like, \u201cWho are you guys?\u201d And they\u2019re like \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nSTEREOGUM: I get why creative control was so important to the Donnas; I can only try and imagine some of the things men would try to impose on you guys.\n\nANDERSON: [Laughs.] We made a couple pilots for reality shows where we were like, [whispers] \u201cOK, we\u2019re just gonna make this pilot so we seem willing, but we\u2019re not gonna do it, right? We\u2019re gonna bail out, right?\u201d One of them we\u2019re like, looking for Halloween costumes at this Halloween store. I don\u2019t know if you have to do this but every once in a while in your career you have to do something really degrading. Doing a reality show is like the most degrading thing I can imagine.\n\nThere was one really cool one we did, by the guys who did [the animated show] Dr. Katz, and they just taped us talking for a couple hours and were able to have enough material to splice it together. There were songs and psychedelic stuff and rabbits, and it was funny, plus, best of all, I wouldn\u2019t have to be in it.\n\nSTEREOGUM: I think a lot of writers hate doing things like \u201cThe Top 10 Miley Cyrus Songs\u201d or something, but I love them, they\u2019re like brain exercises for me and they give me an excuse to do a deep dive on an artist I hardly know sometimes.\n\nANDERSON: That\u2019s how I feel about making music for commercials, which I did for a few years toward the end of the band. [For example, Anderson provided music for Fitbit\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s All Fit\u201d clip. See below. \u2013ed.] I think a lot of people would feel degraded by that, but for me it felt exactly like a brain exercise. Like, \u201cOK, we have these constraints, we have to do this and this and this in that much time, and have to match with this picture.\u201d It\u2019s like a little puzzle.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Liz Phair is, like, an award-winning scorer of soap operas on daytime TV now.\n\nANDERSON: Wow! I would love to spend a whole day with her doing that. I love scores. The new music I\u2019ve made in the last couple years has been really inspired by the scores Nick Cave and Warren Ellis did, like the Assassination Of Jesse James soundtrack, and the music from Twin Peaks and Angelo Badalamenti. Music really is the score for your life. You put on the Donnas and you\u2019re gonna feel empowered and excited and hopefully not feel like things are as heavy as they are. Like day\u2019s over, we\u2019re gonna have fun. But I also like the idea of putting something on and making your day seem more intense or dramatic.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Did you ever struggle with trying to bring in musical ideas that didn\u2019t fit the image the Donnas had been cultivating?\n\nANDERSON: I think part of what kept the band going for so long is that our sound did change a lot. When you look at each record, there is a different thing we\u2019re doing on each record: \u201cTake It Off\u201d is more straightforward and high-energy, and Gold Medal, we just explored more organic sounds with that record, which was really fulfilling and exciting for all of us. And then we went more metal after that. It was exciting seeing what we could get away with, within the constraints of our identity, that wouldn\u2019t seem inauthentic. \u201cCould I play piano on a song?\u201d\n\nSTEREOGUM: Re-listening to all the records within the last few days, I could see the amount of guitar soloing goes up over time.\n\nANDERSON: [Allison Robertson, guitarist] is so good! It was so fun being in a band where, during a solo, I could just turn onstage and be the audience, too.\n\nSTEREOGUM: How intentional was it, politically, that the Donnas\u2019 songwriting perspective seemed to try to even the score by objectifying men?\n\nANDERSON: Yay, you got it! [Laughs.] I can\u2019t tell you how many fucking morning interview shows we\u2019d go to on the radio and they\u2019d be like, [affects dudebro voice] \u201cSooo, when are you gonna take it off?\u201d And we\u2019d be like, \u201cCan you speak your own fucking language? That is an imperative statement, from us, to other people!\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like we sat down and strategized intentionally, it just permeated our every conversation, just being an all-female band in a very male-dominated genre and industry. The bands that we loved and were emulating, their lyrics tended to be about objectifying. So what are your options? Either take on that persona and give back what they\u2019re giving, or are you gonna try and be like, the female in that scenario? I just can\u2019t even imagine why anyone would want to do that or how you\u2019d even pull it off.\n\nSTEREOGUM: But it still backfired with, say, morning show radio hosts, too?\n\nANDERSON: That\u2019s just \u2019cause people are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupidddddddddddddd.\n\nWhen we go to Europe on tour or Australia or Japan, even people for whom English is their second language, get it because they\u2019re actually listening to the lyrics and value musicians as a valuable member of society. When you\u2019re in Europe on tour with your band, they treat you like a doctor or lawyer, the backstage room is decked out when you get to a club, and it may not be the nicest club in the world but they give you all they have because they really value having music and art in their culture. I just don\u2019t think people here, as a whole\u2026 it\u2019s just more commercial here.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Did fans often tell you that the Donnas empowered them?\n\nANDERSON: Not explicitly making statements but I feel like we led with our actions more than our words, and I feel that was really motivating for people who\u2019d never seen a female band onstage playing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, both girls and boys! \u201cI saw you guys play and I never felt that was something I could do.\u201d\n\nSTEREOGUM: On a technical, personal level, if I try to play the \u201cTake It Off\u201d riff, there\u2019s like a first-to-fourth finger stretch that I physically cannot do, like my hands are too small for it.\n\nANDERSON: Sometimes we would dumb down the lyrics a little bit, we didn\u2019t want to be too highbrow but more fun and accessible. But musically, we\u2019re all big nerds across the board who\u2019d get down to the details of all the people that we love.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Is there a record you\u2019re particularly proud of that you consider your artistic peak?\n\nANDERSON: I don\u2019t know about everybody, but Gold Medal was really fulfilling. We met PJ Harvey the week we released that record, and it felt like an omen, like we were getting good feedback from the universe at that point in time. I grew up playing piano and I would love to have something to play and hide behind once in a while.\n\nSTEREOGUM: I love the emphasis on harmonies on that record, and these almost psychedelic elements. But Get Skintight is probably my favorite.\n\nANDERSON: Yeah, and it\u2019s probably the one that\u2019s\u2026most like the Donnas, in a way.\n\nSTEREOGUM: After Bitchin\u2019, did you guys continue to write songs and just not want to put something out?\n\nANDERSON: No, we wrote a bunch more songs and recorded some, but I think it just dissipated. We do have a bunch more songs that I think are really awesome.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Do you have any plans to do anything with those in the future?\n\nANDERSON: Not particularly; for me, I\u2019m just struggling to keep up with the minimum I have to do in this one thing I\u2019m doing, so I can\u2019t even imagine trying to keep up with something else.\n\nSTEREOGUM: What\u2019s the biggest misconception about the band?\n\nANDERSON: People constantly thought we didn\u2019t write our own songs or play our instruments. There were literally rumors that there was a guy behind the stage playing the solos. Right now, I\u2019m surrounded by 18 and 19-year-olds all the time, and some are familiar with the band and some aren\u2019t. If they are, it\u2019s usually through Rock Band or Guitar Hero. I don\u2019t feel like we were really misunderstood, but I guess I\u2019m not sure if people were aware of how much we cared about the songwriting.\n\nSTEREOGUM: Have you guys gotten big offers to reunite for festivals or things you\u2019ve had to turn down?"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsages.com/torry-castellano/", "page_content": "Birth Name: Torrance Heather Castellano Occupation: Drummer Born In: San Francisco, California, USA Birthdate: January 8, 1979 Age: 44 years old (as of 2023) Ethnicity: White Nationality: American Sexuality: Straight\n\nTorry Castellano was born on the 8th of January, 1979.

Torry Castellano (aka \u201cDonna C\u201d), drummer for The Donnas, has been forced to quit the band and completely retire from playing drums due to a chronic, severe shoulder injury. I interviewed Torry several years ago and she was lots of fun. This is really a shame, as not only are The Donnas an awesome band, but I know how passionate drummers are about their craft. No one wants to be forced into retirement due to an injury, but her decision makes sense considering that she was faced with having to choose living without pain over pursuing her art.

To meet Torry Castellano, whose career as a drummer has spanned recording studios, the set of Saturday Night Live and stages in Barcelona, Paris and Tokyo, is to realize how unconcerned she is with popular acclaim.\n\nIn fact, Castellano, '13, was somewhat intimidated by her new surroundings, and she recognized similar feelings among the other 18 transfers. To help cope, she tried to bring them together for karaoke, but then found a better lure: dinner at Mom's. \"Pasta and meatballs,\" explains Castellano. \"About 15 of them were there.\"\n\nMom is a Palo Altan, as was Castellano when she was growing up with the three female friends who became her bandmates, the Donnas. A pop-punk act reminiscent of the Runaways, an all-girl band of the 1970s, the Donnas have been recording and touring since the mid '90s. Plans were announced at the start of the year for a new album, but it will have to be made without Castellano. The victim of uncorrectable shoulder pain from tendonitis and repetitive strain injury, Castellano became one of rock's most youthful retirees last year. She turned 32 in January.\n\nShe didn't surrender her drumsticks easily. But months of rest hadn't worked. Over time, another part of her Los Angeles-based life grew in importance. She had enrolled at Santa Monica College\u2014she took one final online when the band was on tour in Brazil\u2014and began giving serious thought to full-time studies at a university, where she could reinvent herself. She applied to various schools that seemed like reasonable objectives, plus Stanford.\n\n\"I really didn't think I was going to get in,\" says Castellano. \"When I got the acceptance email, I was shaking. And I didn't totally trust it, because it was email. I was crying. I had my mom read it.\"\n\nNo matter how accomplished transfers are before arriving on the Farm\u2014Castellano's contingent includes a former Green Beret, a former radio DJ and a former professional dancer\u2014there's enormous apprehension that comes with entering such an imposing environment. \"That's particularly true,\" says Mentzer, \"if they are transferring from a community or junior college,\" as Castellano did.\n\nWith the Donnas (www.thedonnas.com), Castellano shared a juicy image: \"Pabst-swilling, sex-crazed party animals\" was how a Los Angeles Times writer once distilled it. In reality, the article went on to disclose, they appeared to be \"just regular girls\" who liked iced tea, candy and watching TV.\n\nLooking back, Castellano says, \"There have been many crazy nights, many crazy tours. I don't want to kill the fantasy image of rock 'n' roll life. But there's also a lot of work that goes into being successful, and I was always involved in the business decisions.\"\n\nThe fall quarter at Stanford was partly about solitary nights of keeping up with assignments. But the rest of the experience, in class or almost any conversation on campus, played to her like an intellectual concert. \"Politics, or religion, or philosophy. Everything!\" Her first set of grades: an A and two A-minuses.\n\nBy winter quarter, she had declared a major in political science. That made sense, she said, because she now is thinking ahead\u2014drum roll, please\u2014about possibly applying to law school."}]}
