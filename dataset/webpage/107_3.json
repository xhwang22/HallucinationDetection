In August 1989, Guangzhou issued the \u201cImplementation Plan of Guangzhou Housing System Reform\u201d which started pilot housing sales; in July 1995, Guangzhou issued \u201cOpinions on Deepening Housing System Reform in Guangzhou\u201d to promote the sales of public housing; and in May 2000, Guangzhou issued \u201cNotice on the Relevant Issues of Implementing Monetary Housing Allocation\u201d to fully implement the monetization of housing allocation. The housing improvement process in Guangzhou can be divided into three periods: pilot reform (1980\u20131994), housing reform sales (1995\u20132000), and housing marketization (after 2001). The pilot reform period can be divided into the housing rental subsidy period (before 1989) and the pilot housing sales period (1990\u20131994). The housing marketization period can be divided into the periods of a steady increase in housing prices (2001\u20132005) and of a rapid increase in housing prices (2006\u20132010). Regarding development periods, commodity housing and welfare housing developed in parallel before 2000, after which time commodity housing dominated.\n\nDuring housing property right reform, both regional and work unit levels have adopted progressive and radical reform strategies successively or alternately. At the regional level, reform before 1998 has been gradually promoted by means of pilot housing sales, rent subsidies, and promotion of rentals by sales. After 1998, radical means were adopted to stop housing distribution (Cheng, 1999:12). For example, the Guangzhou government required all enterprises and institutions to stop selling public housing and fully implemented the monetization of housing distribution from January 1, 2000. At the work unit level, because government officials often occupied larger public houses, selling houses at a low price became a priority strategy. Several sudden rounds of low-price house selling were initiated during the process of housing reform (Zhu, 2007:56-58). The reform strategy of housing property rights has given the acquisition of welfare housing a significant period effect.\n\nThe period of housing commercialization also coincided with a period of rapid urbanization in China. The national urbanization rate was 20% in 1980, exceeded 30% in 1996, and reached 50% in 2010. Urbanization and housing commercialization have effectively driven the development of the real estate industry. Commodity residential investment in Guangzhou increased from 0.465 billion yuan in 1985 to 20 billion yuan in 2000, and reached 57.271 billion yuan in 2010 (Guangzhou Statistics Bureau 2011). The average sales price of commodity housing has been rising for a long time, from 882.08 yuan/m2 in 1988 to 3978.34 yuan/m2 in 2000, and 10,615.09 yuan/m2 in 2010 (National Bureau of Statistics, China Index Academy 2011). Housing commercialization has provided new opportunities and paths for residents to acquire housing, but housing price changes have made entering the housing market more or less difficult during different periods. Based on the above analysis, hypothesis 1 is proposed.\n\nHypothesis 1: In the process of housing marketization, the acquisition of housing property rights has a significant period effect, i.e., the probability of housing acquisition is higher during periods of housing reform and when housing prices are steadily increasing (hypothesis of period effects).\n\nLife course factors play a key role in regulating the impact of institutional change on individual life opportunities (Zhou and Noen 2001). The acquisition of new opportunities in the process of institutional change is impacted by the position of individual life course in many respects (Zhou, 2014:240-262). In the process of housing reform, the timing of life course has a great impact on the acquisition of housing property rights (Fu 2016). The reform strategy for housing propertization was \u201cnew systems for new comers, old methods for old cases,\u201d which means each cohort has experienced a very different institutional environment. The continuous rise in housing prices caused each cohort to face a different market environment, thus forming different cohort opportunities (Wu 2016). The cohort experiencing professional growth and achievement during the housing reform period is able to not only benefit from the property rights reform, but also take the opportunity of official promotion of housing purchase and low housing prices to buy their property. On the other hand, the cohort who were preparing for their career not only missed welfare housing, but also faced the adverse environment of rising housing prices, which makes it more difficult to buy a house. Because different cohorts in the housing reform process experience different housing opportunities, property rights acquisition has a cohort effect, and therefore, hypothesis 2 is proposed.\n\nHypothesis 2: In the process of housing marketization, housing property rights have a significant cohort effect. Cohorts experiencing occupational growth and achievement have an advantage during the housing reform period. Cohorts preparing for their occupation or in career decline period have no advantage (hypothesis of cohort effects).\n\nHousing property rights acquisition at all periods of housing reform\n\nPilot reform period (1980\u20131994)\n\nHousing is the most representative welfare product in the national redistribution system of everyday living supplies. In China, the state provides housing through work units and gives out continuous subsidies. The scarcity of urban living space makes housing a symbol of welfare and status (Song and Xie 2014). Welfare housing adopts an \u201coffice-based administrative distribution mode\u201d (Gu and Li, 1998; Li, 2002), where the closer the administrative subordinate is to the core of power, the more abundant the housing resources; the farther away from the core of power, the less abundant the housing resources (Wei, 2015:139). The distribution of welfare housing resources presents a similar \u201cdifferential mode of association\u201d as proposed by Fei Xiaotong (2012:13-17). Whether workers can obtain housing, as well as the environment of surrounding areas and residential facilities, is all related to their work unit\u2019s capacity to build housing and power to control and distribute housing (Bian et.al, 1996). The propertization of welfare housing also implicates a \u201cdifferentiated treatment\u201d that starts from the work units at the system\u2019s outside or margins, and closes in onto the core work units (Wei, 2017). This policy is extended to public and administrative institutions after having been experimented in state-owned and collective enterprises, which also reflects the characteristics of \u201cthe differential mode of association.\u201d According to the policy for housing sale during the housing reform, cadre families and worker families can only enjoy a one-time preferential treatment when purchasing houses, and thus, delaying the purchase means the opportunity to switch to or buy newer and larger public houses (Mao, 2014). With the influence of the stigmatization of private property rights, which was still present at the beginning of the reform, the advantaged social classes were unlikely to willingly purchase a welfare house (Wang and Chen, 2013). To mitigate difficulties faced by urban low-income families, Guangzhou built poverty relief housing that was sold to extremely challenged households\u2014those with less than 5 m2 per capital living area, successfully solved the housing problem for 11,642 special poverty-stricken households from 1986\u20131991 (Liu et al., 2012:142-143). Therefore, in the pilot phase of the social housing reform, welfare housing was often provided to workers who had lower occupational status or were retired.\n\nDue to the exclusiveness of the welfare housing system, welfare housing was difficult to access for employees of private and foreign-funded enterprises and other institutions. Scholars of the market transition theory believe that the market can, to a certain extent, offset inequalities caused by redistribution, thereby benefiting the direct producers, the technical elite, and the lower class (Polany, 2007:4; Szelenyi 1978). In the pilot reform phase, the government supports the development of the real estate industry and encourages developers to build commodity housing (Zhang 1997). The self-employed and employees of private enterprises and other institutions have lower occupational status but higher income and thus entered the real estate market earlier to purchase housing (Lee 2000; Zhu, 2007:123). Therefore, the commercialization of housing in the early phase included some equalizing effects, and people of ordinary classes can benefit from the expansion of the housing market (Szelenyi 2010:152-193). To this end, the following assumptions are made:\n\nHypothesis 3.1: In the pilot reform phase, individuals who are acquiring property rights for welfare housing mostly are the non-elite stratum in the system.\n\nHypothesis 3.2: In the pilot reform phase, employees of non-institutional units will mostly purchase property rights of commodity housing.\n\nHousing reform sales period (1995\u20132000)\n\nThe welfare housing system is a closed system, which makes obvious the housing division between institutional and non-institutional units. Work units at higher administration levels obtain more housing benefits (Li, 2002). China started the housing reform during a time of housing shortages, because the allocation of welfare housing resources presents a \u201cdifferential mode of association,\u201d and work units with advantages in the power system also have advantages in terms of housing property rights (Liu and Mao, 2012; Hu, 2012); the work unit system and the power to redistribute became important mechanisms for housing inequality in the housing reform period (Liu, 2005). Within the work unit, assigned housing serves as a reward for political loyalty and a compensation for low wages (Wang and Murie 1996). Work units assign housing to members who are \u201cmore useful\u201d to society according to their title, seniority, political \u201cprogressiveness,\u201d and family conditions (Huang and Clark 2002; Bian et al., 1996). The welfare housing distribution system, in which professional elite within the system receives newer and higher quality housing, led to the accumulation of social privilege (Szelenyi 2010: 63-86). Driven by concerns with potential resistance from those with vested interests in the status quo, work units recognize and protect the existing housing allocation structure when selling houses (Zhu, 2007: 116-121). As a result, establishment elites have become winners in welfare housing propertization (Bian and Liu, 2005; Logan et al. 2010; Walder and He 2014). Their housing advantages are mainly reflected in the quality, rather than the property right, of their housing (Wei, 2017).\n\nDuring the sales period of the housing reform, work units within the establishment bought a large amount of commodity housing from the market and assigned them to its employees according to preferential policies of the housing reform (Cheng, 1999: 386; Wei, 2017). Statistics show that from 1995\u20131998, 39.3% of commodity houses in Guangzhou were sold to work units (Guangzhou Statistics Bureau 2000). The government also provides a variety of preferential policies and housing provident funds for workers of these work units who sought to buy houses in the market (Wei, 2014). With the development of the housing market and rising house prices, housing property rights are more readily accessible to families with higher occupational status inside and outside the system (Huang 2004). Due to factors such as the little qualitative difference and the huge price difference between commodity housing and welfare housing, the disqualification for welfare housing after a commodity housing purchase, and the influence of the real estate bubble of the 1990s, establishment elites preferred not to buy commodity housing prior to the end of housing reform (Mao, 2014). To this end, the following assumptions are made:\n\nHypothesis 4.1: During the sales period of the housing reform, work units inside the system benefit more from acquiring welfare housing property rights than work units outside the system, and work units with administrative ranks benefit more than those without.\n\nHypothesis 4.2: During the sales period of the housing reform, work units inside the system benefit more from buying commodity housing property rights than work units outside the system, and administrative elites are unlikely to willingly purchase commodity housing.\n\nHousing marketization period (2001\u20132010)\n\nIn the aftermath of the sales period of the housing reform, China has gradually established a mixed real estate market consisted of a highly monopolistic land transfer market and a highly commercialized housing market. On the one hand, the real estate industry has been established as a pillar industry of the national economy for its promotion of economic growth (The State Council 2003), and thus, housing has become an important commodity and investment; on the other hand, local governments have monopolized the land supply through land reserve and the bidding system, making profound intervention into the real estate market. The land bidding system and the reform of the tax sharing system pushed local governments and real estate enterprises into a long-term alliance based on lands, which has maintained the high housing prices (Fu 2013). China\u2019s real estate market has both market and redistribution features, as the market adjustment mechanism has not replaced the deep-rooted influence of the unit system (Ho and Kwong 2002).\n\nDuring the housing marketization period, with the work unit system being stringent and institutional changes gradual, work units inside the system continued to be protected by government power (Wu, 2010), and work units still played an important role in housing acquisition (Huang and Clark 2002). In the process of institutional change, work units changed from \u201cadministrative units\u201d to \u201cinterest-oriented units,\u201d with their central task transitioning to satisfying their members\u2019 needs and seeking organizational self-development (Sun et al., 1994). Against the backdrop of the rapid rise in housing prices, a reversed marketization emerged in the real estate market, in which the establishment elite acquired housing in non-market or semi-market ways (Fang, 2014). State-owned work units and housing management agencies were still allowed to sell their worker\u2019s public houses that were left. In \u201cMeasures for the management of economically affordable housing\u201d issued by the Ministry of Construction in 2007, housing constructed with work units\u2019 collective funds was still defined as economically affordable housing. The abstract and vague nature of the housing policies provided work units with land and housing construction resources with the opportunity to seek favorable housing resources (Hu, 2012). Some localities adopted \u201centrusted construction\u201d or \u201ctargeted housing development\u201d to build housing for civil servants (Chen, 2009); some state-owned enterprises used the land they owned to build luxury collectively funded housing and then sold the houses to their management and employees at prices far below market value. Because the reform remained partialized, administrative elites saw opportunities to use their power in the redistribution economy (Nee 2002:183-216), and they still have the upper hand in welfare housing acquisition.\n\nDuring the process of real estate development, multiple administrative approvals are required. As a result, work units inside the system have more bargaining power in the market. Some families may use their political resources and power to obtain price discounts, preferential loans, insider information, and so on, and acquire high-quality housing (Song and Xie 2014). But on the whole, the vast majority of unit workers bought commodity houses at market prices, and as a result, system differences in commodity housing acquisition gradually shrank. Individuals mainly depend on their own economic ability for purchasing commodity housing, and economic ability is closely related to education level and occupational status; thus, housing marketization benefits the elite class rather than the ordinary citizens (Davis 2003:183-198). Although administrative elites inside the system can benefit from the commercialization of their bureaucratic privileges (Szelenyi and Kostello, 2002:574-589), they are more inclined to obtain welfare housing because of the cost concerns. Professional elites participate in market competition with professional and technical abilities, demonstrating \u201cadvantages\u201d in the commodity housing market. To this end, the following assumptions are proposed:\n\nHypothesis 5.1: During the period of housing marketization, work units inside the system have a greater advantage in acquiring welfare housing property rights than those outside the system have, and administrative elites receiving more benefit than the non-elites.\n\nHypothesis 5.2: During the period of housing marketization, there was no obvious system difference in the acquisition of property rights for commodity housing, but professional elites have more advantages than the non-elites."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/housing-and-housing-policy", "page_content": "Hazleton Avenue, Toronto (photo by Christopher Thomas).\n\nHousing and Housing Policy\n\nShelter is a basic human need. The amount, type and cost of housing describe the \"supply\" side of the housing market. The number of households, their income and housing requirements describe the \"demand\" side of housing. In Canada, generally those who can afford to buy housing do so - in part to provide security of tenure and in part as an investment. Across the country, 70% of Canadians own and 30% rent their housing.\n\nCanadian housing takes many forms. More than half of Canadian homes are single-family detached houses; 17% are other ground-oriented forms such as row houses, duplexes, semi-detached or movable; 18% are lowrise apartments and 10% are highrise apartments. The vast majority of Canadian housing has been built since the Second World War. Consequently, the quality of Canadian housing reflects its recent construction, with less than 6% of homes requiring major repairs.\n\nAcross Canada, construction averaged only 39 000 units per year during the Great Depression and the war years. It increased rapidly after the war to meet the needs of returning veterans, immigrants and people moving from rural to urban centres. Annual additions to Canadian housing averaged 77 000 units in the 1950s, 155 000 in the 1960s and 229 100 in the 1970s. The early 1980s saw a reduced demand for housing as a result of an economic recession and declining demand as most people born during the postwar baby boom had already entered the housing market. Through the 1990s annual housing completions averaged 145 000 units, responding to immigration, increasing incomes of aging baby boomers (9% of whom have purchased a second home) and baby boomers' children entering the housing market. During the early 2000s annual completions increased to an average of 212 924 units per year but dropped in 2008 as Canada experienced the worldwide economic recession.\n\nIn theory, as wealth increases and households age, people seek newer accommodation, freeing up older homes for first-time buyers. However, in metropolitan areas experiencing rapid growth, the trickle down process does not work. A system that provides wealth for some may make housing less affordable for others. The cost of housing is part of a broader concern for affordable living that incorporates the full range of costs a household faces. In metropolitan areas the majority of new development is still in the suburbs on \"greenfield\" sites which require owners to maintain several cars and pay higher taxes for services.\n\nThe housing market is the most complex urban system people experience on a daily basis. For owners, as house prices rise, household wealth increases. Many owners see their home as their retirement savings plan. From 1999 to 2005 the real median net worth of owners rose 27%. By contrast, the median net worth of renters dropped 5%. However, the housing market is cyclical and in uncertain economic times owners may experience a loss of value in their house and face the challenge of making mortgage payments. The flip side of declining house prices is the opportunity for employed renters to purchase a home.\n\nThe challenge facing those who cannot afford to buy housing is that the stock of rental housing is declining. Typically more than 90% of new housing is built for ownership. While some units are temporarily rented by their owner, most are owner occupied. With few new units being added to the rental stock, affordable housing is becoming a scarce resource for lower income Canadians. Low vacancy rates compound the challenge of finding affordable housing. While national average vacancy rates are 3%, this masks the problems of very low vacancy rates in large cities such as Vancouver and Toronto. Those unable to afford ownership seek a variety of other options. Some stay with parents or family members; others find roommates to share housing costs.\n\nCo-operatives and co-housing provide accommodation with security of tenure to households that share costs. Co-operatives reduce housing costs by sharing expenses and management. Housing co-operatives in Canada date back to the 1930s. There are 100 000 units of co-operative housing in Canada. Housing costs are further reduced when residents share some facilities (such as kitchens and living rooms) by living in co-housing.\n\nMarket rental housing refers to housing built and managed by private entrepreneurs. Market units include purpose-built rental buildings, units temporarily rented by their owners and secondary/ancillary suites (often called \"mortgage helpers\") in single-family homes. Residential hotels offer lower rent single-room occupancy (SROs), where tenants share bathrooms and have limited cooking facilities in their rooms.\n\nMost occupants of market rental housing receive little or no assistance from governments to pay their rent. Help is limited to rent supplement programs such as British Columbia's Shelter Assistance for Elderly Renters and the housing component of social assistance. When other options fail, people seek housing in the small number of government-funded social housing units or find themselves part of the growing homeless population.\n\nGovernment Programs to Increase Housing Supply and Affordability\n\nOver the years governments have intervened in the housing market to stimulate the economy and assist people in need. Adequate housing refers to housing that is in good physical condition, has adequate bedrooms and costs less than 30% of before-tax household income. Those living in poor-quality housing and/or spending more than 30% of their income are said to be \"in core need.\"\n\nThe phrase core need was developed by Canada's national housing agency, Canada Mortgage and Housing, to better understand the needs of those requiring assistance. Across Canada, about 14% of households are in core need. Most are renters. Only a few people remain in permanent core need. Others experience temporary need when they move or their family circumstances change through birth of children, death of a spouse or divorce. The most serious need is found in metropolitan areas, where many renters spend more than half their income for housing.\n\nHousing policies and programs are actions taken by governments to improve the quantity and quality of housing and to reduce its cost. The objectives of Canadian housing policies are to ensure that dwellings of a decent standard are available to all Canadians at prices they can afford. Over the years, government assistance has been provided through a variety of grants and loans to developers or consumers.\n\nAll levels of government have been involved in housing programs, though the constitutional authority for housing is vested in provincial governments. They, in turn, may delegate housing responsibility to regional and city governments.\n\nAt the national level, a variety of economic and social concerns such as the Depression had an impact on the housing sector and caused the Government of Canada to become involved in housing policy. Canadian housing policies have addressed 3 issues: assisting the housing market to produce enough housing to meet the needs of most Canadians (see Development Industry), providing mortgage assurance for homeowners and offering assistance to people whose housing needs cannot be adequately met through the private housing market.\n\nBefore 1970, Canadian housing programs were almost exclusively the preserve of the federal government. The first national housing legislation, the Dominion Housing Act of 1935, provided $20 million in loans and helped finance 4900 units over 3 years. The Federal Home Improvement Plan (1937) provided subsidized interest rates on rehabilitation loans to 66 900 homes. In 1938 the first National Housing Act (NHA) was passed. These acts served the dual purposes of providing housing and creating employment opportunities.\n\nThe federal government continued to be active in the housing market during the Second World War. A Crown corporation, Wartime Housing Corporation, built 45 930 units at a cost of $253 million over 8 years and assisted in the repair and modernization of existing houses. New programs stimulated the private housing market by providing mortgage money and favourable interest rates to encourage homeownership and the construction of limited-dividend rental housing. In 1946 the assets of Wartime Housing Corporation were transferred to Central (later Canada) Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\n\nA significant milestone in Canadian housing legislation occurred in 1954 when the federal government agreed to insure mortgage loans made by private investors against borrower default. The Bank Act was also amended to allow Canada's chartered banks to lend money for mortgages. These initiatives enabled the federal government to reduce its direct involvement in lending and to become an insurer of mortgages and a lender of last resort.\n\nThe provision of housing for lower income Canadians has been another continuing concern of governments. Social, public, community and non-market housing are terms used interchangeably to describe housing for people whose needs for adequate and affordable shelter cannot be met through market housing. Non-market units are funded and managed by governments and non-profit and co-operative societies to provide affordable housing. The first Canadian social housing legislation was introduced in 1938 when the NHA made provision for construction of low-rent housing. In 1949 the NHA was broadened to include federal-provincial programs (sometimes with city participation) to fund publicly owned and provincially managed housing for low-income families, seniors and the disabled. Prior to 1970, government programs assisted one-third of all housing starts. Most of this assistance was directed to market housing. Less than 5% of all starts were specifically designed to house lower income Canadians.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 public housing programs underwent extensive evaluation. A $200 million program in 1970 stimulated innovative solutions for housing low-income Canadians. In 1974 the NHA was amended: existing public housing was to continue to provide accommodation for low-income households; rural and First Nations programs were added; and new social housing was to be built by municipalities, non-profit organizations and co-operatives. The legislation encouraged consumers to be more involved in the design and management of housing and encouraged a mix of modest and lower income households. The federal government was the main source of funding for social housing, with some assistance from provinces and cities.\n\nDuring the 1970s the federal government continued to assist the private housing market by insuring mortgages and providing direct loans in smaller communities that were otherwise not well served by private lenders. Incentives introduced to stimulate home ownership were tax-exempt registered homeownership savings plans, an assisted homeownership program and changes to the Tax Act (1971) that excluded principal residences from capital gains tax. The federal government assisted the construction of private rental housing through a combination of grants, preferential loans and taxation concessions (multiple-unit residential-building deductions, the assisted rental program and a rental supply plan). Government programs assisted 40% of all housing completions.\n\nThroughout the 1970s provincial and city governments assumed a more active role in housing. Prior to 1970 Ontario had the most active provincial housing agency. By the mid-1970s all 10 provinces had created new or stronger housing departments and assumed more responsibility for policy development and for setting priorities for spending housing funds. Most provinces offered home-ownership grants and funded non-market housing. Some provinces assisted renters by providing tax credits, shelter allowances and rent control. Amendments to the NHA in 1978 and negotiations surrounding the Constitution Act, 1982, supported provincial housing activities, and, in turn, senior governments encouraged cities to create municipal non-profit corporations to build and manage social housing.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1986 there were 253 500 public housing units built across Canada. Ontario had the largest share (43%), followed by Qu\u00e9bec (22%), British Columbia (8%), Manitoba (7%) and Alberta (5%). The location of public housing reflects the extent to which provincial governments participated in cost-shared programs and in areas with traditionally low vacancy rates. Public housing, managed by government, primarily houses seniors, families and others with housing and support needs.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1986 governments shifted to funding non-profit groups such as churches, co-operatives and municipalities in order to provide affordable housing. More than 220 000 units of non-profit and cooperative housing were provided to house families (50%), seniors (40%) and others (10%). (See also Indigenous People: Government Programs).\n\nIn the early 1980s the Canadian Home Stimulation Program provided grants to home buyers; the Canada Mortgage Renewal Plan assisted those who were experiencing difficulty renewing their mortgages at higher interest rates; and the Graduated Payment Mortgage Plan helped homeowners offset the rising costs of home ownership by lowering initial monthly mortgage payments. In 2008 new initiatives allowed investors in small rental projects to purchase properties with no money down.\n\nSocial housing programs underwent an extensive review from 1979 to 1984. Coinciding with fiscal restraint both to eliminate the operating deficit and reduce the national debt, governments examined the ongoing cost of housing subsidies. Housing funds were reduced and directly targeted to low-income people. More emphasis was placed upon renovation of existing housing.\n\nMost market rental-assistance programs ended by the mid-1980s, but CMHC continued to assist more than 12 800 households annually to improve housing quality through a variety of rehabilitation programs for homeowners, rental units, rental conversions and rooming houses in both urban and rural areas.\n\nBy 1993 the federal government withdrew from funding new social housing. In 1996 the federal government announced that the management and ongoing subsidies of existing social housing would be transferred to the provinces. Provincial contributions to housing varied across the country. For the most part, funding was uncertain and provided minimal support for those least able to afford housing in higher priced markets. Since 1995, British Columbia and Qu\u00e9bec have been the only provinces funding new social housing. British Columbia provides limited funds for building independent living for frail elderly and other vulnerable populations and Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters to ease the cost of market rental housing.\n\nWith the withdrawal of most senior government funding for assisted housing, cities were faced with people in core need and few resources to respond. Cities provide some affordable rental housing through zoning-related actions such as limiting conversion of rental units to ownership, rezoning new sites for housing to deflect pressures from existing stock, permitting second units in single-family homes and funding tenant-assistance programs. \"Carrots,\" such as bonus density to encourage developers to build affordable units, and \"sticks,\" which require developers to include a portion of units as affordable housing, set conditions on new development. Zoning to permit infill of smaller homes in existing neighbourhoods provides some new ownership opportunities in areas with established services.\n\nDeclining support in the face of rising prices has led to an increase in the homeless population. Estimates of the national homeless population vary. As one illustration, in the Metro Vancouver area the number of homeless people increased from 300 to 1100 during the early 2000s. Many more have been identified as at-risk as the rental housing stock decreases and costs rise. Most of those in need benefit from a combination of housing and support services (health care and daycare), requiring partnerships between a variety of agencies. In the 2000s the federal Human Resources and Skills Development Canada and Supporting Communities Partnership Initiative provided some funds for shelters and transition housing to address homelessness\n\nSupporting Housing Quality and Sustainable Cities\n\nThe housing industry is supported by a continuing commitment from all levels of government to improve housing quality and community standards. The National Building Code and the National Fire Code encourage uniform building and safety standards across Canada. Local governments are usually responsible for enforcing adequate housing standards and for land-use planning that affects the location and type of housing (see Urban and Regional Planning; Zoning).\n\nMunicipalities are also responsible for planning and for providing water, sewer, roads, parks, schools and other public services. In unincorporated or rural areas, regional districts or provincial governments regulate land use and provide services.\n\nGovernment programs have assisted cities in improving the quality of housing and services. During the 1950s the federal government funded land assembly programs. In the 1960s cities received funds for urban renewal and municipal infrastructure. During the 1970s the federal government shifted funds into residential rehabilitation assistance, home insulation and neighbourhood-improvement programs. Most cities used the neighbourhood-improvement program to upgrade and preserve older neighbourhoods.\n\nFollowing withdrawal of federal funding for new supportive housing, the national government remained active in supporting the mortgage market (for both homeowners and investors) and research. Partnerships such as the ACT (Affordability and Choice Today) program - sponsored by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Canadian Home Builders' Association, Canadian Housing and Renewal Association and CMHC - provide grants to municipalities, builders, housing agencies and developers to demonstrate innovations in housing, planning, design and construction technology. These are published and shared within the housing industry. The Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships brings together public, private and third-sector agencies to provide cost-effective housing for low-income households.\n\nIn the 2000s federal housing initiatives focused on sustainable designs to reduce demands for energy and lessen emission of greenhouse gases. Example programs include the federal Equilibrium Sustainable Housing Demonstration Initiative to promote healthy, affordable, sustainable, energy-efficient housing. Governments encouraged the building of more compact urban areas by permitting infill housing in existing neighbourhoods, redeveloping \"brownfield\" (old industrial) and \"greyfield\" (low-density commercial) sites and encouraging more housing close to downtown jobs and transit-oriented development as ways to make more efficient and sustainable use of land and services."}, {"url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/liberals-grilled-over-140000-contract-given-to-john-les/article17491702/", "page_content": "Christy Clark is greeted by MLA John Les at her first Liberal Caucus meeting as premier-designate on March 2, 2011.JOHN LEHMANN/The Globe and Mail Share\n\nA day after British Columbia Premier Christy Clark scrapped plans to hire a former cabinet minister to study earthquake preparedness, questions continued to swirl around the process that saw John Les receive the $140,000 contract.\n\nNDP critic Shane Simpson pressed Justice Minister Suzanne Anton in Question Period on why the assignment for Mr. Les was never posted despite a procurement policy that says all contracts valued at more than $75,000 must be posted for open competition. Ms. Anton said Mr. Les's contract did not fit within \"our goals of keeping government small.\"\n\nThe government plans to proceed with the study with one chair \u2013 emergency management and public-safety consultant Henry Renteria, who spent nine years as director of the California governor's office of emergency services. He was also emergency-services director for the city of Oakland, Calif., for 18 years.\n\nIn a scrum with reporters on Thursday, Ms. Anton nonetheless continued to defend Mr. Les. \"Mr. Les had expertise in communities as a former mayor, as a former solicitor general,\" she said at the legislature in Victoria. The minister said it was her call to hire Mr. Les. \"I am the minister. The decisions are mine. The choices are mine. The responsibility is mine.\"\n\nWhile Ms. Anton said \"a number of people\" were considered for the assignment, she declined to name them.\n\nTwenty-four hours after Mr. Les's appointment was announced earlier this week, Ms. Clark said the assignment was news to her and a mistake by Ms. Anton, so it would be scrapped. \"Part of leadership is being able to course-correct and being able to admit when mistakes are being made,\" she told a news conference at the legislature.\n\nThe NDP opposition has been tracking what it calls a \"Liberal job-creation strategy\" for failed Liberal candidates from the 2013 provincial election \u2013 former MLAs and party insiders whose new positions add up to $1.17-million in compensation a year.\n\nAnother case in the spotlight was the appointment of Ben Stewart as Asia trade commissioner \u2013 a job that pays $150,000 a year. Mr. Stewart was elected last May as a Kelowna-area MLA, but gave up his seat so Ms. Clark could run in a by-election. Ms. Clark had been defeated in her Vancouver-area riding.\n\nMr. Les, the former Chilliwack MLA and former cabinet minister who did not seek re-election last year, previously made the NDP's list of questionable postings for a $60,000 job as chairman of the B.C. Farm Industry Review Board.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Simpson said there was no evidence that Mr. Les had any particular qualifications for his earthquake assignment, which was supposed to consist of a consultation process and public-education campaign on earthquake preparedness. The Justice Ministry was expecting a final report on the matter at the end of 2014.\n\n\"You've got to do this right and you've got to find the best people to do it, and not use them as a perk for their friends. And that's essentially what they did with Les,\" he said. He said Mr. Les stood in contrast to Mr. Renteria.\n\n\"You know what that guy is doing,\" he said of the U.S. consultant, citing his emergency preparedness experience. \"I don't know what John Les is doing other than to pick up the [paycheque].\"\n\nMr. Les did not respond to calls to his Chilliwack residence seeking comment.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Renteria said he had just learned on Thursday morning that Mr. Les would no longer be involved in the project. He said he did not expect the departure to have much of an impact. \"We were very early on into this process,\" he said, adding staff in Ms. Anton's ministry will provide the expertise in government that Mr. Les was expected to add to the review.\n\nMr. Renteria said he met Mr. Les and others in Vancouver earlier this week to launch the study. \"I felt very comfortable that he was part of the project.\""}, {"url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/people/michael-gove", "page_content": "The Rt Hon Michael Gove was appointed Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and Minister for Intergovernmental Relations on 25 October 2022.\n\nHe was previously Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities between 15 September 2021 and 6 July 2022, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from July 2019 to September 2021, and Minister for the Cabinet Office from February 2020 to September 2021.

It was falling apart. There was no service, very little services, very little maintenance. But despite the fact that it was the oldest neighbourhood and very rundown, having that roof over my head allowed me to go to undergraduate studies, to even dream of going to university,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI could never have been able to afford paying for a market rental unit and going to university at the same time as a new refugee to Canada, so I know the importance of that. Was it an adequate home? Was it a home that met all my needs? No, but it was a roof over my head and I can tell you it made a difference in my life.\u201d\n\nHussen, a lawyer and former head of the Canadian Somali Congress, was first elected as an MP in 2015. Now in his third ministerial role, he is setting out to make a difference in Canada\u2019s housing crisis.\n\nThis week, in making Hussen his housing minister, Trudeau also reorganized the government\u2019s efforts on both homelessness and housing \u201caffordability.\u201d\n\nNow both files are together under one minister and one roof. Hussen will be responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and for what used to be Employment and Social Development Canada\u2019s homelessness secretariat, both embedded as a department within the infrastructure department. He\u2019ll work closely with Infrastructure Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who is also intergovernmental affairs minister, to leverage relationships with provinces.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he brings personal perspective to the job. That was the case when he became minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship in 2017.\n\nA father of four (his youngest, a girl, born this week just after Trudeau\u2019s latest cabinet unveiling), Hussen was most recently minister of families, children and social development, where he struck child-care agreements with seven provinces and one territory, and rolled out a $1 billion \u201crapid housing\u201d strategy to combat homelessness during COVID-19 that converted hotels and motels into housing units.\n\nHussen talks a mile a minute about his plans, which cover the gamut of the Liberals\u2019 election promises on housing \u2014 an area Opposition parties also campaigned hard on and where the Liberals may find some common ground in the minority Parliament ahead.\n\nHussen said he has the same definition of affordable housing that many Canadians have: \u201cusing no more than 30 per cent of your household income on housing costs, whether it is renting or whatever.\u201d\n\nBut he said Canadians understand it depends on where you are in the country, \u201cand in large urban centres, that is no longer what the market looks like.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said the federal government is committed to that target in its affordable rental housing agreements. \u201cIn those projects, there is an understanding and a commitment and signed agreements to maintain those units at 30 per cent of household income or less.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal government says it will establish a $2.7 billion fund for non-profit housing providers to acquire land and buildings so that they can build more affordable housing \u2014 which Hussen said will help break down the \u201cbiggest barrier\u201d and put non-profit developers \u201con a level playing field with the private sector, where when a piece of land or a property becomes available, they can grab it and secure it.\u201d\n\nHussen also wants to make sure that \u201cteachers, construction workers, paramedics, firefighters, those who can pay some amount of rent but who are getting priced out of the rental market, especially in the larger urban centres\u201d get access to more of what he said are \u201caffordable\u201d rental units.\n\nHe wants to expand the subsidized, non-profit or co-op housing supply for vulnerable people who need it. He wants to end chronic homelessness. And he wants to help younger and first-time home buyers get into the ownership market.\n\nBut his first order of business is to bring in the promised homebuyers\u2019 bill of rights, he said. It will ban so-called blind bidding where bidders can know the asking price of a home but not what other prospective buyers are offering, establish a legal right to home inspection, require \u201ctotal transparency on the history of recent house sales and on title searches,\u201d and the government will move to restrict foreign non-resident home ownership, he added.\n\nStill, it is the promised $4 billion housing accelerator fund that Hussen believes will do the most to expand the housing supply in the country\u2019s largest cities.\n\nIt will be an application-based program that will support those municipalities that \u201cinnovate\u201d to speed up zoning approvals (such as through online, permitting technology) and that require more densification, public transit-oriented and mixed-housing developments. \u201cThey have to show more ambition, they have to show more innovation, and they have to show more openness, quite frankly, to going beyond the NIMBYism that we see in many parts of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMike Moffatt, senior director of policy and innovation at the Smart Prosperity Institute, said the housing accelerator fund is the \u201cpotentially most transformative\u201d initiative because it is Ottawa using its \u201cdeep pockets to basically accelerate reforms at the municipal level,\u201d although nobody seems to really know yet how it will work.\n\nThe other housing measures may be useful but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in there that\u2019s really going to make home prices that much cheaper or homes that much more available,\u201d Moffatt said, adding limits on non-resident foreign investors have been tried in B.C. and \u201chad a minimal effect outside of a little bit of downward pressure on prices on one-bedroom condos.\u201d\n\nHussen is the first housing minister Canada has had in nearly three decades, said Cathy Crowe, a visiting practitioner at Ryerson University\u2019s department of politics and a longtime street nurse, and that move caught her attention. But she is skeptical of the Liberals\u2019 intentions.\n\nCrowe said the year that Hussen immigrated to Canada, former prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien \u201ccancelled our national housing program and downloaded housing to the provinces. So Regent Park disappeared, and communities like St. Lawrence Neighbourhood were never built again because they lost that program.\u201d\n\nSince then, gentrification of Regent Park has led to a net loss of affordable housing units, she said. She\u2019s not so encouraged by all the talk of increasing home ownership, saying the bigger problem is affordable rental housing. That\u2019s where she\u2019d like to see Ottawa\u2019s efforts focused.\n\nCrowe says what\u2019s needed is an \u201cideological\u201d shift and a \u201cfully-funded national housing stream that would include new builds that could be done by co-operatives, municipalities, by not-for-profits, that would be ideally matched by provinces, the way daycare\u2019s being proposed.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/1996/exec/0314n02.htm", "page_content": "\n\nMarch 14, 1996\n\n(Executive Council)\n\nNew Cabinet Sworn in\n\nBackgrounder - Government Restructuring and Reorganization\n\nCabinet Ministers by Department\n\nDeputy Ministers by Department\n\nBiographies of Ministers\n\nNew Cabinet Sworn In The new Cabinet was sworn in today at Government House.
