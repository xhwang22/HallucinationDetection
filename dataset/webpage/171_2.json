Indeed, he meant to convey the opposite point.\n\nThe purpose of his provocative question, he said, was to illustrate the idea that some complex dynamical systems exhibit unpredictable behaviors such that small variances in the initial conditions could have profound and widely divergent effects on the system\u2019s outcomes. Because of the sensitivity of these systems, outcomes are unpredictable. This idea became the basis for a branch of mathematics known as chaos theory, which has been applied in countless scenarios since its introduction.\n\nLorenz\u2019s insight called into question laws introduced as early as 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton suggesting that nature is a probabilistic mechanical system, \u201ca clockwork universe.\u201d Similarly, Lorenz challenged Pierre-Simon Laplace, who argued that unpredictability has no place in the universe, asserting that if we knew all the physical laws of nature, then \u201cnothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to [our] eyes.\u201d\n\nLorenz discovered that this deterministic interpretation of the universe could not account for the imprecision in human measurement of physical phenomena. He observed that nature\u2019s interdependent cause-and-effect relationships are too complex to resolve. To approximate the most likely outcomes for such complex systems as weather patterns, he began using sets of slightly different starting conditions to conduct parallel meteorological simulations. This method is still used today to generate our daily weather forecasts.\n\nOn the cover of this issue, we pose a question: \u201cIf we could rerun life from the beginning, would it turn out the same?\u201d In \"Replaying Evolution,\u201d Zachary Blount addresses this question through empirical analyses of the Long-Term Evolution Experiment, an ongoing study in experimental evolution\u2014now approaching 30 years of investigation\u2014that has been tracking genetic changes in several initially identical populations of Escherichia coli bacteria. He investigates the role of small differences in the evolutionary substrate on the outcome of the process. Interestingly, in \u201cAnyone Can Become a Troll,\u201d Justin Cheng, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Jure Leskovec, and Michael Bernstein explain that the likelihood ordinary people will cultivate certain online behaviors also depends on a specific set of circumstances, ones that neither guarantee nor exclude the possibility of becoming an aggressor; and in Technologue, \u201cSmart and Squishy Robots,\u201d Yigit Meng\u00fc\u00e7 describes the unique technological conditions under which the development of soft-bodied robots became feasible.

For example, if you're sentenced to a year in jail, but you've already spent three months on remand, then you'll only serve nine months. This does actually make sense, especially since criminal proceedings can drag on for much longer than three months.\n\nA sentence of \"time spent\" (or \"time served\") means that your sentence is equal to the amount of time you've already spent in custody, meaning the two cancel each other out and you're free to go. Essentially, the jury decided that the time Father Moore had already spent in custody was punishment enough.\n\nTo provide an official example, the UK Crown Prosecution Service describes this process here.

Derrickson looks back at her mesmerizing performance, recalling actually building a puppet for the iconic dorm room sequence, only to have Carpenter do it all in-camera.\n\nFor this dorm room scene in The Exorcism of Emily Rose, we had built a puppet with these body contortions.

When Anneliese was sixteen, she suddenly blacked out at school and began walking around dazed. Though Anneliese did not remember the event, her friends and family said she was in a trance-like state.\n\nA year later, Anneliese Michel experienced a similar occurrence, where she woke up in a trance and wet her bed. Her body also went through a series of convulsions, causing her body to shake uncontrollably.\n\nBut what happened next was even more disturbing.\n\nAnneliese Michel\u2019s Original Diagnosis\n\nAfter the second time, Anneliese visited a neurologist who diagnosed her with temporal lobe epilepsy, a disorder that causes seizures, loss of memory, and experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations.\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy can also cause Geschwind syndrome, a disorder marked by hyperreligiosity.\n\nAfter her diagnosis, Anneliese began taking medication for her epilepsy and enrolled in the University of W\u00fcrzburg in 1973.\n\nHowever, the drugs she was given failed to help her, and as the year progressed her condition began to deteriorate. Though she was still taking her medication, Anneliese began to believe that she was possessed by a demon and that she needed to find a solution outside of medicine.\n\nShe began to see the face of the devil wherever she went and said she heard demons whispering in her ears. When she heard demons telling her she was \u201cdamned\u201d and would \u201crot in hell\u201d while she was praying, she concluded that the devil must be possessing her.\n\nThe Strange Behavior Of The Girl \u201cPossessed By A Demon\u201d\n\nAnneliese sought out priests to help her with her demonic possession, but all the clergy she approached rejected her requests, saying that she should seek medical help and that they needed the permission of a bishop anyway.\n\nAt this point, Anneliese\u2019s delusions had become extreme.\n\nBelieving she was possessed, she ripped the clothes off her body, compulsively performed up to 400 squats a day, crawled under a table and barked like a dog for two days. She also ate spiders and coal, bit the head off of a dead bird, and licked her own urine from the floor.\n\nFinally, she and her mother found a priest, Ernst Alt, who believed in her possession. He stated that \u201cshe didn\u2019t look like an epileptic\u201d in later court documents.\n\nAnneliese wrote to Alt, \u201cI am nothing, everything about me is vanity, what should I do, I have to improve, you pray for me\u201d and also once told him, \u201cI want to suffer for other people\u2026but this is so cruel\u201d.\n\nAlt petitioned the local bishop, Bishop Josef Stangl, who eventually approved the request and granted a local priest, Arnold Renz permission to perform an exorcism, but ordered that it be carried out in total secret.\n\nWhy The Real Emily Rose Was Subjected To Exorcisms\n\nExorcisms have existed in various cultures and religions for millennia, but the practice became popular in the Catholic Church in the 1500s with priests who would use the Latin phrase \u201cVade retro satana\u201d (\u201cGo back, Satan\u201d) to expel demons from their mortal hosts.\n\nThe practice of Catholic exorcism was codified in the Rituale Romanum, a book of Christian practices assembled in the 16th century.\n\nBy the 1960s, exorcisms were very rare among Catholics, but a rise in movies and books like The Exorcist in the early 1970s caused a renewed interest in the practice.\n\nOver the next ten months, following the bishop\u2019s approval of Anneliese\u2019s exorcism, Alt and Renz conducted 67 exorcisms, lasting up to four hours, on the young woman. Through these sessions, Anneliese revealed that she believed she was possessed by six demons: Lucifer, Cain, Judas Iscariot, Adolf Hitler, Nero, and Fleischmann (a disgraced priest).\n\nAll these spirits would jostle for power of Anneliese\u2019s body, and would communicate from her mouth with a low growl:\n\nHow Did Anneliese Michel Die?\n\nThe demons argued with each other, with Hitler saying, \u201cPeople are stupid as pigs. They think it\u2019s all over after death. It goes on\u201d and Judas saying Hitler was nothing but a \u201cbig mouth\u201d who had \u201cno real say\u201d in Hell.\n\nThroughout these sessions, Anneliese would frequently talk about \u201cdying to atone for the wayward youth of the day and the apostate priests of the modern church.\u201d\n\nShe broke the bones and ripped the tendons in her knees from continually kneeling in prayer.\n\nOver these 10 months, Anneliese was frequently restrained so the priests could conduct exorcism rites. She slowly stopped eating, and she eventually died of malnutrition and dehydration on July 1st, 1976.\n\nShe was just 23 years old.\n\nAfter her death, Anneliese\u2019s story became a national sensation in Germany after her parents and the two priests who conducted the exorcism were charged with negligent homicide. They came before the court and even used a recording of the exorcism to try to justify their actions.\n\nThe two priests were found guilty of manslaughter resulting from negligence and were sentenced to six months in jail (which was later suspended) and three years of probation. The parents were exempted from any punishment as they had \u201csuffered enough,\u201d a criteria for sentencing in German law.\n\nThe Exorcism Of Emily Rose\n\nDecades after the trial, the famous horror movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose was released in 2005. Loosely based on Anneliese\u2019s story, the movie follows a lawyer (played by Laura Linney) who takes on a negligent homicide case involving a priest who allegedly performed a deadly exorcism on a young woman.\n\nSet in America in the modern day, the film was both praised and panned by critics for its depiction of the sensational court case that followed the death of the character Emily Rose.\n\nAlthough much of the movie focuses on courtroom drama and debate, there are plenty of scary flashbacks that depict the events leading up to Emily Rose\u2019s exorcism \u2014 and her untimely death at age 19.\n\nPerhaps one of the most memorable scenes from the film is the flashback of Emily Rose screaming the names of all her demons to her priest. While possessed, she shouts out names such as Judas, Cain, and, most chillingly, Lucifer, \u201cthe devil in the flesh.\u201d\n\nWhile reviews of The Exorcism of Emily Rose were decidedly mixed, the film did pick up a couple of awards, including an MTV Movie Award for \u201cBest Frightened Performance\u201d by Jennifer Carpenter, who played Emily Rose.\n\nHow Anneliese Michel Is Remembered Today\n\nOther than her inspiration for a horror film, Anneliese became an icon for some Catholics who felt modern, secular interpretations of the bible were distorting the ancient, supernatural truth it contains.\n\n\u201cThe surprising thing was that the people connected to Michel were all completely convinced that she had really been possessed,\u201d remembers Franz Barthel, who reported on the trial for the regional daily paper the Main-Post.\n\n\u201cBuses, often from Holland, I think, still come to Anneliese\u2019s grave,\u201d Barthel says. \u201cThe grave is a gathering point for religious outsiders. They write notes with requests and thanks for her help, and leave them on the grave. They pray, sing and travel on.\u201d\n\nWhile she may be a source of inspiration for some religious people, the story of Anneliese Michel is not one of spirituality triumphing over science, but of people who should have known better than allowing a mentally-ill woman to die.\n\nIt\u2019s the story of people projecting their own beliefs, hopes, and faith onto a woman\u2019s delusions, and the price that was paid for those beliefs.\n\nAfter reading about Anneliese Michel\u2019s fatal exorcism that inspired The Exorcism Of Emily Rose, learn about historical \u201ccures\u201d for mental illness, which include vomiting, exorcism, and drilling holes in the skull.

According to the scientists\u2019 simulations, one can take a particle in a specific quantum state back in time and deliberately modify its state in the past without significantly changing it in the present. Voil\u00e0: the butterfly effect\u2014in which tiny changes progress into enormous ones\u2014is thwarted at the quantum level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated than that,\u201d groans Los Alamos physicist Bin Yan. \u201cFor starters,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s more than one way to construe the butterfly effect.\u201d\n\nIndeed there is. Sixty years ago, MIT Professor Edward Lorenz was running a weather simulation and rounded off one of the parameters from six decimal places to three. To his surprise, two months of simulated weather were completely different as a result. He would later liken the situation to the flap of a butterfly\u2019s wings spawning a distant tornado. That\u2019s the butterfly effect most often mentioned; it\u2019s an expression of chaotic behavior. In complex systems such as the weather, a small change in the conditions at one moment can produce an enormous subsequent change overall.\n\nLorenz version of the butterfly effect: For a sufficiently complex system, a small change in the present quickly balloons into a large change in the future. Lorenz\u2019s example was a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil subsequently producing a tornado in Texas. Los Alamos research demonstrated that quantum systems can do the same, such that a slight change in initial conditions can cause a quantum wave function to diverge wildly with time.\n\nBut an earlier version of the butterfly effect derives from the 1955 short story A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury. In it (spoiler alert), a man time-travels back to dinosaur times and accidentally steps on a butterfly. When he returns to the present, everything has changed: people\u2019s attitudes are different, words are misspelled, and a different candidate has won the recent presidential election.\n\nYan\u2019s point is this: the two butterfly effects are related but differ somewhat in character. Lorenz tells a story of chaotic behavior, of small causes producing big effects due to the complexity of the system. Such things can evolve fairly quickly. (Indeed, some scientists argue that accurately predicting the weather more than two or three weeks out will always be impossible, for precisely this reason.) Bradbury tells a story that\u2019s more timeline sensitivity than chaos\u2014small changes being amplified in modest increments over the long haul, like biological evolution\u2014and, technically, involves a backwards-in-time operation.\n\nEver the overachiever, Yan worked out the quantum analogues of both.\n\nQuantum chaos\n\n\u201cAt the outset, it wasn\u2019t clear that quantum chaos would even exist,\u201d says Yan. \u201cThe equations of quantum physics give no immediate indication of it.\u201d\n\nIn classical (nonquantum) physics, objects can be treated as a collection of point particles in distinct locations with distinct states of motion. Yet despite such a rigid description of reality, there are times when chaotic behavior readily emerges. Even a small number of simple objects can be assembled in such a way that small changes in the initial setup lead to wildly varying outcomes. A common example is a frictionless pendulum made from two equal-length rods joined by a hinge, similar to a human arm (although in the case of the pendulum, its \u201celbow\u201d may freely hyperextend). Where a single-rod pendulum released from a horizontal position would swing back and forth repeatedly along the same semicircular arc, a double-rod pendulum would flail about in an enormously complicated fashion, folding and unfolding as it swings and sometimes windmilling its lower arm full-circle around its elbow. If it were released from a slightly different height or with its elbow ever-so-slightly bent one way or the other, the sequence of motion would be entirely different.\n\nAt the outset, it wasn\u2019t clear that quantum chaos would even exist.\n\nBut unlike classical physics, the quantum description of reality does not specify discrete objects at distinct locations with exact states of motion. The basic \u201cobject\u201d is not generally a solid entity but rather a diffuse type of particle imbued with certain wave properties. The mathematical description of its state is called a wave function, and according to the equation governing wave functions, a particle in a fixed energy state doesn\u2019t change in time. The more general case of numerous particles in a mixture of states makes the math considerably messier, but a key feature remains: because the equation governing the time evolution is linear, small changes in the initial configuration remain small as time passes. There is no obvious provision for the emergence of chaotic behavior.\n\nStudying chaotic behavior in the quantum realm, therefore, has often involved a little cheating. A pristine quantum system (intended to be analogous to something like a frictionless double-rod pendulum, perhaps) is not chaotic on its own, in the sense that a change in initial conditions doesn\u2019t generate complex outcomes. But it might become chaotic if one accounts for a non-pristine system. In particular, by acknowledging that a quantum object, such as an atom, can never be fully shielded from its environment\u2014there are always at least a few stray radio waves or magnetic fields or whatnot flitting about, even in the most tightly controlled laboratory\u2014one can introduce some realistic variations into the equation and thereby obtain complex results. About 20 years ago, scientists defined a quantity known as a \u201cLoschmidt echo\u201d to capture the degree to which variations in a system\u2019s environment allow for the emergence of such complexity.\n\nThe connection among measures of quantum chaos was suggestive. We were closing in on something.\n\nBut is that really the same thing as chaos? Is it the Lorenz-type butterfly effect?\n\n\u201cIn those early studies,\u201d Yan explains, \u201cenvironmental perturbations, and the Loschmidt echoes that quantify their effect, were viewed as a necessary substitute for true chaos. But it was unclear if there was a genuine butterfly effect at work. After all, we weren\u2019t taking some tightly controlled system and perturbing its initial conditions; we were perturbing its exposure to the outside world.\u201d Even a boring, back-and-forth, single-rod pendulum might exhibit complex behavior if it were being batted around by wind and hail.\n\nBaby butterflies\n\nAs the 21st century progressed, quantum chaos researchers continued to use Loschmidt echoes and other comparable measures to characterize, well, whatever it was that wasn\u2019t exactly chaos but wasn\u2019t exactly not either. The relationship to Lorenz-type butterflies remained uncertain. Then in 2015 another quantity gained a great deal of attention within the research community: the out-of-time-order correlator, or OTOC. It examines any two measurable properties of a quantum system (its energy and its rotation, perhaps), but it does so in a scrambled time order. Specifically, it considers measuring one property in the present, then mathematically allowing the system to evolve backward in time and measuring the other property in the past, and subsequently returning to the present to assess how different the first property is. Now, quantum measurements normally disturb whatever they\u2019re measuring, so if you measure this and then that and then remeasure this again, even without all the bother of time travel, you generally get a different result the second time. But the OTOC captures a key variation on that effect by including forward and backward evolution in time. Essentially, the OTOC is a measure of the Bradbury-type butterfly effect.\n\nBradbury version of the butterfly effect: Time travel is used to effect a small change in the distant past, and over the long sweep of time, the present is significantly altered. Bradbury described a visitor to dinosaur times accidentally stepping on a butterfly and then returning to a present that had been completely changed. Los Alamos research, however, showed that quantum states can be transported into the past and altered there with minimal impact on the present.\n\nYan decided to see if he could find a bridge between the two key quantities in the emerging field of quantum chaos, the Loschmidt echo and the OTOC. He and his Los Alamos colleagues Lukasz Cincio and Wojciech Zurek\u2014(Cincio recently won the IBM Quantum Challenge, while Zurek is widely recognized for foundational research bridging the quantum-classical divide with a theory of quantum decoherence)\u2014set out to see if they could link the two analytically (pencil and paper) or numerically (via computer calculation). As it turned out, they could do both: they found that the two were intrinsically related, that the OTOC could be approximated from the Loshmidt echo. Complex quantum systems, it seemed, had elements of both butterfly effects.\n\n\u201cThe connection between OTOC and Loschmidt echo\u2014between Bradbury and sort-of Lorenz\u2014was suggestive,\u201d says Yan. \u201cWe were closing in on something. And yet, all along, there was a nagging sense that something was unsubstantiated, that we were getting ahead of ourselves.\u201d Yan notes that a classical chaotic system, like a double-rod pendulum, still has an exact position and state of motion at any moment, while a quantum wave function generally has neither. \u201cIt was never entirely clear that wave functions were suitable quantities for exploring of quantum chaos.\u201d\n\nWorking this time with a colleague from Caltech, Yan set out to see if he could learn anything by trying to justify the use of wave functions in chaos studies. Borrowing a concept called \u201ccircuit complexity\u201d from quantum computing, he analyzed the relative complexity of quantum wave functions in order to precisely quantify how much two initially similar wave functions will deviate from one another over time. This is the essence of chaotic behavior, slight variations in initial conditions leading to large, system-wide departures, and by this circuit-complexity measure\u2014unlike the standard measures of wave-function overlap used in quantum mechanics that stay constant during the time evolution\u2014the wave functions did indeed diverge with time. It even turned out that the complexity growth separating initially similar wave functions could be calculated with OTOCs.\n\nAt the quantum scale, reality is self-healing.\n\nThe circuit-complexity approach clearly worked, and its connection to the OTOC was encouraging, but was it actually correct? To verify this, Yan performed a key consistency check in physics, examining whether his new approach would successfully reproduce known results in a situation that had already been solved. For example, Einstein\u2019s gravity theory, which properly governs extreme gravitational situations, such as a black hole or the big bang, reduces to Newton\u2019s much earlier gravity theory in less extreme situations, such as the orbit of the moon or the trajectory of a baseball. Yan was able to show that the circuit-complexity approach to quantum chaos properly reduces to the standard measure of classical chaos under appropriate conditions.\n\nSo here, at long last, was the Lorenz-type quantum butterfly effect. A quantum wing flap could theoretically produce a quantum tornado. And while a lesser scientist might have just declared victory, Yan felt there was something special about the way the OTOC, a Bradbury-type butterfly, naturally shows up in Lorenz-type quantum chaos. The interrelation implied fertile ground for exploration\u2014and perhaps a hidden reality yet to be revealed.\n\nIf friction is neglected, a single-rod pendulum will forever trace out a consistent arc; if it is released from a different height, it will trace the same arc but climb to the new height with each swing. However, a double-rod pendulum follows a chaotic pattern of motion, swinging and swirling in a way that depends sensitively on the exact manner of its release. If the initial height is changed or the \u201celbow\u201d is bent, even slightly, the resulting motion will be completely different. Here, a double-rod pendulum is released from two nearly identical initial configurations, and they rapidly diverge onto very different paths. This is an example of the Lorenz-type butterfly effect: small changes in initial conditions readily progress to large changes in outcome. CREDIT: adapted from Ari Rubinsztejn/Wikipedia\n\nThe anti-butterfly effect\n\nYan and his Los Alamos colleague Nikolai Sinitsyn set up an experiment to test the quantum butterfly effect, Bradbury-style, on an IBM-Q quantum processor.\n\nA regular, nonquantum computer performs calculations by taking a bunch of bits of information, ones and zeros, and sending them through a complicated \u201clogic circuit,\u201d the elements of which are called gates. Along the way, the ones and zeros interact with one another. (For example, the AND gate compares two bits and returns a value of 1 only if both bits were already 1; if either was 0 to begin with, the gate returns 0.) A quantum computer does its calculations the same way, except that it uses quantum bits, or qubits, and has some additional gates that only work with qubits.\n\nQubits differ from classical bits in two important ways. First, they carry more complicated information than a binary one or zero. Second, when they interact with one another as they are passed along a logic circuit, they become \u201centangled,\u201d meaning that they cease to be purely individual qubits and instead share their states. Probing one member of an entangled group of qubits\u2014for example, checking its value\u2014will in some way affect the state of all the others.\n\nYan and Sinitsyn created a complicated logic circuit and prepared a group of qubits to send through it. However, for this experiment, they sent the qubits through the circuit in reverse order\u2014the last gate first, the first gate last\u2014to simulate the qubits\u2019 states evolving backward in time. Once the qubits had passed backward through the circuit, becoming entangled along the way, the scientists measured the state of one qubit. Because measurements in quantum physics affect the object being measured in an unpredictable way, this measurement amounts to deliberately damaging the state of that qubit and therefore the information it carries. In addition, all of the other qubits entangled with it would also be partially modified.\n\nBut here\u2019s the trick: now, Yan and Sinitsyn send the qubits, including the directly damaged one, forward in time\u2014i.e., passing through the circuit of logic gates again, but this time in the proper forward direction. To their great surprise, the scientists found that the damaged qubit, once returned to the present, was actually in its original state (the \u201cbefore time travel\u201d state), modified only by some small background noise. The same was true of all the other qubits. As long as the circuit is complicated enough to produce significant entanglement among the qubits, the potential damage is curtailed; any information damaged in the past is recovered in the present.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effectively the opposite of the Bradbury-type butterfly effect!\u201d says Yan. \u201cAt the quantum scale, reality is self-healing. Entanglement is preserving the present, protecting it.\u201d\n\nBetter living without butterflies\n\nSuccessfully exploring the nature of the quantum butterfly effect\u2014via either perspective, Lorenz or Bradbury\u2014would have been prize enough. But Yan and his colleagues got an extra bonus with the discovery that natural entanglement serves to restore damaged information. And this quantum anti-butterfly effect\u2014now that it is known to exist\u2014can be put to use.\n\nEntangled qubits might be exploited to provide a reliable rescue against information loss.\n\nThe most obvious application is a straightforward assessment of \u201chow quantum\u201d a quantum computation is. To what extent is a quantum computer actually making use of its quantum resources, rather than relying on its classical ones? \u201cIn principle, finding the answer is simple,\u201d says Yan. \u201cCreate a forward-and-backward logic circuit to check for the preservation of information. Since the anti-butterfly effect is a purely quantum phenomenon, the degree to which information is protected represents the degree to which it is quantum information to begin with.\u201d\n\nMore ambitious, perhaps, would be a direct information-security application. In principle, any information can be encoded in qubits and protected from damage with a forward-and-backward logic-circuit operation. Whether the threat of damage comes from a prosaic vulnerability\u2014such as a power surge, a computer glitch, or ever-present natural radioactivity affecting physical circuitry\u2014or from a deliberate cyber attack, the anti-butterfly nature of entangled qubits might be exploited to provide a reliable rescue.\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s the most important application of all: when we finally do learn to send people back in time, maybe we can construct a suitable quantum anti-butterfly gizmo to prevent time-travel tourists from disturbing the timeline we\u2019ve all come to know.

When we last met, we got to dig into the temporal madness of Terry Gilliam\u2019s 12 Monkeys, and yes, that was young Brad Pitt\u2019s butt! Also, if that film is to be believed, fate is a horrific mistress we cannot run from, no matter how many random voice mails you leave for future posterity. Quick sidetrack: does anyone else think 12 Monkeys would make a good double feature with Tenet? Well, there\u2019s no need to worry about that now, as this time out, we\u2019ll be time traveling with Ashton Kutcher, as he tries to use The Butterfly Effect to create the perfect life.\n\nIf you really want to read a breakdown of Tenet, or any other time related adventure we\u2019ve tackled during out studies in traveling from here to there in the then and now, you can always travel into our archives and read our studies nice and carefully. Though, it should be noted, that if you subscribe to the method of time travel that The Butterfly Effect displays throughout its twisted tale, you might not want to read too carefully. As an example of why you should be careful, I just opened up our past examination of the Happy Death Day time loops, and had to figure out how to escape all three loops that writeup entailed. Grab some compositional notebooks, a freshly sharpened pencil, and a ton of tissues with Aloe, as we\u2019re about to dive into The Butterfly Effect\u2019s chaotic theory on time travel.\n\nThe Time Travel in The Butterfly Effect\n\nLiving in suburbia already has enough of a bum rap, but the lives of Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) and Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) are filled with traumas all the way down. The pair of childhood sweethearts seem to be separated by fate, with Evan swearing to carve the perfect path for the two of them to live on. Which is where the young man\u2019s time traveling abilities come into play.\n\nWho's Time Traveling\n\nBlessed (or cursed, depending on how you see things) with the hereditary ability to travel back in time, Evan is one of two time travelers that we know of in The Butterfly Effect. The only other person we see with those abilities is Jason (Callum Keith Rennie), Evan\u2019s father.\n\nFrom When To When\n\nWhile there\u2019s no exact time frame given to The Butterfly Effect\u2019s chain of events, there\u2019s an easy chain of clues to give us the three years that make up the film\u2019s storyline. This time span is based off of the fact that in their teenage years, Evan and his friends go to see Se7en in its theatrical release, which happened in 1995. Using that as a benchmark, the childhood events six years prior would have taken place in 1989, with the bulk of the \u201cpresent day\u201d story being set seven years later, in 2002. So Evan\u2019s traveling between events that take place in 1989, 1995, and 2002.\n\nThe Purpose Of Their Trip\n\nThe one thing that Evan really wants in life is to be able to live in peace, with Kayleigh by his side. After accidentally triggering her suicide in the initial timeline of The Butterfly Effect, Evan gets the bright idea to revisit key points of traumatic events in their childhood, in order to fix their collective fate. But what starts out as a quest to save one life turns into a chain reaction that ruins several in its wake; leaving Evan to make another trip, in hopes that it will be the one to correct the entire mess.\n\nHow Time Travel Happens In The Butterfly Effect\n\nGood news, time travelers! The Butterfly Effect doesn\u2019t require any sort of special computers of doom, hijacked alien vessels, or 1.21 Gigawatt lightning strikes that mimic the presence of plutonium! In a story that sees tons of problems crop up in the lives of Evan and his friends, all of the good news we can get is much appreciated. All you really need to time travel is a really good memory, thanks to a habit of keeping journals throughout your traumatic, blackout filled childhood.\n\nPlagued by moments of lost time throughout his life, Evan is told to keep a journal of his memories, so he can more easily fill in the gaps he\u2019s been experiencing. However, those journals, and his inherited abilities, are the ultimate method of time travel in The Butterfly Effect. All Evan has to do is concentrate on his journals extra hard, read back the memories he\u2019s written down, and he\u2019s transported back to the moments he wants to go to in order to potentially change everyone\u2019s fate. This method also works with home movies, something that comes in handy when it comes to Evan\u2019s final time traveling trip in the big finale.\n\nRevisiting a memory can bring him back to that time and be in control of his past self.\n\nCan History Be Changed As A Result Of Time Travel In The Butterfly Effect?\n\nIn the history of time travel examinations I\u2019ve conducted here at the CinemaBlend labs, this is probably the most chaotic example of history being changed through the usage of time travel. Not to mention The Butterfly Effect takes its name from a bedrock set of principles in Chaos Theory that dictate the unpredictable nature one decision can have on changing the flow of time. At this point, I\u2019d like to just say a quick thank you to two pioneers of Chaos Theory: Dr. Ian Malcolm and author Ray Bradbury!\n\nAs we see throughout Evan\u2019s actions throughout his quest to create the perfect version of his life with Kayleigh, the more he tries to change things, the more out of control things get.\n\nWith Evan\u2019s life alone, we see him go from a simple psych student to a frat boy, an amputee, a prisoner, and an unintentional murderer. Travelling back in time to key hinge points in his own timeline, The Butterfly Effect sees our protagonist, and everyone around him, changing with every alteration he decides to put into play. Each time, that decision rewrites the entirety of the timeline from that moment forward, with some pretty severe consequences on the line.\n\nWhat Are The Consequences Of Time Travel In The Butterfly Effect?\n\nEvan\u2019s trials and tribulations in The Butterfly Effect lead to all sorts of variations in his life, ranging from something as small as a cigarette burn to larger consequences like the deaths and/or traumas of his friends and family. There\u2019s also a physical toll that Evan\u2019s journey takes on him, as while he\u2019s able to remember everything from the various timelines, by the time he gets to the final iteration, he\u2019s packed on about 40 years worth of memories. With each new trip, each deviation from the previous timeline, Evan\u2019s mind becomes more physically damaged and he come back with increasingly severe nosebleeds.\n\nThe Butterfly Effect does ultimately arrive at Evan arriving at a crossroads that see him arrive at one final play to save his life, and the lives of all around him. One path leads to a happier/bittersweet result, while the other is the darkest timeline possible. Depending on which cut you watch, the result differs drastically.\n\nThe Best Scenario In The Butterfly Effect\n\nIn the theatrical cut of The Butterfly Effect, Evan uses his mother\u2019s home movies and goes back to the birthday party where he and Kayleigh met, circa 1989. Evan tells Kayleigh that he hates her, as well as delivers the ultimatum that if she ever comes near him again, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you and your whole damned family.\u201d This scares Kayleigh into going to live with her mother, instead of her father, which wipes the entire history between Kayleigh, Tommy, Lenny, and Evan.\n\nKayleigh and Tommy live a happy life with their mother, while Evan and Lenny remain friends through life. Eventually, the boys even become college roommates; though the awesome memories of Ethan Suplee\u2019s Thumper will live on forever. However, Evan does find Kayleigh again in 2002, as they pass as strangers in New York. Depending on which of the four endings to The Butterfly Effect you watch, the two friends either keep going their separate ways, or reconnect with a chance of paving the way to a new future together. Either way, someone who looks a lot like Demi Moore is probably on the other end of that phone call, as this flash forward is supposed to take place in 2010; provided our timeline math holds up.\n\nThe Worst Scenario In The Butterfly Effect\n\nIf you watched the Director\u2019s Cut of The Butterfly Effect, there\u2019s a totally different, much darker fate that awaits Evan. Rather than just separating himself from Kayleigh altogether, Evan thinks that the world would be a lot better off without him. This is supported by a deleted scene where a fortune teller literally tells him that he was \u201cnever meant to be,\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t even have a soul.\n\nBy time the ending to the Director\u2019s Cut kicks in, the home movie Evan\u2019s watching is the day that his mother gave birth to him. Just when you thought The Butterfly Effect couldn\u2019t get any darker, our protagonist goes back to his own birth, and kills himself by strangulation in the womb. And based on the voice over from Evan\u2019s mother Andrea (Melora Walters) that plays during his death, this might be the fourth time this sort of scenario has happened. With Evan out of the picture, the rest of the Theatrical Cut\u2019s events occur, with Tommy and Kayleigh straightening up and Lenny never finding himself traumatized into a catatonic state.\n\nWe'll Come Back For You\n\nFriends and fellow travelers, thank you so much for taking this dark journey into the heart of The Butterfly Effect! If you like what you\u2019ve seen, I\u2019d like to remind you that you can hit the CinemaBlend Time Travel Archives and see past studies in temporal madness. Not to mention, if there\u2019s a time travel story you really want to see broken down through our scientific methods, you can drop us a line and we\u2019ll grab it in time. In fact, our next trip is one we\u2019ve been looking forward to for a while, and it also came up as a suggestion from one of you fantastic fans!\n\nLooks like it\u2019s time to go back to space, the final frontier\u2026 again. You asked for it, you\u2019ve been waiting for it, and I literally threw this into my list of initial stories to examine; yes folks, Star Trek \u201809 is next in the lineup! Which means I\u2019ll need to fill out some pre-expedition paperwork with Tempus Fugit Insurance, so the inevitable damage claims get processed and paid in time."}, {"url": "https://interestingengineering.com/science/what-exactly-is-the-butterfly-effect", "page_content": "Whilst Butterfly wings can be used to do some amazing things, do they really have the power to change the weather? The answer might surprise you.\n\nChaos is about to ensue so hold on tight.\n\nWhat is the Butterfly Effect simple explanation?\n\nOne of the best ways to understand a complex idea is to make an easy-to-understand metaphor. In the case of Chaos Theory, the term \"The Butterfly Effect\" was created to attempt just such a thing.\n\nRELATED: WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE A BLACK HOLE?\n\nThe metaphor goes:\n\n\u201cDoes the flap of a butterfly\u2019s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/faq", "page_content": "Yes. However, which ending is the alternate ending depends on which ending(s) you've already seen. Here are short summaries of the possible endings:\n\n\n\nTheatrical Ending: Evan travels back to the birthday party where he first meets Kayleigh (Sarah Widdows) and whispers to her \"I hate you and if you ever come near me again I'll kill you and your whole damn family.\" Kayleigh runs away crying. After a montage of his memories disintegrating, Evan returns to present day in the dorm room with Lenny (Elden Henson), and the two of them burn all of Evan's journals. Eight years pass. One day, Evan and Kayleigh (Amy Smart) are walking down a street, going in opposite directions. When they pass each other, they seem to recognize each other for a second but keep walking away.\n\n\n\nAlternate Ending 1 (on the DVD): Same as Theatrical Ending, only Evan turns and follows Kayleigh. Sometimes referred to as \"the stalker ending\".\n\n\n\nAlternate Ending 2: Same as Alternate Ending 1 only Evan and Kayleigh talk to each other.\n\n\n\nDirectors Cut (also on the DVD): The Director's Cut has several restored scenes. In one of them, Evan and his mom go to a palm reader, who tells Evan that he has no life line and that he was never supposed to be born, which upsets his mom. She goes outside to smoke a cigarette and tells Evan that she had two stillborn children before she had him. There is also a scene in which Evan finds an old hospital record, which indicates that his dad and paternal grandfather also suffered from blackouts and had the same special ability. This means the trait is genetically passed on from the father to all male children. At the end, while Evan has barricaded himself in the office, he starts playing a home movie his father made just as his mother was giving birth to him. Evan travels back into his mother's womb and strangles himself with the umbilical cord. The future is instantly rewritten: with Evan removed from the timeline, everyone seems to be leading a normal life. His mother is heard saying that she had three stillborn babies (him probably being the third), and she is seen with a different husband and a healthy newborn child (implied to be a girl from the floral dress she's wearing; due to the new father, the genetic trait is no longer being passed down); Kayleigh and Tommy go on to live with their mother and stepfather, Lenny grows up normally, Kayleigh marries happily with another man, while Tommy graduates and mentions the \"sacrifices made by parents for their children\" (which echoes Evan's ultimate sacrifice). Said to be the original ending but, because it did poorly with the screening audience, the theatrical ending was chosen for cinema release.\n\n\n\nThe Director's Cut has furthermore some additional scenes extending the storytelling. It runs more than 6 minutes longer than the theatrical release. Edit"}]}
