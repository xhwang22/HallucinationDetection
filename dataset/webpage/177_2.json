He has travelled extensively in imaginary worlds: Robin Hobb, Robert Holdstock, and especially J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Middle Earth, spending the better part of a decade in New Zealand in the company of hobbits, elves and dwarves for Peter Jackson\u2019s trilogies the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit.\n\nJohn is especially fascinated by history, art and architecture. When he is not roaming through the pages of his extensive library of old volumes of folklore, myth and legend, he is out wandering in the mountains and forests where he lives. This rich tapestry of interwoven threads of history and imagination is an enduring source of inspiration.\n\nHe has an abiding fascination with dragons, and is the narrator of a four-part mini-series produced by Arte Television, which saw John and his film crew follow their tracks through Europe and China. \u201cDragons!\u201d has been broadcast worldwide.\n\nBesides exploring Middle Earth, John has illustrated many children\u2019s books, created how-to books on fantasy art, and has illustrated Beowulf, Arthurian legend and many other sagas. He teaches drawing one day a week at a local school and has given master classes as far away as Beijing."}, {"url": "https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2014/06/01/89718-meet-the-man-whose-illustrations-have-helped-define-middle%E2%80%91earth/", "page_content": "Check out this interview with interview that Ethan Gilsdorf conducted with John Howe over two sessions in January and July last year. It\u2019s a corker.\n\nHowe is, of course, a long-time Tolkien illustrator and is currently working with Alan Lee as Conceptual Designer for The Hobbit movie trilogy.\n\nMeet the man who remade Middle\u2011earth\n\nby Ethan Gilsdorf\n\nYou may not know John Howe, but you have probably visited his worlds.\n\nHowe is among the best-known illustrators of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s works. Since the 1990s, Howe has helped visualize Middle-earth by creating art for various bound editions of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and other works. He also provided artwork for more obscure Tolkienania, such as calendars, posters, postcards, jacket art for the covers of audio editions and games and trading cards. Not only that, he\u2019s the man behind the pen for a variety of other fantasy art projects: Beowulf board games, Anne McCaffery book jackets, Magic: The Gathering cards, children\u2019s books, and folk tales such as Rip Van Winkle and Jack and the Beanstalk. Howe has also illustrated books on dragons, knights and \u201chow to\u201d instructional manuals for how to draw your own fantasy art.\n\nBut Howe\u2019s stature as a fantasy artist catapulted to new heights when Peter Jackson tapped him and Alan Lee, another prominent Tolkien illustrator, to serve as conceptual designers for his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jackson has said that even before he hired Howe, the illustrations that Howe drew of Gandalf (see banner image above), Bag End, the Balrog and the Nazg\u00fbl\u2019s flying beasts helped guide his vision for Middle-earth.\n\nToday, given the millions who have seen Jackson\u2019s films, Howe can be credited with irrevocably shaping how we see Tolkien\u2019s world on the screen, and in our imaginations. Someone had to design every dwarf axe, evil tower, hobbit mug, and orc prosthetic, and Howe had his hand in nearly every decision about Middle-earth\u2019s \u201clook and feel.\u201d\n\nPlus, thanks to the seemingly infinite production documentaries found in the Rings trilogy\u2019s Extended Edition DVDs, Howe has become somewhat of a celebrity\u2014at least among the ranks of those who care about the behind-the-scene scribblers, sword-forgers and model makers who work for the special effects house Weta Workshop and Jackson\u2019s fantasy empire down in Wellington, New Zealand. (Howe actually works for 3 Foot 7 Ltd., the New Zealand production company created by Warner Bros.) With his colleagues, Howe has brought new levels of fastidiousness to movie production design.\n\n\u201cJohn is highly productive,\u201d said Alan Lee about his office mate and artistic collaborator, \u201cproducing brilliant drawings in the brief periods when his turbo-charged metabolism allows him to sit still.\u201d\n\nThe tag-team of Howe and Lee moved back to Wellington when Jackson decided to adapt The Hobbit trilogy. The first installment, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, came out Christmas of 2012; film two, The Desolation of Smaug, hit theaters a year after that. When the \u201cExtended Edition\u201d of An Unexpected Journey was released last year, fans got an extra taste of Howe\u2019s magic touch. Expect the same sneak peeks into Howe\u2019s process when the extra dance mix version of film two comes likely comes out in October or November. Of course, there\u2019s also the final installment of the trilogy, now with the new title The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which arrives just over half a year from now, in December.\n\n[Read More]"}, {"url": "https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/john-h-howe-architect", "page_content": "In 1932 nineteen-year-old John H. Howe arrived at Taliesin as a charter member of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Taliesin Fellowship. There he would remain for the next thirty-two years, earning a reputation as \u201cthe pencil in Wright\u2019s hand\u201d before establishing his own architectural practice in Minnesota.\n\nThis is the first book to tell Howe\u2019s story and also the first full account of his place in the history of modern architecture\u2014as chief draftsman and valued interpreter of Wright\u2019s designs and as a prolific architect in his own right. Illustrated throughout with Howe\u2019s sublime drawings, this biography is a testament to the underappreciated architect\u2019s extraordinary design and rendering skills.\n\nInfluenced by Wright\u2019s principles of organic architecture, Howe operated under the conviction that \u201cthe land is the beginning of architecture.\u201d Architectural historians Jane King Hession and Tim Quigley show how this belief worked especially well for Howe in Minnesota, where his buildings appear to have grown naturally and organically from the landscape. Also remarkable are the visionary architectural schemes Howe created while serving time in prison during World War II as a conscientious objector\u2014futuristic visions that anticipated Eero Saarinen\u2019s later designs for airports and Victor Gruen\u2019s plans for America\u2019s first indoor shopping mall.\n\nAn enlightening look at an exemplary life in architecture, this book finally brings the accomplishment\u2014and significance\u2014of John Howe to the fore and at the same time illuminates a fascinating chapter in American architectural history.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/34748.John_Howe", "page_content": "* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.

He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art cl*es full, and left him in cl*es like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology cl* though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for cl*mates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got \"a real spark\" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.\n\nWith Alexis Metzinger during filming John Howe in Strasbourg\n\nA year after his high school graduation, Howe moved to Strasbourg, France to attend college. The following year, he enrolled into the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:\n\nThe first year was spent not understanding much, the second at odds with what I did manage to understand, and the third eager to get out, although in retrospect I certainly owe whatever clarity of thought I possess to the patience of the professor of Illustration.\n\nThroughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was \"simultaneously ancient and novel.\" He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his \"The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-d\u00fbr\", a piece inspired by Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of \"his\" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.\n\nProjects in which Howe worked include The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, Beowulf, Robin Hobb's books, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Cards for Magic: The Gathering, The Hobbit, Pan's Labyrinth. Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.\n\nSelected works\n\nThe Fisherman & His Wife , transl. from Brothers Grimm (Mankato, Minnesota: Creative Education, 1983).
