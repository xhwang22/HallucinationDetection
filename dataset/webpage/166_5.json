Those apple cheeks! Arms wide, head back, he radiates joy, even in antique black and white. That beautiful soprano flying high, talent and presence and just enough ham to sell it all. And it was a great story, too: Up from nothing! A shooting star! So when they found Frankie Lymon dead at the age of 25 one February morning in 1968, in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up, it was the end of something and the beginning of something, but no one was quite sure what.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem. They sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam. They were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett while the kids were rehearsing in an apartment house. A few months later their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts. It was 1956. Overnight, Frankie Lymon was the hottest singer in America, off on a world tour. He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)\n\nIn 1966, there was a brief glimmer of hope. Fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie Lymon was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery: Row 13, Grave 70. It\u2019s 15 minutes by car from the old neighborhood. His headstone is over by the highway. The grass is green and the ground is hard and uneven and on the left his stone is packed tight with the others. On the right there\u2019s a gap like a missing tooth. You can see the towers of two bridges from here, the Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and hear the traffic rush past on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Billie Holiday is buried here, and Typhoid Mary. This is where the Lindbergh ransom exchange happened. The wind comes hard off Eastchester Bay and shakes the pagoda trees.\n\nFor years Frankie\u2019s grave was unmarked. In the mid-1980s, a New Jersey music store held a benefit to raise money for a memorial, but it never made it to the cemetery. The headstone gathered dust in the record shop, then moved at last to the backyard of a friend of the owner.\n\nEmira Eagle had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.In Loving Memory\n\nOf My Husband Frank J. Lymon Sept. 30, 1942 \u2013 Feb. 27, 1968\n\nNot much room to tell his story. And what could anyone say? That the 1950s were long over? That innocence was dead? That by 1968 one America had vanished entirely, and another had taken its place?\n\nOr maybe that Frankie Lymon\u2019s America, doo-wop America, was never simple, never sweet, but was rather an America as complex and wracked by animus and desire as any in history. It was the same America that killed Emmett Till, after all, another angel-faced kid with apple cheeks and a wide, bright smile.\n\nSeen across the gulf of years, what we now think of as the anodyne, antiseptic 1950s America is revealed as an illusion. June Cleaver vacuuming in an organdy cocktail dress and pearls is a television mirage, a national hallucination. We had the postwar world economy to ourselves because so many other industrial nations had been bombed flat. And for every Pat Boone there was a \u201cHowl,\u201d an Allen Ginsberg, a Kerouac, a Coltrane, a Krassner, a Ferlinghetti. There were underground explosions in painting and poetry and music and prose. It was a kind of invisible revolution.\n\nA telling detail of that chaste 1950s mythology: to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother. It gets told and told and told\u2014in fact, he told it himself\u2014that he once got caught by a reporter who went to shows in New York and Chicago and saw that his \u201cmom\u201d was two different women, each twice Frankie\u2019s age. A story too good to fact-check.\n\nIt was in these 1950s that Ralph Ellison wrote Invisible Man, and James Baldwin published Notes of a Native Son. After Rosa Parks was pulled off that bus, Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the trajectory of civil rights in America. The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, and then came Little Rock and the lunch counter sit-ins at Wichita and Oklahoma City. What you saw of the \u201950s in America was all about where you stood. And with whom.\n\nWas the short, blinding arc of Frankie Lymon\u2019s career a morality play? A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cautionary tale? Or just another story of a young man gone too soon?\n\nMaybe it was a reminder that America changes in every instant and never changes at all. Our streets have always been filled with music and temptation; addiction has always been with us, long before \u201cus\u201d was even America, from the Lotus Eaters of The Odyssey to the opium dens of the Wild West to the crack epidemic and on to our own new opioid crisis.\n\nLooking at that headstone, you get to thinking maybe Frankie Lymon was the 1950s, man and myth, the junkie with an angel\u2019s voice, and that the stone stands as a monument to the lies we tell ourselves about America in the time before Frankie flew away.\n\nThe very night Lymon died Walter Cronkite went on the air and said of Vietnam, \u201cWe are mired in a stalemate.\u201d It was clear the center couldn\u2019t hold, and if you felt like the 1950s were five polite young men in matching letter sweaters, the rest of 1968 came at you like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The world lurched and suddenly spun too fast. Tet. My Lai. Chicago. Washington. Baltimore. Riots everywhere. Vietnam the pulse and drumbeat behind and beneath everything.\n\nSo when Frankie Lymon died that February morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for missing it. He was nearly forgotten by then, a five-paragraph item on page 50 of the New York Times, a casualty of the moment the future and the past came apart.\n\nIt was sad, but for a while, arms wide and head back, Frankie Lymon had bridged and bound all those opposing energies. That face! That voice!\n\nMan, he could sing like an angel.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

Frankie was the baby of the group, just 13 when they released their debut single, and his four bandmates were all aged 15 or 16.\n\nWith their of-the-moment sound mashing up doo-wop and rock 'n' roll to their racially integrated lineup (Frankie, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes were Black, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago were Puerto Rican), The Teenagers were groundbreaking.\n\nThey exploded on to the scene with 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', which remained their biggest single, before the hits dried up all-too swiftly.\n\nFrankie Lymon left the group, but his solo career failed to launch. He had struggles in his personal life, and tragically died at the age of 25 after a drug overdose. Below, we mourn teen idol Frankie Lymon, while celebrating his life and legacy.\n\nWhen was Frankie Lymon born and how did he join the Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon was born to truck driver dad Howard and maid mum Jeanette on September 30, 1942 in Harlem, New York\n\nSinging was very much in Frankie's blood, as both his parents sang together in gospel group The Harlemaires.\n\nFrankie and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with Harlemaire Juniors, while Frankie worked as a grocery boy from the age of 10.\n\nWhen he was just 12 Frankie became friends with Herman Santiago, the lead singer of local doo-wop group the Coupe De Villes, having first heard them at a school talent show.\n\nHe went on to join the group that became known as The Ermines, The Premiers and eventually The Teenagers.\n\nHow did Frankie Lymon end up fronting The Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers. Picture: Getty Images\n\nWith his stunning boy soprano voice, it seems obvious that Frankie Lymon would be the frontman (front-boy?) of The Teenagers, but it didn't start that way.\n\nAs said, it was Santiago who was leading the group when Lymon joined, but that all changed quickly.\n\nAfter impressing The Valentines singer Richard Barrett, The Teenagers got an audition with producer George Goldner. Santiago turned up late, Lymon stepped up and said he could take his place.\n\nFrom then on, the group was effectively Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.\n\nDid Frankie Lymon write 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love (Mastered HD)\n\n'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' was the debut single from The Teenagers, their signature song, and their biggest hit.\n\nIt topped the US R&B Chart, went to number 6 on the pop chart, and incredibly went all the way to number one in the UK singles chart, too.\n\nIt's endured to this day, and has also been covered by The Diamonds in 1956, the Beach Boys in 1964 and Diana Ross in 1981.\n\nAs for who wrote the classic song, it's a little bit complicated.\n\nHerman Santiago had written the basic song called 'Why Do Birds Sing So Gay?' for the audition with producer and Gee Records boss George Goldner, basing the words on some love letters given to the group by a tenant in bassist Sherman Garnes' apartment building.\n\nGoldner suggested some tweaks to the lyrics, while Frankie improvised and tweaked the melody.\n\nSo on the first pressings, the song was attributed to Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago, and George Goldner.\n\nAfter a while, Santiago's name was mysteriously dropped from the label. Then, after Goldner was bought out by Morris Levy his name was swapped in for the producers.\n\nA lengthy court battle saw Santiago and Jimmy Merchant being given songwriting credit in 1992, but further legal issues meant that this was overturned four years later.\n\nWhat happened to Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers after 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - I'm not a Juvenile Delinquent (1956) - HD\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers are best known for their stunning number one single, but they were far from one hit wonders.\n\nBefore 1956 was out they had a string of charting singles: 'I Want You to Be My Girl', 'I Promise to Remember' and 'The ABC's of Love' were all top ten R&B hits and all reached the pop Top 100 too.\n\nIn the UK, 'I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent' went to number 12. Even into 1957, 'Out in the Cold Again' reached number 10 in the R&B charts.\n\nBy then though, the Teenagers were beginning to fall apart,\n\nWhen did Frankie Lymon leave The Teenagers and what happened to his solo career?\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Goody Goody\" on The Ed Sullivan Show\n\nAs is so often the case when one of a group has the main billing, there was pressure to push Frankie Lymon into a solo career.\n\nGoldner especially was advocating for a solo Frankie, giving the lead singer solo spots during their live show at the London Palladium and having him sing to pre-recorded backing tapes.\n\nIn fact, while it was credited to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the group's last official single 'Goody Goody' (with 'Creation of Love' on the flip) was effectively a solo Frankie single with session singers.\n\nFrankie formally left the band in September 1957, and the planned Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium LP was released as the solo Frankie Lymon \u2013 At The London Palladium.\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Little Bitty Pretty One\"\n\nSadly, Frankie failed to capture the magic and success of the Teenagers as a solo star.\n\nHis move to Roulette Records may not have helped, nor would an apparently \"scandalous\" incident when he danced with a white girl during his performance on Alan Freed's live ABC TV show The Big Beat on July 19, 1957, prompting protests from racist Southern TV station owners\n\nAlong with his personal troubles, the incident caused his career to stall. As the years continued he had brief record deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records, but he failed to have a chart hit.\n\nHe even reunited with the Teenagers in 1965, but without success.\n\nWhat happened to The Teenagers after Lymon's departure?\n\nTeenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nAs well as Lymon's career failing to take off after he left the group, The Teenagers never really successfully replaced him.\n\nThe first replacement was Billy Lobrano, the first white member of the group. Meanwhile Sherman Garnes and Joe Negroni died in the late 1970s and were replaced by Bobby Jay and Frankie's brother Lewis Lymon.\n\nIn the 1980s the group experimented with female singers, including Pearl McKinnon and Roz Morehead, before Jimmy Castor and then Timothy Wilson took lead.\n\nCurrently touring as Frankie Lymon's Legendary Teenagers or The Legendary Teenagers, the group still plays today with the current lineup being Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Terry King and Terrance Farward.\n\nWas Frankie Lymon married?\n\nFrankie Lymon and DJ Murray The K Kauffman. Picture: Getty Images\n\nFrankie Lymon's personal life was complicated to say the least.\n\nHe married his first wife Elizabeth Mickey Waters in January 1964. Technically though, this marriage was never legal because she was still married to her previous husband.\n\nThey had a daughter together \u2013 Frankie's only child \u2013 but Francine tragically died just two days after being born.\n\nAfter his first \"marriage\" failed, Frankie is then said to have wed The Platters singer Zola Taylor in Mexico in 1965. To this day, no-one has found any documentation of the wedding though, and it's been claimed that the whole story was a joke or publicity stunt.\n\nThe Platters - He's Mine (1957)\n\nLymon's third and final wedding came to schoolteacher Emira Eagle. The couple married in June 1967, but it's worth noting that Frankie hadn't actually divorced either of his two wives before.\n\nThe complex swirl of legal and illegal weddings that may or may not have happened caused issues long after Lymon's death, when Diana Ross's successful cover of 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' sparked a scramble for Frankie's royalties.\n\nHow and when did Frankie Lymon die?\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers - I Promise To Remember (1983)\n\nFrankie Lymon told Ebony magazine in 1967 that he had been introduced to heroin a woman twice his age when he was just 15, and he swiftly became addicted.\n\n\"I looked twice my age,\" Lymon said. \"I was thin as a shadow and I didn't give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.\n\n\"You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he's gambling with death and, yet, he's got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike.\"\n\nHis deepening dependency surely affected his performing and recording career, though he entered rehab in 1961 and attempted a comeback.\n\nLymon appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue and recorded some singles, but nothing really took off.\n\nBy 1966 he was in trouble again, being arrested on a heroin charge. Instead of going to jail, he was drafted in the US army, but after going AWOL he was discharged.\n\nFrankie Lyman - I'm Sorry - (Big Apple)\n\nThe army did the trick though, briefly. Lymon is said to have remained drug-free for two full years after being drafted.\n\nIn 1968 though, he was told a major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates. He had a recording session booked. Lymon \"celebrated\" the news by injecting the drug while staying at his grandmother's house in Harlem.\n\nOn February 27, 1968 \u2013 the day he was meant to be in the studio Lymon was found dead on the floor of his grandmother's bathroom. He had died of a heroin overdose with a syringe by his side. He was only 25.\n\nLymon was buried at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx.\n\nWhat was Frankie Lymon's legacy?\n\nJoni Mitchell - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nDespite dying at such a young age and only really being an active recording artist for a few short years, Frankie Lymon had a massive impact on the emerging pop and rock 'n' roll scene.\n\nAs we already noted, both The Beach Boys and Diana Ross showed their love for Frankie with their covers of his biggest hit.\n\nOther artists who have namechecked The Teenagers include Ronnie Spector, The Temptations, The Chantels, Smokey Robinson, Billy Joel and George Clinton.\n\nThe influence of Frankie and The Teenagers on Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 is as clear as day, as well as all of Berry Gordy's other Motown bands and stables.\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love movie trailer\n\nFrankie's influence went beyond the most obvious, with Joni Mitchell covering 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', and artists as diverse as The Fall, Everything but the Girl and The Mountain Goats, referencing Frankie in their songs 'No X-mas for John Quays', 'Boxing and Pop Music' and 'Harlem Roulette', respectively,.\n\nFrankie's legacy was cemented with the 1998 biopic called (of course) Why Do Fools Fall in Love, which starred Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon, Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle.\n\nThe Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://face2faceafrica.com/article/a-junkie-with-an-angels-voice-the-tragic-tale-of-teen-idol-frankie-lymon-who-died-from-heroin-overdose12", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon was America\u2019s first black teenage pop star but by 1968, aged a mere 25 years, he was found dead from a heroin overdose in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up. Lymon\u2019s fate is tragic in that he was ill equipped to manage the fame that found him.\n\nLymon and the Teenagers, five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett. Months later in 1956, their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts.\n\nThe Teenagers comprised three African-American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago.\n\nAt 13, Frankie Lymon became the hottest singer in America overnight with a world tour to boot. Lymon by that feat was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. His voice and style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants.\n\nThere\u2019s even talk Berry Gordy may have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do.

While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nInterestingly just a few days before Frankie and his friends recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nThe 1950s American postwar economy was booming and music was part of that. Lymon told Ebony \u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away.\u201d\n\nBut that friendship will take a hit when Lymon and his record producers agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so the Teenagers were ditched. They landed another hit in \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d earlier done by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald. When Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. Their union lasted for a brief 18-month period.\n\nFrom here, the tide changed. Lymon was a heroin addict at 15 years old and despite his best efforts to straighten out, he relapsed. It didn\u2019t help when his mother died.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.

He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork about who was entitled to songwriting royalties from his best sellers.

He was the first African American teen heartthrob and inspired a host of other young musicians, such as Michael Jackson. Lymon\u2019s career was born at the very beginning of the rock and roll era and the song with which he remains identified, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?, is considered a classic. However, Lymon was an ill-fated pioneer who could not cope with his sudden fame and who spent the final years of his life battling drug addiction.\n\nLymon was born in Harlem on September 30, 1942. His father sang gospel music in a group called the Harlemaires, and Lymon became a talented singer of the street-corner harmony known as doo-wop. During the early 1950s, Lymon and his friends sang for donations on New York\u2019s streets and Lymon\u2019s distinctive, high-pitched voice led to the creation of a quartet known at various times as the Ermines, the Coupe de Villes, and the Premiers. The group was eventually dubbed the Teenagers and its other members, Sherman Games, Joe Negroni, Herman Santiago, and Jimmy Merchant, were all about a year or two older than Lymon.\n\nIn 1955, a chance encounter propelled Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers to a higher level. Richard Barrett, a member of the successful vocal group, the Valentines, heard Lymon\u2019s group performing on the street. The Valentines had recorded for Gee Records, a small independent label that had cashed in on the rapidly growing popularity of doo-wop music. Barrett brought Lymon and his group to the attention of the label\u2019s executives. Upon hearing Lymon and the Teenagers perform, they rushed the group into the recording studio. The executives were particularly impressed with a song entitled \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d and asked Lymon for the sheet music to the song. According to an account in Irwin Stambler\u2019s Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul, Lymon replied, \u201cNope, we don\u2019t know anything about written-down music.\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d was released in January of 1956 and shared the upper levels of the charts with such luminaries as Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins.

It became a hit in England as well, reaching Number One there. \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d exemplified the best in doo-wop music, with its graceful vocal line from Lymon and its rhythmic and precise harmonies. Although the group is said to have worked to perfect some of their songs in rehearsals, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d coalesced spontaneously\u2014Lymon filled in on lead vocals for the ailing Santiago, who had been scheduled to perform.\n\nDespite competition from cover versions by white singers, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d topped the charts for several weeks. Gee Records crafted an innocent, old-fashioned image for Lymon and the Teenagers\u2014they were often seen wearing collegiate-style school letter sweaters\u2014and the song\u2019s durability worked to prolong the group\u2019s moment in the spotlight. They appeared in two movies, Rock Rock Rock (which included a song called \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u201d that hit both American and British charts) in 1956 and Mr. Rock and Roll in 1957. Their debut album, The Teenagers Featuring Frankie Lymon, included several other hit singles, such as \u201cI Want You To Be My Girl,\u201d \u201cI Promise to Remember,\u201d and \u201cThe ABCs of Love.\u201d\n\nDue to the success of their recordings in England, Lymon and the Teenagers were invited to tour the country and appeared at London\u2019s famed Palladium. During this time, Lymon began to distance himself from the Teenagers. He recorded a solo single while in England, \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d which enjoyed moderate success. Lymon split from the group when they returned to the United States and attempted to launch a solo career. However, his distinctively youthful voice was changing and his popularity soon vanished. While the Teenagers struggled to survive with a succession of new lead vocalists, Lymon began experimenting with drugs and eventually entered a drug rehabilitation program at Manhattan\u2019s General Hospital in 1961.\n\nLymon worked hard to resurrect his career. He took drumming lessons, and reunited briefly with the Teenagers in 1965. However, his attempts at a musical comeback continued to be overshadowed by his abuse of drugs. In 1964, he was arrested on drug charges. Lymon married Emira Eagle, a Georgia schoolteacher, in 1967 and it appeared that the marriage had offered Lymon another opportunity to get his life back on track. He began playing in small Southern clubs, and planned to embark on a European tour with other 1950s music stars. In February of 1968, Lymon departed for New York to make a quick publicity appearance. When his wife tried to contact him in New York, she was unsuccessful. On February 28th, Lymon was found dead of a heroin overdose in his grandmother\u2019s Harlem apartment.\n\nFollowing Lymon\u2019s death, a bitter court battle ensued to determine ownership rights to \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d All of the Teenagers filed suit and two of the members, Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant, eventually won the case. At the same time, two women who claimed to have been married to Lymon battled his widow, Emira, for rights to his estate. The court determined that Emira was the sole heir to Lymon\u2019s fortune. Following resolution of the case, Emira Lymon\u2019s attorney William McCracken told Ebony, \u201cYou could teach a class in domestic law on nothing but this case. It\u2019s just been a battle royaie all the way.\u201d\n\nDespite Lymon\u2019s troubled life and tragic death, the popularity of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d has not diminished. It is considered a rock and roll standard and many artists, including Diana Ross, have recorded versions of the song. The song also appeared on the soundtrack of George Lucas\u2019s 1973 hit film American Graffiti. A host of doo-wop high tenors emulated Lymon throughout the 1950s, and the sweet-voiced male vocalists who recorded for Berry Gordy\u2019s Motown label owed much to Lymon\u2019s style. In 1993, the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1998, Lymon\u2019s life became the subject of a movie, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?,\u201d which showcased both his years of stardom and the mysteries of his later life.\n\nThe Teenagers Featuring Frankie Lymon, Gee, 1957.\n\nThe Teenagers at the London Palladium, Gee, 1958.\n\nRock \u2019n\u2019Roll Party with Frankie Lymon, Guest, 1959.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers: For Collectors Only, Murray Hill, 1987.\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love and Other Hits, Rhino, 1989.\n\nThe Best of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, Roulette, 1990.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers: Complete Recordings, Bear Family, 1994.\n\nBooks\n\nErlewine, Michael, et al, eds., The All-Music Guide to Rock, Miller/Freeman, 1998.\n\nLarkin, Colin, ed., The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Muze U.K., 1998.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, eds., The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul, St. Martin\u2019s, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEbony, December 1998, p. 68.\n\n\u2014James M.

The group later called themselves The Teenagers.\n\nThe Teenagers\n\nRichard Barrett, a singer with The Valentines got the group an audition with record producer George Goldner.

Lymon befriended Herman Santiago, lead singer of Coupe De Villes, and joined the latter\u2019s group that became The Premieres. When the Premieres became The Teenagers, they were still in the process of creating a song called \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love?\u201d It eventually became a bonafide hit in 1956 and it is still appreciated by fans of oldies music fans up to this day. When Lymon went solo, both of his and his former band\u2019s fortunes began to slide. Lymon struggled in his solo career, coupled with personal troubles and heroin addiction; he would eventually die of heroin overdose in 1968, aged just 25. The Teenagers, after Lymon\u2019s departure from the band, went several lineup changes, including hiring a white singer named Billy Lobrano. None of these moves, not even the band\u2019s brief reunion with Lymon in the mid-60s, could re-kindle their early success. However, the group soldiered on, and the new lineup are now performing as \u201cFrankie Lymon\u2019s Legendary Teenagers.\u201d\n\nMeet Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers\n\nAmerican doo wop group Frankie and the Teenagers gained commercial success with the transatlantic hit \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201d during the mid-50s music era. They were the first-ever racially-integrated group.\n\nFormed in 1954 in Harlem, New York, the group comprised of Jimmy Merchant, Herman Santiago (born February 18, 1941 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), Joe Negroni (b. September 9, 1940, New York City, New York), Sherman Garnes, and lead singer Frankie Lymon (born Frankie Joseph Lymon, b. September 30, 1942, Harlem, New York \u2013 d. February 27, 1968). Lymon was only 13 years old when he fronted the group.\n\nAt the age of 12, Lymon was already performing as a gospel singer in his father\u2019s group. Subsequently, he switched to secular music and became a part of the Premiers which was later called as the Teenagers.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers in their peak years\n\nSigning to Gee Records in 1955, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers issued the single \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d that became the group\u2019s breakthrough hit. The song made to the Billboard pop at #6 and at #1 on Billboard R&B chart in early 1956. It even became a bigger hit in the UK where the song topped its national music chart that same year. \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201d was the group\u2019s first and only biggest single. Lymon, being as the lead singer, became a teen idol which led to the group being billed as Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers in 1957.\n\nThe follow up single \u201cI Want You to Be My Girl\u201d was their second big hit, peaking at #13 on the pop chart while it was #3 on the R&B chart later that year. Two of their singles in 1957 became UK hits: \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Deliquent\u201d (#12) and \u201cBaby Baby\u201d (#4).\n\nLymon leaves the Teenagers and the group\u2019s later years\n\nBy 1957, Lymon was pulled out from the group by George Goldner, the owner of the group\u2019s label Gee Records. Goldner wanted to groom Lymon as a solo artist.\u201d On Roulette Records, he issued the song \u201cGoody Goody\u201d that performed well on the pop chart at #20. The Teenagers, meanwhile, recruited Billy Lobrano to replace Lymon, becoming the group\u2019s first white member\u201d. Nonetheless, having Lobrano to the group did not help their career, and Lobrano left the group in 1958.\n\nMerchant, Santiago, Garnes and Negroni tried to continue performing as a quartet and later as a quintet, adding the new lead singer Howard Kenny Bobo. However, they did not gain notable successes, and so did Lymon\u2019s solo career.\n\nOn February 28, 1968, the 25-year old Lymon died of a heroin overdose. In 1977, Garne was claimed by heart attack and a year later, Negroni succumbed to cerebral hemorrhage. Nonetheless, the group still tried to rebuild their career, replacing Negroni and Lymon by Bobby Jay and Lews Lymon, Frankie\u2019s brother. In the 1980\u2019s they also hired a female singer named Pearl McKinnon. But still, none of these formations saw notable success. In their recent years, they continued to perform as the \u201cFrankie Lymon\u2019s Legendary Teenagers.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll of Fame and in 2000, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/The-Fast-Life-of-Frankie-Lymon-a-Fool-for-Love-2994074.php", "page_content": "The way '50s singer Frankie Lymon is presented in \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" is \"mostly true. We played down certain things and fudged others to make it work as a film,\" said director Gregory Nava about the $25 million biopic that opened last weekend.\n\nThe singer-songwriter, played by Larenz Tate, died at 26 from a drug overdose in 1968. As the film shows, there was a trial nearly two decades later to determine which of his three widows (played by Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon) had the rights to his songs.\n\nWhat isn't clear in the movie was just how young Lymon, a mere 13 when he broke ground with the doo-wop classic \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" was when he was three- timing these women. \"We had to fudge a little on the age situation that might have been construed as a problem by audiences,\" Nava acknowledged.\n\nLymon was 14 years old when he began to date Zola Taylor (Berry), lead singer of the chart-topping group the Platters in the mid-1950s.\n\n\"And he was still just a kid when he started on the next wife, Elizabeth Waters,\" said Nava. \"Frankie wasn't much older, either, when he met the third Mrs. Lymon, Emira Eagle. All these women were 18 or 19, older than him, when he turned his charms on them.\"\n\nIn the film, Tate, who is 25, is portrayed as a mature-looking teenager far from 13 in appearance and demeanor. It's only at the end that viewers get a glimpse of the real Lymon in black-and-white concert footage. It's obvious he's just a boy. At 13, the pint-size Lymon and his singing group, the Teenagers, got a record contract. But they turned out to be a flash in the pan that had tanked by the 1960s because of division in the group and Lymon's drug addiction.\n\n\"Looking at Frankie Lymon from the distance of so many years, we were primarily interested in catching the spirit of the times and focusing more on the later and very entertaining story of his wives,\" Nava said.\n\nThe wives -- never quite divorced from Lymon -- took their claims of copyrights for Lymon's songs to a federal court in New York in 1986. The film shifts back and forth in time to look at their relationships with the singer.\n\n\"Nobody was sure who the real Frankie Lymon was,\" Nava said, \"and he wasn't around that long, even though he was a tremendous influence later on everybody from the Jacksons to Smokey Robinson, -- Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross.\"\n\nThere wasn't much interest in making a film about Lymon that was going to be just another biopic about a promising musician who burns out on drugs. It wasn't until the court case involving his wives cropped up that the film's producers got interested.\n\nFox has been singled out for her performance as Lymon's second wife -- a petty thief who turned to prostitution to help Lymon finance his drug habit.\n\n\"I'm gratified people like my performance,\" she said, \"because I worked my rear end off to get it right. Part of the work was putting on all that makeup so all the wives looked 30 years older for the court scenes -- it took three hours just for makeup and hair.\"\n\nEveryone connected with the film, including Warner Bros., was disappointed that the movie didn't fare better in its opening weekend. It grossed a meager $3.9 million, putting it in fifth place.\n\n\"I think it deserved better,\" Fox said.\n\nNava held out hope that interest would build with the release yesterday of two soundtrack recordings from the movie. One, on Rhino (co- producer of the film), features original music by Lymon and the Teenagers, the Platters, Little Richard and Clyde McPhatter. The other, from Elektra, has music from the later years covered in the film's 30- year scope, including updates of the title song."}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/258491/the-tragic-real-life-story-of-ronnie-spector/", "page_content": "The Tragic Real-Life Story Of Ronnie Spector\n\nIn the late 1950s, the all-girl pop group known as the Ronettes were just beginning to make a name for themselves.

Lymon\u2019s mother and father, Howard and Jeanette Lymon, also sang in a gospel group known as the Harlemaires; Frankie Lymon and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with the Harlemaire Juniors (a fourth Lymon brother, Timmy, was a singer, though not with the Harlemaire Juniors). The Lymon family struggled to make ends meet, and Lymon began working as a grocery boy at the age of 10.\n\nAt the age of 12 in 1954, Lymon heard a local doo-wop group known as the Coupe De Villes at a school talent show. He became friends with the lead singer, Herman Santiago, and he eventually became a member of the group, now calling itself both The Ermines and The Premiers. Dennis Jackson of Columbus, Georgia, was one of the main influences in Lymon\u2019s life. His personal donation of $500 helped start Lymon\u2019s career.\n\nOne day in 1955, a neighbor gave The Premiers several love letters that had been written to him by his girlfriend, with the hopes that he could give the boys inspiration to write their own songs.\n\nMerchant and Santiago adapted one of the letters into a song called \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d. The Premiers, now calling itself The Teenagers, got its first shot at fame after impressing Richard Barrett, a singer with The Valentines. Barrett, in turn, got the group an audition with record producer George Goldner. On the day of the group\u2019s audition, Santiago, the original lead singer, was late. Lymon stepped up and told Goldner that he knew the part because he helped write the song. The disc jockeys always called them \u201cFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers\u201d.\n\nThe group was composed of five boys, all in their early to mid-teens. The original lineup of the Teenagers, an integrated group, included three African American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes, and two Puerto Rican members, Herman Santiago and Joe Negroni.\n\n\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love?\u201d was released as a record by The Teenagers featuring Frankie Lymon. It made the top ten in the USA and it reached No.1 in the UK. The group appeared in the movies \u201cRock, Rock, Rock\u201d and \u201cMister Rock and Roll\u201d, and had 2 more hits with \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u201d and \u201cThe ABCs of Love\u201d.\n\nBut by 1957, the group was being billed as \u201cFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers\u201d. This caused in-fighting, and by September, Goldner had pulled Frankie out of the group to record solo. He released some songs of his own including the top twenty song Goody, Goody and eventually he signed with Roulette Records.\n\nBy the 60\u2019s Frankie had a serious drug problem. In 1961 he was forced into a drug rehabilitation program at Manhattan General Hospital. He attempted a comeback, but sadly could not kick his addiction and was convicted on a narcotics charge in 1964. The group was inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and a film based on the life of Frankie Lymon titled Why Do Fools Fall In Love? was released in 1998.\n\nHe was found dead from a drug overdose on the bathroom floor of his grandmother\u2019s apartment on 27 February 1968.

There\u2019s no question Frankie had one of the most unique voices ever but the answer to the question of what really happened to him really remains a mystery.\n\nOf course every article concerning Lymon\u2019s death says he died of a heroin overdose in February of 1968. This isn\u2019t one of those articles, in this one we\u2019ll look at the reasons why many believe he may have been a victim of foul play.\n\nIt\u2019s well noted that Frankie Lymon struggled with drug addiction but by 1968 he\u2019d been clean for years and had started a new chapter in his life. He\u2019d recently gotten married and for the most part lived a normal life in Agusta, GA. That is until his manager Sam Bray called him to come back to New York.\n\nOf course people relapse every day but there\u2019s more than a few red flags in this case. Let\u2019s take a look shall we?\n\nLet\u2019s start with a statement from one of Frankie\u2019s ex-girlfriends, Antonia Figueroa. In a 1998 interview with Westword she said the following. \u201cFrankie owed money to drug dealers who collected in blood.\u201d She then went on to say \u201cHe was starting a new life, he had everything to live for. Why would he go back to drugs. Why? Frankie was murdered. I know that with all of my heart.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Waters (Lymon\u2019s first wife) revealed that she\u2019d seen Frankie right before he died and he seemed happy. She also said that she seen his lifeless body and there was a bruise on his forehead\u2026 perhaps there was a struggle?\n\nAll reports say that a needle was found beside Frankie\u2019s body and not in his arm. Also there was no autopsy performed on his body.\n\nDaughter of one of The Teenagers said that her father also believed Lymon was killed.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re probably saying ok maybe he was murdered but why?\n\nDuring a low point in his life Frankie sold the rights to his song \u2018Why Do Fools Fall in Love\u2019 to his former manager Morris Levy. In 1968 (right before Frankie passed) Levy and Frankie\u2019s new manager Sam Bray were planning to release some of his earlier work along with new songs he\u2019d recorded including \u2018Seabreeze\u2019 & \u2018I\u2019m Sorry\u2019.\n\nWith Levy in full control of just about all of Frankie\u2019s older material and with Sam Bray in control of his new projects is it possible that the two of them put something together to gain more money from Frankie\u2019s name?\n\nIt\u2019s also been said that around the time of Frankie\u2019s death he and the other members of The Teenagers were getting ready to sue Morris Levy for unpaid royalties.\n\nIt\u2019s well noted that Morris Levy was connected with the mafia.\n\nWas it murder? Or did Frankie Lymon simply relapse when it seemed everything was finally going his way?\n\nTELL YO' FRIENDS !

The members were Frankie Lymon (b. Sept. 30, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.\u2014d. Feb. 28, 1968, New York), Herman Santiago (b. Feb. 18, 1941, New York), Jimmy Merchant (b. Feb. 10, 1940, New York), Joe Negroni (b. Sept. 9, 1940, New York\u2014d. Sept. 5, 1978, New York), and Sherman Garnes (b. June 8, 1940, New York\u2014d. Feb. 26, 1977, New York).\n\nThe broad-based success of this vocal ensemble helped signal the emergence of rock and roll as a part of mainstream teenage culture. The prepubescent soprano of 13-year-old lead singer Lymon, sounding innocent and girlish, represented one of the most appealing sounds in early rock and roll, and many later pop groups would feature a preteen male lead, most notably the Jackson 5. The Teenagers\u2019 first successful record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201d (1956), was followed by five more singles that appeared on the national survey lists of the most popular records in the United States. The Teenagers also appeared in two popular rock-and-roll movies starring disc jockey Alan Freed, Rock, Rock, Rock (1956) and Mister Rock and Roll (1957).\n\nIn 1957 Lymon left the group to launch a solo career, which failed when his changed adult voice, an unremarkable tenor, proved to have diminished commercial appeal. Long afflicted by a substance abuse problem, Lymon died in 1968 from a drug overdose. He and the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/teen-idol-frankie-lymon-tragic-rise-fall-tells-truth-1950s-america-180967506/", "page_content": "That voice! Those apple cheeks! Arms wide, head back, he radiates joy, even in antique black and white. That beautiful soprano flying high, talent and presence and just enough ham to sell it all. And it was a great story, too: Up from nothing! A shooting star! So when they found Frankie Lymon dead at the age of 25 one February morning in 1968, in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up, it was the end of something and the beginning of something, but no one was quite sure what.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem. They sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam. They were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett while the kids were rehearsing in an apartment house. A few months later their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts. It was 1956. Overnight, Frankie Lymon was the hottest singer in America, off on a world tour. He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)\n\nIn 1966, there was a brief glimmer of hope. Fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie Lymon was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery: Row 13, Grave 70. It\u2019s 15 minutes by car from the old neighborhood. His headstone is over by the highway. The grass is green and the ground is hard and uneven and on the left his stone is packed tight with the others. On the right there\u2019s a gap like a missing tooth. You can see the towers of two bridges from here, the Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and hear the traffic rush past on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Billie Holiday is buried here, and Typhoid Mary. This is where the Lindbergh ransom exchange happened. The wind comes hard off Eastchester Bay and shakes the pagoda trees.\n\nFor years Frankie\u2019s grave was unmarked. In the mid-1980s, a New Jersey music store held a benefit to raise money for a memorial, but it never made it to the cemetery. The headstone gathered dust in the record shop, then moved at last to the backyard of a friend of the owner.\n\nEmira Eagle had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.In Loving Memory\n\nOf My Husband Frank J. Lymon Sept. 30, 1942 \u2013 Feb. 27, 1968\n\nNot much room to tell his story. And what could anyone say? That the 1950s were long over? That innocence was dead? That by 1968 one America had vanished entirely, and another had taken its place?\n\nOr maybe that Frankie Lymon\u2019s America, doo-wop America, was never simple, never sweet, but was rather an America as complex and wracked by animus and desire as any in history. It was the same America that killed Emmett Till, after all, another angel-faced kid with apple cheeks and a wide, bright smile.\n\nSeen across the gulf of years, what we now think of as the anodyne, antiseptic 1950s America is revealed as an illusion. June Cleaver vacuuming in an organdy cocktail dress and pearls is a television mirage, a national hallucination. We had the postwar world economy to ourselves because so many other industrial nations had been bombed flat. And for every Pat Boone there was a \u201cHowl,\u201d an Allen Ginsberg, a Kerouac, a Coltrane, a Krassner, a Ferlinghetti. There were underground explosions in painting and poetry and music and prose. It was a kind of invisible revolution.\n\nA telling detail of that chaste 1950s mythology: to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother. It gets told and told and told\u2014in fact, he told it himself\u2014that he once got caught by a reporter who went to shows in New York and Chicago and saw that his \u201cmom\u201d was two different women, each twice Frankie\u2019s age. A story too good to fact-check.\n\nIt was in these 1950s that Ralph Ellison wrote Invisible Man, and James Baldwin published Notes of a Native Son. After Rosa Parks was pulled off that bus, Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the trajectory of civil rights in America. The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, and then came Little Rock and the lunch counter sit-ins at Wichita and Oklahoma City. What you saw of the \u201950s in America was all about where you stood. And with whom.\n\nWas the short, blinding arc of Frankie Lymon\u2019s career a morality play? A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cautionary tale? Or just another story of a young man gone too soon?\n\nMaybe it was a reminder that America changes in every instant and never changes at all. Our streets have always been filled with music and temptation; addiction has always been with us, long before \u201cus\u201d was even America, from the Lotus Eaters of The Odyssey to the opium dens of the Wild West to the crack epidemic and on to our own new opioid crisis.\n\nLooking at that headstone, you get to thinking maybe Frankie Lymon was the 1950s, man and myth, the junkie with an angel\u2019s voice, and that the stone stands as a monument to the lies we tell ourselves about America in the time before Frankie flew away.\n\nThe very night Lymon died Walter Cronkite went on the air and said of Vietnam, \u201cWe are mired in a stalemate.\u201d It was clear the center couldn\u2019t hold, and if you felt like the 1950s were five polite young men in matching letter sweaters, the rest of 1968 came at you like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The world lurched and suddenly spun too fast. Tet. My Lai. Chicago. Washington. Baltimore. Riots everywhere. Vietnam the pulse and drumbeat behind and beneath everything.\n\nSo when Frankie Lymon died that February morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for missing it. He was nearly forgotten by then, a five-paragraph item on page 50 of the New York Times, a casualty of the moment the future and the past came apart.\n\nIt was sad, but for a while, arms wide and head back, Frankie Lymon had bridged and bound all those opposing energies. That face! That voice!\n\nMan, he could sing like an angel.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

Stitt Junior High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan (New York City, New York) by second tenor Jimmy Merchant and bass Sherman Garnes. They initially called themselves the Earth Angels. Eventually they added lead singer, Herman Santiago, and baritone, John Seda, to their lineup and evolved into The Coupe De Villes. By the end of 1954, Frankie Lymon joined the band and they changed their name to Ermines and later The Premiers.\n\nLymon was born in New York City on December 30, 1942. When he was 12 years old and working in a grocery store, he met The Premiers. Lymon, who was was already singing gospel music in his father\u2019s church, transitioned to secular music after meeting The Premiers.\n\nAfter joining the group Lymon helped lead singer Herman Santiago rewrite what would become their most popular song, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love.\u201d The song got the group an audition with Gee Records in 1955. On the day of the audition Santiago fell ill and was unable to sing. Lymon replaced him. After hearing Lymon sing, Gee Records agreed to sign the band as The Teenagers with Lymon as the lead singer.\n\nReleased in 1956, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d quickly became the number one R&B song in the United States and the number one pop hit in Great Britain. Music critics credit the song\u2019s success as the likely result of Lymon\u2019s agile, ingenuous, and utterly charming performance. The song remains one of the key records by which the doo-wop style is defined and remembered. Moreover, its success in an era of racial segregation allowed Lymon to become the first black teenage pop star.\n\nThe group went on to star in Alan Freed\u2019s package shows and movies and later appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand. By the end of 1956, after touring through all of the United States and in Great Britain, the group was arguably the most popular band in the nation.\n\nIn 1956 and 1957 the Teenagers released five more singles which reached the Billboard R&B top ten list, and three of these songs \u2014\u201dI Want You to Be My Girl,\u201d \u201cWho Can Explain?\u201d and \u201cThe ABC\u2019s of Love\u201d\u2014 all reached the U.S. pop charts as well. As the band toured in 1957 Lymon left the group and began to record solo singles produced by Roulette Records.\n\nLymon continued to make records, as did the Teenagers but neither his solo career nor the Teenagers\u2019 career ever matched their early success in 1956. On February 27, 1968, Frankie Lymon was found dead of a heroin overdose in his grandmother\u2019s New York City apartment bathroom floor. He was only 25 years old. \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d and \u201cSeabreeze,\u201d the two songs Lymon had recorded for Big Apple Records before his death, were released later in 1968.\n\nIn 1993 Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000."}, {"url": "https://bertoltpress.com/2021/06/12/frankie-lymon-the-early-success-of-rock-and-roll/", "page_content": "One of the most famous and influential bands in doo-wop music history is The Teenagers, with Frankie Lymon as the lead singer. The five kids from Washington Heights are most celebrated for their contribution to the early success of rock-and-roll music. They introduced the world to a new brand of doo-wop music by speeding up the tempo.\n\nThe Origin And Influence Of Doo-wop music The sound of doo-wop music was born out of the creativity of the African American youth who dealt with the impact of segregation during its peak in the late 1940s and 1950s. The development of\u2026\n\nThe Teenagers got formed at a high school in Manhattan under the name The Coup De Villes. The group changed its name a couple of times (The Ermines and later The Premiers) before changing it to The Teenagers. In 1954 a 12-year-old boy, Frankie Lymon, joined the group. Together they wrote and composed the song \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201c. The song became an instant success and turned singer Frankie Lymon into a pop star.\n\nThanks to Frankie\u2019s success, the group got renamed Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers in 1957. This name change was not well received by some band members what, amongst other reasons, caused Frankie to leave and start recording solo. The Teenagers continued under their original name but with new lead singers what was not an easy task. The band even hired female singers to replicate the unique high boy voice of Frankie Lymon.\n\nFrankie Lymon (left) \u2013 The Teenagers (right)\n\nFrankie Lymon became the first black teenage pop star in America. But the truth about America\u2019s music industry in the 1950s was well disguised. Editor-at-large Jeff MacGregor wrote in an article for the Smithsonian Magazine that \u201cFrankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable.\u201d Frankie Lymon himself told in an interview with Ebony magazine in 1967 that he had no time to be a child: \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star.\u201d\n\nFrankie Lymon got hooked on heroin and, his relationship with the drug was recurring. He would go into rehab, partially recover, but because of events like the death of his mother, he would relapse. On February 27, 1968, the singer was found dead with a syringe by his side. He died from a heroin overdose on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor. He was 25.\n\nFrankie Lymon\u2019s life was short but, his legacy still lives today. He shaped rock-and-roll music as a genre and influenced the many performers who made an appearance in the decades after his death. Frankie and The Teenagers introduced the audience to a new doo-wop sound. A sound that got picked up by the American teenagers and therefore became mainstream. By speeding up the tempo and singing with more intonation, Frankie Lymon became one of the founding fathers of rock-and-roll music.\n\nDoo-wop music would eventually evolve into various genres, among them rhythm-and-blues and rock-an-roll. It peaked in the early 1960s before it became dominated by rock-and-roll music and a phenomenon known as \u201cThe British Invasion\u201c. Bands as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Animals became very popular with the American youth but, there is no doubt that doo-wop music had a great deal of influence on their music style and way of performing.\n\nNot only did Frankie Lymon signal the emergence of rock-and-roll music by introducing it to America\u2019s mainstream culture. He also influenced various other genres such as pop and Motown soul. Michael Jackson mentioned he got inspiration by Frankie Lymon and that The Jackson 5 derived from The Teenagers. Motown founder Berry Gordy based much of The Jackson 5\u2018s sounds on recordings from Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers. The Teenagers stood as a model for many Motown groups like The Temptations and The Supremes.\n\nReferences and recommended reads:\n\nTeen Idol Frankie Lymon\u2019s Tragic Rise and Fall Tells the Truth About 1950s America (Jeff MacGregor for the Smithsonian Magazine, 2018)"}, {"url": "https://www.goldradiouk.com/features/frankie-lymon-life-death-marriages/", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon facts: Life, and tragic death of The Teenagers star and 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' teen idol\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers in Streetlight Harmonies\n\nBy Mayer Nissim\n\nFrankie Lymon was the leader of the first all-teen hit rock 'n' roll band, but his short life spiralled into tragedy.\n\nListen to this article Loading audio...\n\nRock 'n' roll was always a teen phenomenon, but while most of the fans lapping up the new sound were that age, many of those putting out the records were well into their 20s and beyond.\n\nThat wasn't the case for Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers. Frankie was the baby of the group, just 13 when they released their debut single, and his four bandmates were all aged 15 or 16.\n\nWith their of-the-moment sound mashing up doo-wop and rock 'n' roll to their racially integrated lineup (Frankie, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes were Black, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago were Puerto Rican), The Teenagers were groundbreaking.\n\nThey exploded on to the scene with 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', which remained their biggest single, before the hits dried up all-too swiftly.\n\nFrankie Lymon left the group, but his solo career failed to launch.

Santiago turned up late, Lymon stepped up and said he could take his place.\n\nFrom then on, the group was effectively Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.\n\nDid Frankie Lymon write 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love (Mastered HD)\n\n'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' was the debut single from The Teenagers, their signature song, and their biggest hit.\n\nIt topped the US R&B Chart, went to number 6 on the pop chart, and incredibly went all the way to number one in the UK singles chart, too.\n\nIt's endured to this day, and has also been covered by The Diamonds in 1956, the Beach Boys in 1964 and Diana Ross in 1981.\n\nAs for who wrote the classic song, it's a little bit complicated.\n\nHerman Santiago had written the basic song called 'Why Do Birds Sing So Gay?' for the audition with producer and Gee Records boss George Goldner, basing the words on some love letters given to the group by a tenant in bassist Sherman Garnes' apartment building.\n\nGoldner suggested some tweaks to the lyrics, while Frankie improvised and tweaked the melody.\n\nSo on the first pressings, the song was attributed to Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago, and George Goldner.\n\nAfter a while, Santiago's name was mysteriously dropped from the label. Then, after Goldner was bought out by Morris Levy his name was swapped in for the producers.\n\nA lengthy court battle saw Santiago and Jimmy Merchant being given songwriting credit in 1992, but further legal issues meant that this was overturned four years later.\n\nWhat happened to Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers after 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - I'm not a Juvenile Delinquent (1956) - HD\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers are best known for their stunning number one single, but they were far from one hit wonders.\n\nBefore 1956 was out they had a string of charting singles: 'I Want You to Be My Girl', 'I Promise to Remember' and 'The ABC's of Love' were all top ten R&B hits and all reached the pop Top 100 too.\n\nIn the UK, 'I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent' went to number 12. Even into 1957, 'Out in the Cold Again' reached number 10 in the R&B charts.\n\nBy then though, the Teenagers were beginning to fall apart,\n\nWhen did Frankie Lymon leave The Teenagers and what happened to his solo career?\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Goody Goody\" on The Ed Sullivan Show\n\nAs is so often the case when one of a group has the main billing, there was pressure to push Frankie Lymon into a solo career.\n\nGoldner especially was advocating for a solo Frankie, giving the lead singer solo spots during their live show at the London Palladium and having him sing to pre-recorded backing tapes.\n\nIn fact, while it was credited to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the group's last official single 'Goody Goody' (with 'Creation of Love' on the flip) was effectively a solo Frankie single with session singers.\n\nFrankie formally left the band in September 1957, and the planned Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium LP was released as the solo Frankie Lymon \u2013 At The London Palladium.\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Little Bitty Pretty One\"\n\nSadly, Frankie failed to capture the magic and success of the Teenagers as a solo star.\n\nHis move to Roulette Records may not have helped, nor would an apparently \"scandalous\" incident when he danced with a white girl during his performance on Alan Freed's live ABC TV show The Big Beat on July 19, 1957, prompting protests from racist Southern TV station owners\n\nAlong with his personal troubles, the incident caused his career to stall. As the years continued he had brief record deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records, but he failed to have a chart hit.\n\nHe even reunited with the Teenagers in 1965, but without success.\n\nWhat happened to The Teenagers after Lymon's departure?\n\nTeenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nAs well as Lymon's career failing to take off after he left the group, The Teenagers never really successfully replaced him.\n\nThe first replacement was Billy Lobrano, the first white member of the group. Meanwhile Sherman Garnes and Joe Negroni died in the late 1970s and were replaced by Bobby Jay and Frankie's brother Lewis Lymon.\n\nIn the 1980s the group experimented with female singers, including Pearl McKinnon and Roz Morehead, before Jimmy Castor and then Timothy Wilson took lead.\n\nCurrently touring as Frankie Lymon's Legendary Teenagers or The Legendary Teenagers, the group still plays today with the current lineup being Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Terry King and Terrance Farward.\n\nWas Frankie Lymon married?\n\nFrankie Lymon and DJ Murray The K Kauffman. Picture: Getty Images\n\nFrankie Lymon's personal life was complicated to say the least.\n\nHe married his first wife Elizabeth Mickey Waters in January 1964. Technically though, this marriage was never legal because she was still married to her previous husband.\n\nThey had a daughter together \u2013 Frankie's only child \u2013 but Francine tragically died just two days after being born.\n\nAfter his first \"marriage\" failed, Frankie is then said to have wed The Platters singer Zola Taylor in Mexico in 1965. To this day, no-one has found any documentation of the wedding though, and it's been claimed that the whole story was a joke or publicity stunt.\n\nThe Platters - He's Mine (1957)\n\nLymon's third and final wedding came to schoolteacher Emira Eagle. The couple married in June 1967, but it's worth noting that Frankie hadn't actually divorced either of his two wives before.\n\nThe complex swirl of legal and illegal weddings that may or may not have happened caused issues long after Lymon's death, when Diana Ross's successful cover of 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' sparked a scramble for Frankie's royalties.\n\nHow and when did Frankie Lymon die?\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers - I Promise To Remember (1983)\n\nFrankie Lymon told Ebony magazine in 1967 that he had been introduced to heroin a woman twice his age when he was just 15, and he swiftly became addicted.\n\n\"I looked twice my age,\" Lymon said. \"I was thin as a shadow and I didn't give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.\n\n\"You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he's gambling with death and, yet, he's got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike.\"\n\nHis deepening dependency surely affected his performing and recording career, though he entered rehab in 1961 and attempted a comeback.\n\nLymon appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue and recorded some singles, but nothing really took off.\n\nBy 1966 he was in trouble again, being arrested on a heroin charge. Instead of going to jail, he was drafted in the US army, but after going AWOL he was discharged.\n\nFrankie Lyman - I'm Sorry - (Big Apple)\n\nThe army did the trick though, briefly. Lymon is said to have remained drug-free for two full years after being drafted.\n\nIn 1968 though, he was told a major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates. He had a recording session booked. Lymon \"celebrated\" the news by injecting the drug while staying at his grandmother's house in Harlem.\n\nOn February 27, 1968 \u2013 the day he was meant to be in the studio Lymon was found dead on the floor of his grandmother's bathroom. He had died of a heroin overdose with a syringe by his side. He was only 25.\n\nLymon was buried at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx.\n\nWhat was Frankie Lymon's legacy?\n\nJoni Mitchell - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nDespite dying at such a young age and only really being an active recording artist for a few short years, Frankie Lymon had a massive impact on the emerging pop and rock 'n' roll scene.\n\nAs we already noted, both The Beach Boys and Diana Ross showed their love for Frankie with their covers of his biggest hit.\n\nOther artists who have namechecked The Teenagers include Ronnie Spector, The Temptations, The Chantels, Smokey Robinson, Billy Joel and George Clinton.\n\nThe influence of Frankie and The Teenagers on Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 is as clear as day, as well as all of Berry Gordy's other Motown bands and stables.\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love movie trailer\n\nFrankie's influence went beyond the most obvious, with Joni Mitchell covering 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', and artists as diverse as The Fall, Everything but the Girl and The Mountain Goats, referencing Frankie in their songs 'No X-mas for John Quays', 'Boxing and Pop Music' and 'Harlem Roulette', respectively,.\n\nFrankie's legacy was cemented with the 1998 biopic called (of course) Why Do Fools Fall in Love, which starred Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon, Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle.\n\nThe Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://metrobiography.com/frankie-lymon/", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon is a famous American rock and roll/rhythm and blues singer and songwriter.

Lymon, who began abusing drugs after his career fell apart, died of a heroin overdose at the age of 25. He was interred in New York City\u2019s Saint Raymond\u2019s Cemetery after his tragic death. In terms of his personal life, the American singer was a polygamist who was married to three stunning women until his death. \u2018Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\u2019 was a 1998 film that chronicled his musical career.\n\nEarly Life and Bio\n\nFranklin Joseph Lymon, better known as Frankie Lymon, was born on September 30, 1942, in Harlem, New York City, New York, United States. His mother, Jeanette Lymon, worked as a maid, while his father, Howard Lymon, drove a truck. They were both members of the Harlemaires, a gospel ensemble.\n\nLymon began working as a grocery boy at the age of 10 to help his family make ends meet. He met the lead vocalist of the local doo-wop group Coupe De Villes, Herman Santiago when he was 12 years old. He eventually became a member of the band, which was later renamed The Ermines and The Premiers.\n\nCareer\n\nA neighbor handed the Premiers some love letters written by his girlfriend in 1955 to encourage them to write their songs. The boys were inspired by this and wrote a song called \u2018Why Do Fools Fall in Love.\u2019\n\nThe Teenagers, as they were now known, went on to audition with American record producer George Goldner. When Santiago, the original lead singer, failed to show up for the audition, Lymon stepped in and sang in his place.\n\nThe trio was signed to Gee Records by Goldner in 1956, and their first single, \u2018Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\u2019 was published. The singles \u2018I Want You to Be My Girl,\u2019 \u2018I Promise to Remember,\u2019 \u2018The ABC of Love,\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u2019 was released after that.\n\nThe Teenagers were renamed Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers shortly after. In December 1956, their album \u2018The Teenagers Featuring Frankie Lymon\u2019 was released. Several singles were issued the next year, including \u2018Teenage Love,\u2019 \u2018Out in the Cold Again,\u2019 and \u2018Everything to Me.\u2019 In 1957, Lymon and the Teenagers split up while on tour in Europe.\n\nFrankie Lymon then began performing as a solo performer, with Roulette Record publishing his tracks. In 1957, he released the songs \u2018My Girl\u2019 and \u2018Little Girl.\u2019 The rock and roll vocalist launched his solo album, \u2018Rock & Roll with Frankie Lymon,\u2019 shortly after these singles.\n\nHe released the single \u2018Up Jumped a Rabbit\u2019 in 1959. In 1960, he recorded the singles \u201cLittle Bitty Pretty One\u201d and \u201cBuzz Buzz Buzz.\u201d Lymon\u2019s career began to wane in the early 1960s. The singer\u2019s voice transformed to a deeper baritone when he grew hooked on heroin.\n\nHe followed up with the hits \u2018Jailhouse Rock,\u2019 \u2018Change Partners,\u2019 and \u2018Young.\u2019 Roulette later terminated their contract with him, and Lymon joined a drug treatment facility.\n\nThe American vocalist battled through short-term partnerships with Columbia Records and 20th Century Fox Records during the next four years. He was able to release the singles \u2018To Each His Own\u2019 and \u2018Somewhere\u2019 under these recordings.\n\nLymon then performed in a revue at the Apollo. He also attempted but failed to videotape several live performances.

Income Source Rock Singer Net Worth Verification Status Not Verified\n\nMarried Life\n\nFrankie Lymon started seeing Elizabeth Waters and married her in 1964.\n\nThe couple had a baby girl, who died at Lenox Hill Hospital barely two days after her birth. Few people are aware that Lymon\u2019s marriage to Waters was unconstitutional because she was still married to her first husband.\n\nAfter his marriage to Waters fell up, Lymon began dating Zola Taylor. The couple is said to have married in 1965. Their marriage, however, was thought to be a PR gimmick, as there was no formal paperwork of their union. Lymon\u2019s drug addiction caused the pair to split up in 1968.\n\nMeanwhile, Lymon had fallen in love with another woman, Emira Eagle, in 1967. In June of 1967, they married.\n\nLymon was a polygamist who married three women before his death: Waters, Taylor, and Eagle.\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was discovered dead from a heroin overdose. He died while he was only 25 years old. He was laid to rest in the Catholic cemetery of Saint Raymond.\n\nFacts\n\n\u2018The Golden Throat\u2019 was his moniker.\n\nFrankie Lymon has been described as one of Michael Jackson\u2019s, Diana Ross\u2019, Ronnie Spector\u2019s, The Chantels\u2019, George Clinton\u2019s, The Temptations\u2019, Len Barry\u2019s, Smokey Robinson\u2019s, and The Beach Boys\u2019 idols.\n\nRead More: Ximena C\u00f3rdoba, Sapphire Nicole Howell, Natalie Knepp, Caroline Gregory"}, {"url": "https://face2faceafrica.com/article/a-junkie-with-an-angels-voice-the-tragic-tale-of-teen-idol-frankie-lymon-who-died-from-heroin-overdose12", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon was America\u2019s first black teenage pop star but by 1968, aged a mere 25 years, he was found dead from a heroin overdose in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up. Lymon\u2019s fate is tragic in that he was ill equipped to manage the fame that found him.\n\nLymon and the Teenagers, five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett. Months later in 1956, their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts.\n\nThe Teenagers comprised three African-American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago.\n\nAt 13, Frankie Lymon became the hottest singer in America overnight with a world tour to boot. Lymon by that feat was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. His voice and style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants.\n\nThere\u2019s even talk Berry Gordy may have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nInterestingly just a few days before Frankie and his friends recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nThe 1950s American postwar economy was booming and music was part of that. Lymon told Ebony \u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away.\u201d\n\nBut that friendship will take a hit when Lymon and his record producers agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so the Teenagers were ditched. They landed another hit in \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d earlier done by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald. When Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. Their union lasted for a brief 18-month period.\n\nFrom here, the tide changed. Lymon was a heroin addict at 15 years old and despite his best efforts to straighten out, he relapsed. It didn\u2019t help when his mother died.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nIn 1966, fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor. He was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery but for years, Lymon\u2019s grave was unmarked until Emira Eagle, his third wife had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nFame has its gifts and young as Lymon was, he had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork about who was entitled to songwriting royalties from his best sellers. None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.\n\nIt was also said that to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother except keen observers noted different women emerged as mothers in various cities. He sang for Queen Elizabeth II at the London Palladium and performed in nightclubs and theaters worldwide. Lymon also served as an Army private at Fort Gordon.\n\nFrankie Lymon who could sing like an angel but was a troubled soul influenced Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Len Barry and Michael Jackson as well as a host of other singers."}, {"url": "https://famousbio.net/frankie-lymon-5293.html", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon's Personal Details\n\nFrankie Lymon was an American rock and roll singer and songwriter\n\nInformation Detail Birthday September 30, 1942 Died on February 27, 1968 Nationality American Famous Black Singers, Singers, Rock Singers City/State New York City, New Yorkers Spouses Emira Eagle (m. 1967\u20131968), Zola Taylor (m. 1965\u20131968) Known as Franklin Joseph Lymon Cause of death Drug Overdose Birth Place New York City, New York, United States Gender Male Father Howard Lymon Mother Jeanette Lymon Sun Sign Libra Born in New York City, New York, United States Famous as Singer Died at Age 25\n\n// Famous Black Singers\n\nSZA SZA is an American singer-songwriter known for her debut studio album \u2018Ctrl.\u2019 Check out this biography to know about her childhood, family life, achievements and fun facts about her.

The group was composed of five boys, all in their early to mid-teens. The original lineup of the Teenagers, an integrated group, included three African-American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago.\n\nThe Teenagers\u2019 first single, 1956\u2019s \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love,\u201d was also its biggest hit. After Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. He was found dead at the age of 25 on the floor of his grandmother\u2019s bathroom from a heroin overdose. His life was dramatized in the 1998 film Why Do Fools Fall In Love.\n\nFrankie Lymon was born in Harlem, New York on September 30, 1942 to Howard and Jeanette Lymon. Howard worked as a truck driver and Jeanette worked as a maid. Howard and Jeanette Lymon also sang in a gospel group known as the Harlemaires; Frankie and his brothers, Lewis and Howie, sang with the Harlemaire Juniors (a fourth Lymon brother, Timmy, was a singer, though not with the Harlemaire Juniors). The Lymons struggled to make ends meet, so, at age 10, Lymon began working as a grocery boy.\n\nAt the age of 12 in 1954, Lymon heard a local doo-wop group known as the Coupe De Villes at a school talent show. He became friends with the lead singer, Herman Santiago, and he eventually became a member of the group, now calling itself both The Ermines and The Premiers. Dennis Jackson of Columbus, Georgia, was one of the main influences in Lymon\u2019s life. His personal donation of $500 helped start Lymon\u2019s career.\n\nOne day in 1955, a neighbor gave The Premiers several love letters that had been written to him by his girlfriend, with the hopes that he could give the boys inspiration to write their own songs. Merchant and Santiago adapted one of the letters into a song called \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d. The Premiers, now calling themselves The Teenagers, got their first shot at fame after impressing Richard Barrett, a singer with The Valentines. Barrett, in turn, got the group an audition with record producer George Goldner. On the day of the group\u2019s audition, Santiago, the original lead singer, was late. Lymon stepped up and told Goldner that he knew the part because he helped write the song. The disc jockeys always called them \u201cFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers\u201d.\n\nGoldner signed the group to Gee Records, and \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d became its first single in January 1956. The single peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard pop singles chart, and topped the Billboard R&B singles chart for five weeks.\n\nSix other top blues 10 singles followed over the next year or so: \u201cI Want You to Be My Girl\u201d, \u201cI Promise to Remember\u201d, \u201cWho Can Explain?\u201d, \u201cOut in the Cold Again\u201d, \u201cThe ABC\u2019s of Love\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u201d, and \u201cBaby Baby\u201d were also popular Teenagers releases. \u201cI Want You To Be My Girl\u201d gave the band its second pop hit, reaching No. 13 on the national Billboard Hot 100 chart. \u201cGoody Goody\u201d (written by Matty Malneck and Johnny Mercer and originally performed by Benny Goodman) was a No. 20 pop hit but did not appear on the R&B chart. The Teenagers placed two other singles in the lower half of the pop chart.\n\nWith the release of \u201cI Want You To Be My Girl\u201d, the group\u2019s second single, The Teenagers became Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers. An album, \u201cThe Teenagers Featuring Frankie Lymon\u201d, was released in December 1956.\n\nIn early 1957, Lymon and the Teenagers broke up while on a tour in Europe. During an engagement at the London Palladium, Goldner began pushing Lymon as a solo act, giving him solo spots in the show. Lymon began performing with backing from pre-recorded tapes. The group\u2019s last single, \u201cGoody Goody\u201d backed with \u201cCreation of Love,\u201d initially retained the \u201cFrankie Lymon & the Teenagers\u201d credit, but they were actually solo recordings (with backing by session singers). Lymon had officially departed from the group by September 1957; an in-progress studio album called Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium was instead issued as a Lymon solo release.\n\nAs a solo artist, Lymon was not nearly as successful as he had been with the Teenagers. Beginning with his second solo release, \u201cMy Girl\u201d, Lymon had moved to Roulette Records. On a July 19, 1957 episode of Alan Freed\u2019s live ABC TV show The Big Beat, Lymon began dancing with a white teenage girl while he was performing. His actions caused a scandal, particularly among Southern TV station owners, and The Big Beat was subsequently canceled. There is no surviving footage because the episode was taped over, according to Judith Fisher Freed.\n\nLymon\u2019s slowly declining sales fell sharply in the early 1960s. Within the span of one year, as a result of heroin use, his voice changed from his signature tenor to a much deeper baritone. His highest-charting solo hit was a cover of Bobby Day\u2019s \u201cLittle Bitty Pretty One\u201d, which peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 pop chart in 1960 and which had been recorded in 1957. Addicted to heroin since the age of 15, Lymon fell further into his habit, and his performing career went into decline. According to Lymon in an interview with Ebony magazine in 1967, he was first introduced to heroin when he was 15 by a woman twice his age. In 1961, Roulette, now run by Morris Levy, ended their contract with Lymon and he entered a drug rehabilitation program.\n\nAfter losing Lymon, the Teenagers went through a string of replacement singers, the first of whom was Billy Lobrano. In 1960, Howard Kenny Bobo sang lead on \u201cTonight\u2019s the Night\u201d with the Teenagers; later that year, Johnny Houston sang lead on two songs. The Teenagers, who had been moved by Morris Levy to End Records, were released from their contract in 1961. The Teenagers briefly reunited with Lymon in 1965, without success.\n\nOver the next four years, Lymon struggled through short-lived deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records. Lymon began a relationship with Elizabeth Mickey Waters, who became his first wife in January 1964 and the mother of his only child, a baby girl named Francine who died two days after birth at Lenox Hill Hospital. Lymon\u2019s marriage to Waters was not legal because she was still married to her first husband. After the marriage failed, he moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, where he began a romantic relationship with Zola Taylor, a member of the Platters. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965 although their relationship ended several months later, purportedly because of Lymon\u2019s drug habits. Lymon, however, had been known to say that their marriage was a publicity stunt, and Taylor could produce no legal documentation of their marriage. In Major Robinson\u2019s gossip column of June 6, 1966, Zola said the whole thing was a joke that she went along with at the time (October 1965).\n\nHe appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue, adding an extended tap dance number. Lymon recorded several live performances (such as \u201cMelinda\u201d in 1959), but none rose on the charts. His final television performance was on Hollywood a Go-Go in 1965, where the then-22-year-old singer lip-synched to the recording of his 13-year-old self singing \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love.\u201d\n\nThe same year, Lymon was drafted into the United States Army and reported to Fort Gordon, Georgia, near Augusta, Georgia, for training. While in the Augusta area, Lymon met and fell in love with Emira Eagle, a schoolteacher at Hornsby Elementary in Augusta. The two were wed in June 1967, and Lymon repeatedly went AWOL to secure gigs at small Southern clubs. Dishonorably discharged from the Army, Lymon moved into his wife\u2019s home and continued to perform sporadically.\n\nTraveling to New York in 1968, Lymon was signed by manager Sam Bray to his Big Apple label, and the singer returned to recording. Roulette Records expressed interest in releasing Lymon\u2019s records in conjunction with Big Apple and scheduled a recording session for February 28. A major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates, owned by radio personalities Frankie Crocker, Herb Hamlett and Eddie O\u2019Jay. Lymon, staying at his grandmother\u2019s house in Harlem where he had grown up, celebrated his good fortune by taking heroin; he had remained clean ever since entering the Army three years earlier.\n\nOn February 27, 1968, Lymon was found dead of a heroin overdose at the age of 25 on the floor of his grandmother\u2019s bathroom. Lymon, a Baptist, was buried at Catholic Saint Raymond\u2019s Cemetery in the Throgs Neck section of The Bronx, New York City, New York.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d and \u201cSeabreeze\u201d, the two songs Lymon had recorded for Big Apple before his death, were released later in 1968."}]}
