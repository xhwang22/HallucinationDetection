{"Pattern's sound is a mix of indie rock, soul, and jazz, with a focus on intricate vocal harmonies and complex rhythms.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/jazz", "page_content": "Nonetheless, one important aspect of jazz clearly does distinguish it from other traditional musical areas, especially from classical music: the jazz performer is primarily or wholly a creative, improvising composer\u2014his own composer, as it were\u2014whereas in classical music the performer typically expresses and interprets someone else\u2019s composition .\n\nMost early classical composers (such as Aaron Copland , John Alden Carpenter \u2014and even Igor Stravinsky , who became smitten with jazz) were drawn to its instrumental sounds and timbres, the unusual effects and inflections of jazz playing (brass mutes, glissandos, scoops, bends, and stringless ensembles), and its syncopations, completely ignoring, or at least underappreciating, the extemporized aspects of jazz. Indeed, the sounds that jazz musicians make on their instruments\u2014the way they attack, inflect, release, embellish, and colour notes\u2014characterize jazz playing to such an extent that if a classical piece were played by jazz musicians in their idiomatic phrasings, it would in all likelihood be called jazz.\n\nJazz, in fact, is not\u2014and never has been\u2014an entirely composed, predetermined music, nor is it an entirely extemporized one. For almost all of its history it has employed both creative approaches in varying degrees and endless permutations. And yet, despite these diverse terminological confusions, jazz seems to be instantly recognized and distinguished as something separate from all other forms of musical expression . To repeat Armstrong\u2019s famous reply when asked what swing meant: \u201cIf you have to ask, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d To add to the confusion, there often have been seemingly unbridgeable perceptual differences between the producers of jazz (performers, composers, and arrangers) and its audiences. For example, with the arrival of free jazz and other latter-day avant-garde manifestations , many senior musicians maintained that music that didn\u2019t swing was not jazz.\n\nAny attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile . Jazz has been, from its very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, a constantly evolving, expanding, changing music, passing through several distinctive phases of development; a definition that might apply to one phase\u2014for instance, to New Orleans style or swing \u2014becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz . Early attempts to define jazz as a music whose chief characteristic was improvisation , for example, turned out to be too restrictive and largely untrue, since composition , arrangement , and ensemble have also been essential components of jazz for most of its history. Similarly, syncopation and swing, often considered essential and unique to jazz, are in fact lacking in much authentic jazz, whether of the 1920s or of later decades. Again, the long-held notion that swing could not occur without syncopation was roundly disproved when trumpeters Louis Armstrong and Bunny Berigan (among others) frequently generated enormous swing while playing repeated, unsyncopated quarter notes.\n\njazz , musical form , often improvisational, developed by African Americans and influenced by both European harmonic structure and African rhythms. It was developed partially from ragtime and blues and is often characterized by syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying degrees of improvisation, often deliberate deviations of pitch, and the use of original timbres.\n\nWest Africa in the American South: gathering the musical elements of jazz\n\nThe elements that make jazz distinctive derive primarily from West African musical sources as taken to the North American continent by slaves, who partially preserved them against all odds in the plantation culture of the American South. These elements are not precisely identifiable because they were not documented\u2014at least not until the mid- to late 19th century, and then only sparsely. Furthermore, Black slaves came from diverse West African tribal cultures with distinct musical traditions. Thus, a great variety of Black musical sensibilities were assembled on American soil. These in turn rather quickly encountered European musical elements\u2014for example, simple dance and entertainment musics and shape-note hymn tunes, such as were prevalent in early 19th-century North America.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

It is only a slight oversimplification to assert that the rhythmic and structural elements of jazz, as well as some aspects of its customary instrumentation (e.g., banjo or guitar and percussion), derive primarily from West African traditions, whereas the European influences can be heard not only in the harmonic language of jazz but in its use of such conventional instruments as trumpet, trombone, saxophone, string bass, and piano.\n\nThe syncopations of jazz were not entirely new\u2014they had been the central attraction of one of its forerunners, ragtime, and could be heard even earlier in minstrel music and in the work of Creole composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (Bamboula, subtitled Danse des N\u00e8gres, 1844\u201345, and Ojos Criollos, 1859, among others). Nevertheless, jazz syncopation struck nonblack listeners as fascinating and novel, because that particular type of syncopation was not present in European classical music. The syncopations in ragtime and jazz were, in fact, the result of reducing and simplifying (over a period of at least a century) the complex, multilayered, polyrhythmic, and polymetric designs indigenous to all kinds of West African ritual dance and ensemble music. In other words, the former accentuations of multiple vertically competing metres were drastically simplified to syncopated accents.\n\nThe provenance of melody (tune, theme, motive, riff) in jazz is more obscure. In all likelihood, jazz melody evolved out of a simplified residue and mixture of African and European vocal materials intuitively developed by slaves in the United States in the 1700s and 1800s\u2014for example, unaccompanied field hollers and work songs associated with the changed social conditions of Blacks. The widely prevalent emphasis on pentatonic formations came primarily from West Africa, whereas the diatonic (and later more chromatic) melodic lines of jazz grew from late 19th- and early 20th-century European antecedents.\n\nHarmony was probably the last aspect of European music to be absorbed by Blacks. But once acquired, harmony was applied as an additional musical resource to religious texts; one result was the gradual development of spirituals, borrowing from the white religious revival meetings that African Americans in many parts of the South were urged to attend. One crucial outcome of these musical acculturations was the development by Blacks of the so-called blues scale, with its \u201cblue notes\u201d\u2014the flatted third and seventh degrees. This scale is neither particularly African nor particularly European but acquired its peculiar modality from pitch inflections common to any number of West African languages and musical forms. In effect these highly expressive\u2014and in African terms very meaningful\u2014pitch deviations were superimposed on the diatonic scale common to almost all European classical and vernacular music.\n\nThat jazz developed uniquely in the United States, not in the Caribbean or in South America (or any other realm to which thousands of African Blacks were also transported) is historically fascinating. Many Blacks in those other regions were very often emancipated by the early 1800s and thus were free individuals who actively participated in the cultural development of their own countries. In the case of Brazil, Blacks were so geographically and socially isolated from the white establishment that they simply were able to retain their own African musical traditions in a virtually pure form. It is thus ironic that jazz would probably never have evolved had it not been for the slave trade as it was practiced specifically in the United States.\n\nJazz grew from the African American slaves who were prevented from maintaining their native musical traditions and felt the need to substitute some homegrown form of musical expression. Such composers as the Brazilian mulatto Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia were fully in touch with the musical advances of their time that were developing in Europe and wrote music in those styles and traditions. American slaves, by contrast, were restricted not only in their work conditions and religious observances but in leisure activities, including music making. Although slaves who played such instruments as the violin, horn, and oboe were exploited for their musical talents in such cities as Charleston, South Carolina, these were exceptional situations. By and large the slaves were relegated to picking up whatever little scraps of music were allowed them."}, {"url": "https://www.cmuse.org/characteristics-of-funk-music/", "page_content": "As a musical genre, Funk has its roots firmly embedded in jazz. Funk incorporates many elements of jazz alongside soul and earlier African-American styles of music. Following on from the immense success of soul singer James Brown in the mid-1960s, the idea of Funk began to catch hold of the musical community in the US.\n\nJames Brown probably coined the term \u2018funk beat\u2019 in this decade and the concept stuck. What typically distinguished this new sound was a not only a strongly syncopated or off-beat bass line but the driving rhythmic emphasis of the first beat of every bar. This gave the music quite a different feel to that of either jazz or the blues where beats 2 & 4 were more commonly highlighted.\n\nCharacteristics of Funk Music\n\nFunk tended towards the instrumental rather than vocal centered tracks although there have been many successful songs that include an aspect of voice too. Harmonically, Funk hinged on jazz progressions but often without the complexities of bebop. Chromatic movement in harmony was a popular device with subtle side-steps either up or down underpinning the main melodic material.\n\nBy the 1970s, Funk was a household name, and many bands were emerging who focused completely on this fresh form of popular music. One of the key bands of the time was an American group of musicians called \u2018The Metres\u2019 who were, as far as I can discover, still active in 2010. One of the earliest examples of a Funk band, their music is characterized by grooving electric guitar riffs, quick-moving, virtuosic bass lines, driving drum rhythms, and beefy Hammond organ solos that many later groups mimicked.\n\nOther major artists began to sit up and take notice of the growing Funk movement including Stevie Wonder, Kool, and The Gang and Paul McCartney, who invited the Meters to play at the release of his album \u2018Venus & Mars\u2019.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kuP5Xwfal2thfGsVVp4_kZhQJKWxd521c\n\nTo complement the popular music world and to exemplify the appeal of Funk in the 1970s, well-known jazz artists like Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. Davis\u2019s album \u2018On The Corner\u2019 (1972) is a great example of jazz fusion, encapsulating the new sounds of Funk without losing the essence of jazz. The album fully absorbs the musical features of Funk and is Davis reaching back out to the young African-American audiences of the time who largely had abandoned jazz.\n\nThe influences of Funk began to resonate through nearly all contemporary styles of music. Disco borrowed heavily from the drum and bass patterns of Funk and even Hip-Hop owed much of its early music to the work of Funk bands. As the 1980s progressed Funk divided into sub-genres. From the Jazz Funk of the 70s to \u2018Synth-Funk\u2019, \u2018Psychedelic Funk\u2019, \u2018Funk Rock\u2019, and even \u2018Avant-Funk\u2019, it was a style of music that began to thread its way into huge swathes of the musical community.\n\nPushing back against the tide of disco music, Synth-Funk took on board all the latest technology replacing live instruments with the best-synthesized sounds available; even the drummer. Prince created some dynamic and innovative tracks at this time, blending the cutting-edge technology with more erotic lyrics.\n\nEqually, Jazz Funk moved the world of Jazz into new territory. Herbie Hancock, in particular, made great creative use of the available analog synthesizers, in combination with traditional instruments in albums like \u2018Future Shock\u2019 (1983). In this album, we find Hancock at his creative best. Jazz fuses with techno, dance, and hip-hop to present us with an album very much of its time. The album won an RIAA Platinum Award in 1994.\n\nThe British \u2018Acid Jazz\u2019 band Corduroy for me is one of the most exciting groups of Funk musicians still playing today. This type of jazz owes its birth to a broad mix of genres dominated by Funk, Soul and Jazz music. What Corduroy so successfully produce is music that centers on creating a strong \u2018groove\u2019 over which instrumentalists in the band riff, improvise, and occasionally sing.\n\nThe music is eminently danceable and has proved to be a popular form of Funk on the current music scene. Even though Funk hailed from the US, the UK acid jazz scene was a vibrant one and it too stepped in the mainstream popular music world with bands like The Brand New Heavies, who enjoyed success with chart-topping tracks like \u2018Never Stop\u2019, that was released in 1991 as a 7-inch single only. The James Taylor Quartet brought the sound of the Hammond organ back to Funk in the late 80s and into the 90s alongside the famous Stereo-MCs.\n\nA less well-established sub-genre of Funk to emerge from the 80s is Funk-Metal. This genre incorporates a curious selection of musical genres including as you might well anticipate, heavy metal, or thrash metal with punk. The music is fast-paced, driven to the point of being manic with blistering guitar riffs. The West Coast of the US was where it became briefly popular with bands like Living Colour.\n\nMany additional genres of Funk have evolved since the 1960s, some more obscure than others but nearly all with their musical feet placed in the fertile soil of Funk. Perhaps one of the most interesting is one called \u2018Avant-Funk\u2019. This genre of Funk drew its inspiration from psychedelic music that made such colorful use of fuzz boxes, phasing, and vocoders to name but a few key devices.\n\nWhat Avant Funk boils down to is an amalgam of progressive rock concepts welded with electro-pop and of course Funk. The music is experimental and, in many ways, far less approachable than more mainstream Funk. Rhythm is the main focus of Avant-Funk with extended and hyper-developed patterns that can generate lengthy pieces.\n\nWhat appeals to me is really that Funk is a natural progression in the wider genre of Jazz, with an immediately compelling treatment of its material in a popular music context. The bass lines are often remarkably complex, giving the limelight to an instrument that usually takes more of a back seat, whilst the drum patterns are tight and neat. Delicately shifting harmonic shapes offer huge potential for improvisation within flexible structures built on existing jazz models. There is something for everyone in the wide world of Funk."}, {"url": "https://www.gemtracks.com/guides/view.php?title=indie-music-characteristics&id=550", "page_content": "What is Indie Music and its Characteristics in 2023?\n\nWhat does indie music sounds like?

However, a generally agreed upon classification is that indie music is music that has been produced outside of commercial record labels, music that has a DIY approach to both recording and publishing.\n\nThat description, indie as an economic model of producing your own music, or producing music with an independent label, is one way to look at it. But Indie music is also sometimes used as a genre description, a way to describe a certain sound. And it's true, some artists and bands are considered 'indie' and do record and produce their music within a commercial record label. Similarly, many DIY 'indie' bands produce music outside of the record industry but who fall into various other genres, and would not easily identify themselves with the term 'indie'. This has led many to question whether the use of 'indie' as a term to describe a style of music has any real meaning.\n\nIndie vs. Alternative\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about the difference between the alternative and indie genres. The history of the two terms intertwines. Alternative first pops up in the 1980s to describe rock music that was simply considered outside of the mainstream. At the time popular rock bands were power metal, glam metal, and classic style rock. They were technical and very polished. But many underground artists were still playing rock and certainly did not fit any of those categories.\n\nThe term indie is similar. Indie first simply means bands that are not signed to one of the major labels and came from a variety of genres. The internet increased the awareness of many of these bands as it became easier to share music. Many bands that were once considered indie would end up signing with major labels, such as The Strokes and Modest Mouse.\n\nAlternative rock and indie rock have gradually merged with each other because of their extensive overlap. Many indie rock bands are simultaneously categorized as alternative rock, and many alternative rock bands are simultaneously categorized as indie bands. This has led to an oxymoronic situation in which you have many indie artists recording on major labels, and many alternative artists recording on independent labels. But the reason for this confusion has to do with the common threads that have existed between artists of both genres throughout the years.\n\nAt the end of the day, it really doesn't make a difference what you call these bands. Whether you consider them indie or alternative are merely semantic differences that have no clear solution. The power of the music produced by these artists extends far beyond what these mere labels describe.\n\nStill, the indie genres has a fascinating history. So let's take a look at some of indie music's characteristics, and the huge variety of subgenres of indie music that have existed throughout the years.\n\nRead our article on Pop Music Genres and Characteristics.\n\nIndie Rock\n\nDescribing a very diverse range of subgenres, as we said above, indie rock does not describe a definitive musical entity. However, a few things do tend to typify indie rock bands. One of the more important things is that indie rock artists tend to reject the swagger typified by traditional rock bands. The use of the term 'indie' to describe bands that did not record on the major commercial labels fell out of fashion in the 80s. Instead, indie began to refer to a style of music usually related to punk or post-punk.\n\nThe 90s saw grunge, punk-revival, and Britpop bands go mainstream, but many of these bands were able to maintain their 'indie' status. For example, Sub Pop Records enjoyed mainstream success in the early 1990s with the rise of the grunge genre, which they were instrumental in promoting. But in 1995 they sold to Warner Music Group.\n\nLo-fi, emo, noise pop, slowcore, math-rock, and post-rock are all considered indie genres. The 2000s saw the impact of the internet on music consumption and distribution, and new waves of indie bands began to achieve success, some of them signing to major labels, others continued with independent labels. Many of these bands played a kind of back-to-basics guitar rock, like The Strokes and The White Stripes.\n\nEmo\n\nBoth Weezer and Jawbreaker would release foundational emo albums in 1994 (24 Hour Revenge Therapy, and Weezer respectively). But the emo genre traces its roots back to 1984 and the post-hardcore band Rites of Spring which combined the hardcore punk music style with more varied rhythms and melodies, as well as lyrical content that would come to define the genre: personal, emotional, nostalgia-driven, romantically bitter and poetically desperate. Like many of these music subgenres, emo is more than just a music style, it also has an associated fashion and cultural element, including long bangs, skinny jeans, tight t-shirts, studded belts. Emo enjoyed mainstream success in the early 2000s with bands like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy.\n\nNoise Pop\n\nWith its mix of feedback, dissonance, and pop music songcraft, noise pop experimented with distortion, drones, and white noise all while maintaining conventional pop music songwriting. The style has been described as hazy, narcotic, textured, angular and many regard the influential band The Velvet Underground as one of the earliest examples of the genre. It wasn't, however, until 1985's Psychocandy by the Scottish alt-rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain that the genre was properly born. Noise pop would lead directly to the development of the shoegazing movement which began to emerge in the late '80s.\n\nKeep reading on about The Stages of Custom Music Production & Its Benefits to gain a deeper understanding of the topic.\n\nPost-Punk Revival\n\nThis genre of indie rock began developing in the late 90s and early aughts. Inspired by a combination of different styles, primarily garage rock, new wave, and post-punk, several post-punk revival bands went mainstream in the early 2000s. Post-punk itself was a style of music developed in the late 1970s that saw a departure from the simplistic traditions of punk rock and infused the genre with avant-garde influences. Post-punk revival offered a return to that late-70s form ranging from the atonal music created by groups like Liars to the more melodic pop-inflected songs of The Sounds. Several bands saw mainstream success such as The Strokes, The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, and the Arctic Monkeys. The style declined in popularity by 2010, but many bands, such as Arcade Fire, were strongly influenced by the subgenre.\n\nIndie Pop\n\nLike indie rock, indie pop is related to rock music in general, particularly guitar pop. Indie pop generally exists in opposition to mainstream pop with its do-it-yourself ethic. Also like indie rock, indie pop traces its origin from post-punk. Melodies tend to play a more prominent role in indie pop when compared to indie rock, and they tend to be less abrasive, more positive, and relatively free of angst. Chamber pop, twee pop, dream pop, and the Japanese Shibuya-Kei style are all examples of this genre. Let's take a look at them.\n\nChamber Pop\n\nMelody, texture, and use of orchestral elements such as strings, horns, and piano, are all defining elements of chamber pop (sometimes called 'orchestral pop'). The Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds was a huge influence on the subgenre, as were the baroque pop bands of the 1960s. Like all of the indie bands on this list, chamber pop is stylistically and aesthetically diverse. But they all share a strong influence by pop musicians like Burt Bacharach, Scott Walker, Lee Hazlewood, and Brian Wilson. Chamber pop shares many parallel influences with the Japanese music movement known as Shibuya-Kei.\n\nTwee Pop\n\nWould you be interested in Music 101: What is Indie Music?\n\nThe origins of twee pop take us back to 1986, and to a cassette compilation put out by the British music magazine NME. Originally it was the term C86 that defined this kind of indie music. Twee pop is characterized by treble-heavy, undistorted guitars, with power-pop melodies and structures. Boy-girl harmonies, lyrics about love and relationships, and a perceived innocence also define its sound. Twee pop would evolve into the cuddlecore subgenre, which enjoyed brief success in the mid-90s\n\nDream Pop\n\nThis subgenre often overlaps with other indie genres, especially shoegaze, so much so that dream pop and shoegaze are often used interchangeably. The main thing that sets this genre apart from its peers is its atmosphere and heavy reliance on sonic textures, and the immersive experience offered to the listener. Again the music of Brian Wilson and other mid-60s/early-70s figures were the primary source of influence. Bands such as Cocteau Twins, A. R. Kane, Bat for Lashes, and My Bloody Valentine all count themselves among the genres best.\n\nUnderground Hip Hop\n\nSometimes refered to as 'indie hip-hop', underground hip-hop encompasses anything in hip-hop that is produced outside of the commercial record. It does have some characteristics that make it different from its more commercial cousin, and that includes lyrics that are generally more socially conscious and positive. Alt-hip hop and 'conscious' hip hop all have ties to underground hip-hop and emphasize that they do not conform to any of the traditional genres or stereotypes, and draw equally from funk, pop, rock, jazz, reggae, soul, and folk music.\n\nIndie Music Scenes\n\nIn addition to the different subgenres of indie music, there are also several localized 'indie music scenes'. Often a local music scene can play just as much of a role in music history and the developments of different genres as the music coming out of the big commercial labels.\n\nOther readers recommend reading about Arpeggiator and Its Uses next for more information.\n\nSome examples of prominent indie music scenes are:\n\nNo Wave - This was an avant-garde art scene that came out of late 70s New York City. It was a reaction against punk rock and its perceived recycling of clich\u00e9s and influences from rock music. Musicians of the No Wave movement relied on experimentation with noise and dissonance, with atonality and abrasiveness, and with confrontation and a worldview drenched in nihilism. The movement embraced many different styles such as funk, jazz, blues, and punk rock. Perhaps the best-known band to emerge from this genre was Sonic Youth.\n\nMadchester - Developed in Manchester, U.K. in the late 80s, Madchester was an indie cultural scene. Not just a music scene, Madchester was closely associated with dance. 'Indie-raves' were presided over by music that merged acid house, psychedelia, 60s pop, and rave music. It was heavily influenced by the drug MDMA and was part of a broader social phenomenon of 1980s UK youth culture, sometimes called the Second Summer of Love. Madchester Bands would dominate the UK indie charts for much of the late 80s and early 90s. Some well-known groups to come out of the Madchester scene include The Stone Roses and 808 State.\n\nGrunge - This subculture, which was also sometimes referred to as 'Seattle sound', was a rock subculture that emerged in the mid-80s around the state of Washington. Fusing punk rock and heavy metal, Grunge incorporated angst-filled, introspective lyrics that addressed themes of social alienation, trauma, neglect, and self-doubt. Sub Pop Records was home to many of the brands associated with the grunge movement, and this independent label did much to market the genre before selling out to Warner Music Group in 1995. In the early 90s grunge was hugely popular throughout the English-speaking world, and made grunge the most popular form of rock music of its day. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains were all bands that came out of that movement.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we've seen, indie music is hardly one single thing. Not only does it have multiple, sometimes overlapping subgenres, but the genre of 'indie music' itself overlaps with other broader musical trends, like alternative rock, punk, pop, and hip-hop. No sooner can you point to an example of what indie music 'is', than you can point to several contradictory examples that hold up a different ethos. Regardless of the differences, indie music shares a rejection of commercial aspirations, and the trends of commercial genres.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: You may be interested in What is Sound Design and Its Use ? as well."}, {"url": "https://www.chosic.com/genre-chart/indie-jazz/", "page_content": "Parent Genre: R&B\n\nIndie jazz is a genre that blends traditional jazz elements with modern influences, resulting in a unique sound that is both experimental and accessible.

But what\u2019s the difference between the two? This blog post explores the origins and key characteristics of each genre.\n\nDefining R&B and Soul Music\n\nR&B and Soul music are often thought of as the same genre. However, there are some key differences between the two genres. R&B is short for Rhythm and Blues and is a genre that started in the 1940s. It is a mix of African American music styles such as Jazz, Blues, and Gospel. Soul music is a genre that developed in the 1950s and is a mix of R&B and Gospel.\n\nR&B\n\nR&B, which stands for rhythm and blues, is a genre of music that originated in the 1940s. The genre was created by black artists who blended elements of blues, gospel, and jazz to create a new style of music. R&B is characterized by a strong beat, soulful vocals, and often sexually suggestive lyrics.\n\nR&B became popular in the 1950s and 1960s with artists like Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, and Aretha Franklin. In the 1970s, disco began to influence the sound of R&B, resulting in a new subgenre called \u201cdisco-funk.\u201d During the 1980s and 1990s, R&B underwent another transformation with the advent of new jack swing. This fusion of R&B and hip-hop created a smoother sound that was more acceptable to mainstream audiences. Today, R&B is one of the most popular genres of music, with artists like Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, and Usher topping the charts.\n\nSoul music is a genre that originated in the United States in the 1950s. Like R&B, soul music combines elements of blues and gospel music. However, soul music is more closely associated with personal and social issues than R&B. Soul music often deals with themes of love, heartache, and struggle.\n\nArtists like Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye helped to define the sound of soul music in the 1960s. In the 1970s, disco again began to influence soul music, resulting in a new subgenre called \u201cdisco-soul.\u201d As with R&B, disco-influenced soul became more mainstream in the 1980s with artists like Lionel Richie and Whitney Houston. Today\u2019s soul musicians often incorporate elements of hip-hop and other genres into their music to create a unique sound.\n\nSoul\n\nMost people have heard of R&B and soul music, but many don\u2019t know the difference between the two genres. Both genres are similar in that they are African-American music styles that originated in the 1940s and 1950s. They both also have roots in gospel music. The main difference between the two genres is that soul music is more emotive than R&B. Soul music is also usually more gospel-influenced than R&B, which is more rooted in blues.\n\nSome well-known soul artists include Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Aretha Franklin. R&B artists include Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston.\n\nThe Origins of R&B and Soul Music\n\nR&B and soul music are two genres that are often confused. R&B stands for rhythm and blues, and it is a genre that was created in the 1940s. Soul music is a genre that emerged in the 1950s and is a combination of R&B and gospel music.\n\nR&B\n\nR&B is a genre of music that developed in the 1940s. It is a combination of blues, gospel, and jazz. R&B is short for rhythm and blues. The name was first used in the 1930s by Billboard magazine. It became popular in the 1940s with the advent of electric guitars and amplified sound. R&B was originally performed by African American artists, but it has since been embraced by all cultures.\n\nThe term soul music was coined in the late 1950s by record companies to describe a new kind of music that was influenced by R&B and gospel. Soul music is a combination of these two genres. It is characterized by emotional vocals, often with a call and response between the singer and the audience. Soul music became popular in the 1960s with artists such as Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, and Marvin Gaye.\n\nSoul\n\nSoul music is a genre that emerged from the African-American community in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

R&B is typically more focused on the sound of the music, while soul music is more focused on the lyrics and the message.\n\nR&B\n\nR&B is a genre of music that has its roots in spirituals, work songs, and blues. R&B is short for rhythm and blues. The term was coined by Billboard magazine in 1949. The magazine used the term to describe a new kind of music that had emerged from the streets of African American neighborhoods in New Orleans and other cities.\n\nThe sound of R&B is characterized by a strong beat, often accompanied by horn sections or synthesizers, and by a call-and-response pattern between the singer and the band or backing vocalists. The lyrics of R&B songs often deal with love, relationships, and heartbreak.\n\nR&B has been a major force in popular music since the 1940s. R&B artists such as Ray Charles, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, and Prince have left an indelible mark on popular culture. In the 1990s and 2000s, R&B underwent a renaissance with artists such as Mariah Carey, TLC, Boyz II Men, Destiny\u2019s Child, Alicia Keys, Usher, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles ,and Justin Timberlake carrying the torch for the genre.\n\nSoul\n\nR&B stands for rhythm and blues. The term was first used in the late 1940s to describe a style of African-American music that developed from jazz, gospel, and blues.

You can see it everywhere, from daily neighborhood karaoke sessions, to TV variety shows and underground gigs. The global top 40 is popular, but there\u2019s nothing quite like the sound of homegrown Filipino music\u2014whether they\u2019re in English, Tagalog, or another local language .\n\nBefore the pandemic changed life as we knew it, a typical Friday night in Manila would see a group of students and young creatives in a packed bar\u2014San Miguel beer in one hand and phones snapping videos in the other. Everyone was sweaty and probably tired from a long day and bumper-to-bumper traffic but persistent to see their favorite bands live .\n\nA lot of big artists and music executives also outgrew their major labels and started their own companies, giving new acts a chance to explore their sound and image without the pressures of catering to the mainstream. There\u2019s Offshore Music by Ely Buendia, the frontman of iconic 90s rock band Eraserheads; singer-songwriter Rico Blanco\u2019s Balcony Entertainment; Lilystar Records by Orange and Lemons\u2019 Clem Castro; and Terno Recordings, which brought about the band UDD. And that\u2019s just to name a few.\n\nBut classifying all Filipino artists under the same umbrella, regardless of genre, also made it difficult for listeners to explore new sounds. In search of something different, young Filipinos turned to the internet instead of the radio for new music. For years, the Philippine music scene was dominated by big labels and established stars. But more recently, the advent of platforms like Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and Spotify has made it possible for grassroots acts to promote themselves.\n\nLocally, these songs are known as OPM or \u201cOriginal Pilipino Music,\u201d a term popularized in the 70s used to describe pop music at the time. Years later, OPM came to describe all music from the Philippines. Today, pop, rock, hip-hop, and everything in between are all classified as OPM. According to Spotify, OPM has reached 10 billion streams as of 2019 , with listeners in the Philippines and places like Singapore, the United States, and Hong Kong.\n\nMusic venues like Route 196 and Mow\u2019s Bar in Quezon City, and SaGuijo and B-Side in Makati, were the go-to spots for people looking to watch live music or discover new bands. There was also 20:20, which promoted dance and electronic acts, and Black Market for those into hip-hop. Right before the pandemic hit, less mainstream Filipino artists started going international too; synth-pop producer No Rome became the first Filipino to perform at Coachella in 2019 , and local performers featured in international streaming playlists. While some of this has been put on pause, Filipino indie artists continue to produce music amid Manila\u2019s crazy long quarantine.\n\nAlthough Filipino indie is heavily influenced by styles from Europe and the United States, these songs are always mixed with local sounds and tell stories more relatable to the people from the country. Some talk about what it\u2019s like to live by the sea, or more serious topics like the drug war. Others simply tap into universal emotions like heartbreak, which has become somewhat of a subgenre called \u201chugot\u201d or \u201cto draw out feelings.\u201d After all, Filipinos love ballads and love songs, rooting from Filipino folk traditions like Kundiman\u2014a style of traditional love song known for mellow rhythms and dramatic swells\u2014and harana (serenade).\n\nThis playlist ends with \u201cKagulo,\u201d from Sandwich, a feisty track that further solidifies why they\u2019re one of the most respected bands in the country. After over 20 years in the scene, their energy has yet to be matched.\n\nThen there\u2019s Hazylazy, the most recent solo project of Jason Fernandez from the band Serotonin, and fellow one-man act Markmuffins (by Mark Aze Deladia). Both rock out of their bedroom, bringing the fuzz with takes on shoegaze, marrying relaxing tempos with harsh vocal melodies.\n\nMeanwhile, 21-year-old Unique Salonga is bold with his lyricsm while creatively crafting strange but skillfully done melodies that he wrote, produced, and arranged\u2014staying authentic to his artistry despite his already massive following on social media.\n\nIf you were to go to one of those pre-COVID gigs, one of the bands you\u2019d probably catch was Oh, Flamingo!, performing \u201cFour Corners,\u201d a 2019 single that paints a clear picture of lingering heartache with the same eclectic mix of pop and rock the four-piece band is known for.\n\nSo you want to get into\u2026 introspective electric guitar-driven Filipino indie music?\n\nSo you want to get into\u2026 introspective electric guitar-driven Filipino indie music?\n\nFrom alternative rock to hip-hop, below are some songs that make up the diverse sound of Filipino music. We will inevitably miss a lot of great artists, but this should give a taste of what the country\u2019s indie scene has to offer.\n\nStart with \u201cOut Of My Mind\u201d by Techy Romantics, a mellowed out dance track produced in 2010, but very much still a bop today. It\u2019s a combination of the synthesized sound of lounge and electropop, matched with dreamy vocal work that takes you out of your headspace.\n\nDance music in the Philippines has long been thriving. Disco music topped the charts in the 70s, with artists from the decade pioneering \u201cManila Sound.\u201d It has since evolved to be more electronic and stylized.

Acts like Thirst Kid, Local Sun, Arthur Tan, Pamcy, Aries, and lui., have honed their own unique styles, creating a characteristic mix of live sounds, synths, and drums that step out of just U.S. and European influences.\n\n\u201cTelephone\u201d by Ena Mori is a more recent single, a bubbly fast-paced track that puts you on hyperdrive, setting the bar high for pop music in the country with its catchy hooks and intricate production.\n\nYou\u2019ll dig this if you like: Jordan Rakei, Toro Y Moi, Tom Misch, Kaytranada, Kali Uchis, Sabrina Claudio, Jorja Smith, Chet Faker\n\nListen to this when you\u2019re... in the mood to *feel things* and unwind after a long day.\n\nThen there\u2019s Leanne & Naara, Leila Alcasid, and Jolianne, all of whom have mastered lyrical honesty pooled in with soothing vocal prowess.\n\nThe same can be said for producer LUSTBASS, who on his track with Jason Dhakal \u201cBody & Soul\u201d, perfectly captures that rare, tender moment of submission to a lover.\n\nKing Puentespina, the producer and drummer for alternative band She\u2019s Only Sixteen known as crwn, has that magic touch when it comes to beats. No matter which singer he\u2019s working with\u2014from August Wahh to Jess Connelly\u2014he somehow finds ways to make each track stand out with his masterful mix of textures with lo-fi beats.\n\nR&B was always a staple in the Philippine mainstream, with many big artists championing the genre in the 90s.

The genre is often described as feeling happy, relaxed, and even romantic. But beyond the general feeling that jazz music gives off, there are specific elements that make up the genre\u2019s unique sound. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore the feel, groove, and soul of jazz music to help you better appreciate this timeless genre.\n\n1.Jazz Music: The Feel\n\nJazz music has a feel that is unique and often hard to describe. It is a music that seems to defy explanation and instead must be felt. The best way to get a feel for jazz is to listen to it. But even then, it can be hard to understand what it is that makes jazz, well, Jazz.\n\nJazz has been described as the sound of surprise. It is a music that is constantly evolving and changing, always fresh and new. Jazz is also a very personal music, each musician bringing their own style and flavor to the mix. This makes for a music that can be both intimate and intensely powerful.\n\nJazz is also a very sensual music, full of passion and emotion. It can be both joyful and melancholy, often at the same time. Jazz speaks to the heart as well as the head, and can be both thought-provoking and deeply moving.\n\n2.Jazz Music: The Groove\n\nJazz music is often described as having a \u201cgroove.\u201d This term refers to the rhythmic feel of the music; it\u2019s the syncopated, swinging quality that makes you want to tap your foot or dance. The best way to understand groove is to feel it; listen to a jazz recording and pay attention to the rhythm. You should feel a strong, consistent pulse that gives the music a sense of forward motion.\n\n3.Jazz Music: The Soul\n\nJazz music has a rich history and has been described as \u201cthe sound of America.\u201d Jazz is a uniquely American art form that combines elements of European and African musical traditions. Jazz is characterized by Swing, which is a rhythmic feel that allows dancers to \u201cswing\u201d or move their hips in time with the music. Jazz also features improvisation, which is when musicians spontaneously create new melodies and solos while they are performing. Improvisation is an important part of jazz and gives the music its unique sound. Jazz also has a strong focus on the groove, which is the rhythmic feel that propels the music forward. The groove is created by the interplay between the rhythm section (piano, bass, drums) and the horns (trumpet, saxophone, trombone). Lastly, jazz has a great deal of soulfulness or emotionality. This comes from the blues tradition and gives jazz its heart and feeling.\n\n4.Jazz Music: The Passion\n\nJazz music is passionate, soulful and full of feeling. It is often said to have a \u201cgroove\u201d that makes you want to move. Jazz musicians improvise, or make up their own solos as they play. This allows them to express their feelings and emotions through their music. Jazz is also a very social music. Musicians often play together in small groups, called \u201ccombo\u201d or \u201cband\u201d. They often interact with each other while they are playing, making the music more personal and intimate.\n\n5.Jazz Music: The Art\n\nJazz is a type of music that originated in the United States in the early 1900s. It is characterized by a syncopated rhythm, improvisation, and complex harmonies. Jazz has been influenced by European classical music, African American folk music, and work songs. Many jazz musicians have been active in the civil rights movement.\n\nThere are many different types of jazz, including traditional jazz, bebop, swing, hard bop, free jazz, and fusion. Traditional jazz is closest to the original form of the music. It is often performed on acoustic instruments such as piano, trumpet, saxophone, and clarinet. Bebop is a more recent type of jazz that developed in the 1940s. It is characterized by a faster tempo and more complex harmonies than traditional jazz. Swing is a type of jazz that developed in the 1930s and 1940s. It is characterized by a smooth, relaxed feel and a focus on group interaction. Hard bop is a type of Jazz that developed in the 1950s as an extension of bebop. It is characterized by a bluesy feel and greater use of dissonance than other types of Jazz. Free Jazz emerged in the 1960s as some musicians began to experiment with more abstract forms of improvisation. Fusion is a type of Jazz that combines elements of other genres such as rock or funk with traditional Jazz elements.\n\nJazz has had a significant impact on popular culture.

Here\u2019s a list of 10 popular music genres and a look at their origins, basic characteristics, descriptions, and some examples of the subgenres they have birthed to give you an idea of how music genres are categorized.\n\n1. Pop\n\nPop music is the genre with the most mass appeal currently.3 The genre is specifically targeted at commercial success and can use any kind of instrumentation and musical qualities as long as the song is catchy, upbeat, and appealing to a large audience. The first signs of this style of music started to appear in the late 19th century.4\n\nSub-genres\n\nArt pop, dance-pop, orchestral pop, country pop, indie pop, bubblegum, Sunshine Pop, Surf Pop, Synthpop, Teen Pop, Traditional Pop Music, Turkish Pop, Vispop, Wonky Pop, Post-Disco, Progressive Pop are among the many subgenres of pop music.5\n\n2. Rock\n\nRock music originated in the United States around the 1950s, and due to its growing diversity to this day, it is still not possible to arrive at a concrete definition of the genre. However, rock music has a strong beat accompanied by simple tunes that are generally played or performed loudly by a small group of people, usually with electric guitars and drums. This is an extremely basic definition of rock music, as it is an exceptionally dynamic genre.6\n\nSub-genres\n\nSome subgenres of rock music are alternative rock, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, blues rock, progressive rock, indie rock, punk rock, psychedelic rock, glam rock, roots rock, Britpop, folk rock, electronic rock, arena rock, funk rock, garage rock, space rock, soft rock, experimental rock, surf rock and art rock. 7\n\n3. Soundtrack\n\nSoundtrack is not exactly a genre but a term used for a selection of songs that are featured in a film. These songs have become a category of their own, with increasingly high-quality music being composed and used in many movies that have generated large-scale appeal. These songs can be existing tracks that are licensed by the producers or original songs that are composed and written to fit the film\u2019s story. \u201cSoundtrack\u201d can also refer to the commercial album released with a movie, as well as a collection of sound effects, music, and dialogue used in a movie.8\n\nSub-genres\n\nThere are no subgenres for this type of music. However, there is also original music called \u201cscore\u201d that is composed and recorded by a single composer, and sometimes more, especially for a film. It adheres to a strict timecode as it is composed to fit certain parts and the story of the film precisely. Orchestras usually perform film scores, however, the music for films these days can deviate from this norm.\n\n4. Rap and Hip-hop\n\nRap music is a style that has rhythmic and rhyming speech, which is chanted to musical beats. The backing music can include digital sampling, which is music and sounds extracted from other recordings. It is also called hip-hop, a term that represents this type of music at large and includes rap, deejaying, graffiti painting, and break dancing. Rap originated in the African American communities of New York City around the 1970s.9\n\nSub-genres\n\nOld school, boom-bap, jazz rap, trap, mumble rap, rap rock, country trap, gangsta rap, crunk, emo rap, grime, UK drill, bounce, horrorcore, Latin trap, conscious hip-hop, Soundcloud rap, hyphy, Soundcloud rap, lo-fi hip-hop, G-funk, footwork, etc., are some styles of rap and hip-hop music.10\n\n5. Electronic Dance Music\n\nElectronic dance music, known more commonly by its abbreviation EDM, typically has inorganic sounds and timbres. These sounds are often produced on cheap music equipment of the early 1980s, such as the 808 drum machine and the 303 bass synthesizer, or from samples of previous recordings. Although the style does include some instrumentation and singing, it is not the main focus of EDM. It is composed specifically for dancing; therefore, rhythm plays a vital role in most subgenres of EDM.11\n\nSub-genres\n\nHouse, techno, techno, dubstep, drum & bass, garage, grime, trap, hardstyle, moombahton, juke, breakbeat, downtempo, etc., are some of the most popular sub-genres of EDM, which further branch out into styles of their own.12\n\n6. K-Pop\n\nK-pop is a form of Korean popular music, and it originated in South Korea in the 1950s. However, the type of K-pop music that has gained popularity today is a new form of the genre that emerged in the 1990s. K-pop is heavily influenced by Western music and pop groups, especially all styles of American pop music and culture, which continues to impact this style of music to this day.13 K-pop is mostly focused on esthetic and the trendsetting style of the artists. It maintains its reputation as a strictly Korean genre through tunes based on traditional Korean music and lyrics that have some short English sentences or words used in some places.14\n\nSub-genres\n\nThe sub-genres of K-pop are based on both Korean and North American music, such as soundtrack, gayo, jazz, pop, new age, classic, gukak, Religious music, World music, Hip-hop, Dongyo, Electronic, Rock, R&B, Indie and Metal.15\n\n7. Indie Music\n\n\u201cIndie\u201d is a term that is short for \u201cindependent\u201d and was first used for artists who recorded and released their music themselves instead of signing with a record label. However, the genre now defines a certain attitude, sound, or way of creating music. Therefore, since its inception in the 1970s, the term has come to encompass indie music artists who are also working with major labels. Indie is a style of music that was initially not focused on commercial success or appeal. It was known for straying from the accepted norms of pop music, which are still retained, with the exception of the large-scale success and appeal that indie music has garnered since and artists signing deals with record labels.16\n\nSub-genres\n\nIndie music has some fascinating types of subgenres such as math rock, post-rock, shoegaze, chillwave, freak folk, Nintendocore, and folktronica, apart from the more commonly known styles like indie rock, indie rap, indie R & B, indie electronica, and indie synthpop.17\n\n8. R&B\n\nR&B, aka rhythm and blues, is a style of popular African American music that started to gain popularity during the post-World War II era. A variety of different styles of music emerged soon after and were included under the term R&B later. R&B is described as sophisticated urban music with humorous lyrics and upbeat rhythms that were inspired by other music styles such as boogie-woogie and classic blues.18\n\nSub-genres\n\nContemporary R&B, disco, doo Wop, funk, Motown, neo-Soul, quiet Storm, soul,19 indie soul, alternative R&B, new jack swing, pop-soul, trap soul, pop R&B, and gospel R&B are some other popular styles that emerged from this genre.20\n\n9. Country\n\nCountry music originated in the rural areas of the southwest United States in the early 20th century and is also referred to as western music.21 Country songs are based on the stories of rural life, and most artists endorse the cowboy style through their music and clothing. The style of singing is very distinct and incorporates a quality called \u201ctwang,\u201d which can be described as the elongation of words during the singing and the usage of diphthongs and triphthongs.22\n\nSub-genres\n\nCountry music has branched into many different styles over the years, such as alternative country, Americana, sertanejo, Nashville sound, country pop, bluegrass, country soul, Australian country, zydeco and western swing.23\n\n10. Jazz\n\nJazz started to develop through the blending of African American musical traditions with other cultures during the early 20th century in the United States. Jazz is characterized by improvisations, which are one of the most defining qualities of this style. It requires artists to create solos spontaneously during a performance. Jazz music is usually rhythmic and is accompanied by lots of string bending and a forward momentum called \u201cswing.\u201d24\n\nSub-genres\n\nSome early sub-genres of jazz are big band, boogie-woogie piano, bop, classic jazz, Dixieland, jump blues, original New Orleans jazz, ragtime, stride piano, swing, and vocal jazz. Some styles that emerged later are Afro-Cuban jazz, avant-garde jazz, bossa nova, cool jazz, eclectic fusion, funk jazz, fusion, hard bop, Latin jazz, nu jazz, and post-bop.25\n\nBYJU\u2019S FutureSchool\n\nWe hope this BYJU\u2019S FutureSchool article has enriched your knowledge of music genres.
