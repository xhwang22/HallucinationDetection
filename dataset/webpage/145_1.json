It includes over 20 original ABBA songs, the most famous of which is Mamma Mia, which lends itself to the title of the musical. The musical is based on a book written by British author Catherine Johnson, and the music was primarily written by Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus of ABBA.\n\nABBA began in the 1970\u2019s in Sweden, and became famous when the group won the 1974 Eurovision song writing contest. It consisted of four members: Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, Ani-Frid Lyngstad, and Agnetha Faltskog. It is from their first names that the group\u2019s name came. They wrote songs that became extremely popular world-wide, including Dancing Queen (which was number one on charts across the world, including the US. It was only song to become number one in the US), Waterloo (the song that won the Eurovision contest), and of course, Mamma Mia. All of these popular songs, and more, are included in the show that became Mamma Mia! (Mamma Mia official site).\n\nCatherine Johnson\u2019s book tells a story about a daughter (Sophie) who is about to get married, but she doesn\u2019t know who her own father is. She is living on a Greek island paradise, and invites the three potential candidates to the island to see her \u2013 the first time they\u2019ve all set foot on the island in 20 years (Harry, Bill, and Sam). She tries to figure out which one of these men is her father while hiding this from her mother, Donna, who won\u2019t talk about her past. Her goal is to have her real father walk her down the aisle.\n\nOrder custom essay Mamma Mia! the Musical: History and Music with free plagiarism report GET ORIGINAL PAPER\n\nUltimately, her mother walks her down the aisle because everyone realizes that they don\u2019t know who her real father is, but that it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 they will all be a part of her life. She also realizes she doesn\u2019t actually want to get married, so her mother ends up marrying one of the three men (Sam) instead, and Sophie and her fianc\u00e9 go off to travel the world (Wikipedia).\n\nThe musical is interspersed with songs like Does Your Mother Know, Super-Trouper, Lay All Your Love on Me, and more. Many of the songs are not used in their original context, but are used in key parts of the musical. For example, the original lyrics in Does Your Mother Know are sung by a man who is asking his underage date if her mother know she\u2019s seeing him. In the musical, it is sung by women and used to ask Sophie if her mother knows she\u2019s invited these men to the island (Wikipedia).\n\nThe original idea for the musical was conceived in 1989 by Judy Craymer, and was to use popular ABBA songs in the new context of a musical. Bj\u00f6rn and Benny had attempted to write their own musical in the 70\u2019s, consisting of songs like Thank You for the Music (now used in Mamma Mia!) and others, but it was never completed. Lending songs to a musical that was completed and performed was obviously something they were interested in. In May 1999, 10 years after the original idea, Mamma Mia! was born, and made its debut in London theaters. While the creators and producers were initially worried about audience reception, it was an instant success, and went on to play all over Britain, and then in the United States on Broadway.\n\nThe U.S. debut was in 2000, and has since played in many Broadway and off-Broadway theaters throughout the country. It is playing simultaneously in more theaters than any other musical. Today, it is estimated that over 20 million people have seen the show (Mamma Mia official website). The show has toured all major US cities and many minor ones as well, and continues to play on Broadway. There are several casts that are performing the show at any given time.\n\nThe show is now playing world-wide, including in Japan, Sweden, and other European countries. It is estimated that 1.3 million people have seen the show in one of these countries. The show has swept not only the English-speaking countries, but the entire world. The soundtrack is also available in different languages for the diverse audience members.\n\nTypical advertising lines include \u201cPeople are singing in their seats and dancing in the aisles\u201d when they see the musical. Also, audience members are encouraged to sing along during the encore, which consists of three songs sung earlier in the musical; there are 22 unique songs in all. Audiences consist of people of all ages, as the musical is family friendly and the music is loved not only by the older generation that grew up with it, but also by the younger generation becoming familiar with it for the first time (Mamma Mia! official site).\n\nThe combination of familiar, well-loved songs with a new, exciting story is what makes Mamma Mia! what it is. Many of the adults in world were growing up during the 1970\u2019s and spent a lot of time listening to ABBA music. Their songs topped charts around the world from their debut in 1974 straight through the mid-80\u2019s. They produced several greatest hits CDs, include ABBA Gold and More Gold, which together include over 40 songs. ABBA continues to play on \u201coldies\u201d radios today, and their music has been passed down to younger generations.\n\nThe music is so upbeat and exciting and perfect for the stage that when it was combined with the cute and interesting story by Catherine Johnson, it was well-received and well-loved. Mamma Mia! will likely continue to play in theaters throughout the country for several more years, as it continues to be an exciting, fun show for all to enjoy.\n\nBibliography\n\n\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

From 1939 to 1956 she was Katherine Goble, having married James Goble. Three years after his death, she married James Johnson.\n\nIn 1939 Johnson was selected to be one of the first three African American students to enroll in a graduate program at West Virginia University. Later she was a member of a group of NASA employees called \"computers,\" made up of African American women who excelled in mathematics and problem-solving.\n\nKatherine Johnson, n\u00e9e Katherine Coleman, also known as (1939\u201356) Katherine Goble, (born August 26, 1918, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, U.S.\u2014died February 24, 2020, Newport News, Virginia), American mathematician who calculated and analyzed the flight paths of many spacecraft during her more than three decades with the U.S. space program. Her work helped send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nColeman\u2019s intelligence and skill with numbers became apparent when she was a child; by the time she was 10 years old, she had started attending high school. In 1937, at age 18, Coleman graduated with highest honours from West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University), earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and French. She subsequently moved to Virginia to take a teaching job. In 1939, however, she was selected to be one of the first three African American students to enroll in a graduate program at West Virginia University. She studied math there but soon left after marrying James Goble and deciding to start a family. He died in 1956, and three years later she married James Johnson.\n\nBritannica Quiz Numbers and Mathematics\n\nIn 1953 she began working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)\u2019s West Area Computing unit, a group of African American women who manually performed complex mathematical calculations for the program\u2019s engineers. The women, known as the West Computers, analyzed test data and provided mathematical computations that were essential to the success of the early U.S. space program. During this time, NACA was segregated, and the West Computers had to use separate bathrooms and dining facilities. That changed in 1958 when NACA was incorporated into the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which banned segregation.\n\nAt NASA Johnson was a member of the Space Task Group. In 1960 she coauthored a paper with one of the group\u2019s engineers about calculations for placing a spacecraft into orbit. It was the first time a woman in her division received credit as an author of a research report. Johnson authored or coauthored 26 research reports during her career.\n\nJohnson also played an important role in NASA\u2019s Mercury program (1961\u201363) of crewed spaceflights. In 1961 she calculated the path for Freedom 7, the spacecraft that put the first U.S astronaut in space, Alan B. Shepard, Jr. The following year, at the request of John Glenn, Johnson verified that the electronic computer had planned his flight correctly. Glenn subsequently made history aboard Friendship 7, becoming the first U.S. astronaut to orbit Earth. Johnson was also part of the team that calculated where and when to launch the rocket for the Apollo 11 mission of 1969, which sent the first three men to the Moon. Johnson later worked on the space shuttle program. She retired from NASA in 1986.\n\nJohnson received numerous awards and honours for her work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2015). In 2016 NASA named a building, the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility, after her. That year Margot Lee Shetterly published Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, about the West Computers, including Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. A film based on the book was also released in 2016. Johnson\u2019s memoir, My Remarkable Journey (2021; written with Joylette Hylick and Katherine Moore), was published posthumously."}, {"url": "https://www.scripts.com/writer/catherine_johnson/8416", "page_content": "Catherine Johnson\n\nCatherine Johnson is a British playwright, producing works for stage and television.

Active between 1972 and 1982, the Swedish pop/dance group is one of the most popular international groups of all time, with hits that spanned the charts of Europe, North America and Australia.\n\nThe musical came to fruition under the idea of theatre producer, Judy Craymer. After seeing the 1983 musical, Chess, for which, Andersson and Ulvaeus also wrote the music, she asked to sit down with them and talk about future plans. When she heard their song \"The Winner Takes It All,\" she realized the theatrical potential of the group's pop songs. Although the composers were initially not enthusiastic about the idea, they commissioned her to go forward with their work. Craymer then recruited playwright, Catherine Johnson, to write the book and took on Phyllida Lloyd as the director of the original London production.\n\nMamma Mia! premiered in the West End at the Prince Edward Theatre on April 6, 1999. It has been extremely successful and underwent two different location transfers (to the Prince of Wales Theatre in June 2004 and to the Novello Theatre in September 2012); it continues to play to full houses to this day. Toronto was the first city to produce the show after premiering in London, with a production that ran from May 22, 2000, to May 22, 2005.\n\nThe musical made its debut in the United States at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, California, on November 17, 2000. On February 26, 2001, the production moved to the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles and then to the Cadillac Palace Theatre in Chicago on May 13 of the same year. Mamma Mia! moved further east to open on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on October 18, 2001, and then transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre on November 2, 2013. It remained one of the most popular shows on the Great White Way throughout its almost fifteen-year run.\n\nThe first North American tour started in Providence, Rhode Island, in February 2002, and then premiered in Las Vegas at the Mandelay Bay in February 2003.\n\nMamma Mia! has been performed in more than 40 countries and across five continents, including: Belgium, Greece, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. The first non-English production started in Hamburg, Germany, on November 3, 2002. Many international tours have run over the past several years, but the current one started off in Dublin on September 9, 2004.\n\nCultural Influence\n\nMamma Mia! has grossed $2 billion worldwide since premiering in 1999.\n\nOver 54 million people have seen the musical in 40 different countries.\n\nIt is said that, on any given day, there are at least seven performances of the musical being performed around the world.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the Broadway production was ranked the tenth-longest running musical in Broadway history.\n\nMamma Mia! has brought a renaissance to ABBA's music. Following the London premiere in 1999, the album, ABBA Gold, topped charts in the United Kingdom for the second time in fifteen years.\n\nThe London production of the musical was one of the first times that three women (producer, Judy Craymer; book writer, Catherine Johnson; and director, Phyllida Lloyd) collaborated as a creative team. Its immense commercial success has been significant to the image of female creators in musical theatre.\n\nIn June 2005, the Las Vegas production played its 1000th performance, becoming the longest-running West End or Broadway musical to ever play in Vegas.\n\nMamma Mia! has premiered in more cities faster than any musical in history.\n\nMamma Mia! has been translated into fourteen languages, including: German, Japanese, Spanish, Danish, French, and Chinese.\n\nThe show is the first major musical to play concurrently in three German cities, with productions in Hamburg, Stuttgart and Essen all running in 2007.\n\nThe Chinese premiere at the Shanghai Grand Theatre on July 11, 2011, was the first time a contemporary Western musical was presented in Chinese in Shanghai."}, {"url": "https://www.classicpopmag.com/2021/09/abba-mamma-mia/", "page_content": "Adored the world over, the global reach of ABBA now extends to a box office record-breaking musical and movie. Classic Pop looks at the twin phenomenon that is Mamma Mia!\n\nOn any given day, numerous different productions of ABBA: Mamma Mia! \u2013 the musical inspired by ABBA\u2019s mammoth hits \u2013 plays somewhere round the globe. Its subsequent silver screen spin-off, Mamma Mia! The Movie, is now the most successful film musical ever. Not for nothing are songwriting partners Benny and Bj\u00f6rn, cited as fourth best-selling artists of all time.\n\nIt was while the pair were working on the West End to Broadway musical, Chess with Tim Rice, in around 1983, that they first met theatrical producer Judy Craymer. The determined 20-something had risen through the ranks from stage manager of the original production of Cats, to Tim Rice\u2019s production assistant and onto his executive producer of Chess.\n\nInspired by the drama of The Winner Takes It All \u2013 Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s ultimate break-up hit song \u2013 Craymer had the lightbulb idea of setting ABBA\u2019s best-loved songs in a stage context.\n\nInitially, the guys were not overly keen on the concept, and it took the would-be impresario 10 years to persuade them to give her the rights to their most treasured works. However, once in agreement, they were artistically involved from the start, along with ABBA\u2019s Anni-Frid in a financial capacity.\n\nABBA: Mamma Mia! \u2013 trailer\n\nSaid to have sealed the deal was the pitching of a top-notch creative team \u2013 Andersson and Ulvaeus were already on good working terms with Craymer as proposed producer.\n\nThe script by \u2018savvy writer\u2019, Brit playwright Catherine Johnson was promptly sanctioned; while director Phyllida Lloyd impressed with her previous high-end output of Brecht and Shakespeare. Firing on all fronts, Craymer put everything on the line to make it all happen, selling her flat and giving up her day job in the process.\n\nBy 1997, the musical juggernaut was well and truly on its way. It lived up to its billing: \u2018The storytelling magic of ABBA\u2019s timeless songs with an enchanting tale of family and friendship unfolding on a Greek island paradise.\u2019\n\nIt was a surprisingly modern narrative centred round the wedding of a girl who had invited her three possible biological fathers to her important event. On the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi, Sophie aches for her father to walk her down the aisle \u2013 but does not know his identity. Discovering her mother\u2019s old diary by chance, she finds entries recording romantic dates with three men in swift succession.\n\nThinking one of these may well be her father, ahead of the wedding she sends an invite out to each in the guise of her unsuspecting mother, Donna. As Donna is caught up with meeting guests at her taverna including old best friends (and ex-bandmates) Tanya and Rosie, in turn Sophie secretly meets each of her mother\u2019s ex-lovers.\n\nShocked to see the men after all this time, Donna exits overcome with emotion. Soon confusion reigns for both mother and daughter, with all three men wanting to escort Sophie on her big day.\n\nThe somewhat soap-opera story breezes by ably abetted by a string of ABBA pearls including Super Trouper, Lay All Your Love On Me, Dancing Queen, Knowing Me, Knowing You, Take A Chance On Me, Thank You For The Music, Money, Money Money, The Winner Takes It All, Voulez Vous, and of course, Mamma Mia! \u2013 the title track taken from the band\u2019s 1975 smash.\n\nVarious plot twists and turns later, it all resolves with a giant \u2018sing\u2019 in the tale via I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, and I Have A Dream, before a lively audience interacting finale and reprise of Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen.\n\nThe non-stop ABBA jukebox musical proved to mesmerise an audience like no other production before or (so far) since. Currently entering its 18th year, the London production has now been seen by more than 10 per cent of the population.\n\nFollowing its London premiere in 1999, the album ABBA Gold notably topped the UK charts again. By 2001, the musical opened on Broadway, and has now played in more than 40 countries in all six continents \u2013 to a worldwide audience of more than 60 million.\n\nNot surprisingly, Hollywood soon came calling. As Craymer later related, after all her hard slog: \u201cThere was no way I was going to sell the rights and have someone else do it.\u201d True to what would become her indomitable reputation as \u201cthe greatest showbiz impresario of the 21st century\u201d, she wisely insisted on refusing all Tinseltown offers until reaching an agreement to helm the film herself along with the original key team: Catherine Johnson as writer, and Phyllida Lloyd, directing. She fought suggestions for other experienced directors (such as Steven Spielberg) to take over.\n\nEqually, insistence was made that the musical\u2019s central middle-aged, hippie mother character remained just so. Politely declined were mentions of casting younger glamour girls like Kylie Minogue, and favoured from the start, was Meryl Streep. Self declared \u2018lifelong ABBA fan\u2019 Streep stated: \u201cI am Mamma Mia!\u201d on being cast, and said it was one of the happiest roles of her life.\n\nShe explained she\u2019d found watching the 2001 Broadway musical version \u2018life-affirming\u2019 in the wake of the 9/11 Twin Towers tragedy, and thus made contact via a congratulations note, with Craymer.\n\nFinally, actor Tom Hanks offered to make it on the Brit producer\u2019s strict terms with his production company, and soon a useful \u2018ABBA-mad\u2019 high-up at Universal Pictures got things moving.\n\nBesides Streep \u2013 as spirited, single mother Donna \u2013 the stellar cast boasted Amanda Seyfried as her daughter Sophie, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as her best friends, and as the trio of love interests, Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard, ex \u2018Mr Darcy\u2019 Colin Firth and former 007, Pierce Brosnan.\n\nIronically, as well as the main film location of the gorgeous Greek island of Skiathos, Donna\u2019s villa in the film was in reality a set shot on the 007 stage at Pinewood Studios.\n\nMost external shots, with the exception of the seaside hamlet of Damouchari in the Pelion region, were filmed on Kastani beach, on the small island of Skopelos. The beach bar and jetty were temporarily built for showcase song and dance numbers: who can forget the highlight of the cast strutting their collective stuff to Dancing Queen with such joy on the jetty? \u2013 all to that ABBA soundtrack.\n\nEagle-eyed ABBA fans may have spotted cameos by Benny Andersson as the Dancing Queen piano player, while more uncharacteristically, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus played a \u2018blink and he\u2019s gone\u2019 Greek god!\n\nCast-wise, most naturally attuned to the ABBA repertoire, and known for their singing ability, was Meryl Streep. Having taken opera singing lessons as a child, she had previously performed in films including Postcards From the Edge, Silkwood, and most recently, Florence \u2013 about opera singer Florence Foster Jenkins.\n\nConsequently among the movie\u2019s many awards, she was Golden Globe nominated for best actress. The fact that some of the cast had not been chosen for their vocalising led to some mixed reviews from critics. Most especially Pierce Brosnan, who may have looked the part but somehow didn\u2019t quite sound it \u2013 and as a result, won the Golden Raspberry award for worst supporting actor.\n\nAt least he had a great time making the film \u2013 \u201cone of the best jobs ever\u201d, he said. \u201cThe Mamma Mia! experience that has been created and given people so much joy on the stage has bled into this film.\u201d The cast certainly looked like they were having a ball and allegedly, were whooping it up after hours, as contrary to usual film-making stipulations, producer Judy kept the party mood going with beers all-round for cast and crew.\n\nComing up to a decade after the movie was made, fans still make pilgrimages to the locations, particularly the picturesque \u2013 but admittedly petite \u2013 Ioannis white chapel used in the wedding scene. Beyond the likes of Grease and Dirty Dancing, Mamma Mia! instantly became the song and dance hit of the decade.\n\nPacking in a cracking 24 ABBA hits, as a feel-good escape, it more than hit the mark. As Meryl Streep summed up: \u201cIt\u2019s about dreams, your hopes, your happiness.\u201d Opening in 2008, it opened at No. 1 in 35 countries.\n\nCraymer had staked all on its success. In the 90s money had been so tight that on the verge of bankruptcy, she had had to sell her house. In interviews in the British press, she later related: \u201cAll my friends thought I was crazy. They said ABBA was so passe and I should get over it. But I knew everyone would want to see the musical. I had to make people believe in what I was doing and it became a complete obsession.\u201d\n\nHer choice to, in effect, \u2018take a chance\u2019 on ABBA paid dividends to an astounding degree: overall from her Mamma Mia! concepts, she is reported to have made a reported \u00a390 million.\n\nAwarded an MBE, she went on to produce Viva Forever!, the 2012 musical based on the Spice Girls\u2019 hits, and now spends much of her off-duty time fund-raising for Mamma Mia!-linked charities such as Breast Cancer Research.\n\nIn much the same way, Bristol writer Catherine Johnson shares a similar \u2018roughing it to riches\u2019 backstory. Her colourful life could itself create a compelling screenplay. Expelled from school at 16, married at 18, divorced at 24, she was a hard-up single mum with another child on the way when entering \u2013 and winning \u2013 a newspaper playwriting competition changed her life.\n\nHer hard-hitting play, Rag Doll was staged by the Bristol Old Vic, and penning further plays followed \u2013 including Bay City Rollers-based Shang-A-Lang \u2013 before stints on popular UK TV series such as Casualty, Band Of Gold and Byker Grove.\n\nABBA: Mamma Mia! \u2013 Here We Go Again trailer\n\nRecommended to producer Judy Craymer by a mentor friend, she found the idea of the ABBA project entertaining but over-familiar with financial hardship, did not take its commercial chances seriously. For that matter, neither did ABBA\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue that Mamma Mia! would be a worldwide success,\u201d he later admitted.\n\nFor the two years it took to write the book, it was a \u2018scary-ish time\u2019 for Johnson. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford for things to go wrong,\u201d she said, looking back on the time. It\u2019s now well-known that Johnson deliberately wrote the plot about a single mother \u2013 notably one \u2018who wasn\u2019t as the press often liked to paint, a drain on the state\u2026 a working single mother who had got her life together and the relationship she had with her daughter.\u2019\n\nAs she told The Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ve had less years of being a success than I had of being a failure. For a lot of my life, I felt a complete letdown\u201d.\n\nConsequently, though she has gone onto create other plays, she is happy if Mamma Mia! is fated to remain her career\u2019s masterwork. Having initially given the musical a lifespan of three months, it\u2019s now going strong in its second decade, having amassed over an eye-watering \u00a32 billion worldwide.\n\nBankrolling nearly $610 million on a $52 million budget, Mamma Mia! is the highest grossing musical film of all time in the UK. Such was its unprecedented success that co-chairman of Universal Studios David Linde, made a press statement that in years to come, there could be a sequel \u2013 adding he would be delighted if the creative quintet of Craymer, Johnson, Lloyd, Andersson and Ulvaeus reunited to create a follow-up based round other ABBA songs.\n\nThe world\u2019s premiere may have taken place elsewhere, but on 4 July 2008, all eyes were on the Swedish film screening. In attending this, all four members of ABBA were photographed together for the first time in 22 years. It was aptly held on ABBA\u2019s home turf in Stockholm, and at the Rival theatre \u2013 part of the boutique hotel owned by Benny, where each room has a copy of ABBA Gold \u2013 the album that spawned both memorable musical to movie productions. Agnetha and Anni-Frid arrived dancing with star of the movie Meryl Streep, before joining the ABBA boys and rest of the cast, on the balcony.\n\nA show of solidarity between the former band members, marking the next chapter in ABBA\u2019s enduring success: from international stage to screen, in 2021, their perfectly crafted pop legacy lives on."}]}
