He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding %, and once in double plays.[2]\n\nIn four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were World Champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only postseason homer came in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2\u20132 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees.[2]\n\nIn 1949, he developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended, with his final game taking place on October 1, 1949[2]\n\nAcross a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played.\n\nMinor League Manager [ edit ]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Kurowski coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972.[1] Additionally, he made rare appearances on the field as a player, working in both the Cardinal and Cleveland Indians organizations. In his final professional at-bat in 1959, he recorded a base hit with Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League.[4]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nKurowski was a huge contributor for the Cardinals during their most successful run as a franchise, winning the World Series in 1942, 1944 and 1946 and adding another National League pennant in 1943. In games that Kurowski played, the Cardinals had a winning percentage of .620, finishing in second place or higher in every season of his career and winning 90+ games in all but two seasons. After retiring, the Redbirds wouldn't finish as high as second place again until 1957, and wouldn't claim another National League pennant until 1964.\n\nThe five time National League All-Star started the 1946 All-Star Game at third base. But Kurowski's impact each season was felt long after the Midsummer Classic, as he proved to be a consistent player as the dog days of an often unforgiving baseball summer wore on. For instance, his slugging percentage increased by 15 points in the second half of the season, and he maintained his career .286 batting average across both halves of the season. Moreover, he hit 47% more home runs (and 15% more extra-base hits) in the second half of the season.[5]\n\nSuch was his consistency that Kurowski appeared five times in the National League MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947.\n\nHe gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988.[1]\n\nIn an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team.[6]\n\nKurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.\n\nSee also [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8391/george-john-kurowski", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

He won all five of his Gold Glove Awards with the Cardinals and is often considered one of the finest gloves ever at third base.\n\n\n\nBoyer was born in Liberty, Mo., and became a high school star in Alba. He signed with the Cardinals in 1949 as a pitcher, but during one game in his second Minor League season, the club's third baseman got injured. Boyer took over at the position, showed his hitting talent and never pitched again. He debuted in '55 and made his first of 11 All-Star teams in '56. He\u2019s the only Cardinal in history to have hit for the cycle twice ('61 and '64). In '58, he hit .307, the first of four consecutive seasons with at least a .300 average.\n\n\n\nIn Game 4 of the 1964 World Series against the Yankees, Boyer hit a sixth-inning grand slam to rally the Cardinals from a 3-0 deficit to a 4-3 win. Boyer and the Cardinals beat the Yankees and their third baseman, Ken\u2019s brother, Clete, in seven games that year.\n\n\n\nBoyer was traded to the Mets in 1965, but he returned to the Cardinals as a coach and Minor League manager in the 1970s, taking over the big league club from '78 until part way through '80. He died of lung cancer at age 51 in '82, and when the Cardinals retired his No. 14 two years later, Boyer became the only non-Hall of Famer to have his number hanging on the left-field wall of Busch Stadium. Fifty-five years after he left the Cardinals, Boyer still ranks third in home runs (255), sixth in RBIs (1,001) and ninth in hits (1,855) in the franchise\u2019s record books.\n\n\n\n\\\"\\\\[Boyer\\\\] wasn't a guy for show, at all,\\\" Mike Shannon, Boyer\u2019s eventual successor at third base, told Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2009. \\\"He wasn't flashy. Everything he did, he did smooth. He just did the job. And if you look up his stats, those are pretty good stats. He was like the Clydesdale of third basemen. He was a great big, strong guy who had a lot of grace. He was the prototype third baseman.\\\"\",\"type\":\"text\"},{\"__typename\":\"Video\",\"contentDate\":\"1964-10-11T07:33:00Z\",\"preferredPlaybackScenarioURL({\\\"preferredPlaybacks\\\":\\\"mp4AvcPlayback\\\"})\":\"http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2016/11/02/1210854883/1478109747553/asset_450K.mp4\",\"type\":\"video\",\"description\":\"10/11/64: Ken Boyer's grand slam in the top of the 6th inning gives the Cardinals a 4-3 lead over the Yankees in Game 4 of the World Series\",\"displayAsVideoGif\":false,\"duration\":\"00:00:41\",\"slug\":\"boyer-s-grand-slam-c1210854883\",\"tags\":[{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-away-team-id-138\",\"title\":\"HBmig away_team_id: 138\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-home-team-id-147\",\"title\":\"HBmig home_team_id: 147\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"PersonTag\",\"slug\":\"playerid-111321\",\"title\":\"Ken Boyer\",\"person\":{\"__ref\":\"Person:111321\"},\"type\":\"player\"},{\"__typename\":\"TeamTag\",\"slug\":\"teamid-138\",\"title\":\"St. Louis Cardinals\",\"team\":{\"__ref\":\"Team:138\"},\"type\":\"team\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-team-id-138\",\"title\":\"HBmig 138\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"GameTag\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-mlbtax-rbi\",\"title\":\"HBmig 2013/03/19/sfnmlb-seamlb-1\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-subject-mlbcom-top-play\",\"title\":\"HBmig MLBCOM_TOP_PLAY\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-combined-media-state-media-archive\",\"title\":\"HBmig MEDIA_ARCHIVE\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-subject-mlbmobile-application-highlight\",\"title\":\"HBmig MLBMOBILE_APPLICATION_HIGHLIGHT\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"InternalTag\",\"slug\":\"hbmig-mlbtax-vtp-1960\",\"title\":\"HBmig 1960s\",\"type\":\"unsupported\"},{\"__typename\":\"TaxonomyTag\",\"slug\":\"home-run\",\"title\":\"home run\",\"type\":\"taxonomy\"},{\"__typename\":\"TaxonomyTag\",\"slug\":\"classic\",\"title\":\"classic\",\"type\":\"taxonomy\"},{\"__typename\":\"TaxonomyTag\",\"slug\":\"hitting\",\"title\":\"hitting\",\"type\":\"taxonomy\"},{\"__typename\":\"TaxonomyTag\",\"slug\":\"world-series\",\"title\":\"World Series\",\"type\":\"taxonomy\"},{\"__typename\":\"TaxonomyTag\",\"slug\":\"postseason\",\"title\":\"postseason\",\"type\":\"taxonomy\"},{\"__typename\":\"TaxonomyTag\",\"slug\":\"highlight\",\"title\":\"highlight\",\"type\":\"taxonomy\"}],\"thumbnail\":{\"__typename\":\"Thumbnail\",\"templateUrl\":\"https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/private/{formatInstructions}/mlb/nhs0t08evxif1tecehqs\"},\"title\":\"Boyer's grand slam\",\"relativeSiteUrl\":\"/video/boyer-s-grand-slam-c1210854883\"},{\"__typename\":\"Markdown\",\"content\":\"**2.** Scott Rolen **, 2002-07**\n\n_Key fact: Accumulated 25.9 WAR in five and a half seasons with the Cardinals_\n\n\n\nRolen was part of the backbone of one of the most successful eras in team history, from the juggernaut teams of 2004-05 that won 205 total games to the '06 World Series team.

He was 81.\n\nKurowski, who lived in Shillington, had been in failing health since suffering a stroke after heart bypass surgery in July, according to his wife, Joan.\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 5, 1942, a remarkable stretch of World Series success for the Yankees came to an end with one swing by a rookie infielder. George (Whitey) Kurowski's two-run home run off Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of Game 5 propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in 1926.\n\nThat Kurowski was even in a major league uniform defied the odds. When he was growing up in Reading, Pa., he fell off a fence and landed in broken glass, severely cutting his right arm. Two years later, he began suffering severe pain and was found to have developed osteomyelitis, a bone inflammation. Three inches of bone above his wrist were surgically removed, leaving the arm weakened and with an unnatural bend. He strengthened his arm muscles as he embarked on a baseball career, but his right arm, his throwing arm, had become shorter than his left."}]}
