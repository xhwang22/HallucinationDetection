It fits his lifestyle.\n\nStewart Regan says this has been the biggest week of his own tenure\n\n\"We have a laugh and a joke about his popularity. But, if he keeps winning matches, he can work here until he gets his bus pass.\n\n\"He's really enjoying it and doing well. Mind on qualification just now. Let's hope we can do it.\"\n\nStrachan's side travel to Dublin equal on points with Germany, behind Group D leaders Poland and with the Irish in fourth.\n\nA win on Saturday would leave Scotland well placed to qualify for the finals of a major tournament for the first time in 18 years.\n\nRegan says the build-up to the game has been the \"biggest week\" of his tenure as chief executive.\n\n\"This is a huge week for Scottish football,\" added the chief executive.\n\n\"We've never been this close to qualification for some time.\n\n\"The way Gordon Strachan has the team playing, it's full of optimism, hope.\n\n\"We have a great chance. It will be a very tight, intense game in Dublin but one going into hoping we can get a result.\"\n\nMeanwhile, newly-elected president of the SFA Alan McRae believes reaching the Euro 2016 finals would be \"a fitting tribute to the memory of the late David Taylor\".\n\nTaylor, a former SFA chief executive who went on to work for Uefa, passed away last year."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/19/gordon-strachan-scotland-euro-2016-draw", "page_content": "In a short spell, Gordon Strachan has allowed previously beleaguered followers of Scotland's international team to once again indulge in what they do best. Dreaming.\n\nThe improvement presided over by Strachan since taking office 13 months ago means there is excitement ahead of the Scots' latest date with destiny. Namely, that is, the draw for the European Championships qualifying phase .\n\n\"To qualify,\" says Strachan when asked what a legitimate ambition is, with Euro 2016 in mind.\n\n\"But everything has to be done as a group. If you don't understand that whether you are a fan, or a coach, or a player, you can't be with us.\"\n\nThere is logic behind the latter assertion. Gone are the days whereby Scotland could rely on the individual brilliance of Denis Law, Kenny Dalglish or, in a glance to the more recent past, James McFadden to win matches.\n\n\"We aren't a nation that has produced players who can eliminate people, go by them and score goals,\" Strachan adds. \"We don't have the Hazard, the Oscar, the Modric, the Su\u00e1rez, the Bale. Everything we have to do is as a team. So when you are like that, you have to work more as a team. We have trained, trained, trained and trained. If one or two of them think it's a bit hard then that's unlucky, we can't be guided by one or two.\n\n\"A lot of people wondered why we couldn't beat Serbia in our last campaign. Then you watch Manchester City play Chelsea, two of the best squads in the world, and there are four Serbians playing. Our players are nowhere near that level so that's what you are up against.\"\n\nIn maintaining this realistic analysis, Strachan points out it is \"far harder\" to qualify for major tournaments than when he was part of a successful Scotland team. Yet there is not a hint of annoyance over Scotland's diminished status, which will see them once again in pot four when the draw takes place in Nice.\n\n\"I like it like this,\" Strachan says. \"The groups are balanced. You don't want four top sides in the one group then two of them get knocked out. That wouldn't be fair on the spectator for the spectacle which should be the finals.\n\n\"You have to fight for the right to get into these pots and we are where we deserve to be so there is no point complaining.\"\n\nAnd has he planned a best and worst case scenario? \"Absolutely not. I don't even bother about it.\n\n\"I have always been like that as a manager, I don't bother about it until it comes. Are you going to worry about it, get yourself all worked up before it happens? No, I haven't given it a second thought.\"\n\nStrachan will be at this summer's World Cup in his ongoing punditry role with ITV. That, added to family and work commitments, mean Strachan firmly refutes any suggestion of boredom.\n\n\"I work with good people,\" he says. \"I get close to and watch the best games, I get the best seats, to speak to coaches.\n\n\"I have got something to do every day. I have never woken up one morning and thought, 'I have nothing to do.' There are times when I have to say enough is enough because at the end of some weeks I say \u201a 'I'm knackered now.'\"\n\nTime in Strachan's company remains well spent. He cites Howard Wilkinson as the biggest managerial influence on his career rather than Sir Alex Ferguson. In fact, the refusal to discuss his relationship with the former Manchester United manager suggests it has never been repaired after Ferguson took a swipe at Strachan in his first autobiography.\n\nA move into the international scene has reinvigorated Strachan's stock, just as he seems in the process of doing likewise for the nation itself. And yet, the Scottish domestic set up is still, and rightly, viewed from even the inside as a troubled one.\n\n\"I don't think the standard is as good as when I joined Celtic [in 2005],\" Strachan says. \"Look at the Hibs team, what a team that was. Hearts were backed by a lot of money with top international players in there. Rangers had won the league so there were four teams really at it at that point. The league was stronger, I don't think anyone will disagree.\n\n\"When Walter Smith got his team to the Uefa Cup final and we had a Celtic team in the last 16 of the Champions League, I think there were nine [Scottish] players at that level which definitely benefits the international team.\"\n\nStrachan was a successful Celtic manager during times of austerity between 2005 and 2009. By the time of his departure, even Strachan's detractors must surely have conceded that \u2013 those who didn't should have witnessed Tony Mowbray's subsequent failure.\n\nIf you ask Strachan which is the tougher job, that at Celtic or Scotland, the answer is a forceful one.\n\n\"Celtic, by a million miles,\" he says. \"It is non-stop, under the microscope. Which I wouldn't have missed for the world, by the way. I enjoyed the challenge, I enjoyed the fight.\n\n\"I can disappear for weeks now, I can live in another country. With players, you have the choice not to pick them, you don't have to deal with them again if they don't want to be part of the squad.\n\n\"The other thing I think is different is the media generally want you to do well here. You don't get that with Celtic or Rangers because you [the media] are not allowed to. I get the general feeling that everybody wants the Scotland team to do well.\n\n\"Apart from the punter or player who thinks every journalist hates them and wants to be involved in horrendous results, I don't get that feeling. I think nearly everybody wants the Scotland team to do well and because of that, it's a better working environment for me.\"\n\nStrachan swiftly dismisses the widely-held notion that he stayed at Celtic one season too long. \"I would have missed a League Cup final, beating Rangers.\"\n\nThere was a struggle at Middlesbrough thereafter, with Strachan refusing to take compensation for more than half of a four-year contract which was ripped up.\n\n\"They were great people to me but there wasn't that intensity,\" he explains. \"I found it very strange. Maybe the drive for me wasn't there after wanting to fight the world for 15 years. I don't know, I don't over analyse.\n\n\"It's the only place where I feel that I didn't earn my money. Whether I was on \u00a315-a-week at Dundee or a lot more at Celtic, I always felt like I earned my money. I couldn't blame anybody at Middlesbrough for that, it was my fault. When you know it is your fault then it is easier to deal with.\"\n\nFor now, club football is a distant \u2013 or possibly non \u2013 issue.\n\n\"Never say never but honestly I can't see myself doing anything else but this, as long as they want me,\" Strachan says. \"It's not even in my mind, I haven't thought about it. I enjoy this.\"\n\nAlbeit he won't say as much, events later this month will form a key part in just how far that enjoyment can extend."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/06/gordon-strachan-scotland-germany-euro-2016-qualifiers", "page_content": "Now for the real stuff. As Gordon Strachan will readily admit, the improvement in Scotland under his management is partly offset by only being visible in friendly matches and a World Cup qualification section that had degenerated into dead-rubber territory by the time of his appointment.\n\nOn Sunday night in Dortmund, Scotland\u2019s latest bid to end a wait for a major finals appearance, which stretches back to 1998, begins and Germany, the world champions, will not provide a smooth European Championship start.\n\nWith a couple of notable exceptions, Strachan has generally carried that useful commodity of luck in management. He may well have done so again on the international scene.\n\nNot only has the European Championship finals been expanded but the Scots find themselves in a group that offers promise. Germany will qualify, Gibraltar will make up the numbers and there are cases to be made for the three nations Scotland will challenge for second place \u2013 the Republic of Ireland, Georgia and Poland \u2013 carrying teams that have passed their best.\n\nBy mid-November, Scotland will have faced those three nations and an assessment of their qualifying hopes will be more legitimate than after 90 minutes inside the Westfalenstadion. Recent campaigns have been ruined by poor starts.\n\nIn the specific context of their German examination, Scotland\u2019s task has been made tougher by the absence through injury of Robert Snodgrass, who has been prominent in navy blue under Strachan. More galling is a glance at a weak defence, which is likely to come under serious pressure from a side looking to roar back from a midweek friendly defeat to Argentina. Germany were 4-0 down after 50 minutes before clawing back two goals.\n\n\u201cThis is a competitive game and the Germans come alive when it becomes competitive,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cIt was a wonderful game to watch from a neutral\u2019s point of view but we didn\u2019t take anything from it. When the Germans have to compete, they are a different animal.\u201d\n\nOne team Strachan did take pointers from is Chile, who were widely considered as unfortunate to lose 1-0 to Germany in March. Chile played 3-4-3 that night, but it would come as a major surprise if Strachan were to match that bold system.\n\nThere is cause for optimism even if this tie ends in expected defeat. Strachan\u2019s baby-steps with his squad have restored optimism to a Tartan Army who had become battle-weary after a series of blows and substandard performances from their team. Scotland have lost four of Strachan\u2019s 12 matches in charge with one of them, at Wembley against England, slightly harsh after a stirring performance from the visitors in a narrow 3-2 defeat.\n\nIn Allan McGregor, Craig Gordon and David Marshall, Strachan has three goalkeepers who will be the envy of many international coaches \u2013 albeit only one of them can play at a time. The influence and composure of the captain, Darren Fletcher, has been restored to the dressing room and pitch while Steven Naismith\u2019s excellent start to the domestic season at Everton means Scotland have a potency of their own.\n\nStrachan is an unlikely hero. The idea of such elevated status, should he return Scotland to a major platform in France two years from now, does not sit all that comfortably with the man who won 50 caps. Yet players and supporters have clearly bought into the Strachan plan. \u201cThere is an optimism around everybody; even at times when we haven\u2019t played well, we have still got results,\u201d Naismith said.\n\n\u201cWe have some momentum but all of that work has just been preparation for the big thing coming up. That\u2019s what we have to understand and believe. Everybody needs to work for the team. One of the first things the manager said was one of the best: \u2018Even if you are having a bad game, you have to work for your team-mates.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen he gives you the freedom, he lets you go and do your stuff. He knows that the players are good enough to do what they do without the worry of losing the ball. We have players who can see forward passes, see runs and score goals.\n\n\u201cWe are also so much more solid. That has got to be encouraging for us. In the past, we have done well in games and given as good as we got but left ourselves too open or not defended a set piece well enough, which has cost us.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34181652", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\n'We are still in this' - Gordon Strachan\n\nScotland can still reach the Euro 2016 finals despite defeats by Georgia and Germany, says manager Gordon Strachan.\n\nWorld champions Germany won 3-2 at Hampden on Monday to leave the Scots fourth in Group D - four points behind third-placed Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe top two in the nine groups and best third-placed team qualify; the other eight in third face a two-leg play-off.\n\n\"We are still in this,\" said Strachan, whose side host Poland and visit Gibraltar in their final two games.\n\nUnlike group leaders Germany, Poland and Republic of Ireland, Scotland cannot now claim one of the two automatic qualification spots.\n\nThe target is third place and a double-header against another third-place team for a spot in the Euro 2016 finals in France.\n\nRepublic of Ireland, who beat Georgia 1-0 on Monday, have a home match against Germany before finishing their campaign with a trip to Poland.\n\n\"Well played to the Irish for winning,\" said Strachan. \"We've had two chances over the last couple of days to pick up points and we've not done that, so we can't look about and blame anybody else for anything.\n\n\"But trust me, we're still in this.\n\n\"If we play like that, the same determination with a wee bit luck - when you play the world champions you need a wee bit of luck.

Scotland went on to beat Georgia and Ireland at home, either side of a 2-2 draw with section leaders Poland in Warsaw. For captain Scott Brown \u2013 who played under Strachan at Celtic FC \u2013 the manager's spirit has infected the team.\n\n\"He just loves football,\" he told UEFA.com. \"Whenever we're away, he is up bright and early, looking forward to training.

So maybe it would be nice to give a little bit back to them. But selfishly, individually, you're still looking to it as one of those things you want to achieve in your career.\"\n\nStrachan, for his part, is certain Scotland \u2013 and their fans \u2013 would grace any big championship. \"I've been to so many finals recently through my television work and it's definitely something missing for Scottish fans,\" said the ex-Coventry City FC, Southampton FC and Middlesbrough FC trainer. \"I know they could have added to the occasions everywhere I went. And I know people in the footballing world are desperate for Scotland to get there.\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/09/scotland-euro-2016-gordon-strachan", "page_content": "A message from rugby union resonated in Scottish football. Geoff Cooke, then coach of the British & Irish Lions, gave a lecture in 1993 at which Craig Brown was in attendance.\n\n\u201cGeoff pointed out that you could go down a route of spending millions on youth development but if your national team, your flagship team, wasn\u2019t doing well then you were wasting your money,\u201d the former Scotland manager recalls. \u201cThe same could apply to an individual; can you imagine trying to promote tennis in Scotland without Andy Murray?\u201d\n\nThe message Brown took on board 23 years ago is especially salient now. That is not just because as Scotland slumped to a 3-0 defeat by France in a friendly in Metz on Saturday evening the two second-half chants from the Tartan Army related to Murray\u2019s appearance in the French Open final the following day.\n\nIf Scottish disappointment at not qualifying for major football tournaments has long since been reduced to a shrug, then Euro 2016 still has cause to be wounding. The increase to 24 teams was insufficient to secure Scottish involvement. Near neighbours who were once on the outside looking in are in tournament mode as the Scots endure a watching role. Aside from Willie Collum, a referee, that is.\n\nThe reason for Scotland\u2019s slide into footballing oblivion is widely debated. When the going was relatively good, a mixture of negligence, arrogance, short-termism and mismanagement was never likely to leave positive legacies.\n\nThe silver lining being clung to relates to the potential for a much-improved domestic scene next season. The arrival of Brendan Rodgers at Celtic and imminent return of the Old Firm fixture has ramped up excitement. Both matters rather belie a bigger picture but a general drift in attention from international to club matters has been evident.\n\nGordon Strachan has his obvious failings as the latest individual to occupy the post of national team manager, but nobody should be deluded enough to believe Scotland has a rightful place anywhere near the top table of international football. The difficult aspect this time? Neither do Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Albania or Iceland. This hasn\u2019t been lost on Strachan, who will not attend matches in France on the basis it may prove too painful to watch so many others enjoying a party that he couldn\u2019t successfully negotiate a path towards.\n\nBrown was the last manager to lead Scotland on to such a stage, in 1998. By the time he could not secure qualification for the 2002 World Cup, Brown felt \u201cashamed and embarrassed\u201d when resigning. \u201cWe had just been so used to qualifying,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI would maybe have thought twice about going if I had the ability to contemplate what was going to happen during all these intervening years but at the time that [gap without qualification] would have been inconceivable to me.\n\n\u201cThere was an intolerance then towards not qualifying. There\u2019s more forgiveness now, which I am pleased about because it takes resource into account.\u201d\n\nBrown has witnessed Scotland\u2019s toils with dismay. \u201cI was involved in five tournaments from Mexico 86 onwards,\u201d he says. \u201cBack home you had Scotland flags flying out of cars and tenement windows, pubs selling more drink than ever before, kids running around in Scotland jerseys. There was a real enthusiasm in the nation.\n\n\u201cNow there is the danger of disengagement. Kids instead run around in Barcelona and Real Madrid shirts. It has gone from real football feelgood factor around major tournaments to a football depression.\u201d\n\nEconomics are also pertinent here. The Scottish Football Association has been denied revenue from nine tournaments and counting. It is no coincidence the game has suffered on account of a lack of proper investment in facilities and personnel.\n\nScotland remains a football-obsessed country. We also live in tribal times. And yet, the time-honoured vociferous backing of any opponent to England in finals has diminished in recent years. There are two legitimate explanations for that: slight embarrassment that the best a Scotland supporter could do is shout against a neighbour elevated to a different footballing planet; and the establishment of essentially a more rounded and cosmopolitan nation. We are no longer living in Thatcherite times where \u201cThe English\u201d were openly detested at every Scottish turn.\n\nFacts and figures back this up. A survey conducted by Sporting Index concluded 21% of Scottish football followers would support England in the upcoming weeks, a higher figure than the \u201canyone but England\u201d brigade. Perhaps more tellingly, 34% said they felt no need to support any team in essentially blanking out what should be a marquee event.

The lengthy preamble to another international qualifying campaign, when the feverish hopes of a nation desperate to return to the big stage collide with a stark reality in which Scotland remain lengthy outsiders.\n\nGordon Strachan would have been fully aware of just how difficult the task of getting Scotland to the World Cup finals in Russia in 2018 was going to be when he agreed to prolong his time in the job of national manager.\n\nHis decision to do so was welcomed not unanimously, but by a significant portion of the Scottish football family.\n\nScotland media conference in Prague: Gordon Strachan and Darren Fletcher\n\nA pragmatic view is that there is no realistic candidate for the role better qualified to turn a squad of jobbing footballers into a team capable of at least making the play-offs.\n\nIt had appeared that Strachan had found a way of doing exactly that as qualifying for Euro 2016 began relatively brightly.\n\nBut the early promise went unfulfilled as other equally unglamorous nations - the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland among them - managed to emerge successfully from their groups to take their place in France this summer.\n\nThe players in the Scotland squads for the two friendlies are vying for places in the World Cup qualifying campaign\n\nScots can learn from Czechs\n\nIn fact, Scotland's opponents on Thursday night were able to top their section without having - as Christophe Berra put it - any world-beaters in their squad, although Petr Cech could put up a strong case for having earned that description.\n\nNonetheless, Berra's point is a fair one, as was his assertion that Scotland's players as well as Strachan could learn from the Czechs.\n\nThe job done by Pavel Vrba in leading them to Euro 2016, ahead of Turkey, Iceland and the Netherlands is mightily impressive, because other than Cech and the ageing Tomas Rosicky, the bulk of this squad is drawn from Europe's lesser leagues - Turkey, Switzerland, the Czech Republic itself and the English Championship.\n\nIn that respect, the pool is much like that of the Scots. Just as Vrba has a couple of mainstays playing in the Bundesliga, Strachan can pick from a handful of English Premier League players.\n\nOtherwise, neither squad has a superstar and yet the Czechs' qualifying record suggests they have a very good team.\n\nHead coach Pavel Vrba has guided the Czechs to the Euro 2016 finals\n\nQuite how they have achieved this will not become clear over the course of the 90 minutes on Thursday, but their success - and that of Albania, Slovakia, Iceland and others - proves that qualification need not be an impossible dream.\n\nOf course, qualifying for the World Cup will be tougher, with only the group winners making it through automatically.\n\nStrachan's challenge\n\nSo Strachan has to quickly rediscover the formula that worked at the outset of Euro 2016 qualifying, in the draw in Warsaw and home wins over Georgia and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNone of those were spectacular, but Scotland ground out results that should have been a solid platform for qualification.\n\nThe wheels began to come off in Dublin where Scotland nonetheless came away with a good point. But it appeared a spark had gone, never to be recovered.\n\nOver the course of the next four games - against the Czechs, Denmark and then Italy and France - the challenge for Strachan and his players is to recapture the belief that they can live with these countries and that what Northern Ireland and Wales have done, in ending long waits to return to a major tournament, is not beyond them.\n\nIt seems likely the squad that makes the trip to Malta in September will consist largely of the group of players who failed to build on that early promise in Euro qualifying.\n\nBut if the manager can identify one or two younger players in these friendly matches to complement those in whom he already has faith, that would be an additional bonus."}, {"url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2418279/Gordon-Strachan-lead-Scotland-Euro-2016-says-Gary-McAllister.html", "page_content": "McAllister: We've made progress under Strachan... he'll lead us to Euro 2016\n\n\n\nGary McAllister has backed Gordon Strachan to lead Scotland to the next European Championship finals in France.\n\nThe former Scotland captain believes the national team have taken huge strides under his former team-mate.\n\nAnd, after watching Tuesday\u2019s dramatic 2-1 win over Macedonia lift the Scots off the foot of their World Cup qualifying group, McAllister says Strachan is the man to end a 16-year absence from major international tournaments.\n\nHeading in the right direction: A delighted Gordon Strachan congratulates his side after sealing a decent win\n\n\u2018Gordon\u2019s done a fantastic job since he took over,\u2019 said the former Scots skipper. \u2018The performances have been getting better and better. But Gordon knows it\u2019s about getting results.\n\n\u2018They had a wonderful result against Croatia, a good result against Macedonia on Tuesday night and I thought they were a little unlucky when they played Belgium and in the friendly against England.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s starting to marry the two important things, performance level and result. So, when the next qualifying campaign starts, I think he\u2019ll get us to the European Championship.\u2019\n\nStrachan himself says it\u2019s too early to assess the progress made, but successive qualifying wins away from home in Zagreb and Skopje have raised hopes of a more competitive national team.\n\nShaun Maloney and debutant Ikechi Anya were the stand-outs as a performance featuring sharp passing, width and attacking threat answered many of the concerns expressed over the depth of players available.\n\n\u2018Gordon encourages people to do what they are good at,\u2019 McAllister told Talksport. \u2018He doesn\u2019t ask people to do what they don\u2019t at their clubs.\n\nUnbridled glee: Scotland celebrate after the final whistle\n\n\u2018The players and the manager are now finding a mutual respect and that\u2019s an important thing in international football.\n\n\u2018Listen, I\u2019ve been to tournaments with Scotland and tournaments when Scotland haven\u2019t been involved.\n\n\u2018And I have to say that World Cups and European Championships become less of a tournament when Scotland aren\u2019t there.\u2019\n\nA surprise inclusion at right midfield, Crystal Palace winger Barry Bannan turned in a fine display on a night when the Scots had few failures.\n\nAnd he believes a win over high-flying Croatia in the final group game at Hampden next month will make a statement ahead of the European Championship qualifying campaign.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s important we put down a marker for the next campaign by ending this one with a good night at Hampden,\u2019 said the former Aston Villa winger.\n\n\u2018Croatia are a quality team, but the way we\u2019ve started playing under the manager means we can go into that with belief.\n\nAddressing the troops: Strachan (centre) speaks his side during training in Skopje\n\n\u2018Hopefully I\u2019ll have more games under my belt by that time and we will have a strong squad to choose from with guys who were missing for the last two games back in contention.\n\n\u2018The Euros have to be a major aim for us as a group and, while the World Cup has not worked out for us, there are signs that we\u2019re getting back on track.\u2019\n\nCrediting Strachan with getting the best of a demoralised and battered squad, Bannan turned in a fine display.\n\n\u2018The way the manager has dealt with me means a lot to me,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I have to be honest and say that I think I was lucky to even make the squad for the Belgium and Macedonia games.\n\n\u2018I hadn\u2019t kicked a ball since June and yet he believed in me not only to pick me, but then to play me.\n\n\u2018I owe him performances because of the way he\u2019s treated me.\n\nScotland's Ikechi Anya (centre) celebrates his goal with team-mates Barry Bannan (left) and Steven Naismith\n\n\u2018Before the Macedonia game he really gave me confidence to go and express myself. He said I had the freedom to play and that made me realise he has faith in my ability.\u2019\n\nAnother player delighted to get a run-out was goalkeeper Matt Gilks, who replaced David Marshall at half-time in the Philip II Arena. \u2018It\u2019s a different kind of pressure playing at international level to club level,\u2019 he told the Scottish Football Association\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\n\u2018I have to take my hat off to these lads who do it every time we come away. Obviously I don\u2019t.\n\n\u2018It was 45 minutes of pure concentration and I am over the moon we got the win.\n\n\u2018I know they got one back but I thought we dominated the game.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult coming on but you have got to prepare properly. Thankfully I did and kept us in at 1-0 and then Shaun has won us the game with a great free-kick.\u2019\n\nGilks, who qualifies for Scotland through his Perth-born grandmother, added: \u2018When Shaun put the free-kick down, I knew he would score.

Scotland\u2019s World Cup push had, after all, just been comprehensively halted by the outstanding players of Ukraine. What had been pointed out among journalists was that the sides must meet again on Nations League business. \u201cI forgot about that,\u201d said one. \u201cThat\u2019s another couple of humpings to look forward to.\u201d\n\nDark humour used to be essential when following Scotland.\n\nIt is to Clarke\u2019s credit that the mood music has changed so significantly and that the reaction to Scotland\u2019s showing against Ukraine on Wednesday has consequently been so scathing. With higher standards comes higher expectations. There is nothing wrong with that. There is, however, always a danger in Scotland that exaggeration of language \u2013 in positive and negative contexts \u2013 distorts the truth.\n\nClarke does not subscribe to the theory that Ukraine rode a wave of emotion when winning in Glasgow. Scotland\u2019s manager explained the loss in strictly football terms. He was entitled to; there were fundamental reasons not at all linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine why his team failed to shine on their big night.\n\nWhile Ukraine\u2019s players were in a training camp, Grant Hanley was part of a Norwich defence that conceded 84 Premier League goals. Billy Gilmour\u2019s loan spell at the same club was disastrous. Negativity around Manchester United was so unrelenting that Scott McTominay had to be affected. John McGinn\u2019s form at Aston Villa has split opinion. Lyndon Dykes last scored for QPR on 29 January. Scott McKenna was man of the match as Nottingham Forest earned promotion via the playoff final, but his delayed arrival in Scotland on account of those exploits meant the centre-back could not be considered for a start.\n\nYou needn\u2019t be a puritan to find images of Andy Robertson with beer in hand on an open-top bus, days before arguably his country\u2019s biggest fixture in a generation, to not be a great look. More pertinent, though, is that the fixture marked Robertson\u2019s 120th appearance in two seasons. There must be a physical and psychological toll.\n\nClarke erred by partnering Dykes with Ch\u00e9 Adams in attack from the outset. There is a reason so few leading international sides play with a front two. Scotland\u2019s defence bypassed Gilmour and Callum McGregor far too often when firing aimless balls at Dykes, which were duly returned with interest. Clarke\u2019s approach was curious given the panache and fluidity with which Denmark were swatted aside at Hampden in November.\n\nIn that game, Ryan Christie supported Adams. Not only does Christie have craft and guile, he can assist in midfield when Scotland are out of possession. Against Ukraine, Gilmour and McGregor were swamped. The wing-backs, Robertson and Aaron Hickey, had no adequate protection. Hickey became a soft target for criticism when so many more experienced players around him toiled.\n\nThe absence of Kieran Tierney was hugely significant. He dictates so much of how Scotland play by driving with the ball from central defence. The Arsenal man is a left centre-half who has key involvement in Scottish attacks. Nobody else in the squad can replicate his style. With all of this noted, it is far from a disaster that Scotland were eliminated by a side full of technically and physically impressive footballers. This episode would not feature in a top 100 of clanger moments for those in navy blue.\n\nScotland\u2019s Grant Hanley reacts after John McGinn heads wide from close range. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nIn 2019, Scotland were being humbled in Kazakhstan. Three years ago this week, a trip to face Peru and Mexico in friendlies involved a cast list resembling international football\u2019s equivalent of the Dog & Duck\u2019s Sunday morning team. At that point, there was a clear disconnect between squad and public.\n\nClarke has changed that. Only those who have never taken to him would ignore tangible progress when assessing where it all went wrong on Wednesday.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nScotland should be better than receiving pats on the head for competing well but the reality is they were an international irrelevance for years. Now they are not, but the talent available to Clarke is nowhere near as strong as many would insist, especially in areas that can make a fundamental difference.\n\nWhen Craig Gordon, now 39, retires Scotland will find themselves in an almighty goalkeeping pickle. He was one player who could leave the pitch with head held high, though he will be stung by the absence of a World Cup from his CV. Too many others fell short of the level required to impose themselves on Ukraine. That is no laughing matter; nor is it a disgrace."}, {"url": "https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2021/0611/1227498-scotland-back-on-big-stage-after-staying-home-too-long/", "page_content": "As Scotland lumbered from one demoralising campaign to another over the course of the past decade - the Craig Levein 4-6-0 campaign probably standing as the most depressing - many fans soothed themselves by claiming international football no longer mattered.\n\nAs Irish fans will recall, Gordon Strachan seemed to generate a bit of uplift in the first half of the Euro 2016 qualifiers but this fizzled out in familiar fashion, a 1-0 defeat in Tblisi in September 2015 allowing Ireland back in the frame.\n\n'What a kick in the b*****s' was the unsubtle back page headline in the Daily Record on the morning after Ireland shocked Germany 1-0 in Dublin, a result which eliminated the Scots from contention.\n\nAll the pain and anguish and, in some places, feigned indifference, evaporated on that ecstatic night last November, as Scotland-based Irish journalist Tom English recounted on Newstalk's Off the Ball in the aftermath.\n\n\n\n\"People have been ground down in Scotland over the last 20 years about the national team. And people, I think, inoculated themselves against this by saying international football didn't matter. They convinced themselves it didn't matter because Scotland constantly let them down.\n\n\n\n\"But on Thursday night, when Scotland won and they qualified, all that emotion came rising to the top. And we could see, of course it mattered. It mattered hugely.\"\n\nThe performance of the Scottish clubs in Europe had continued to decline, as did their purchasing power. Celtic have increasingly made a habit of exiting the Champions League every August, usually at the hands of some unpronouncable Eastern European entity.\n\nYet it is that supposedly gloomy development which may have sparked the revival of the national team.\n\nThe leading Scottish clubs have had to fall back on developing their own players, Arsenal's brilliant full-back Kieran Tierney, a Celtic player until last year, a prime example of the phenomenon. Other players like Ryan Christie and Callum McGregor, superb in Belgrade, have flourished at Celtic Park.\n\nBut then that hardly explains Andy Robertson establishing himself at Liverpool or Scott McTominay battling his way through the grades to nail down a first-team place at Manchester United.\n\nFor Macpherson, it remains something of a mystery, this sudden arrival of players.\n\n\"I don't think anything particularly changed. It's not as if we devised some social method for producing the boys we used to produce in the past. We're still not producing them as we did. And I think this is an exceptional era.\n\n\"I think it just came through persistence and clubs bringing through younger players through the lack of money, enabling them to chance their arms with younger players. If you take the likes of the Old Firm, Celtic and Rangers, they would barely give young players a chance of playing for them regularly because there was too much at stake in European football for them.\n\n\"But now and again, Celtic in particular, have brought on some younger players and now we're seeing the fruit of that. The likes of Kieran Tierney, at Arsenal, who's probably at this stage one of the best full-backs in the entire continent.\n\n\"It's difficult to put my finger on the precise reason why this has developed at this time.

Scotland, it can surely be argued, invented the World Cup exit.\n\nThe four British football associations - those of Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales - had withdrawn from football's governing body FIFA back in 1920. There had been arguments over the suitability of playing teams with whom Britain had recently been at war, and more importantly a general feeling that there was now too much foreign influence in what was surely a British game!\n\nThis disassociation from FIFA meant that there was no participation in the trio of World Cups that were staged before the Second World War.\n\nPre-war, Scotland hadn't played many matches against continental teams, but the record stood at two defeats in 15 games. Interestingly, Scotland's first defeat abroad was by Austria in 1931, and it was that country that would give Scotland its first defeat by a non-British team at Hampden, a few months after the 1950 World Cup qualifying debacle."}, {"url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/euro-2021/2021/06/22/croatia-vs-scotland-live-score-team-news-latest-updates/", "page_content": "Accurate McGregor strike cancels out Vlasic's opener for Croatia\n\nBut Modric stunner and Perisic header prove too much for Scotland\n\nCroatia finish in second place in Group D; winless Scotland eliminated\n\nEngland vs Denmark live Euros semi-final\n\nReading this on the Telegraph app?

There was no qualifying tournament back then but somehow the Scots (or rather the SFA) contrived to disqualify themselves from a trip to South America as they announced they would only travel if they were British Champions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week long Home Internationals, played at the end of the domestic league season, was without doubt THE tournament for England, Scotland, N. Ireland and Wales throughout the 1950's and maybe even trumped the World Cup in importance in that decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngland were happy to accept the Brazilian invitation, but the Scots felt their place had to be earned, thus putting themselves under pressure to win the traditional finale to the four-team UK contest against the Three Lions. Following indifferent Scottish performances against N. Ireland and Wales, only a win v the 'Auld Enemy' at Hampden Park, Glasgow in May 1950 would give them the Sir Stanley Rous trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland lost in Glasgow against England and compounded their failure by turning down a SECOND invitation from the Brazilian FA some ten days after their self imposed exile from the Jules Rimet Trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n1954\n\n1954 saw tartan pride replaced by a better sense of the changing world football landscape and 13 plucky Scotland Internationals (including just one goalie) pitched up in Switzerland for the finals. However, the, at times, comic cuts nature of Team Scotland at international level was starting to formulate as SFA officials (and wives) outnumbered the actual 'squad' (if you can call 13 'a squad'), while heavy cotton shirts and woolen socks were packed naively as the SFA thought the Swiss, famed for their winter sports, might not have discovered the season called summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1954 marked Scotland's World Cup debut They had, and Scotland were hammered 7-0 by 1950 World Champions Uruguay in their opening group match in a game that was as much about kit as grit.\n\nThe Uruguay side wore light boots and shirts, designed for humid conditions, while they were also still on a high from their unexpected success four years earlier, when they so scarred their local rivals that the Brazilians would ditch their all white national kit for what we know today. A Scotland international in Switzerland (and future Scotland and Man Utd manager) Tommy Docherty, quipped that the Scots \"were knackered by the end of the anthems\" as they stood in the Berne sunshine with heavy boots and the aforementioned heavy cotton shirts and woolen socks, designed more for a November night at Hampden. Scottish shorts were over the knee while the South Americans had, shall we say, more room to manouvere!\n\n\n\n1958\n\nScotland's first World Cup finals in 1954 were over before they had really begun, and although 1958 in Sweden was slightly more memorable, if only for the lack of being hammered 7-0, the First Round of the finals was where Scotland peaked again. Manager Dawson Walker resigned after the second match, a 3-2 defeat by Paraguay which followed a 1-1 draw with Yugoslavia. Scotland limped home after losing their third match 2-1 to France, but with the man who should have led them to the finals still recovering from the Munich Air disaster (Matt Busby), there were more important things for the Scottish football public to concentrate on in 1958 rather than World Cup mediocrity from their national team. And of course - there was always 1962.\n\n\n\nBarren years\n\nScotland would not qualify again until 1974 with a hat-trick of near misses showing them at their most infuriating before the days of Jordan, Dalglish, Holton etc. They ended up losing a place in Chile '62 to eventual finalists Czeckoslovakia in a play off while 1966 England was a particularly sore one for Scots as, despite beating Italy in the qualifying tournament, they would fail to make it over the Italians to what is regarded as the finals that heralded the arrival of the World Cup as a global spectacle. Denis Law ended up playing golf on the day England beat W. Germany 4-2 in the Wembley final. Typically, Scotland decided to become the first team to beat Bobby Moore's Worldbeaters (in 1967 winning 3-2 at Wembley).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finals in Mexico 1970 was a near miss as West Germany beat Scotland 3-2 in the decisive qualifying match after Scotland had taken the lead abroad. Scotland again didn't help themselves when full back Tommy Gemmell of Celtic got himself sent off for retaliation after a foul by Helmut Haller, Gemmell chasing the German for 20 yards, before connecting with Haller's backside via a foot that would score in two European Cup finals for big Tam's Glasgow club side.\n\n\n\n1974\n\nSir Alf Ramsey, no less, referred to the 1973 Scotland team that lost 1-0 to England at Wembley in the annual Home Internationals as \"the best Scotland team\" any of his England teams had played against and even went as far as to say the Scots might join England in the 1974 World Cup Finals in the then West Germany!\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland went one better and qualified while England stayed at home thanks to their failure to beat Poland in their qualifying group. Scotland pipped old foes Czeckoslovakia and left Denmark in their wake on their route to the finals and then in an 'oh so typical' Scottish way still failed to get past the First Round in the GDR despite remaining undefeated against Zaire, Brazil (0-0) and Yugoslavia (1-1). Brazil beat Zaire 3-0 and Scotland beat the former Belgian Congo 2-0 and that was to be the difference between second and third place. Yugoslavia, by the way, beat the Africans 9-0. Willie Ormond was the Scotland manager for the big trip to the 1974 finals.\n\n\n\n1978\n\nThe finals of 1978 in Argentina with the likeable Ally MacLeod in charge of Scotland needs no introduction, and no rewriting here, the failure to beat Peru and Iran followed by the surrealism and artistry of Archie Gemmill's goal in the 3-2 win over eventual beaten finalists Holland is etched on the minds of a generation of Scots.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe move on.\n\n\n\n1982\n\n1982 saw a more sober approach to the now expected qualification for the World Cup with Jock Stein in charge for Spain '82. There would be no repeat of Peru or Iran as New Zealand were dispatched 5-2 in the opening game but a 4-1 thumping by Brazil left Scotland having to win their final First Round group game against the USSR.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal score 2-2 and once again Scotland home before the postcards.\n\n\n\n1986\n\n\n\n\n\nJock Stein, who sadly passed away in Wales and his replacement, Alex Ferguson\n\nQualifying for Mexico 1986 saw the tragic death of Jock Stein, clearly ill before the tie, at the end of the final Qualifier in Wales where a point was required (1-1). Alex Ferguson took charge for a lack lustre campaign which saw scrappy defeats by Denmark (1-0) and West Germany (2-1). The final game at Mexico 1986 against 10 men from the first minute (a thuggish foul on Gordon Strachan), Uruguay (0-0) is without doubt one of the most turgid Scottish international matches ever witnessed.\n\n1990\n\nBy Italia 1990 being at the party was more important to the Tartan Army than actual results (we knew the team would always go off script by the time Andy Roxburgh was in charge and history had indeed proved that).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the record, a 2-1 win over Sweden was the meat in the sandwich of 1-0 defeats against Costa Rica and Brazil respectively. Scotland would be forced to seek consolation in England's semi final defeat on penalties against the Germans, but for us it was a World Cup that should have produced more under the unfashionable Roxburgh, the man who, as a young coach, had warned Ally MacLeod about Peru.\n\n\n\n1998\n\nFrance 1998 was the Scots last appearance at a World Cup finals. This completed a mind-blowing six out of seven qualifications over 25 years which will never be repeated in my view.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Brown took charge of qualification and the games in the finals v Brazil, Norway and Morocco. A Tom Boyd own goal gave the World Cup holders a lucky 2-1 win in Paris, while the 1-1 draw v Norway contains the Scots last goal at a finals (Craig Burley). As always, Scottish gusto and expectation was replaced with stark reality, as Morocco thumped us 3-0 in our (to date) last match at a World Cup finals.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven as a proud Scot, I personally can't see qualification for a World Cup for my nation for quite some time. Although our contrary football nature, forged in aforementioned games against Uruguay, Brazil, Peru and a collection of underdogs in finals and qualifying alike, guarantees the combination of fair complexions, red hair, kilts and retro cotton dark blue shirts in the baking heat of Qatar. Infact, it's now almost a kind of World Cup law that Scotland should be there against the odds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the Taran Army journey to Qatar in 2022? See you in 2022 for the 2-0 win over the Germans followed by defeats by Panama and the Faroe Islands!\n\n\n\nScotland World Cup Landmarks:\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Jordan scored in three successive finals in 1974, 1978, 1982.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland have still not equalled or bettered their 8-0 win over Cyprus at Hampden in 1969 (World Cup 1970 qualifying) .\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland's 'away' Qualifier for the finals in Argentina v Wales in 1977 was switched to Anfield in Liverpool to accommodate the demand for tickets (Scotland won 2-0).\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland beat then European Champions Czeckoslovakia 3-1 on their way to the 1978 finals.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland qualified for two of the three World Cup finals played in the 1970's. Old rivals England didn't qualify for any via the qualifying tournament in that decade. Their 1970 appearance was automatic as holders and they failed to qualify for W. Germany and Argentina.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland World Cup Lowmarks:\n\n\n\n\n\nWillie Johnston was sent home from the Argentina World Cup after a flu shot recommended by a Doctor. He took it for a summer cold and it was counted as a performance enhancing drug following a test after the Peru match. A controversial decision at the time by FIFA, Johnston never forgave the SFA for not arguing his case.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland needed a three goal victory over Holland in their final group game to qualify for the second stage of the Argentina finals. Goals from Archie Gemmill (2, 1 a pen) and Kenny Dalglish had them 3-1 up at one stage but Jonny Rep's strike for the Dutch ended the Scots mission impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland managed to draw a World Cup Qualifier for France 1998, despite Estonia failing to show up for their 1997 home tie. The match was awarded to Scotland but then Fifa reversed the decision and allowed a replay in neutral Monaco which ended 0-0.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland's Women also suffered World Cup heartache in the finals of 2019. They led 3-0 in the First Round group stage against Argentina in a must win match only to be pulled back to a final score of 3-3. The dramatic nature of Scotland's International football team is also a female trait it would seem. Argentina's third goal was a thrice taken penalty with the Scottish goalkeeper accused of moving before the spot kick twice before Argentina finally scored.\n\nReplays show her second penalty save was entirely legal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/eurovision-2022-finalists-list-which-countries-song-contest-final-songs-running-order-1628228", "page_content": "The full list of countries set to compete in the Eurovision final has been confirmed, with a running order of the night\u2019s events released.\n\nSeveral countries, including Ireland, were eliminated over the course of this week\u2019s two semi-finals. 25 countries remain in the competition, which is set to come to a close at the final on Saturday 14 May.\n\nThe UK doesn\u2019t have to worry about that thanks to its status as one of the Big Five \u2013 a set of countries that receive automatic qualification.

My message before the game was that this is a night when we could make everyone proud, involved with this beautiful club and we did.\"\n\nThe omens were in favour of Rangers pre-match. Before Thursday's second leg, only one side in the history of the Europa League had failed to go through in a knockout tie after winning an away leg by two or more goals.\n\nFactor in the continued absence of superstar striker Erling Haaland for the visitors, things were looking positive for Van Bronckhorst's men as they took to the turf at a fever-pitch Ibrox.\n\nDortmund, on their first visit to Scotland in over two decades, were off the back of thrashing Borussia Monchengladbach 6-0 at the weekend - a clear indication of their attacking potency, even without their talisman.\n\nBut Rangers, as they did last Thursday, started on the front foot with a bubbling home crowd behind them and passed up the game's first chance when Tavernier's deep free-kick was headed over by Alfredo Morelos.\n\nThat noise was momentarily muted to pin-drop silence when Nico Schulz's corner was diverted onto the back post by Bellingham.\n\nThat Dortmund chance seemed to spook Rangers, who struggled to get up the pitch and maintain possession against a slick visiting side, as Malen rifled a strike from outside the area past Allan McGregor's right-hand post.\n\nBut against the run of play, Kent - who was a thorn in the side of the Dortmund defence a week ago - jinked into the box before being tripped by Julian Brandt's lazy leg.\n\nThere was a sense of deja vu when Tavernier, who opened the scoring from the spot in Dortmund, stepped up to take the penalty with the score at 0-0, and the Rangers captain kept his cool again to slot the ball straight down the middle.\n\nIbrox was bouncing, but Brandt had an immediate opportunity to rectify his penalty concession when he struck at goal from just inside the box, but McGregor was equal to the German international's effort.\n\nBellingham was on hand minutes later to show the composure Brandt was lacking, capitalising on Connor Goldson's failed clearance to slot away coolly down to McGregor's left - the teenager's second goal of the tie and the second time he provided his side with a lifeline.\n\nRangers' three-goal advantage was almost restored instantly when Scott Arfield broke into the Dortmund box and had a finish thwarted by Gregor Kobel. The rebound fell to Morelos, who leathered a first-time effort off Mats Hummels on the goal-line.\n\nRangers instead saw their lead reduced when Malen, who had a fierce strike tipped wide by McGregor moments earlier, poked in from close range after sketchy defending from the Ibrox backline.\n\nThe Dutch striker could have then levelled the tie on aggregate just before the break when he turned another near-post effort, this time from close range, wide of the target.\n\nWith Dortmund hitting their stride, Rangers needed the interval. And so it proved as Van Bronckhorst's men started the second period with more of a threat.\n\nKobel got down low to both sides to deny Morelos twice in succession, then another dose of bedlam.\n\nCalvin Bassey powered his way up the left to cross into the box. World-Cup winner Hummels made a mess of cutting it out and Tavernier was there at the back post to punish, driving in his and Rangers' second of the night.\n\nLast season's Scottish champions thought they had a second-leg lead when Morelos broke clear and laid Kent off to tap in the simplest of finishes, but a VAR review judged Morelos to have fouled Emre Can in the build-up when the Germany midfielder appeared to kick the Colombia striker's calf.\n\nThat moment could have proven to be a turning point in the tie, but Rangers remained firm and held off any late Dortmund pressure to see out a remarkable win that will be etched into Ibrox folklore.\n\nMan of the match - James Tavernier\n\nSo often unfairly criticised when things don't go to plan, Tavernier delivered a true captain's performance and added two goals to his ridiculous goal tally\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\nDare to dream, Rangers fans. Your side have just dumped out the tournament favourites, what next?\n\nAn extra two Europa League games, at least, will be painted by some as a negative as the Ibrox side aim to claw back a three-point gap on leaders Celtic.\n\nBut Van Bronckhorst must use this night, that will go down in club history, to fuel his players' drive to reclaim the Premiership crown.\n\nSunday's draw at Dundee United highlighted the unpredictable nature of the champions' season, but they have shown in spades they can deal with the tempo and quality of top-level opposition.\n\nIt is now about showing that on a consistent basis in the business end of the campaign.\n\nWhat they said\n\nRangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst told BT Sport: \"We trained with three different plans for today. We needed to have scenarios in place to be executed and I'm glad we did.\n\n\"We had a great performance, we played them twice and got four points, its a great performance. The last 16 is only top teams, we wait for them and we look forward to the draw.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nRangers return to Premiership duty on Sunday (15:00 GMT) as they welcome Motherwell to

been more difficult \u2013 they were to take on the defending champions Holland in their opener in Gothenburg.\n\nIn customary fashion, the Scots worked their socks off, and for 75 minutes they gave as good as they got against an ultra-technical Dutch side.\n\nBut close games are often separated by a moment of class, and it was Dennis Bergkamp who broke Scottish hearts when he fired home from Frank Rijkaard\u2019s knockdown.\n\nThe Scots needed a win to keep their hopes alive in their second group game \u2013 typically, they were up against the reigning world champions, Germany.\n\nOnce again, Andy Roxburgh\u2019s side gave it their all, but goals from Karl-Heinz Riedle and Stefan Effenberg were the difference.\n\nEliminated from the tournament but unbowed, Scotland took on the CIS \u2013 a team made up of nations such as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus impacted by the dissolution of the Soviet Union \u2013 and came out a 3-0 winner courtesy of goals from Paul McStay, Brian McClair and Gary McAllister.\n\nEuro \u201996 \u2013 The Auld Enemy Prevails\n\nEuro \u201996 Group A\n\nPos Team Pts P W D L F A Diff. 1st England 7 3 2 1 0 7 2 +5 2nd Netherlands 4 3 1 1 1 3 4 -1 3rd

forget.\n\nThey started well enough, and while riding their luck they managed to secure a 0-0 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nNext up? England at Wembley. It was a glorious June day in the capital, and a cagey first half meant that the two teams could not be separated.\n\nAlan Shearer found a route to goal in the second period, and Scotland \u2013 pressing hard for an equaliser \u2013 looked to have got their reward when Tony Adams brought down Gordon Durie in the penalty area.\n\nBut McAllister saw his resulting spot kick saved by David Seaman, with TV replays showing that the ball was actually moving when the Leeds and Liverpool legend struck it. Incredibly, TV psychic Uri Geller claimed he moved the ball using the power of his mind\u2026.spooky indeed.\n\nThe scene was set for Paul Gascoigne\u2019s moment of magic, lifting the ball over Colin Hendry\u2019s head before volleying home, and Scottish fans were left frustrated once more by their team\u2019s inabilities on the big stage.\n\nUnlike in 1992, Scotland still had a chance of qualifying for the knockout phase, and they held up their end of the bargain by defeating Switzerland courtesy of an Ally McCoist goal.\n\nSadly, even though the Dutch were thrashed by England, they snuck through \u2013 despite having the same goal difference as the Scots and an equal head-to-head record, they had scored more goals than Craig Brown\u2019s outfit and thus crept through.\n\nWorld Cup Woe\n\nScotland\u2019s World Cup Matches \u2013 1954 to 1998\n\nTournament Game 1 Game 2 Game 3 Switzerland 1954 Lost 1-0 (Austria) Lost 7-0 (Uruguay) \u2013 Sweden 1958 Drew 1-1 (Yugoslavia) Lost 3-2 (Paraguay) Lost 2-1 (France) W.

However, those dreams were shattered even though the side managed to draw with Brazil and Yugoslavia \u2013 the group was decided on goal difference, and the Scots came up one goal shy.\n\nThe 1978 campaign was a bizarre one \u2013 defeat against Peru and a draw with Iran prevented Scotland from reaching the bracket phase once again. And yet, this was a side capable of beating eventual finalists Holland in their last group runout.\n\nGoal difference was the decisive factor again in 1982, because despite thrashing New Zealand 5-2 a heavy defeat to Brazil and a 2-2 draw with the Soviet Union saw them bow out despite finishing level on points with the Soviets.\n\nEngland bowed out to the Hand of God in 1986, but Scotland went much more quietly \u2013 defeats to West Germany and Denmark eliminating them despite a draw with Uruguay in the last group game.\n\nA rather embarrassing defeat to Costa Rica condemned the Scots in 1990, although a follow-up victory over Sweden gave them a chance to finally escape a World Cup group. But once more, they came up short as a last ditch defeat to Brazil prevented them from securing a top two finish.\n\nAfter missing out in 1994, Scotland returned to the world stage four years later and got off to an excellent start \u2013 John Collins\u2019 penalty levelling the game against a Ronaldo inspired Brazil. Sadly, the Scots couldn\u2019t hold on, and that defeat was followed by a draw with Norway and a gut-wrenching 0-3 loss at the hands of Morocco.\n\nAnd that was the last time that Scotland were seen on the big stage\u2026.could the class of 2020 finally end their long wait for a place in the knockout phase of a major tournament?"}], "Gordon David Strachan led Scotland to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41453901", "page_content": "Strachan acknowledges Scotland's next opponents Slovakia represent a \"huge hurdle\"\n\nScotland boss Gordon Strachan insists his side \"fear no-one\" as they target the \"one big result\" that can transform their World Cup qualifying prospects.\n\nThe Scots host Slovakia at Hampden Park on Thursday before travelling to face Slovenia next Sunday, knowing two wins would likely secure a play-off place.\n\n\"We know how hard it is going to be,\" Strachan told Football Focus.\n\n\"Slovakia are one of the powers now.

The lengthy preamble to another international qualifying campaign, when the feverish hopes of a nation desperate to return to the big stage collide with a stark reality in which Scotland remain lengthy outsiders.\n\nGordon Strachan would have been fully aware of just how difficult the task of getting Scotland to the World Cup finals in Russia in 2018 was going to be when he agreed to prolong his time in the job of national manager.\n\nHis decision to do so was welcomed not unanimously, but by a significant portion of the Scottish football family.\n\nScotland media conference in Prague: Gordon Strachan and Darren Fletcher\n\nA pragmatic view is that there is no realistic candidate for the role better qualified to turn a squad of jobbing footballers into a team capable of at least making the play-offs.\n\nIt had appeared that Strachan had found a way of doing exactly that as qualifying for Euro 2016 began relatively brightly.\n\nBut the early promise went unfulfilled as other equally unglamorous nations - the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland among them - managed to emerge successfully from their groups to take their place in France this summer.\n\nThe players in the Scotland squads for the two friendlies are vying for places in the World Cup qualifying campaign\n\nScots can learn from Czechs\n\nIn fact, Scotland's opponents on Thursday night were able to top their section without having - as Christophe Berra put it - any world-beaters in their squad, although Petr Cech could put up a strong case for having earned that description.\n\nNonetheless, Berra's point is a fair one, as was his assertion that Scotland's players as well as Strachan could learn from the Czechs.\n\nThe job done by Pavel Vrba in leading them to Euro 2016, ahead of Turkey, Iceland and the Netherlands is mightily impressive, because other than Cech and the ageing Tomas Rosicky, the bulk of this squad is drawn from Europe's lesser leagues - Turkey, Switzerland, the Czech Republic itself and the English Championship.\n\nIn that respect, the pool is much like that of the Scots. Just as Vrba has a couple of mainstays playing in the Bundesliga, Strachan can pick from a handful of English Premier League players.\n\nOtherwise, neither squad has a superstar and yet the Czechs' qualifying record suggests they have a very good team.\n\nHead coach Pavel Vrba has guided the Czechs to the Euro 2016 finals\n\nQuite how they have achieved this will not become clear over the course of the 90 minutes on Thursday, but their success - and that of Albania, Slovakia, Iceland and others - proves that qualification need not be an impossible dream.\n\nOf course, qualifying for the World Cup will be tougher, with only the group winners making it through automatically.\n\nStrachan's challenge\n\nSo Strachan has to quickly rediscover the formula that worked at the outset of Euro 2016 qualifying, in the draw in Warsaw and home wins over Georgia and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNone of those were spectacular, but Scotland ground out results that should have been a solid platform for qualification.\n\nThe wheels began to come off in Dublin where Scotland nonetheless came away with a good point. But it appeared a spark had gone, never to be recovered.\n\nOver the course of the next four games - against the Czechs, Denmark and then Italy and France - the challenge for Strachan and his players is to recapture the belief that they can live with these countries and that what Northern Ireland and Wales have done, in ending long waits to return to a major tournament, is not beyond them.\n\nIt seems likely the squad that makes the trip to Malta in September will consist largely of the group of players who failed to build on that early promise in Euro qualifying.\n\nBut if the manager can identify one or two younger players in these friendly matches to complement those in whom he already has faith, that would be an additional bonus."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gordon-strachan-can-lead-scotland-9354465", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter\n\nSFA president Alan McRae is confident Scotland can reach the 2018 World Cup finals under Gordon Strachan .\n\nThe former Celtic manager's future was surrounded in doubt following the 3-0 defeat to England at Wembley - which left the Scots second bottom of Group F with four points from 12 - but Strachan was backed to continue by the eight-strong SFA board.\n\nMcRae was at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park to help with the draw for the William Hill Scottish Cup fourth-round where Rangers were paired with fellow Ladbrokes Premiership rivals Motherwell with Celtic away to either Albion Rovers or Queen of the South.\n\nAfterwards, he explained the SFA 's decision to stand by their man\n\nHe said: \"Gordon is a good experienced coach, a former international player, he has all the credentials, he has won trophies.\n\n\"He has a good group of players, they work as a group.\n\n\"We are obviously a bit disappointed to say the least in terms of four points from 12 which, if it had been six or seven we would have all have had at least a half smile on our face.\n\n\"But it is mathematically possible and I still think Gordon can take us to the play-offs.\n\n\"I am going to be positive.

Yet the 3-0 win over Lithuania has fuelled a belief Gordon Strachan\u2019s side may make a late charge towards a World Cup play-off berth.\n\nTicket sales for Monday\u2019s visit of Malta to Hampden Park illustrate that feeling; more than 2,000 were taken up between full-time in Vilnius on Friday and Saturday lunchtime. There remains a glimmer of hope.\n\nScotland are four points adrift of Slovakia in Group F but the wider picture is suddenly more positive. Slovakia visit Wembley on Monday and Glasgow next month. On the basis Scotland should take care of Malta, tales of yet another failed qualifying campaign may have been premature. Assistance from England would further boost the mood.\n\n\u201cEngland need to do themselves a favour because if they don\u2019t do well and get beaten, Slovakia go top,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re England you have no option but to win games.

I think we are all feeling a bit better. The players were buoyant after the Malta game but then we let ourselves down in the next couple of games and then we were back at it again. But they never, at any time, lacked belief. If they didn\u2019t have belief they wouldn\u2019t have done what they have done over the last three games.\u201d\n\nThe match in Vilnius unquestionably witnessed the finest Scotland performance of Strachan\u2019s reign. A different approach will be required against Malta, whose woeful run has brought seven straight defeats in the group. Their goal difference is minus 19. Scotland won the reverse fixture 5-1.\n\n\u201cPeople will look at that game and think that we got breaks at the right time,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cWe said afterwards that we were lucky to get the breaks and we didn\u2019t disguise that. We didn\u2019t think it was a 5-1 mauling. We just thought it was a good performance, with the breaks at the right time. How hard did England find it to break them down? How hard did other teams find it?\n\n\u201cGetting the first goal against them is the most important thing. Lithuania took nearly 80 minutes to get their first goal and that was from a corner.\n\n\u201cThe key for us is patience. If you come along to the game and think it\u2019s going to be shots from everywhere, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. It\u2019s not going to be like that.
