{"Bill Brown made his debut for Clyde in a 3\u20132 win over Partick Thistle in October 1951.": [{"url": "https://thecelticstar.com/oh-harry-harryoh-harry-hood-part-2-cruising-with-the-clyde/", "page_content": "\u201cOh Harry, Harry\u2026Oh Harry Hood\u201d : Part 2: Cruising with the Clyde\n\nHarry Hood\u2019s second Clyde debut took place at Shawfield on Saturday, 8 October 1966, a 3-1 win over Motherwell in front of 4,000 spectators. He would not score on that occasion but was back on the goal trail the following weekend as the Bully Wee lost 4-3 to Dundee United at Tannadice. Clyde would edge another seven-goal thriller across the road at Dens Park just before Christmas, with Harry grabbing a brace on that occasion.\n\nREAD PART ONE HERE\u2026 \u201cOh Harry, Harry\u2026Oh Harry Hood\u201d: Springburn, Shawfield & Sunderland\u2026but no Celtic\n\nThe calendar year 1967 would be a momentous one for both of the old east end rivals, Celtic and Clyde, whilst it would spell the end of the road for another traditional old Glasgow club, Third Lanark. The signs for the Hi Hi were growing increasingly desperate as Celts hosted Clyde on Wednesday, 11 January 1967, the match deferred from the Ne\u2019erday holiday due to the frozen conditions. The Hoops began life minus their injured top scorer Joe McBride by thrashing the Shawfield outfit 5-1, Stevie Chalmers with a double and Charlie Gallagher, Tommy Gemmell and Bobby Lennox netting for Celts whilst Joe Gilroy \u2013 frequently rumoured to be a signing target for Jock Stein \u2013 briefly gave Clyde parity in the first half. It was only a second defeat in 10 for the visitors and halted a run of four successive away League victories.\n\nHarry opened his Scottish Cup account for the season with another double, in the 4-1 win over East Fife at Shawfield on Saturday, 18 February 1967, and he would repeat that feat in the replayed quarter-final tie against Hamilton Academical on Wednesday, 22 March 1967, my sixth birthday, as the Bully Wee won 5-1 at Douglas Park in front of over 9,000 spectators.\n\nThat set up a last four clash between Clyde and Celtic at Hampden on the opening day in April, almost 57,000 braving a blustery afternoon to watch the sides battle the elements and each other before settling for a 0-0 draw. The two big incidents occurred in the closing quarter, first Ronnie Simpson pulling off a fabulous save from Joe Gilroy before Celts were denied a penalty by referee JRP Gordon when Jimmy Johnstone\u2019s goalbound shot was stopped on the line by Dave Souter\u2019s elbow. An injury suffered by Harry at Hampden saw him miss the replay, before 55,000 at the same venue four days later, and Clyde had also missed their chance of glory, goals from Bobby Lennox and Bertie Auld settling the tie within the opening 22 minutes.\n\nHarry would miss the next three games but would return for the final four fixtures of the League season, scoring a double on the last day as Clyde came back from 2-0 down at half-time to beat Stirling Albion 5-2 at Annfield and secure third place in the Championship, the club\u2019s highest League finish of all time.\n\nThey would be cruelly robbed of a place in European football by a strange rule whereby only one club from each city could compete in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, runners-up Rangers claiming Glasgow\u2019s spot, whilst with the teams finishing immediately below Clyde \u2013 Aberdeen and Hibernian \u2013 qualifying on their own merits, sixth-placed Dundee got the nod to replace them. To rub salt into Clyde wounds, the Dens Park men would then go all the way to the last four of the competition before following the Easter Road and Ibrox outfits as the third Scottish club to be defeated by Cup-winners Leeds United.\n\nThings continued to progress well with Harry\u2019s career. He was chosen as part of a Scotland touring party for a series of close-season \u2018test matches\u2019 in May and June 1967, as new boss Bobby Brown looked at fringe players who may break into the full squad for the upcoming World Cup campaign. Hood replaced new Rangers signing Andy Penman in the opening match in Tel Aviv, scoring the winner as the Scots beat Israel 2-1. The next game would take place on Lisbon Day, Thursday, 25 May 1967, Harry also enjoying the taste of victory with a goal in Scotland\u2019s 4-1 win over Hong Kong, Dunfermline Athletic pair Alex Ferguson \u2013 with a double \u2013 and Willie Callaghan \u2013 elder brother of Tommy \u2013 with the other counters for the tourists.\n\nThree days later, Hood was in action again as another Ferguson goal, this time in Sydney, beat an Australian national team managed by a certain Jo Venglos! Harry would sit out further victories over the Socceroos in Adelaide and Melbourne before returning on Tuesday, 5 June 1967 for the match in Wellington against a New Zealand Under-23 team, Hood not on the scoresheet as the Scots won 7-2, thanks to a hat-trick from Joe Harper, a double from recent Wembley hero Jim McCalliog, a Tommy McLean penalty and a Gary Lake own goal.\n\nThat scoreline would be repeated in the final tour match against Canada, played in Winnipeg, this time Harper grabbing five with Bobby Hope and Willie Morgan also netting for Scotland. Of the 19 players who travelled, only seven would not receive full caps for Scotland, Harry Hood and Alex Ferguson being the most high-profile of those. To this day, I would struggle to name a better uncapped Scottish player than Harry Hood.\n\nClyde would open their 1967/68 League campaign at the home of the European champions, Celtic, Chris Shevlane and Pat McMahon given League debuts as Mrs Kelly unfurled the flag. The Shawfield club were now under temporary new management in the shape of former Airdrieonians boss, Archie Wright, Davie White having moved to Ibrox as assistant to Scot Symon, who he would later replace whilst Rangers were at the top of the League as the Govan outfit began to fear, feel then resent the chill in Jock Stein\u2019s shadow. Kilsyth Bhoy McMahon would open the scoring before Lions Bobby Lennox and Bertie Auld completed a 3-0 win before the interval.\n\nHarry would then hit the goal trail with three in the victories over Partick Thistle and Aberdeen which followed, before the run came to an end with a 2-0 defeat by Falkirk at Shawfield on Saturday, 30 September 1967, a match my father actually took me along to, if I recall correctly. The highlight of the autumn schedule was a 5-0 win over Dundee United at Shawfield just before Christmas, with Hood scoring twice.\n\nThe new year 1968 opened with another Clyde managerial appointment, former player Archie Robertson \u2013 the man whose goal directly from a corner had prevented Jimmy McGrory\u2019s Celtic from retaining their Scottish Cup in April 1955 \u2013 picking up the reins from Archie Wright. Jock Stein\u2019s current Hoops side would eventually edge a five-goal thriller at Shawfield, with Harry Hood very much to the fore if Press reports are to be believed.\n\n\u201cThe power of Murdoch and Brogan at wing-half and the hard running of Chalmers and McBride, who scored Celtic\u2019s goals between them, were unmatchable over the whole game by Clyde, for whom Anderson, Hood and McFarlane took the eye in much briefer glimpses. Clyde forestalled any thoughts of a rout two minutes after the interval, when McFarlane took Anderson\u2019s pass and shot home from an angle. Indeed, they played their best football in the next 15 minutes, during which Hood hit a post and Simpson made timely saves from Hood and Stewart.\u201d\n\nSadly, Ronnie Simpson would sustain a rib injury which would rule him out of the following day\u2019s clash with Rangers at Celtic Park, a vital match with the two rivals neck-and-neck for the title. John Fallon would take Ronnie\u2019s place and would be blamed for the two goals which gave Rangers an undeserved draw and left the advantage for the flag race with the Ibrox club.\n\nThere would be joy for Harry with a hat-trick for Clyde in a 6-3 win over Hearts at Shawfield on Saturday, 20 January 1968, then disappointment as they exited the Scottish Cup following a 3-2 defeat by Partick Thistle at Firhill in front of 14,000 spectators in late February. In between those matches, however, there was finally some well-deserved international recognition for Harry, chosen in the Scotland side for the Under-23 international with England at Hampden on Wednesday, 7 February 1968.\n\nHe was joined in the navy blue by a number of stars who would go on to become household names, Pat Stanton, Peter Cormack and Colin Stein with Hibernian, Bobby Moncur at Newcastle United and Willie Morgan at Manchester United, together with Steve Murray, who would later join him at Celtic. Hood would score Scotland\u2019s only goal, early in the second half, sadly sandwiched between strikes from Martin Chivers and Rodney Marsh, as the visitors won 2-1.\n\nFollowing the high of playing for his country at Hampden, Harry would suffer the heaviest defeat of his career at the same venue as Clyde ran into a rampant Celtic side in the final of the Glasgow Cup, on Wednesday, 17 April 1968. The Hoops scored seven goals in an incredible 24-minute spell in the first half, Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Lennox with a hat-trick, John Hughes with a brace and Tommy Gemmell doing the damage.\n\nFortunately, for Clyde, Celts eased off in the second half, only Bobby Murdoch early on adding to the Bully Wee misery. The 8-0 victory witnessed by 25,000 equalled a record scoreline for this final which had stood since the year Celtic was founded. Clyde would win two of the final three League games, with Harry scoring the winner at Fir Park, to finish the season in a highly-respectable eighth position.\n\nHood commenced what would be his final season with Clyde by scoring in a 4-1 win over Aberdeen in the League Cup sectional tie at Shawfield, on Saturday, 10 August 1968, then again in a 3-2 victory at Tannadice in midweek. He would then return from injury to hit a hat-trick in the final game, a 3-0 defeat of Dunfermline Athletic at Shawfield which saw the Bully Wee emerge from a difficult group to face Ayr United in the quarter-final.\n\nBefore that clash, Clyde found themselves again facing the champions Celtic in the opening League game of the season, this time at Shawfield on Saturday, 7 September 1968. The old Rutherglen stadium was crammed with 22,000 fans, most expecting to see Celts continue the high-scoring form which had seen them blow away Rangers, Morton and Partick Thistle in their own League Cup section.\n\nThey would get three goals from Jock Stein\u2019s men, two of them late on to put a rather flattering look on the scoreline at 3-0, after Jim Brogan had scored the finest goal of his Celtic career midway through the first half.\n\nClyde would win both legs of the quarter-final against an Ayr United side who would be promoted from the Second Division at the end of the season, Harry on target in the 2-0 win at Shawfield on Wednesday, 25 September 1968. On the same night, a young man called Kenny Dalglish was given his Celtic debut by Jock Stein at Douglas Park as the Hoops followed up a 10-0 first leg humiliation of Hamilton Academical \u2013 Stevie Chalmers and Bobby Lennox each scoring five \u2013 with a 4-2 victory in the return, Charlie Gallagher\u2019s final match for Celtic.\n\nThe two east end clubs would now meet at Hampden for the third time in 18 months, on Wednesday, 9 October 1968, Harry Hood described as a \u201cconstant threat\u201d to Celtic who won thanks to a late George Connelly strike, the big Fifer scoring with a fierce shot just three minutes after replacing the injured Joe McBride, to send most of the 35,000 fans home happy.\n\nThe clubs would clash again two months later in the by-now annual New Year\u2019s Day fixture, this time at Celtic Park. New signing Tommy Callaghan from Dunfermline Athletic helped himself to a double, whilst a Tommy Gemmell penalty and second-half strikes from Willie Wallace and Bobby Lennox made it a comfortable 5-0 victory for the hosts.\n\nHarry would be joined up front later that month by Jimmy Quinn, a young player on loan from Celtic, grandson of the Mighty Hoops striker of the same name, the Bould Bhoy from Croy. Quinn would score before being sent off in a 1-1 draw with Motherwell at Fir Park on Saturday, 25 January 1969, as the Bully Wee finished the Scottish Cup first round match with just nine men.\n\nThe Shawfield men would then win the home replay 2-1 in midweek, to set up yet another cup clash with Treble-chasing Celtic, the following month. On the same night, the Hoops had destroyed Partick Thistle 8-1 in their replayed tie \u2013 with SEVEN different goalscorers \u2013 the sides having drawn 3-3 at Firhill on the Saturday thanks to Jimmy Bone\u2019s last-gasp strike.\n\nThe second round would prove significant for two wonderful Celts, albeit for vastly different reasons. The game took place at Shawfield on Wednesday, 12 February 1969 with a 4.30 kick-off, due to issues with Clyde\u2019s floodlighting system. Nevertheless, more than 25,000 crammed into the Rutherglen arena and they would see Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson dislocate his shoulder early on following a clash with \u2013 would you believe it \u2013 Hoops loanee Jimmy Quinn. Tommy Gemmell would replace \u2018Faither\u2019 in goals as the match petered out to a goalless draw. Sadly, this would be the start of Ronnie\u2019s injury problems which would ultimately cause his retirement from football. Such a cruel and crazy game is football sometimes.\n\nThe replay would take place 12 days later at Celtic Park, the Hoops buoyant after an excellent 0-0 draw in the San Siro which raised Parkhead hopes of a second European Cup triumph in three seasons. A higher-than-normal crowd of 38,000 turned out on an icy evening to see Stevie Chalmers give Celts the lead midway through the first half. Despite incessant attacking, they had to wait until the closing 15 minutes before further strikes from John Hughes and Bobby Murdoch sealed the 3-0 victory and a quarter-final match with St Johnstone.\n\nBack at Shawfield, Harry Hood would continue to get himself amongst the goals as February became March. There was a touch of symmetry about the match with Rangers at Ibrox on Saturday, 15 March 1969. Back in November 1962, Harry had made his debut for Clyde in Govan as an 18-year-old hopeful. This day would now mark his final game for the club, at the same venue.\n\nTwo days later, on Monday, 17 March 1969 \u2013 St Patrick\u2019s Day \u2013 after 96 goals in 197 matches for Clyde, Henry Anthony Hood became Harry Hood of the Celtic.\n\nLife would never be quite the same.\n\nHail Hail!

He was also rated highly for his fielding skills. Just like many of the other Australian cricketers of his era, he missed out on playing Test cricket due to the second World War.\n\n\n\nBrown, made his First-Class debut in 1932-33 for New South Wales. However, he had a bad start to his fledgling career as he was run-out for zero and that too without facing a single delivery. Consistent scores in the Sheffield Shield helped him to gain a place in the Ashes squad that toured England in 1934.\n\n\n\nThe century against Lancashire during that tour won him a place in the Test side that took on England at Trent Bridge. He gave a glimpse of his skills with a measured innings of 73 and that too with Australia finding themselves in trouble. In the next Test at Lord's, he amassed his first ton. Brown then scored heavily during the tour of South Africa in 1935.\n\n\n\nDuring the tour of England in 1938, with his double-hundred in the Test at Lord's, he held the innings together and the game ended in a draw. In 1946, when Australia resumed playing Test cricket, Brown seemed to have lost his way a bit.\n\n\n\nBrown captained the Australian side that played one-off Test in New Zealand in 1946. The tour to England in 1948 though, turned out to be his last series. With players like Morris and Harvey coming through the ranks, he faded away from the scene.\n\n\n\nAfter retiring from the game, Brown served as the selector for Queensland and then for Australia. Brown passed away in March 2008.\n\n\n\nBy Bharath Ramaraj"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64527164", "page_content": "Rangers \"won in the right way\" after allowing Partick Thistle to equalise in a tumultuous Scottish Cup tie at Ibrox, said manager Michael Beale.\n\nThistle levelled unopposed through Scott Tiffoney when the visitors complained Malik Tillman had been unsportsmanlike when making it 2-1.\n\nThe midfielder had intercepted the ball as the Championship side intended to surrender possession from a throw-in.\n\n\"It was a big misunderstanding, the whole thing,\" said Beale.\n\n\"Malik gets injured. We play the ball out. Malik's on the floor, he's unaware that we've played the ball out so when he gets up, he just thinks it's a throw-in to Partick Thistle. He presses innocently and then he's through on goal and he goes and finishes the move.\n\n\"I don't want us to win a football game on a misunderstanding and it was a misunderstanding. It would've been the wrong thing to do. I've got high standards but the club I work for has got high standards as well and as Rangers Football Club, we're in a better place tonight that we did that. It's not an easy thing to do, trust me. We won the game, we won the game in the right way.\"\n\nPartick Thistle boss Ian McCall commented: \"I don't think Malik Tillman knew what he was doing. I think he got mixed up and put it in the net.\n\n\"Michael Beale showed an awful lot of class, so did James Tavernier to do what they did. It was the right to do so there's no blame on anybody, not even the ref. I've been involved in the game since 1981 - I've never seen it before.\"\n\nAntonio Colak and James Sands also scored for Rangers, who came from behind to book their place in Monday's quarter-final draw with Ayr United, Celtic, Hearts, Kilmarnock, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Raith Rovers and Darvel or Falkirk.\n\n'It was a big misunderstanding' - Beale on Ibrox drama\n\nThe hosts had a nervous moment early on when Tillman tussled with Holt on the very edge of the Rangers penalty area but referee David Munro offered the 2,500-strong travelling Thistle support no encouragement.\n\nThe visitors held their own with a disciplined defensive approach and a determination not to allow their hosts time and space. Kyle Turner won and took a free-kick that tested Allan McGregor - and the goalkeeper was forced into an even better stop to deny Tiffoney moments later.\n\nBut, in the aftermath, the visitors were awarded their spot-kick. Munro was asked to review whether Kevin Holt's header had been handled by Colak and the referee signalled penalty. Holt converted confidently.\n\nRangers' play had been too narrow and their short passing game food and drink for the Jags. Ibrox manager Michael Beale took action at half-time with Ryan Kent and Kemar Roofe sent on in place of Ianis Hagi and Todd Cantwell. And there was almost instant reward. Kent sent Roofe through and the striker fired narrowly wide.\n\nThe leveller duly arrived when Nicolas Raskin chipped from the inside right channel for Colak to nod in. The Croatian had gone nine games without a goal since his last on 29 October.\n\nThe keeper may have done better with that one but stood up well to block Colak's next effort and made his mark again by saving a Rangers' penalty.\n\nTillman was dragged down by Stuart Bannigan, who was adamant the foul had taken place outside the box. The award stood but so did Sneddon as he stayed in a central position to get in the way of Tavernier's spot-kick.\n\nBut then, another jaw-dropping twist. Rangers put the ball out after Tillman pulled up with a knock and, after the restart, Tillman robbed Holt and evaded chasing defenders and Sneddon to score. Thistle were furious, insisting the Rangers attacker had stolen the ball just as they were about to kick it back to the home defence.\n\nA melee ensued on the pitch and Beale was active in his technical area, with the instruction given before Tiffoney sauntered forward from the re-start to round McGregor and score.\n\nIt was from a Borna Barisic corner that the decisive goal came, but again confusion reigned. Sands threw himself at the ball and celebrated when the net bulged but replays suggested Thistle's Connor McAvoy may have knocked it over the line.\n\nTillman danced away from a clutch of challenges only to be denied by Sneddon in added time, the last major incident of an enthralling Scottish Cup tie.\n\nPlayer of the match - Nicolas Raskin\n\nRangers' January signing marked his first start with an assist and his use of the ball was integral to much of Rangers' play in the second half\n\nWhat they said\n\nRangers manager Michael Beale: \"It was right to make the changes in the second half. I didn't think the performance was great. To be fair to the character and mentality of the players, they have found a way to win.\"\n\nPartick Thistle manager Ian McCall: \"We're full of pride but full of disappointment as well. The players were absolutely magnificent. First half, I thought we were terrific. They allowed us to score the goal to get us to 2-2 and then it was game on, And, unfortunately Rangers scored from a set play.\"\n\nLine-ups\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLive Text Line-ups Rangers Formation 4-2-3-1 1 McGregor 2 Tavernier 19 Sands 26 Davies 31 Barisic 18 Kamara 43 Raskin 7 Hagi 71 Tillman 13 Cantwell 9 Colak 1 McGregor\n\n2 Tavernier\n\n19 Sands\n\n26 Davies\n\n31 Barisic Booked at 72mins\n\n18 Kamara Booked at 79mins\n\n43 Raskin Substituted for Jack at 89' minutes\n\n7 Hagi Substituted for Kent at 45' minutes\n\n71 Tillman\n\n13 Cantwell Substituted for Roofe at 45' minutes\n\n9 Colak Substituted for Morelos at 83' minutes Substitutes 6 Goldson\n\n8 Jack\n\n14 Kent\n\n20 Morelos\n\n23 Wright\n\n25 Roofe\n\n33 McLaughlin\n\n38 King\n\n44 Devine Partick Thistle Formation 5-4-1 1 Sneddon 2 McMillan 18 McAvoy 22 Muirhead 4 Holt 3 Milne 7 Tiffoney 16 Hodson 6 Turner 8 Bannigan 9 Graham 1 Sneddon Booked at 82mins\n\n2 McMillan\n\n18 McAvoy\n\n22 Muirhead\n\n4 Holt\n\n3 Milne Booked at 52mins\n\n7 Tiffoney Booked at 72mins Substituted for Fitzpatrick at 74' minutes\n\n16 Hodson Substituted for Mackenzie at 89' minutes\n\n6 Turner Booked at 52mins\n\n8 Bannigan Substituted for Docherty at 75' minutes Booked at 80mins\n\n9 Graham Booked at 44mins Substituted for Dowds at 66' minutes Substitutes 5 Brownlie\n\n10 Dowds\n\n11 Lawless\n\n14 Smith\n\n19 Mullen\n\n21 Fitzpatrick\n\n23 Docherty\n\n29 Mackenzie\n\n31 Mitchell Referee: David Munro Attendance: 44,636 Match Stats Live Text Post update Match ends, Rangers 3, Partick Thistle 2.

Dens Park was officially opened against St. Bernards on August 19th 1899 when Fred McDiarmid was awarded with a medal for scoring the first goal on the new ground and the move was the start of the good times for The Dee.\n\nTwelve months previously, Dundee were saved from liquidation after poor gates had contributed to large debts and the part of the new committee\u2019s strategy was increase attendances by relocating to the new ground. It was a move that paid off, as the crowds started to flock to Dens and with Dundee now regularly playing in the dark blue of Our Boys, they finished as runners-up in the Scottish League championship three times within the next decade.\n\nDUNDEE IN THE 20TH CENTURY\n\nSilverware was also just around the corner and in 1910, Dundee won their first major honour when they brought home the Scottish Cup for the first and to date only time in the Club\u2019s history. After a marathon ten game campaign, Dundee won the oldest football trophy in the world after a 2-1 win over Clyde at Ibrox in the second replay. Jimmy Bellamy scored the equaliser after the Bully Wee had taken the lead and it was John \u2018Sailor\u2019 Hunter who wrote his name into Dundee folklore by scoring the winning goal.\n\nIt would be another forty-one years before Dundee would win another major honour, although they did reach the Scottish Cup Final again in 1925 when they lost 2-1 to Celtic who scored two late goals after Davie McLean gave Dundee a half-time lead.\n\nHowever it wasn\u2019t until after the Second World War that Dundee emerged as a major force in the Scottish game when managing / director George Anderson built a side that was to challenge for honours. Having been relegated on the eve of War, Anderson lead Dundee to back to back B Division championships, having been denied promotion in the 1945/46 season as the Scottish League gave clubs a years grace to get players back from the armed forces and soon they were challenging for the A Division title.\n\nAnderson would tell the players to \u2018go out and enjoy themselves\u2019 and he liked to encourage attractive football and Dundee\u2019s first season back in the top flight was rewarded with a fourth place finish, their highest placing for twenty-six years.\n\nSeason 1948/49 saw Dundee reach the semi-finals of both the League and Scottish Cups and in the League Championship finished second after a heart breaking last day defeat. Dundee were one point ahead going into the final match at Falkirk and a win would guarantee the League Flag, regardless of what Rangers did at Albion Rovers but it wasn\u2019t to be.\n\nThe Dundee players were flooded with nerves and the effervescent and chirpy Anderson was unable to dispel them. When confronted with the usual pre-match opposition banter, Anderson locked his troops in the dressing room an hour before kick off and tried to protect his players from unnecessary distractions. It back fired however as Dundee first missed a penalty while at 0-0 and then fell apart in the second half and went down 4-1 as Rangers snatched the title with a similar score line at Coatbridge.\n\nIn just five short years however, Anderson had taken Dundee from Division Two also-rans to Championship contenders but the fact was, that there was no major trophies in the Dens Park cabinet and he had to work out how he was going to change that.\n\nHowever it was the signing George Anderson made in September 1950 which was the final piece in the jigsaw, when pulled off one of the transfer coups of the century when he signed Scottish superstar Billy Steel for a world record fee of \u00a323, 500. Anderson had fought off competition from Rangers to land Steel and the inside forward brought power, skill and imagination to the Dundee forward line. It was extraordinary for a provincial club like Dundee to pay such an extraordinary fee and Anderson\u2019s philosophy of \u2018think big\u2019 was repaid when silverware was soon on its way to Dens.\n\nWith the strong back-line of Cowie, Gallacher and Boyd added to the goals of Flavell and the skill of Steel, Dundee won their first trophy since 1910 when on October 27th 1951, Dundee won the League Cup in an exciting 3-2 win over Rangers at Hampden.\n\nTwelve months later Dundee became the first club to retain the League Cup when the defeated Kilmarnock 2-0 in the Final and with a Scottish Cup Final defeat to Motherwell squeezed in between the two League Cup wins, Anderson had finally turned Dundee in a trophy winning, Scottish footballing force.\n\nWhile the early fifties brought cup glory, the rest of the decade would see dismay for the Dark Blues in the country\u2019s main competition notably with a three nil defeat in the season 1953/54 by C Division Berwick Rangers.\n\nThings got worse five years later when in January 1959 Dundee visited to Highland League Fraserburgh in the Scottish Cup first round and crashed out with an embarrassing 1-0 loss. With a team that was full of experience and youthful promise, the Dark Blues had Bill Brown and Doug Cowie both of whom appeared for Scotland at the previous year\u2019s World Cup Finals, alongside Jimmy Gabriel who would go on to have a fine career with Everton, Hugh Robertson, Alan Cousin, Bobby Cox and Alex Hamilton. On paper Dundee should have been comfortable winners but the defeat to \u2018The Broch\u2019 is perhaps the biggest shock defeat ever from a Highland League Club.\n\nHowever Robertson, Cousin, Cox and Hamilton didn\u2019t have long to wait for honours, for in season 1961/62 the Dark Blues had their most glorious season, beating Rangers 5-1 at Ibrox and winning the Scottish League championship with a 3-0 win at Muirton Park, Perth on the final day of the season.\n\nThe names of Liney, Hamilton, Cox, Seith, Ure, Wishart, Smith, Penman, Cousin, Gilzean and Robertson trip off the tongue of every Dundee fan young and old and managed by Bob Shankly, they were described by Scottish Football historian Bob Crampsey as \u2018the best Scottish footballing side to emerge in Scotland since the war, better even than the Lisbon Lions.\u2019\n\nShankly brought together a blend of players together both on and off the park who allowed Dundee to live their dreams. There were the young stars like goal scoring phenomenon Alan Gilzean, who had trained as a painter and decorator, Ian Ure, who had given up rugby to play football for Dundee and Andy Penman, the \u2018Penalty King\u2019, the homesick genius whom Willie Thornton had rescued from Everton at the tender age of fifteen.\n\nThere was the ageing genius Gordon Smith who had been put out to pasture by Hearts with four championship medals in his pocket, whom Bob Shankly picked up for nothing at the age of 37 and who would play in a European Cup semi-final at 39. There were fellow veterans Bobby Wishart and Bobby Seith who had championships behind them with Aberdeen and Burnley respectively and who would bring vital experience to a young team.\n\nThere was Alan Cousin, the part-time footballer who juggled his playing career with school teaching and whose double shuffle was something that could never be taught. There was Hugh Robertson, deft and electric on the left wing and Pat Liney, without whom the Championship might not have been won had he not saved a penalty against St. Mirren in the penultimate game.\n\nThere was Alex Hamilton, Dundee\u2019s most capped player with 24 international appearances for Scotland, a joker and an extrovert, whose party-piece was playing keepie-up with a sixpence before flicking it up and catching it in his pocket and fellow full back Bobby Cox, the local boy who with his famous sliding tackle who skippered the Club he loved to its greatest moment.\n\nLegends all of them and the following season, Dundee set off on a memorable European odyssey as the Club entered into it\u2019s first foray into continental competition. As they took their European Cup challenge to a semi-final against AC Milan, they showed that the classic Scottish passing game which they played, could work as well in Europe as in Scotland. Their campaign began with an 8-1 thumping of second favourites Cologne, before a bruising rematch in Germany. Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht were also despatched before AC Milan ended the dream 5-1 in the San Siro despite Dundee winning the second leg 1-0 at home.\n\nAnother Scottish Cup Final followed in 1964 when only two late goals denied them a replay against Rangers in a game during which keeper Bert Slater turned in one of all time great performances in a final and a League Cup Final was reached in 1967 where the Dark Blues lost 5-3 to Celtic.\n\nThat same season Dundee reached their second European semi final as they reached the last four of the Inter City Fairs Cup \u2013 the predecessor to the UEFA Cup where they lost to Don Revie\u2019s Leeds United 2-1 on aggregate.\n\n1973 brought Dundee\u2019s last major trophy when captain Tommy Gemmell lifted the League Cup after Gordon Wallace\u2019s winner had beaten Celtic 1-0 at Hampden and both would later go on to manage the Club..\n\nTwo seasons later came the formation of the Premier League, something Dundee had been prime movers in establishing, but they were not in it long, being relegated at the end of the first season. They found life tougher than anticipated in the First Division and although promotion was achieved in 1978 the Dark Blues were back down by the end of the following campaign despite registering a famous 5-1 win over Celtic towards the end of the season.\n\n1980-81 saw them win their way back to the Premier League and reach another League Cup final which was played at Dens Park in an historic Jute City Final against Dundee United and once up Dundee, stayed in the top flight throughout the eighties\n\nThe nineties brought more years in second tier wilderness with a Centenary Cup win in 1990 and two First Division titles in 1992 and 1998 and another League Cup Final as a First Division club, where they lost 2-0 to Aberdeen at Hampden.\n\nPromotion in 1998 entered Dundee into the inaugural Scottish Premier League but it was a season that Dundee off the field were in a continual fight against adversity, expulsion, bankruptcy and takeover fears. The S.P.L. wanted to see Dens Park as a 10 000 all seated stadium within twelve months and Dundee United attempted a takeover and merge the clubs but the players got on with it and turned in some terrific performances.\n\nOn the field, Dundee showed a gritty determination and fighting spirit to retain their top flight status and by the end of the season, The Dee finished in fifth place, their highest league position for twenty-five years and never bettered since they were Scottish champions in 1962.\n\nDundee had also failed to finish above their rivals Dundee United during the same period but now they managed to achieve this after a memorable derby victory on May 1st 1999 when goals from Brian Irvine and James Grady gave Dundee a famous 2-0 win.\n\nThe stands were built and named after the League Championship winning captain and manager Bobby Cox and Bob Shankly and despite being within a point of finishing fifth again that season, Jocky Scott was replaced in favour of Italian manager Ivano Bonetti.\n\nBonetti would bring excitement, stars and wonderful football and had no problem attracting players, most notably Argentine superstar Claudio Caniggia but the problem was that apart from Caniggia, they could not sell the stars in for a big profit. With cost spiralling out of control and no tangible league or cup success to match Dundee\u2019s stylish football Bonetti left in 2002 to be replaced by Jim Duffy who took over for the second time.\n\nA 21ST CENTURY DUNDEE\n\nDundee still had a fine squad and Duffy led them to the Scottish Cup Final in his first season, losing 1-0 to Rangers in a match which the Dark Blues could well have won and took Dundee back into Europe after a twenty-nine year absence. There they defeated KS Vllaznia 6-0 on aggregate in the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup before losing out 3-1 to Serie A side Perguia when over 2000 Dees had travelled to Umbria to watch the second leg.\n\nHowever the following month, November 2003 brought a bombshell for the Dark Blues faithful as Dundee went into administration. The court appointed Tom Burton and Fiona Taylor from the accountants Ernst & Young as joint administrators and the following day the full extent of Dundee\u2019s financial plight was revealed with debts reported to be close to a staggering \u00a320 million.\n\nDundee fans feared the worst and it was a crucial time for the survival of Dundee FC with the supporters\u2019 association launching its Dee4Life fundraising campaign which was crucial in helping save the Club.\n\nTwenty-five members of staff had been immediately axed and manager Jim Duffy took it upon himself to inform the playing and coaching staff and almost immediately became a target for Partick Thistle to replace Gerry Collins who was sacked with the Maryhill club rooted to the bottom of the league. He showed incredibly loyalty however and stayed with the beleaguered Dees and against all the odds led them to a seventh place finish at the end of that year.\n\nThere was real concern that the Club would not survive and the drastic cost cutting that was necessary to do so, impacted not just on that season but continues until today. In 2005 the Dark Blues were relegated in dramatic style on the final day of the season after Tam McManus\u2019 injury time shot which hit the post would have kept them up and the first season in the lower leagues saw Duffy and his replacement Alan Kernaghan both sacked.\n\nAlex Rae replaced the Irishman in the summer of 2006 but a third and then second place finish couldn\u2019t get The Dee back up and he was replaced in November 2008 by Jocky Scott for his third spell in charge.\n\nScott\u2019s first game in charge stopped the rot with a 1-1 draw at home to Airdrie United and the following week on November 8th, Dundee got their first win since August 23rd with an impressive 1-0 victory over Dunfermline in Fife thanks to a goal from Guadeloupe international Mikel Antoine-Curier.\n\nResults continued to pick up with just one league defeat in nine as well as running Celtic close in the third round of the Scottish Cup at Parkhead when Colin McMenamin gave The Dee a 1-0 lead before eventually losing 2-1.\n\nAnother run of only one defeat in nine in February / March saw Dundee propel up the league but their poor early season form meant that they never really put pressure on St Johnstone and Partick at the top.\n\nIn April Dundee held their first ever Hall of Fame Dinner at the Invercarse Hotel and manager Jocky Scott was one of eight inaugural inductees alongside William Longair, Alan Gilzean, Billy Steel, Doug Cowie, Claudio Caniggia, Bobby Cox and Barry Smith, Scott\u2019s former captain from his last spell in charge whom he would bring back to Dens to coach the Under-19s.\n\nAt the end of the season Dundee finished a credible fourth, fifteen points behind champions St Johnstone who won the League with 65 points \u2013 four less than Dundee had as runners-up the year before.\n\nHopes were high therefore that promotion could be achieved in season 2009/10 under the guidance of the experienced Scott who had led Dundee to the First Division title in 1998. After years of struggling with the financial constraints caused by the administration period of 2003/04, it looked like those days might be behind the club thanks to new investment that had come into the club in the summer of 2009.\n\nThat investment came in the form of Aberdeen businessman Calum Melville who joined the board in March 2009 after answering a newspaper advert from Dundee F.C. chairman Bob Brannan which invited investment into the club. Prior to the forty-one year old\u2019s arrival at Dens, Dundee, if not exactly reaching for the stars, were hardly in the gutter either and the board, having studied the impact of administration, realised that they couldn\u2019t afford to live beyond their means and if that meant fans had to lower their expectations, so be it.\n\nSuch pragmatism exited Dens Park however when Melville breezed into the City of Discovery with big promises and grander ambitions and journalists regaled Dundee supporters with various tales of Melville\u2019s wealth, from his princely house in Gleneagles and his Bentley, to how he wasn\u2019t averse to hearing himself compared with the American billionaire, Donald Trump.\n\nBrannan had placed the advert in The Sunday Times at a cost of \u00a35900 in February 2009 advertising for \u2018Business Directors\u2019 and at the club\u2019s AGM a few weeks later, told the assembled shareholders that a shortlist of ten interested parties had been drawn up. By the end of March that list had been reduced to one and on the 26th of the month, Melville was invited to come on board.\n\nMelville was born in Aberdeen and made his fortune through commercial and residential property, hotels and the oil and gas industry in the Granite City, and was a lifelong Dons supporter. He was listed in The Sunday Times top 500 rich list in 2008 and in his first public interview since joining Dundee in the Evening Telegraph on April 27th, Melville revealed that the board had come up with a plan that for every full price season ticket over the figure sold the previous year, they were going to match it pound for pound to invest in the playing staff.\n\n\u201cIf we sell a thousand more than last year, that\u2019s \u00a3280,000 from the fans and we will put in another \u00a3280,000 to match that and get the best players we can\u201d, said Calum in an exclusive interview for the local press. \u201cWe are having a genuine push to get back to the SPL and the term we will use again and again is that second is last. There is no second prize in the First Division and we have to be first.\n\n\u201cWe have to get promoted and the guys in the street have to know that and support us accordingly. I\u2019ll say it again and keep saying it \u2013 the mantra for next season is second is nowhere.\u201d\n\nBefore then Brannan had already announced at the club\u2019s annual Hall of Fame dinner on April 3rd that the budget for the playing staff would increase by 25% for the following season and that manager Jocky Scott was already identifying some exciting signing targets.\n\nAn approach for one of those signing targets was made on the last day of the season against Partick Thistle when Scott asked Jags manager Ian McCall about the availability of midfielder Gary Harkins who had been outstanding despite Dundee\u2019s 4-0 win. Harkins had been nominated for the First Division player of the year award and after a protracted three-month transfer saga, Jocky eventually got his man for a fee of \u00a3150,000 plus add-ons which was funded by the new director.\n\nAlso on Jocky\u2019s radar was nineteen-year-old Livingston striker Leigh Griffiths and an approach was made for the Scotland B cap in April shortly after Melville joined the club. This approach was immediately rebuffed by the West Lothian club and Dundee looked to have a job on their hands to secure his services as the much sought after youngster was also being coveted by a number of SPL clubs including Hearts who publicly stated as much. Dundee, however, were the only club who put cash on the table and on June 25th, Livingston accepted Dundee\u2019s offer of \u00a3125,000 and \u201cSparky\u201d was on his way to Dens.\n\nWith a number of new players, including some with international experience, reported to also be close to joining Dundee, Melville was asked in an interview with the Dundee Mad website if the club could sustain the wages they were now offering without him.\n\nHis answer was emphatic and he said, \u201cYes. This is not a Gretna situation. This club is only sustainable in the long run in the SPL and that is where we need to be. We can pay good money now so imagine doubling the crowds and having SPL football to offer. We are aiming for regular 4th to 8th place in that league. I need to make it clear the players joining the club just now, they are not mercenaries. They are not being paid SPL wages, they are being paid good First Division wages. There are fantastic bonuses in place for success in this league and to get out of it. They get First Division wages now with built in SPL wages after promotion. They are buying into the opportunity we are giving them. The board, the fans, the backroom staff and the players, we are all in this together. Everyone wants to see this club back in the SPL.\u201d\n\nTo invest to get into the SPL was clearly Dundee\u2019s plan as the build-up to the 2009/10 season saw a host of new players join the Club, including former Scotland internationalists Brian Kerr and Colin Cameron, Northern Ireland internationalist Chris Casement, goalkeepers Tony Bullock and John Gibson, strikers Pat Clarke and Sean Higgins and midfielder Ritchie Hart. In total eleven new players joined the club and straight away things seemed to click into place in the first game of the season when Stranraer were dispatched 5-0 in the League Cup 1st round, with three of the new boys on target.\n\nBy the end of October, Dundee had reached the final of the ALBA Cup, the League Cup quarter-final after beating SPL Aberdeen in the third round, and were level on points at the top of the league with Queen of the South and the next two months would see Dundee win the ALBA Cup and open up that eight-point gap at the top on Boxing Day.\n\nDundee had reached the Scottish League Challenge Cup Final, now sponsored by Gaelic speaking television channel BBC ALBA for the third time in their history where they met fellow First Division title contenders Inverness Caledonian Thistle at McDiarmid Park on Sunday 22nd November 2009.\n\nIn a thrilling final, Dundee were 2-0 down at half-time but stormed back in the second half to win 3-2 thanks to an own goal from Caley\u2019s Nauris Bulvitis and strikes from Gary Harkins and Craig Forysth to lift the cup for the second time.\n\n\u201cThat was a big win,\u201d said an understandably delighted Dundee manager Jocky Scott when he emerged from the home dressing room. \u201cIt was a big win though not a big score and hopefully that will inspire the players for the future and prove to them that we are a good side when we do the right things.\u201d\n\nImmediately Jocky appeared to be right as the ALBA Cup win inspired the players to storm to the top of the Scottish League First Division with impressive away wins against Ross County (1-0) and Partick Thistle (2-0) in the immediate aftermath of the Cup Final. These victories were followed by two 3-1 home wins over Ayr United and Morton and after a Boxing Day draw against the recently relegated Inverness, the Dark Blues had opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the table ahead of Queen of the South and a twelve-point lead over the side from the Highlands who had been arguably Dundee\u2019s biggest threat to promotion pre-season.\n\nDecember saw Jocky Scott win the Irn-Bru First Division Manager of the Month Award and Gary Harkins named as the Irn-Bru Phenomenal Player of the month and in the first half in Inverness on the 26th, Dundee were extremely comfortable against one of their main rivals and went in at half time 1-0 ahead thanks to a Leigh Griffiths penalty. A win would mean a fifteen-point gap being opened up over the Highlanders but the second half was a completely different proposition and The Dee were lucky to escape with a 1-1 draw.\n\nHaving endured a long trek on Boxing Day, Dundee were also disappointed that the Scottish League fixture list had given them another match on the road at New Year, this time away to Airdrie United. This had meant that the club had missed out on some potentially decent revenue as the festive fixtures are often well attended while the fixtures before Christmas are normally amongst the lowest of the season for every club and Dundee had hosted Morton on December 19th in front of just over 4000.\n\nHowever, by the Monday in the lead-up to Airdrie on January 2nd, it became clear that the match was already in severe jeopardy due to the weather and at Melville\u2019s suggestion, Dundee approached The Diamonds and the Scottish League to have the game moved to Dens as the Dark Blues had under soil heating and were confident they could get the fixture played. Melville felt this would give Dundee a great chance to get some revenue in over the festive period, as well as continue the recent good run, and with the majority of other games likely to be off, Dundee could increase their lead at the top.\n\nMelville approached the Scottish League personally and all parties agreed that the game could go ahead at Dens on Sunday the 3rd with the corresponding fixture against Airdrie in March now being swapped to be played at the Excelsior Stadium.\n\nA monumental effort therefore took place to get the game on but by Sunday lunchtime, Club General Manger Jim Thomson, who had overseen the operation, feared the worst as temperatures plummeted in Dundee. To everyone\u2019s relief, referee Colin Brown finally did deem it playable at 2.20pm but in hindsight, it would have perhaps have been better if he hadn\u2019t as, in the words of Jocky Scott, \u201cEverything that could have gone wrong went wrong on that day.\u201d\n\nIn the sub zero temperatures Dundee slipped to their first defeat in fourteen as Airdrie deservedly won 1-0. It was a tale of two penalties with Leigh Griffiths\u2019 spot-kick being saved with the game at 0-0 before Kevin McDonald sent Rab Douglas the wrong way with his shot from twelve yards shortly afterwards.\n\nAs the fans watched the pitch start to glisten towards the end, Airdrie were reduced to ten men and still Dundee couldn\u2019t make the breakthrough in a game that was to have ramifications for the rest of the season. Losing to the side at the bottom of the league was a serious blow and was a big dent to the players\u2019 confidence and the swapping of the fixtures meant that Dundee would now have six of their last nine fixtures away from home for the title run-in. The pitch itself also took some serious punishment and cut up badly and it didn\u2019t really recover from this until pre-season. It meant that it was often more of a hindrance to Dundee and a help to the opposition when they visited Dens and it could affect Dundee\u2019s passing game.\n\nOne such game was three weeks later when second-placed Ross County came to Dens and snatched a 1-0 win in a drab affair to cut The Dees\u2019 lead at the top to six points having also played three games more. There was a huge surprise for the Dundee support at kick-off when top goalscorer Leigh Griffiths started on the bench, having been left out of the starting line-up as a punishment for turning up late. Dundee were 1-0 down at the break and so Sparky came on at half time but he couldn\u2019t inspire the Dark Blues as they turned in a dismal performance and blew the chance to go twelve points clear. It was another dent to the players\u2019 confidence and it gave both Highland sides the chance to close the gap on Dundee at the top.\n\nMelville\u2019s appearances at Dens however had become more infrequent since Christmas and he claimed this was due to being busy with his business interests and he was censored by the SFA after claiming to BBC journalist Jim Spence that Dundee might offer Dundee United \u00a3500,000 for Scott Robertson in the January transfer window. Dundee had already outspent the likes of Rangers that season and the SFA gave Melville a \u2018slap on the wrist\u2019 as it was seen as \u2018tapping up\u2019 the player.\n\nOn February 20th Dundee were due to play Partick at Dens but on the eve of the match the club received some devastating news that legendary skipper of the 1962 championship winning side Bobby Cox had passed away during the night. \u2018Sir\u2019 Bobby as he was known by the fans was a regular at Dens on match days until he had recently taken ill and the club honoured him with a minute\u2019s applause before the game. The players stood for the applause in front of the stand which bears his name and they furthered honoured his memory when current captain Eric Paton scored the winner in a 1-0 victory.\n\nLess than a month later however, there was more devastating news when another of the League winning side, Hugh Robertson, passed away, but by then Dundee\u2019s results had been on the slide. On March 6th Dundee again came back from 2-0 down against Inverness to draw two each and keep Caley at nine points\u2019 arms length but that lead was being whittled away with a draw at Ayr and a defeat again to Airdrie later in the month.\n\nThere was a further blow on March 13th when Dundee lost at 2-1 home to Raith Rovers in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and this disappointment was further deepened when the Fife side drew Dundee United in the semi-final in what would have been a huge money spinner for the club.\n\nThat defeat, coupled with the loss at Airdrie, signaled the end of Jocky Scott\u2019s time in charge and the shocking performance in Lanarkshire had been the final straw for the board. Calum Melville wasn\u2019t at the match at the Excelsior Stadium but he took the responsibility himself to personally inform Scott of his fate and left his home in Aberdeen to drive south give him the bad news after a conference phone call between the directors decided the manager had to go.\n\nIn a statement released by the club via the official website, it explained why the decision had been made despite Dundee still being top of the league. \u201cThe unanimous decision of the board was not taken lightly but it was felt in view of the results since the turn of the year that the move was essential and in the best interests of the club.\u201d\n\nRecent performances had indeed been poor and with the lead now down to just three points, there was a worry that Inverness were going to overhaul The Dee sooner rather than later. It was clear now that it was imperative for the club to win the First Division to return to the SPL after a five-year absence and the mantra of \u2018second is nowhere\u2019 meant Jocky Scott had to pay the ultimate price despite his side still being top of the league.\n\nJocky Scott was sacked on March 20th with just nine matches to go until the end of the season and according to striker Colin McMenamin, \u201cThe whole place died the day they sacked Jocky Scott and we just never recovered from that. The boys were so close to Jocky and they felt really let down by the board at the time.\u201d\n\nIt was not the first time that Dundee had replaced their manager while top of the First Division, it was the third and on the previous occasions Dundee managed to finish the season as champions in their last two successful promotion campaigns. The first was in 1992 when Iain Munro was replaced by Simon Stainrod in February while in 1998, John McCormack was ironically replaced by Jocky Scott during the same month to guide them to the league title.\n\nHaving won just two of their eight games since New Year, the board felt a fresh approach was needed to again get Dundee over the finishing line and they were desperate to get a new man in charge before the following Tuesday when the Dark Blues were due to face Queen of the South.\n\nIronically it was Queens\u2019 manager Gordon Chisholm who quickly became the board\u2019s first choice to take over and they envisaged a management dream team to include former Dundee favourite Billy Dodds, who had been coaching part-time with Chisholm in Dumfries. The Dark Blues wanted Dodds to give up his media career and join Dundee as full-time assistant manager instead of Chisholm\u2019s number two at Palmerston, Kenny Brannigan, and when the pair agreed, they were offered their new roles at Dens.\n\nChisholm and Dodds were controversial choices for many Dark Blues fans with Chisholm becoming the first man to manage both Dundee and Dundee United while Dodds had criticised the club on a number occasions while working on the radio for BBC Scotland.\n\nChisholm\u2019s opening match in charge just two days later therefore was against the club he\u2019d just left and the match against Queen of the South was shown live on BBC ALBA. The hope was that Dundee would get the immediate boost that a new manager often brings to a club and the game got off to the perfect start when Queens were reduced to ten men in sixteen minutes. McAusland was sent off for denying Leigh Griffiths a goalscoring opportunity in the box and the striker dusted himself down and scored the resultant spot kick.\n\nThe Dee however couldn\u2019t make their extra man count and after an hour Queens drew level through Bob Harris and managed to hold on for a point. In injury time it had looked as if Dundee might snatch a winner when the referee pointed to the spot again, this time for a handball from by Paul Burns but as Griffiths placed the ball on the spot, the Queens\u2019 players surrounded referee Scott MacDonald as he went to consult his linesman and after an agonising delay, he changed his mind and awarded Dundee a corner.\n\nIt was another blow to the confidence of the players while the fans had also been noticeably nervy after the Doonhamers\u2019 equaliser. It was a disappointing start for Chisholm with another two points dropped and now they had to face a Ross County side in Dingwall who were only seven points behind with three games in hand and on a high after knocking Hibs out of the Scottish Cup in their last match.\n\nFour changes were made by Chisholm for the trip up north and it looked like Dundee were heading for a timely three points when on-loan Celtic striker Ben Hutchinson opened the scoring just after half time. However, with just three minutes left on the clock, former Dundee forward Steven Craig equalised for County and the game despairingly ended in a draw.\n\nIt was another two points dropped and The Dee had now taken just two points from nine in the last eight days. Second placed Inverness had won 1-0 at Partick Thistle to take seven points from nine in the same period and they now dislodged Dundee from top spot to move one point clear.\n\nThe following Tuesday was now going to be a crucial one with a full set of First Division fixtures seeing the top four playing each other and second placed Dundee had another away game at third placed Dunfermline, who themselves still harboured ambitions of promotion.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be a miserable night for Dundee in more ways than one, as they went down by two goals to one on a cold, wet, snowy night on a slippy, muddy surface. Dunfermline were firing on all cylinders from the off and took the lead in six minutes while a lacklustre Dens side were never at the races and went in at the break 2-0 behind. Chisholm sent on all three substitutes at half time and went for broke but an injury time goal from Eddie Malone only served as scant consolation.\n\nIn the Highland derby in Inverness, league leaders Caley gunned down fourth placed Ross County by three goals to nil and in the process extended their lead over Dundee. It was a disastrous start for Chisholm, without a win in his first three games, and the three-point lead he had inherited had now turned round to a four-point deficit.\n\nDundee were now desperate for a win and achieved one at Dens against Ayr United the following Saturday but the 3-0 victory was overshadowed by the news that Caley had come from behind twice against Raith to win 4-3.\n\nDundee were due to play Inverness on the last day of the season at the Caledonian Stadium and the hope now was that Dundee could get within three points of Inverness before they had to travel north to give them a chance of grabbing the title. Caley however showed no sign of letting up and were on a sixteen-game unbeaten run which stretched back to November and they made it seventeen games on April 6th with a midweek 2-0 win at Greenock which gave them a seven-point lead as Dundee were inactive.\n\nDundee kept within touching distance of top spot when they won their first league away match of the year 1-0 at Partick but the following week dropped two more points when a late Griffiths equaliser earned a 2-2 draw with Morton.\n\nSparky\u2019s free kick in the 86th minute at Greenock meant that Dundee were now nine points behind with three games to play and that goal had merely meant that Dundee could still mathematically catch Inverness. To do so they would have to win their game in hand at Raith Rovers the following Tuesday, but after twenty-six minutes they suffered a serious blow when goalkeeper Tony Bullock had to go off with a hamstring injury.\n\nDundee had been unlucky throughout the season with goalkeeping injuries to Robert Douglas and Tony Bullock and veteran goalkeeping coach Bobby Geddes had already featured on the bench five times before Christmas. In the ALBA Cup quarter-final at Stirling in October, it looked like the forty-nine year old Dundee legend would have to come on when Bullock picked up a knock, but the Englishman played on, much to everyone\u2019s relief.\n\nTo avoid a repeat of this scenario, Jocky Scott had brought in former Dundee goalkeeper Derek Soutar in November but now both he and Douglas were injured for the game at Stark\u2019s Park and Geddes was again on the bench and therefore had to come on when Bullock hobbled off. At the age of forty-nine years and eight months, Geddes became the oldest player in Scottish football history and let no one down with a performance that rolled back the years.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent Raith from taking all three points as The Dee turned in a dreadful performance and the 1-0 win for Rovers handed Inverness the First Division Championship.\n\nThe farcical situation with the goalkeeper just about summed things up for Dundee as a fifteen-point lead over Inverness had been overturned to a nine-point deficit. Dundee gained some revenge over Raith on the Saturday with a 2-0 win in their last home game but a 1-0 defeat at Caley on the last day meant Inverness won the league by twelve points, having orchestrated a twenty-seven point swing.\n\nWhere it all had gone wrong was what every Dundee fan wanted to know but credit to Inverness who went on a twenty-one game unbeaten run just after their defeat to the Dark Blues in the ALBA Cup final. Dundee, by contrast, had won just four league games since Christmas and didn\u2019t enjoy the boost normally enjoyed by clubs when they bring in a new manager. Dundee never really recovered from the defeats to Airdrie and Ross County in January and took only nine points from twenty-seven after Gordon Chisholm took charge.\n\nAfter a season which had started with so much hope and promise, it became painful watching the SPL dream, which seemed so close at Christmas, slowly disappear. Dundee had clearly gambled on getting promotion by offering higher wages than previous years and paying the second highest transfer fees in Scotland but it had not paid off.\n\nIt was obvious therefore that failure to win the league meant cutbacks had to be made and budgets had to be reduced and new Business Development Manager Harry MacLean, who had joined the club in May 2010 and would become CEO in September, immediately went from raising money to saving it, cutting the first team wages from \u00a331,000 a week to \u00a316,000.\n\nDuring pre-season, Chisholm had a number of players on trial, training with the squad and on the eve of the new campaign, deals were completed with Nicky Riley, Stephen O\u2019Donnell and Gary Irvine. Mikael Antoine-Curier also joined up with the team after a spell last season on loan at Hamilton and the Guadeloupe international went straight into the side for the season\u2019s opener against Alloa Athletic in defence of the ALBA Cup which The Dee won 2-1.\n\nThe league campaign started with a 1-0 win over Queen of the South at Dens with debutants Rhys Weston, Netan Sansara and Jamie Adams on loan from St Johnstone in the side. Dundee achieved that victory despite going down to nine men but the next game saw the Dark Blues go from the courageous to the ridiculous when they crashed out in of the ALBA Cup to Second Division Stenhousemuir, after a dismal performance saw The Dee surrender the trophy with a 4-1 defeat.\n\nResults continued to be poor with a defeat away to Partick and a 0-0 draw with Ross County at Dens before another embarrassing cup exit, this time in the League Cup at Brechin on penalties.\n\nDefeats in Fife to Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath in September started to put real pressure on Gordon Chisholm but rumours started to circulate that there were more pressing financial pressures off the pitch. Internet chatter was suggesting that Dundee may be in some sort of financial trouble and that Calum Melville might be about to jump ship and the dreaded \u2018A\u2019 word started to being bandied about.\n\nThe local press were suggesting that Dundee owed the taxman in the region of \u00a3365,000 and on Friday 1st October, the players and staff were left reeling when the club failed to pay their wages. Financial expert Blair Nimmo had been negotiating with HMRC on the club\u2019s behalf and was trying to persuade them to accept a lump sum now and the balance in the summer but the talks became deadlocked and Dundee decided not to pay their staff after taking independent advice.\n\nThe reality now was that if a resolution wasn\u2019t reached, Dundee would have to go into administration for the second time in seven years. On October 14th it was official when the papers were lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh and Bryan Jackson of PKF assumed control of the club. It was the third occasion that the club was on the brink due to financial mismanagement and as Dundee arguably sunk to the lowest level in its 117-year history, there was real worry that the club might not survive this time.\n\nAs expected, the first task of the Administrator was to reduce the wage costs and release a number of staff with immediate effect. Jackson was involved in the same process at Motherwell when they went into administration in 2002, letting go nineteen players shortly after taking over at Fir Park and on this occasion the number was thirteen.\n\nFrom the playing staff, Mikael Antoine-Curier, Scott Fox, Charlie Grant, Brian Kerr, Njazi Kuqi, Paul McHale, Colin McMenamin, Eric Paton and Dominic Shimmin were released alongside manager Gordon Chisholm, assistant manager Billy Dodds, youth development coach John Holt and ticket office manager/kit man Neil Cosgrove.\n\nOctober 15th 2010 was a horrendous day at Dens and Bryan Jackson held a press conference to inform the fans that firstly under-19 coach Barry Smith had been put in charge of the team as caretaker-manager and secondly that Dundee\u2019s debts were much larger than initially feared and were in the region of around \u00a32 million.\n\nAmidst all the chaos and conjecture, Dundee actually had a game to play twenty-four hours later at Stirling Albion and new boss Barry Smith had the job of lifting the thirteen senior players who were left on the books. With so few players remaining, the team virtually picked itself while the substitutes\u2019 bench would have to be supplemented with players from the youth team.\n\nAstonishingly, after such a week of turmoil and despair, a match would have understandingly been the last thing on the mind of the players, but they turned in an excellent performance which trumped anything of recent weeks. In front of a noisy away support, Dundee dominated the first half before Leigh Griffiths gave The Dee the lead not long after the break. Stirling, however, bounced back and equalised despite being down to ten men and although it was one way traffic towards The Binos\u2019 goal, Dundee couldn\u2019t grab the winner as every player gave their all.\n\nUnder the circumstances it was a very good point and an emotional week ended with an emotional moment that fitted the day perfectly. Before the match, the players had gone into a huddle for the second match in a row and then at the end, every member of the team, alongside Barry Smith and his coaches, made a point of heading towards the 1000 plus away support that stood to applaud their heroes. The Dundee fans gave the players a tremendous ovation and the bond between the players and the fans was a theme that was to become more prevalent in the weeks and months to come.\n\nAs they had done seven years before, the Dundee support mobilised quickly and the Dundee FC Supporters\u2019 Society started a fighting fund in an attempt to save the club while the threadbare squad achieved credible draws against Dunfermline and Falkirk in their next two games.\n\nBefore the next match at home to Partick however the club received another blow when the Scottish League hit Dundee with a twenty-five point penalty on November 1st. It was a serious threat to the club\u2019s very existence as relegation could mean part-time football or even closure. It left Dundee on minus eleven points, bottom of the league and in a state of shock.\n\nDundee were reeling and on the precipice and the next game against Partick Thistle at Dens on November 6th was clearly going to be one of the biggest games in the club\u2019s history as the reaction of the players, staff and supporters would go a long way to showing the footballing world whether Dundee FC had a future or not. The fight for survival was now in full swing.\n\nThe players and fans didn\u2019t disappoint as over 6000 turned up to wave their red cards in protest of the draconian 25 point penalty and watch Jamie Adams score in the 85th minute to give The Dee a priceless 2-1 win. It was the first victory since going into administration and there were wild celebrations both on and off the park. The noise nearly lifted the roof off of the old Archibald Leitch stand and Dee-Fiant was now the belief and inspiration.\n\nVictories in the next five games against Ross County (home and away), Morton, Cowdenbeath and Stirling Albion put The Dee on a ten game unbeaten run and chipped away at the gap between Dundee and second bottom place which was now down to ten points.\n\nAgainst Ross County on January 2nd a familiar face was in the line-up when Steven Robb returned to help out his old club as a trialist. As well as the 25 point deduction the Scottish League had imposed a transfer embargo on Dundee and in the coming months manager Barry Smith would use the 3-game trialist loophole to help boost his tiny squad.\n\nThe most celebrated example of this occurred a month later against league leaders Raith Rovers at Dens on February 12th when club legend Neil McCann came out of retirement and put his boots on again for three games. Now working as a SKY Sports pundit, he came to the aid of his old club and old team mate Barry Smith and it was a fairytale return for the winger.\n\nMcCann started on the bench and came on after 57 minutes with Dundee already 1-0 down. His appearance saw the tide begin to turn however and with four minutes left captain Gary Harkins scored a fantastic free kick to deservedly level the scores.\n\nDundee didn\u2019t settle for a point however and four minutes into injury time, those who were there witnessed one of the great Dens Park moments. A Craig Forsyth corner was cleared by a Raith defender but when it fell to Matt Lockwood outside the box, he lofted it back in where it was met by Forsyth who headed the ball down. It landed at the feet of McCann twelve yards out and as he spun and fell to the ground, he lifted the ball gently into the air and watched it float over the Rovers keeper and into the net.\n\nMcCann\u2019s sprint towards the South Enclosure belied his thirty-six years and his team mates didn\u2019t catch him till he reached the touchline. When they got there, they buried him in dark blue bodies in front of a frenzied Dundee support which had bounced to the front of the South Enclosure to celebrate with their heroes. It was simply magnificent as Dens reverberated with joy.\n\nThe previous week Dundee had come off the bottom of the league for the first time after a 2-1 win at Dumfries and the victory over Raith was incredibly Dundee\u2019s fourteenth match unbeaten.\n\nTen days later Dundee met Raith again this time in Fife and there was another fairytale in the Dens Park ranks when Lochee United\u2019s Craig Robertson, a lifelong Dee, was offered the chance to turn out for his heroes. Dundee exploited another loophole where Junior players could be used as trialists and Robertson did himself proud with a magnificent performance in the middle of the park in another 2-1 win.\n\nTwo weeks later Dundee were back in Fife and their 3-1 win over Cowdenbeath equaled the club\u2019s 19-game unbeaten run record set by the Championship winning side of 1961/62. They broke the record with a 2-1 win over Queen of the South on March 12th and the run would eventually become a new record of 23 games, broken only when Raith gained a modicum of revenge for McCann\u2019s last minute goal with a last minute winner of their own at Starks Park on April 2nd.\n\nBy then Dundee had survival in their sights and on Easter Saturday travelled up to Dingwall where victory would ensure not only that Dundee would avoid bottom spot but also ninth place which would have put Dundee into a relegation play-off.\n\nAlthough Barry Smith had predicted a \u2018cracker\u2019, it turned out in the end to be anything but, but no one connected with Dundee cared a jot as in they secured the victory they needed with a 1-0 win in a scrappy affair. In many ways it was a performance which summed up much of the post-administration season as they defended superbly when under pressure, played some neat passing football, ground out a result when most needed and saw a youngster come to the fore by grabbing the winning goal.\n\nThe winning goal came from Leighton McIntosh in sixty-five minutes when he took advantage of a poor touch from Michael McGovern to take the ball off the County keeper before rolling it into the empty net in front of the jubilant away fans. It was McIntosh\u2019s fourth goal in three games and as the only fit striker on the books he had really come of age with vital goals at vital times after missing part of the season earlier with a broken wrist, which he still protected with a cast.\n\nThe final whistle brought scenes of joy as players, management and fans celebrated the amazing feat of what they had achieved in staying up after the 25 point deduction with two games to spare. Survival had seemed a pipe dream in November but it would be an achievement long remembered.\n\nThe following week there was a carnival atmosphere at Dens as almost 8000 fans came out to salute their heroes against Partick Thistle. An entertaining 3-2 win meant that Dundee had lost just one game in 27 and the players enjoyed a lap of honour at the end. Dundee would finish the league in sixth place, 24 points ahead of bottom, 9 points ahead of the play-offs and the players deserved the applause for everything they had done in adversity, giving their all and for playing a huge, huge part in saving the club.\n\nThe fans more than did their bit as well, raising an astonishing \u00a3250,000 in six months which allowed the Administrator to propose a CVA as early as March 11th. It was accepted without appeal and Dundee officially exited Administration on May 12th to become a fans\u2019 owned club with the Dundee FC Supporters\u2019 Society as the majority shareholder.\n\nThe fans-led new board was announced at the end of season player of the year dinner at the Hilton Hotel as was the news that Barry Smith had been appointed permanent manger. He\u2019d been given a three year deal as reward for his remarkable Dee-fiant leadership and this elicited a huge cheer and standing ovation in the room.\n\nSmith\u2019s task was now to consolidate Dundee\u2019s position in the league and build on the confidence of the Dee-Fiant season. It was a new beginning and a new chapter for club and no one seriously expected Dundee to be challenging for promotion as the club started to rebuild.\n\nWhat the fans didn\u2019t expect however was to be bottom of the league by November after a 1-0 home defeat to Partick. A series of disappointing defeats to Livingston, Morton, Falkirk, Hamilton and Ross County contributed to being rooted to the bottom.\n\nThe return of a former hero however changed the fortunes on the pitch when Gavin Rae rejoined the club seven years after leaving for Rangers to raise much needed cash during the first administration. Almost immediately Gavin\u2019s drive and determination in the middle of the park saw results pick up, culminating in a superb 6-1 win at Hamilton in December. Steven Milne, another former Dee who had returned in the summer scored a hat-trick at New Douglas Park as the Dark Blues started to shoot up the league.\n\nBy early February Dundee were up to third, six points behind leaders Ross County who had two games in hand but had lost Gavin Rae to his hometown team Aberdeen. The chance to close the gap on the Staggies however came when they visited Dens at the end of the month but a 1-1 draw allowed County to keep their distance and as they won their games in hand, started to pull away at the top.\n\nDundee kept plugging away however and by the end of March were up to second in the league albeit 15 points behind the Highlanders. By then however Rangers had gone into administration on Valentine\u2019s Day and the press started to hint that second in the First Division may be good enough for promotion should Rangers liquidate. A run of four home games in a row allowed Dundee to stay ahead of Falkirk in second spot and when they beat the Bairns at Dens in early April, it all but ensured that Dundee would finish as runners-up.\n\nA last day 1-0 home win over Livingston thanks to youngster Jamie Reid\u2019s debut goal secured second spot behind champions Ross County and it was another superb achievement from Barry Smith less than twelve months after coming out of admin.\n\nBy the end of the season the situation with Rangers was no clearer and the uncertainty became a Scottish football summer soap opera. Rangers had indeed liquidated but when the new season fixtures were released on June 20th, the S.P.L. named \u2018Club 12\u2019 on their list as no decision had yet been on the future of the new company headed by Charles Green.\n\nThe 2012/13 fixture list gave Dundee an opening day home game against Dumbarton but they were watching the Rangers situation quietly and with great interest. Dundee had finished as First Division runners-up for the third time in five years but if the \u2018Newco\u2019 were denied entry into the S.P.L., then The Dee would be in prime position to move back into the top tier after a seven year absence.\n\nAfter a season of consolidation manager Barry Smith now looked to assemble a Dark Blue squad to attempt to win promotion but as he did so, events with Rangers took a dramatic turn. On July 4th the eleven other S.P.L. clubs unanimously rejected the \u2018Newco\u2019 Rangers\u2019 application to join them and twelve days later named Dundee F.C. as \u2018Club 12\u2019. For once \u2018second was somewhere.\u2019\n\nDundee were handed their Golden Ticket just two weeks before the start of the new season and indeed didn\u2019t actually receive their S.P.L. share until twenty-four hours before opening day and the national summer of uncertainty meant the whole of Scottish football were ill prepared as fixture reshuffling ensued.\n\nThe League Cup First Round draw was made in June giving Dundee an away trip to Peterhead but this match was scheduled to take place on the first day of the S.P.L. season as the top flight clubs had a bye. This match therefore had to be brought forward four days to the previous Wednesday meaning Dundee had to cancel a pre-season friendly with Bristol City.\n\nDundee however had been building for a tilt at the First Division title and had assembled a squad over the summer which reflected this. They scraped through on penalties after a 0-0 draw in the \u2018Blue Toon\u2019 but that uninspiring result didn\u2019t stop over 3000 Dees travelling to Kilmarnock for their first SPL game and witness a battling 0-0 draw; a decent start against the League Cup holders\n\nThe next two games however highlighted Dundee\u2019s deficiencies with a 2-0 home defeat to St Mirren and a 3-0 loss \u2018across the road\u2019 at Tannadice to bitterest rivals Dundee United in which captain Stephen O\u2019Donnell was sent off live on SKY Sports.\n\nWith no goals and no points after three games, it was obvious that Dundee needed to add to their squad but they were unable to do so as they had yet to receive any money from the SPL. With Rangers now playing in the Third Division this caused uncertainty with the television deals and the usual August payment was delayed until September after the transfer window had closed. With Dundee having no overdraft since administration, they were therefore only able to bring in Hartlepool striker Colin Nish on loan until January.\n\nA 1-0 home defeat to Ross County after the derby was followed by one of the worst cup results in the club\u2019s history when Dundee crashed out 2-1 in the League Cup to Third Division Queens Park at Hampden after scoring their first goal in over 500 minutes. A surprise 1-0 win away to Hearts in the next game was followed by six straight defeats and the SPL was becoming a nightmare.\n\nDundee\u2019s inability to score would plague them all season and despite having seven strikers on the books, the top scorer finished with just seven goals. In fact the strikers scored no league goals in August and from September to January scored just one league goal between them each month.\n\nLong term injuries to key players also didn\u2019t help and throughout the season The Dee lost the services of Carl Finnigan, Jamie McClusky, Stephen O\u2019Donnell, Mark Stewart, Lewis Toshney for extended periods as well as those of new signings David Grassi, Brian Easton and Mark Kerr who had been brought in as free agents for their experience.\n\nA mini revival was sparked in November when another win over Hearts was followed by a draw at Motherwell then victory against Hibs which put second bottom St Mirren in their sights but when the sides met next met in Paisley, the turning point was the dismissal of Colin Nish and the Dark Blues lost 2-1. The decision to move the following midweek game against Kilmarnock to a free Saturday in January meant that Nish would now be suspended for the home derby against United and another 3-0 defeat meant the natives were becoming restless.\n\nA dismal Christmas period put pressure on Barry Smith and after a New Year defeat at Perth, a director was alleged to have leaked to a local newspaper that Smith\u2019s position was under review. Dundee denied this and gave Smith a vote of confidence until the end of the season but on February 20th with just two more points secured, Smith was dismissed.\n\nIt was a sad end for a Dundee legend who was elevated from youth coach to manager in October 2011 after the administrators axe fell on Gordon Chisholm. Smith led them on a club record run to avoid relegation, helping literally save the club as well as secure that second place which was crucial in getting into the SPL.\n\nOn February 23rd former player John Brown was appointed as caretaker boss and had the job until the end of the season but with Dundee fifteen points adrift at the bottom he claimed it would be \u2018a mountain to climb\u2019. League results and displays improved but the \u2018mountain was never climbed\u2019 and relegation to the First Division was confirmed on May 5th after a controversial 1-1 draw with Aberdeen. It was a lot later than many expected after a run of just one defeat in nine since Bomber was appointed and Brown was deservedly given the job full-time.\n\nIn the summer Dundee endured a soap opera of their own rather than a national one as Football Partners Scotland looked to invest in the club. After a protracted saga, a vote was held at a Supporters Society SGM on August 12th where members voted overwhelmingly to approve the issuance of 100 million new shares in Dundee FC for FPS to purchase. Bill Colvin was subsequently appointed as chairman, with Steve Martin and Ian Crighton rejoining the board alongside John Nelms from American investment group Keyes Capital who was appointed Director of Football Operations.\n\nManager John Brown spent the summer building a squad to get Dundee back into the top tier at the first attempt and after a sluggish start, were right on the tail of leaders Hamilton after the first quarter.\n\nBy the New Year Dundee were on top of new Scottish Championship but after a series of disappointing home results, Brown resigned with his side joint top of the league. To replace him, The Dee turned to former Scotland internationalist Paul Hartley who had done an impressive job at Alloa, leading them to consecutive promotions and his target was to make it a hat-trick by taking Dundee back into the top tier at the first attempt.\n\nHartley\u2019s first game in charge was against fellow title challengers Hamilton Academical on February 8th and his reign got off to the perfect start with a 1-0 win over his old side, making Hartley the first Dundee manager for 24 years to win his opening game.\n\nOver the next few months the lead repeatedly changed hands between Dundee and Hamilton with Falkirk also on their tales and after a valiant 1-1 draw with Hamilton at New Douglas Park and a convincing 4-0 home win over Cowdenbeath at Dens, the Dark Blues were in pole position with just three games left.\n\nHowever disaster struck on a sunny day in Greenock when already relegated Morton shocked The Dee with a 1-0 win. Hamilton went back to the top by a point meaning Dundee needed favours from others but just seven days later the football gods were smiling on Dundee as Dumbarton thumped Hamilton 4-1 as The Dee beat Alloa 3-0 in front of a sold out away end at Recreation Park.\n\nIt was all set up for Dundee to clinch promotion and the Scottish Championship trophy at home to Dumbarton on the last day of the season where a win would guarantee the title while a draw was likely good enough as Dundee were two points and eight goals ahead of Accies.\n\nAnticipation reached fever pitch as Dens Park sold out by the Wednesday but the capacity crowd in attendance could hardly have anticipated the high drama that was about to unfold. Christian Nade and Peter MacDonald gave Dundee a 2-0 half-time lead but when Scott Agnew pulled one back from the spot with twenty minutes left, the news filtering through from Lanarkshire was that Accies were beating Morton 8-1. The Greenock side pulled one back before Hamilton scored twice to make it 10-2, giving them the eight goals they needed to better Dundee\u2019s goal difference on goals scored.\n\nA goal for Dumbarton therefore would hand the title to Hamilton and The Sons desperately pushed forward in search of an equaliser to spoil the Dark Blues\u2019 party. First there was a penalty shout for Dumbarton, then an almighty scramble in the Dundee box and then with 90 minutes on the clock Kyle Letheren pulled off a world class fingertips save from a Bryan Prunty header as The Dee tried to desperately hang on to their 2-1 lead.\n\nEventually the referee\u2019s final whistle went and Dens Park exploded into unbridled joy. Dundee were SPFL Championship winners and had won promotion at the first attempt. The helicopter carrying the Championship trophy which had been circling over Dens in the final minutes delivered the trophy and when it was handed over to captain Gavin Rae it signaled that Dundee were back in the big time and could now look forward to the Premiership and the return of the derbies.\n\nPaul Hartley rebuilt the squad in the summer in preparation for the Premiership and it would pay dividends with a top six finish in Dundee\u2019s first season back in the top tier. The highlight was the derby victory over United in April which all but secured that top six finish and the success of Dundee\u2019s season was emphasised by Greg Stewart\u2019s nomination for Premiership Player of the Year and Scott Bain\u2019s call up to the full Scotland side.\n\nIn Dundee\u2019s second season in the Premiership, they just missed out on successive top six finishes by a point but there was compensation when Dundee got the chance to relegate their rivals Dundee United in what would become known as the \u2018Doon Derby.\u2019\n\nDundee had a good record against United that season with two draws at Tannadice a New Year win at Dens and the first draw in August was particularly memorable when The Dee came back from 2-0 down with 10 minutes to go to draw 2-2 thanks to a stunning strike from Greg Stewart and a 94th minute equaliser from James McPake.\n\nOn May 2nd 2016, the Dundee fans had the time of their lives when United crossed the road needing a win to avoid dropping down to the Championship. It looked like they might survive to fight another day when Ofere gave them the lead nine mutes after the break but on the 77th minute, Bulgarian defender Kostadin Gadzhalov wrote himself into the history books when he headed home a Gary Harkins corner to equalise and effectively relegate United.\n\nHowever in injury time, Dundee fan Craig Wighton hit the final nail in United\u2019s coffin when he hit home a 93rd minute winner and send United down and the home fans into delirium.\n\nGreg Stewart was again nominated for the PFA Player of the Year alongside team mate Kane Hemmings and both were lured south to Oxford United and Birmingham City at the start of the 2016/17 season, with around \u00a3750,000 coming into the Dens Park coffers.\n\nHowever their goals and influence were difficult to replace and the Dark Blues struggled at times in a rollercoaster season where Dundee sat 1st, 6th and 12th in the Premiership at various points across the season.\n\nIt was certainly a season of highs and lows as Rangers were defeated at home for the first time in 25 years, Inverness were beaten at Dens for the first time since 2005, Dundee scored six and seven in consecutive home games and ended their Highland hoodoo in the first league outing of the season. The Dee came back from two down to win a thrilling match against Hearts, then threw away a two goal lead at Inverness a month later and gave Celtic three of toughest matches of their imperious season with a hat-trick of narrow one goal losses. Dundee also scored five in the first half in Motherwell but then didn\u2019t win again until they went back there in Neil McCann\u2019s first match in charge.\n\nMcCann was appointed as interim manager after Paul Hartley departed with The Dee hovering precariously near the bottom after the Premiership split and wins at Motherwell and Kilmarnock and a 1-1 draw at home to Ross County (secured thanks to a penalty from Darren O\u2019Dea who ran into the South Enclosure after he scored) were enough to see Dundee safe from going down with two games to spare.\n\nDundee legend McCann was appointed full time manager in the summer and his first full season in charge saw more points won, an improvement in league position and further progress in both cup competitions.\n\nIt was a season of transition with Neil trying to implement his own football philosophy into the playing style and considering he was remembered in his Dundee playing career for his famous late goals, McCann clearly tried to instil that never-say-die attitude into his team with late winners against Raith, Hearts, Ross County, Hamilton, Partick and St Johnstone.\n\nIn the League Cup Dundee knocked their big rivals Dundee United out in the second round, after facing them in the group stages and the 2-1 victory came via a winner from Paul McGowan and a stunning opener from Faissal El Bahktaoui which saw him win the DFC Goal of the Season for the second year in a row.\n\nAnother highlight was defeating Rangers 2-1 in November \u2013 the second home win over the Light Blues in the calendar year and a decent post split campaign helped Dundee comfortably secure safety in the end.\n\nArticle by Kenny Ross \u2013 Kenny is the author of \u2018Dundee: Champions of Scotland 1961-62\u2019, \u2018Dundee Legends\u2019, \u2018Dundee\u2019s Hampden Heroes\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s All About the Memories\u2019.

Brad Marchand had two goals against the Hurricanes Tuesday. AP Photo/Gerry Broome\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 matchup against the Carolina Hurricanes is the NHL\u2019s newest nontraditional storyline.\n\nTuesday night, the teams combined for 75 shots, nine penalties, four power play goals and numerous shorthanded scoring chances. The game even saw Bruce Cassidy break up Boston\u2019s dynamic trio of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak.\n\nThe Bruins weathered the storm \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 and Marchand tallied two impressive goals to down the Hurricanes Tuesday night, 3-2. Here\u2019s we learned from Boston\u2019s chaotic come-from-behind victory at PNC Arena in Raleigh.\n\nIt might be Jaroslav Halak\u2019s time\n\nAfter seemingly every game, the main talking point around the Bruins is goaltender performance, and it appears that Jaroslav Halak has taken the lead over Tuukka Rask.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThis isn\u2019t as much about what Rask isn\u2019t doing, but rather about what Halak is doing.\n\nTuesday night against Carolina, the 33-year-old goaltender stood on his head, made 42 saves, and never let the Hurricanes get more than a one-goal lead when Boston\u2019s offense was struggling. Halak was up to the task for every one of Carolina\u2019s breakaway opportunities and the two goals he gave up came on the penalty kill.\n\n?WHAT A SAVE?

It is not a guarantee that he will take over sole possession of the starting role, as Boston, now 7-3-2, has enjoyed early success with a two-goalie rotation. Yet, it\u2019s hard to imagine Halak not getting the reins as Cassidy\u2019s premier netminder if both goalies continue their trajectories.\n\nBruce Cassidy isn\u2019t afraid to shake things up\n\nThe Bruins had trouble scoring goals until Pastrnak\u2019s second period power play tally. They went exactly 92 minutes and 45 seconds between Tuesday\u2019s first goal and Zdeno Chara\u2019s empty-netter against the Flyers on Oct. 25.\n\nWith the recent lack of offensive production, Cassidy showed Tuesday that he isn\u2019t afraid to shake things up. The third-year Bruins coach did the unthinkable and broke up Boston\u2019s top line \u2014 a line that has combined for 50 points this season \u2014 by assigning Pastrnak to the second line to play alongside fellow countryman David Krejci and moving Jake DeBrusk up to the first line.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Bruins netted three goals following the changes \u2014 two on the power play \u2014 but were all scored by members of the original top line so it is difficult to tell if the move had any real affect on the offensive depth and secondary scoring.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that this move is anything more than just a bandaid fix for the Bruins\u2019 early scoring woes against the Hurricanes. But it\u2019s also not hard to see Cassidy making necessary adjustments, even if it means breaking up one of the best lines in the National Hockey League.\n\nTorey Krug makes his season debut\n\nHe worked hard during his rehab from an ankle injury at training camp and skated in the last two preseason games. But another setback in the final exhibition contest kept Boston\u2019s top puck-moving defenseman out of the lineup for the first 11 games.\n\nKrug finally made his regular season debut Tuesday night. He skated alongside John Moore on the Bruins\u2019 second defensive line and picked up right where he left off quarterbacking the first power play unit.\n\nThe former Michigan State standout looked comfortable throughout his 18:03 of ice time \u2014 third-most among Bruins defensemen \u2014 and notched a key assist on Pastrnak\u2019s 11th goal of the season.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nKrug\u2019s addition into an already depleted defense that is missing Charlie McAvoy, Kevan Miller and Matt Grzelcyk is massive.

The Bruins are a perfect 5-0 on their season-long six-game homestand. Angela Spagna/Bruins Daily\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers were winless in their first four games of March when they took the ice at TD Garden on Thursday night against their archrivals. At the opposite end were the Bruins, with four straight W\u2019s \u2014 three in overtime \u2014 under their belts.\n\nThe clash marked the Black and Gold\u2019s fifth game of a six-game homestand \u2014 their longest of the season \u2014 and the first of three contests in less than 72 hours, with a matinee home-and-home series against the Blackhawks coming up this weekend.\n\nThursday saw another case of coach Bruce Cassidy shuffling all hands on deck; he welcomed goalie Tuukka Rask back from a minor lower-body injury, while forward David Backes \u2014 who was suspended three games for Tuesday\u2019s hit on Frans Nielsen of the Red Wings \u2014 joined Patrice Bergeron and Charlie McAvoy on the sidelines. Cassidy\u2019s third line ended up with Tommy Wingels in place of Backes, and Danton Heinen and Brian Gionta on the wings.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe contest that followed may not have compared to the Bruins\u2019 clashes of yesteryear against the Broad Street Bullies, but any time these teams meet, the result is usually an energy filled and highly entertaining 60 minutes. Here\u2019s what we learned from a game that produced all of that en route to a 3-2 win for Boston.\n\nMarchand notched his third straight game-winner.\n\nJust another day at the office for @Bmarch63. That\u2019s three straight games with the game-winner for the Bruins leading scorer. #NHLBruins pic.twitter.com/5lTwXMyMHC \u2014 Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) March 9, 2018\n\n\u201cHe just keeps on ticking,\u201d Cassidy said about his leading goal scorer. \u201cHe seems like he\u2019s on a bit of a mission with Bergy [Bergeron] out, that he wants to pick the team up in the offensive part of it.\u201d\n\nBrad Marchand has carried his team with three consecutive game-winners, with two coming in overtime.\n\nOn Thursday, it appeared yet another OT was coming. But in the waning seconds of the final frame, Zdeno Chara put a left-point shot on net that found David Pastrnak digging for the puck at one post. The puck squirted opposite, and Marchand needed but a single moment to win the game at 19:38 by poking home his 29th of the season.\n\n\u201cI think we all have to carry the load a bit,\u201d Marchand said after wearing the \u201cA\u201d in Bergeron\u2019s absence. \u201cI think we\u2019re all feeling that. You know, it\u2019s very hard missing a guy like [Bergeron] and McAvoy, and now Backes for a few games. It\u2019s tough to replace them, so \u2026 I think we all feel that a bit and have to step up.\u201d\n\nBruins barely capitalized on facing their second consecutive rookie goalie.\n\nForty-year-old Zdeno Chara connects with 39-year-old @Giostyle21 for this beautiful breakaway tally, Gionta\u2019s first as a Bruin ? pic.twitter.com/ybzVMzg1Yn \u2014 Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) March 9, 2018\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bruins sent Red Wings rookie goalie Jared Coreau to the bench after scoring four goals by the mid-game mark \u2013 including two on their first two shots. On Thursday, Philly\u2019s Alex Lyon was making his fourth career NHL start.\n\nLyon went the distance, keeping it a one-goal game until the final horn. He was at his best stopping three rat-a-tat Boston bids with two minutes left in the second period.\n\nBut David Pastrnak twirled 360 degrees before taking one swipe to pay dirt, and Riley Nash\u2019s second-rebound poke gave Boston its first goal at 9:14 of the first period. That goal evened the game at one apiece after Jakub Voracek had given the Flyers the lead within the first two minutes.\n\nWith 25 ticks left in the opening period, Gionta went in alone from center ice off Chara\u2019s 75-foot pass, and dropped Lyon before backhanding Boston to a 2-1 lead. The tally was Gionta\u2019s first goal and fourth point after returning to the NHL from the Winter Olympics. Call it the tallest to shortest play of the season \u2013 Chara at 6-foot-9 and Gionta at 5-foot-7.\n\n\u201cTo be able to come in and [be in] the everyday battles that go along with being an NHLer, a professional player, time and space, little plays,\u201d Cassidy listed as positives about Gionta. \u201cIt looks like he hasn\u2019t missed a beat at all.\u201d\n\nRask was active in his return.\n\nAfter missing a week with a minor lower-body injury, 2014 Vezina winner Tuukka Rask had with 31 saves in a solid outing.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cWe talked to him [about] dealing with a nagging injury,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cbut it\u2019s helped him to get back to where he needs to be, and we\u2019ll see how he recovers tomorrow. That\u2019s probably the best test; see if he\u2019s sore or just your typical game sore. I thought he did a good job.\u201d\n\nRask didn\u2019t look all that sharp on Jori Lehtera\u2019s shorthanded goal at 7:21 of the second period to tie the game at 2-2. He also had to deal with quality chances for the Flyers early, including their conversion on a double-minor to Boston\u2019s Kevan Miller (for high-sticking) in which Rask was beaten clean by Voracek for the 1-0 advantage.\n\nOtherwise, Rask produced a fairly active performance in his return to the crease.\n\n\u201cOh, it was good. It was sharp,\u201d Rask said. \u201c[I] got into the game early with the power play, a lot of shots there. Felt sharp.\u201d\n\nMcQuaid was also solid in his return.\n\nPick the top Bruin who returns seamlessly after being M.I.A., and it might well be Adam McQuaid.\n\nAfter missing 36 games with a broken leg, the veteran defenseman went back to providing his usual stay-at-home, dependable play on Jan. 17. He then played 17 of the next 18, before sitting out the last four while Bruce Cassidy got a look at newcomer Nick Holden.\n\n\u201cAdam is going to play his game,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cHe is going to be the heart; he is going to block shots. He\u2019s going to confront the opposition and stick up for his teammates, try to make the easy play. So it\u2019s not easy missing some time \u2013 long stretches \u2013 and then [coming] back in \u2026 he\u2019s working at it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMcQuaid was paired with the red-hot Torey Krug against Philadelphia, with the latter fresh off a career-high four points in Tuesday\u2019s game against Detroit. He did not disappoint, with four hits and three blocked shots in his 19:11 of ice time \u2013 including 4:03 on the penalty kill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always a big fan of Adam\u2019s kill,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to \u2026 be out there competing with the guys, to be a part of a win again. It feels good,\u201d McQuaid said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t how I would\u2019ve drew things up, or how I envisioned things going. But I\u2019m trying to put the first part \u2013 the injury \u2013 behind me and focus on where I am at now.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64092693", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Scottish Championship\n\nSimon Murray opened the scoring this afternoon as his side went top\n\nQueen's Park went top of the Scottish Championship after an entertaining 2-0 win over Partick Thistle.\n\nSimon Murray latched onto Grant Savoury's cutback for the game's opener after just five minutes.\n\nPatrick Jarrett doubled the Spiders' lead to secure the three points with 15 minutes left.\n\nIt was Partick's first loss in five games while Dundee's defeat at Arbroath allowed Owen Coyle's side to leapfrog them to the league's summit."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65643013", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Scottish\n\nScott Tiffoney celebrates his second goal at Somerset Park\n\nPartick Thistle are through to the Premiership play-off final after brushing aside 10-man Ayr United at a packed Somerset Park.\n\nLeading 3-0 from the first leg, the visitors added five more goals, Jack McMillan striking early and Scott Tiffoney doubling their lead moments after Dipo Akinyemi was sent off for an angry shove.\n\nIn the second half, McMillan set up Tiffoney's second, Stevie Lawless drilled home and Kevin Holt added a late header in a one-sided contest.\n\nThistle, who also hit eight against Queen's Park in the quarter-final, are the first team to make the final after finishing fourth in the Championship.\n\nThe first leg is at Firhill on Thursday and the Jags' scintillating form will have their top-flight opponents very concerned.\n\nRoss County and Kilmarnock, who meet at Rugby Park on Sunday, are battling to avoid 11th spot, while there is a remote chance of Dundee United hauling themselves off the bottom.\n\nA bumper crowd turned out, with the home faithful hoping for something special, but that bubble was burst on seven minutes when McMillan headed in after an Aidan Fitzpatrick shot was stopped by goalkeeper Charlie Albinson.\n\nAnd the hosts' slim hopes evaporated when top-scorer Akinyemi was dismissed for reacting to being held by Aaron Muirhead, with the defender making the most of it with a dramatic fall.\n\nThistle soon doubled their lead on the counter-attack, Tiffoney converting from Fitzpatrick's low cross.\n\nTiffoney added another goal in the 54th minute, poking in a McMillan delivery from six yards.\n\nLawless cracked in a neat reverse finish after Albinson had palmed away Holt's cross and the defender got the better of the keeper from a corner to complete the scoring.\n\n'When you're winning, your legs don't feel tired'\n\nAyr top-scorer Akinyemi was dismissed for a first-half shove on Aaron Muirhead\n\nPartick Thistle manager Kris Doolan: \"I think it's a statement of the way we want to play, of how good we can be and what's coming.\n\n\"That's how we've approached every game, we've not sat back.

Something else distinguishing them is they are all still here \u2013 \u201call above ground,\u201d as Bone phrases it \u2013 and able to tell their stories.\n\nThis is in contrast with Celtic, sadly. It seems very poignant to note that five players who featured for them that afternoon are now in the high stand. This does not even include the late Billy McNeill, who missed the game because of illness.\n\nSt Mirren captain Bone celebrates with the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1980.\n\n\u201cIt was a factor,\u201d says Bone, who ended up being team-mates with McNeill not long afterwards. \u201cBilly was such a leader for Celtic. When I joined, you immediately knew who The Man was. Billy was.\n\n\u201cHe was a leader. He made sure everything was right. On that particular day they did not have that leader. We started so well and scored the first goal they did not have anyone to go and gel and bring them back round. If Billy was playing maybe he would have calmed things down and got things sorted.\u201d\n\nMaybe. Reviewing footage of the match underlines just how irrepressible Thistle were. It really was a case of the Maryhill Magyars. Among the repercussions, Bone\u2019s abrupt sale included, was Alan Hansen helping Liverpool to three European Cups and umpteen other titles. It\u2019s said that watching his brother John taste such glory in unforgettable style convinced him to play football seriously having already shown enough promise to consider golf as a professional.\n\n\u201cOne thing we did have \u2013 when we were hot, we were really good,\u201d says Bone. \u201cAnd when we were not hot, we lost goals because we had four forwards, two wingers and two strikers, and we had two full backs \u2013 Hansen and [Alex] Forsyth \u2013 who bombed on.

They would turn up on a Saturday not knowing what to expect but they got behind the team anyway. If they got beaten, they were still there the next game anyway. If they won? It was all singing and dancing. They had a real hard core. It was a fabulous club to play for.\u201d\n\nIt seems fitting that the current Thistle are a glorious reincarnation of such freewheeling times, scoring six in their last outing, away at Hamilton Accies, four in their last home game against Ayr United and in between times losing 2-0 in the SPFL Trust trophy to Queen of the South. Ian McCall\u2019s side will wear sponsorless, 1971-style shirts today against Dunfermline.\n\nThose who originally filled them have been in demand this week of course and all of them, minus 82-year-old father of the team Hughie Strachan and Ronnie Glavin, who turned 70 earlier this year, will be in attendance at Firhill this afternoon.\n\nThey will then gather tomorrow for an anniversary lunch at the Hampden Park venue where, on October 23, 1971, they were four up before Celtic had finished their starters.\n\nJimmy Bone shows off the League Cup, 50 years on from the triumph.\n\nBone walked the fourth goal past Celtic \u2018keeper Evan Williams just 37 minutes in to send the information superhighway of the day \u2013 basically reporters spluttering into phone receivers \u2013 into meltdown. Legend has it Rangers fans swarmed to Hampden to get in on the action. And we\u2019ve all heard stories of Grandstand anchor Frank Bough reacting to the news of the half-time score from Hampden as if, well, he\u2019d just heard that Thistle were four goals up at half-time against Celtic in a cup final. Say again? \u201cWe\u2019ll get that checked,\u201d he told viewers while adjusting his earpiece.\n\nWhile it is of course unusual to be four goals up in a cup final against anyone, let alone opponents of Celtic\u2019s class, it doesn\u2019t seem outrageous for Thistle to harbour belief they had a chance. According to Bone, that\u2019s exactly how they felt. They\u2019d already beaten Rangers that season and would go onto finish seventh in an 18-team league. Hardly no-hopers.\n\n\u201cSix of that team went on to represent Scotland, and four of us went to Celtic and one, Alex Forsyth, went to Rangers as well as Man Utd.\n\n\"Roughie [Alan Rough], Gibby [Johnny Gibson], Ronnie Glavin and me went to Celtic.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n\"On that day, it was not a fluke.

We drew 0-0 with Dundee. That was a good performance, that was a right good Dundee team. Then we went to Aberdeen, we just didn\u2019t have any legs left. Everything hit us. Bang. But we recovered.\u201d\n\nBone was sold to Norwich City a couple of months later and missed out on Thistle\u2019s foray into Europe, where they lost to Hungarian side Honved \u2013 in fact, Bone wouldn\u2019t make his European debut until the grand age of 35, while at Hearts.\n\nThere was a lot to fit in before then, including locating Norwich on a map. He was part-time at the time \u2013 Bone calculated as many as three of the Thistle team against Celtic had day jobs \u2013 and so Norwich City's plan to sign him had to be relayed to Bone down a coal pit in Fallin. He had just completed an apprenticeship as an electrician.\n\n\u201cYou know, it was my first day as a tradesman,\u201d he says. \u201cI went to part-time then I had spell when I went full-time and then I thought, wait a wee minute, I have just left a trade here, I only have a matter of eight or nine months to do, so I went back part-time. When we won the cup final I was part-time \u2013 I was on night shift.\u201d\n\n\u201cJackie Campbell was also part time, Coulston and myself. We trained the Tuesday and Thursday night. I was an electrician, I worked in the mines. After I qualified, on my first day, I got the phone call to come up the pit. It was manager David McParland. He said, \u2018grab an overnight bag, you are coming to stay with me tonight. We are going down to Norwich tomorrow for talks.\u2019 In those days it was a case of you were going. We did not have the power players have now.\u201d\n\nWhile heading to Norwich hadn\u2019t been his intended career path, it was the making of him. Talk to any Canaries fan of a certain age about Bone and their eyes will mist up. While it now might seem like they are perennially yo-yoing between the Premier League and Championship, Bone helped Norwich secure promotion in the last few weeks of that same, enchanted 1971-72 season before scoring their first-ever goal in the English top-flight, against Everton.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAs now, Norwich found it hard going and manager Ron Saunders felt he needed some midfield grit. Bone was on the road again, this time to Sheffield United, in exchange for Trevor Hockey. It broke up a \"Cross-Bone\" partnership with David Cross that seemed born to be.\n\nRemarkably, the transfer took place days before Norwich were due to take part in the League Cup final against Spurs, which meant Bone, who had played in the quarter-final and semi-final wins over Arsenal and Chelsea, was denied making League Cup final appearances on either side of the Border in successive seasons.\n\nNorwich lost the final 1-0 to Spurs. Bone, meanwhile, made his debut for Sheffield United a few miles away at Highbury, scoring in a 3-2 defeat.\n\n\u201cA Scotsman called Jim Blair, formerly of Airdrie, replaced me,\u201d he reflects. \u201cHe was a completely different player to me. He was a dribbler guy whereas I had a really good partnership with a guy called David Cross. Crossy was good in the air, I was able to run onto things. Jim Blair was more about having the ball at his feet. It was a strange one.\u201d\n\nAside from playing there once, for next club Sheffield United, he has never returned to Norwich, though not through lack of trying. He is after all in their Hall of Fame and is bound to be warmly received.\n\n\u201cOne of the times I was intending to go I was at Prestwick, the flight could not go because of snow,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t at Prestwick, it was at Norwich! It never snows in Norwich!\u201d\n\nHe also had to call off from attending Musselburgh-born former skipper Duncan Forbes\u2019 funeral two years ago due to work commitments.\n\nHe will return one day because the ties are strong. It\u2019s not quite how he feels with regards Celtic, where he experienced a frustrating time after Jock Stein brought him back to Scotland after a short, productive spell at Bramall Lane, where he scored nine times in 31 league appearances. Bone just wasn\u2019t given the chance to get going in a side packed with talent, and when he did finally score a goal, in a win over Dunfermline, he was sold days later \u2013 to Arbroath.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIt\u2019s where, he says, he got his \u201csparkle\u201d back. There was something about Gayfield. Even the wind seemed to blow for him. \u201cThe ball just seemed to run for me there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas in other places it would go out of play.\u201d\n\nSt Mirren\u2019s Love Street was another place that suited him, playing in the No 10 position, with attacking players of the calibre of Doug Somner, Frank McDougall, Frank McAvennie and Billy Stark. There\u2019s a recently completed mural at the new stadium of Bone holding aloft the Anglo-Scottish Cup, won in 1980. Bone is in the Hall of Fame there, too. He left St Mirren, via two summer spells with Toronto Blizzard, to sign for Hong Kong Rangers.\n\nOn his return from the Far East, there was a message waiting for him at the airport. \u201cIt was Alex MacDonald from Hearts, wanting me to make contact \u2026\u201d\n\n********\n\nAfter all the coming and going, all the highs and the lows, all the travelling, this was the maroon shirt \u2013 no disrespect to Arbroath \u2013 that he had always really wanted to pull on.\n\nAlthough his mother was from Glasgow, her family had been Hearts. His father was Rangers and the young Jimmy \u2013 the eldest of six \u2013 went along with that just so he could see some football on a Saturday afternoon, hence why his boyhood hero was Ibrox striker Jimmy Millar.\n\nBut he kept a light burning for Hearts which is why there was a grin almost as wide as the Alexanders logo on his chest when he signed for the Tynecastle side in 1983\n\n\u201cI was also offered the chance to go to Hibs, they wanted me to do some coaching as well. I said no because I wanted to play for as long as I could. And also, well, I am a bit of a Jambo.\u201d\n\nHe quickly became a part of the scenery. According to John Robertson, one room in the old Tynecastle main stand was christened \u201cJimmy Bone\u2019s tea room\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n\u201cTo be fair it was not just Jimmy Bone\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was Jimmy Bone and Willie Johnston\u2019s tea room. The manager was Alex MacDonald, the assistant was Sandy Jardine, and there was me and Willie Johnston. The papers would give it: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Dad\u2019s army..\u2019\n\n\u201cSo if any of the young boys were stepping out of line, me and Bud we would ask them to come and see us in the \u2018tea room\u2019. \u2018Why should we not go and tell the manager\u2019, it was that kind of stuff.\n\n\u201cThere would be a knock on the door, and we would say: \u2018why do you think you should come in here? And we\u2019d say, \u2018ok you have a cup of tea\u2019, or it was a case of \u2018nah, you spoke back to one of the experienced players, you have not shown enough respect,\u2019 and we would throw them out.\u201d\n\nIt was undeniably old school but Hearts youngsters such as Robertson seemed to benefit from this treatment, bunking up with Bone \u2013 who he stills refers to as \u201cDa\u2019\u201d \u2013 on way trips. The pair remain close. Sandy Clark was Bone's more than decent replacement, but who knows, things might have been different had the veteran still been around to come on and save the day in the final league game of the 1985/86 season.\n\n\u201cI was actually coaching in Zambia,\u201d he recalls. He listened to the Dens Park denouement in the toilet. \u201cIt was the only place I could get reception!\u201d He mimics holding a crackling radio against his ear. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not quite as crazy as what happened 50 years ago today. However one judges it, Bone\u2019s lived a life \u2013 and is still going strong.\n\nA message from the Editor: Thank you for reading this article.

I don\u2019t know why but I did. I knew exactly how long was left when Dalglish scored. Someone said it was 21 minutes but I told them it was 22!\n\n\u201cI actually wasn\u2019t too busy in the second half and it is a tragedy we can\u2019t see the 90 minutes of that match again. We only have 15 or 20 minutes of highlights.\n\n\u201cWe played as well in the second half as we didn\u2019t in the first half and we didn\u2019t have another few chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do have a lasting memory of the second half just right at the start we could have scored another couple.\n\n\u201cI think Denis McQuade was through and I think Evan Williams had a tremendous save, so we weren\u2019t on the back foot by any manner of means, I think we handled the game quite well.\u201d\n\nPartick Thistle celebrate with the League Cup after the Jags stunning win over Celtic in 1971. Picture: Contributed\n\nRough described Jags boss McParland as a \u201cfather figure\u201d to him and believes that was the main reason Stein decided to bring him to Celtic as his assistant manager at the start of the 1976/77 season.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou have to remember, I think there were four of us that were only 18 or 19, four of us had just played our first-team games in a season in the lower divisions so he was like Jock Stein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that is probably why Jock took him to Celtic, I think Jock saw a lot in Davie McParland in himself in his younger career and basically he was a father figure, he watched what you were doing, he was always on top of you if you weren\u2019t toing the line, that kind of thing.\n\n\u201cTactical-wise you just have to look at the formation we played, 4-2-4, it was two full-backs attacking, four forwards, and that is the way we played and that was his philosophy of how we should be playing.\u201d\n\nRough earned 53 caps for the national team, the majority coming under Stein\u2019s tenure, and he still remembers vividly the ribbing he received from Scottish football\u2019s greatest ever manager.\n\nHe reckons the biggest advantage Thistle had ahead of the Cup Final was the absence of centre-back Billy McNeil from the Celtic side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRough admitted: \u201cAll the time, he used to wind me up by saying it was \u2018just a one off\u2019, \u2018we felt sorry for yous\u2019 and all that carry-on, but I said, \u2018aye that will be shining bright\u2019.\n\n\u201cFor me I think one of the biggest factors of that was game was Billy McNeill not playing, and I spoke to big Billy, unfortunately he has passed away now, and he was sad he missed that game as well.\n\n\u201cI thought he was a mainstay in their team and it was a bonus for us I think he got injured before that game.\n\n\u201cIt has become almost mythical because for provincial clubs like us, these days don\u2019t come around very often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSt Johnstone were a perfect example last season and it is something you hang on to. The fact we beat Celtic in the final also makes it that bit extra special even 50 years on.\u201d\n\nJock Stein on the pitch at Elland Road after being appointed Leeds United's new manager in August 1978.\n\nRemarkably, every member of Thistle\u2019s 71\u2019 squad are still around and will attend Firhill this afternoon when Ian McCall\u2019s side take on bottom of the table Dunfermline.\n\nRough is hopeful the Jags can mark the occasion with a victory that would be sure to put a lot of smiles on people\u2019s faces.\n\n\u201cIt would be fantastic,\u201d he stated. \u201cI think obviously Dunfermline will be a different Dunfermline to who we played in the first game of the season, obviously we\u2019d like to carry on the Hamilton result which was fantastic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt would just be a great start to the weekend, but nothing is predictable and I\u2019m sure Ian (McCall) and the boys will have that in the back of their mind that it would make a lot of people happy if they could pull it off.\n\n\u201cIt will be a great day and if you mingle around our supporters there are still some who were at that game. Hopefully, there are plenty others who have heard about and will turn out in their numbers.\n\n\u201cEverybody in our team is still alive, unfortunately in the Celtic team there are some legends who are no longer with us.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t have great memories of that day, but I am sure if they were still here, they would be talking about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI remember as soon as those 90 minutes finished in the cup final, the first thing was every Celtic player to a man came over and congratulated us, there was no walking off the park or anything like that.\n\n\u201cI think they appreciated what we had done, which I just think is a great thing for a team like Celtic to do.\n\n\u201cBut it is a tragedy that some of the Celtic boys aren\u2019t here because they are big, big legends at their club\u201d\n\nRough has been monitoring the progress of current Thistle keeper Jamie Sneddon, who continues to impress between the sticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSneddon is a product of Hearts youth system and the former Scotland legend has tipped the 24-year-old to have a big future in the game.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think he\u2019s improved year on year. He has obviously had to fight for his place, which is a good thing as well.\n\n\u201cThe manager had a decision at the beginning of the season who to go with and in fairness he gave both of them a shot.

The new fan ownership group will be similar to Motherwell's Well Society.\n\nWeir, who had previously invested significantly in Thistle and its Academy said: \"Thistle for Ever (TfE) planted the thought of fan ownership as a real option in my mind.\n\n\"From there, TBC has taken the dream and is turning it in to a reality. But this has all happened quicker than anyone might have anticipated.\n\n\"That's why I have offered a three to four month window for fans to get everything in place before handing over shares.\n\n\"They want to get it right and I want to be sure that when the new entity is operational, there is a structure that will allow for a smooth transfer of ownership.\n\n\"This is a major financial commitment on my part as fan owners will not need to repay a penny - but I believe this gives fan ownership the best possible start.\n\n\"Today is a great day for a Club that means everything to me. I hope that fans can get behind this exciting development.

With the sides level into additional time of the first half, City took the lead to deal a sucker punch to Thistle. Bea Prades with a fine strike from the edge of the box after it fell kindly for the Spanish midfielder.\n\nWith less than an hour played, City found the final goal despite the best efforts of Megan Cunningham in the Partick Thistle net. It looked like she'd done enough by denying Linda Motlhalo from close range but the SWPL top goalscorer, Lauren Davidson, was on hand to fire home for her 24th goal in the league.\n\nThe result means Glasgow City remain top of the table, two points clear of Celtic, and Partick Thistle continue to occupy sixth. City host Hibernian on Wednesday while Thistle are away to Heart of Midlothian.\n\nCeltic 3-0 Hibernian\n\nCeltic kept pace at the top of the Park's Motor Group SWPL with a comfortable victory over Hibernian at the Excelsior Stadium.\n\nImage: Celtic ran out 3-0 winners over Hibernian\n\nIt was unlikely we'd see a repeat scoreline from the opening day of the season when Celtic were 9-0 winners, but they started fast with the opener after just 18 minutes. Former Hibee, Amy Gallacher, with a fine finish to take her top of Celtic's goalscoring charts in the league. Gallacher then turned provider with 40 minutes played, whipping in a corner for Chloe Craig to finish at the back post.\n\nWithin moments of the restart, Celtic increased their lead. Natasha Flint was alert to intercept the Hibs pass before finishing off for her fourth goal in her last three SWPL matches.\n\nCeltic remain two points behind Glasgow City and face Rangers, live on Sky Sports, this Thursday in what could be a monumental match for both sides' title chances. Hibernian are fifth and four points clear of Partick Thistle.\n\nRangers 1-1 Heart of Midlothian\n\nRangers were denied by a late Hearts penalty as they moved behind the top two in the battle for the Park's Motor Group SWPL trophy. It adds extra pressure on Malky Thomson's side for Thursday's clash with Celtic, live on Sky Sports, likely a must-win if Rangers are to retain their title.\n\nHearts are the only side outside of the top two to have taken any points against Rangers coming into the game, a 0-0 draw at Oriam back in January.\n\nThe opening goal of the game came with 37 minutes on the clock as Sam Kerr grabbed her fifth goal in her last four SWPL matches. The Scotland midfielder created the goal after driving into the opposition box, finding Kirsty Howat before it bounced back kindly for Kerr to smash home.\n\nIt looked set that Rangers would clinch all three points and keep pace at the top, but Hannah Davison conceded a penalty nearly three minutes into additional time for a foul on Cailin Michie. Former Rangers midfielder, Ciara Grant stepped up and smashed the ball home at the death.\n\nRangers are now five points behind Glasgow City and three behind Celtic ahead of Thursday's match. Hearts remain fourth, nine points clear of Hibernian with five games left to play.\n\nHamilton Academical 1-1 Dundee United\n\nHamilton Accies and Dundee United shared the spoils at New Douglas Park, leaving them five points apart with five games remaining. The result favours Dundee United who are in 10th and just outside the relegation play-off spot.\n\nDanni McGinley got the opening goal for United, her 13th in the league this season, after eight minutes. The United forward hammered her free-kick low and with enough power to pass Chloe Nicolson in goals.\n\nOne of Accies' star players, Josi Giard, was without a goal in her last seven matches before today and her strike could be vital for Accies avoiding the relegation play-off. The German forward's ball towards goal was from a tight angle and was parried in by Fiona McNicoll in the United goal.\n\nHamilton are away to Motherwell on Wednesday in the Lanarkshire derby while Dundee United travel to Spartans.\n\nAberdeen 0-2 Motherwell\n\nMotherwell maintained their 100 per cent record against Aberdeen this season with another comfortable victory up North.\n\nThe away side took the lead just before the half-time whistle thanks to the in-form Tiree Burchill. The loanee's strike from distance beating her Celtic team-mate, India Marwaha, to give Motherwell the lead and her fifth goal in her last five SWPL matches.\n\nThe final goal came with just under an hour played through Louisa Boyes as the Dons gave away possession in their own box with the Motherwell forward capitalising.\n\nThe result keeps Motherwell seventh as they battle to finish top of the bottom six since the split. They host the Lanarkshire derby against Hamilton Academical on Wednesday. Aberdeen remain eight points clear of the relegation play-off ahead their midweek home match against relegated Glasgow Women.\n\nGlasgow Women 0-1 Spartans\n\nGlasgow Women were relegated from the Park's Motor Group SWPL after falling to their 27th defeat of the season. They had earned promotion to the top division on the last day of the 2021/22 season but have so far failed to get a point.\n\nDespite a battling performance, Spartans prevailed to maintain their unbeaten run in April with three wins and one draw. The only goal of the game came from Mya Bates after seven minutes played. On her 18th birthday, Bates blasted home after the cutback from Caley Gibb.\n\nSpartans remain eighth, two points behind Motherwell in the battle for seventh.
