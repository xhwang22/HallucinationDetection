{"David Kappos served until February 2013.": [{"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J. Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

Kappos, the departing director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the second time the law firm has added a former senior Obama administration official to its partnership.\n\nMr. Kappos, a former senior lawyer at I.B.M., served for three and a half years as head of the patent office. He has received widespread praise for making the country\u2019s outdated intellectual property system more efficient and improving patent quality. He left his post at the end of last week and joined Cravath on Wednesday.\n\nThe move is a coup for the law firm, which plans to use Mr. Kappos\u2019s expertise to advise clients on intellectual property issues related to big corporate mergers as well as to assist in high-stakes patent and trademark disputes.\n\n\u201cWe were convinced Dave would not only significantly enhance our ability to serve our clients\u2019 needs, but also fit into \u2014 and even enhance \u2014 the culture of our firm,\u201d said C. Allen Parker, Cravath\u2019s presiding partner.\n\nThe culture issue is an important one for Cravath, which rarely hires partners from outside the firm. Mr. Kappos is only the fourth outside partner in a half-century. Yet he is the second high-ranking government lawyer recently hired by Cravath. Christine A. Varney, the White House\u2019s former top antitrust lawyer, joined the firm in August 2011.\n\nCravath\u2019s strategy in recruiting Mr. Kappos and Ms. Varney goes beyond hiring top-flight legal talent, and speaks to the increasing importance of government policy to corporate America.\n\nThe firm is somewhat unusual in that, other than a small London office, it houses all its 439 lawyers in New York. Such proximity, Cravath\u2019s management believes, reinforces esprit de corps.\n\nToday, having a physical presence in Washington is considered a must for nearly every large law firm. Cravath, however, has a strategy of adding lawyers like Ms. Varney and Mr. Kappos, moving them to New York but benefiting from their vast Washington contacts.\n\nFounded in 1819, Cravath has deep roots in patent law. In the 19th century, the firm handled the electric light bulb patent litigation for Thomas Edison and the telegraph patent litigation for Samuel Morse.\n\nToday, it serves as the primary outside counsel for the telecommunications company Qualcomm and has litigated numerous drug patent cases for pharmaceutical giants like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis.\n\nThough Mr. Kappos, 51, has never worked at Cravath, he is no stranger to the firm: he worked for 26 years at I.B.M., one of Cravath\u2019s most important and longstanding clients. Mr. Kappos served in a variety of roles at I.B.M., working first as an engineer and then as a lawyer. From 2003 to 2009, he was the company\u2019s assistant general counsel for intellectual property.\n\nIn Washington, Mr. Kappos, who earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley, took over a patent office that had failed to keep up with technology and the advent of the digital age.\n\n\u201dThere is no company I know of that would have permitted its information technology to get into the state we\u2019re in,\u201d Mr. Kappos said in a 2011 interview with The New York Times. \u201dIf it had, the C.E.O. would have been fired, the board would have been thrown out, and you would have had shareholder lawsuits.\u201d\n\nHe put in place substantial changes and was instrumental in the passage of the America Invents Act, patent legislation that, among other things, created a new process for challenging issued patents. The measure, legal experts say, is helping to curb the number of frivolous patents. Large technology companies have long complained about overly broad patents and \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d whose business is buying patents and filing infringement lawsuits seeking royalties.\n\n\u201cI think Dave joining Cravath is a marriage made in heaven,\u201d said Donald J. Rosenberg, the general counsel of Qualcomm, who spent three decades at I.B.M. where he worked closely with Mr. Kappos. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for the country but a real gain for Qualcomm and the firm\u2019s other clients.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/david-kappos", "page_content": "David J.

Kappos will be remembered for guiding the America Invents Act through Congress and an intense focus on practical implementation of the new provisions. Kappos has pushed a paradigm shift that focuses on mechanisms for improving patent quality by working with applicants rather than against applicants. This approach and his understanding of the business of patent law has allowed Kappos to remain well respected amongst patent attorneys and intellectual property professionals throughout a turbulent four year term.\n\nIn an effort to eliminate the patent prosecution backlog, Kappos has led the charge to greatly increase the number of patent examiners over the past two years. During this time, the number of examiners has swelled to over 8,000 \u2013 a more than 30% increase from two years before.
