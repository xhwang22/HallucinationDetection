That\u2019s the short story of Alana Davis who released two great pop songs in 1997 on her debut album titled Blame It On Me. Then promptly disappeared.\n\nThe first song to chart was \u201c32 Flavors,\u201d a cover of Ani DiFranco\u2019s most famous song (and by saying it\u2019s famous that means every Ani DiFranco fan knows it and virtually no one else). It\u2019s an exceptionally well-written song with evocative lyrics.\n\nClick to read 32 Flavors lyrics\n\nBut it\u2019s the melody and the phrasing that gets me. You can completely ignore the lyrics yet get sucked into listening to the song again and again and again, which is what I did with Davis\u2019 version of \u201c32 Flavors\u201d back in 1997. It was hooky, catchy and brilliant enough to shine through the rest of the radio hits at the time and reach #37 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\u201cCrazy\u201d was the follow-up single. While I was initially more koo koo for \u201cCrazy,\u201d time has proven \u201c32 Flavors\u201d the more enduring song. Although the pre-chorus/bridge of \u201cCrazy\u201d is still a brilliant piece of songwriting.\n\nThe entire Blame It On Me album is a completely agreeable (some might say forgettable) record. Davis has a soulful, endearing voice. But the world soon forgot about Davis and today, few people know her name. But you should know her version of \u201c32 Flavors.\u201d It\u2019s a great cover of a wonderful folk song that deservedly became a pop one-hit wonder.\n\nListen to \u201c32 Flavors\u201d\n\nListen to Ani DiFranco\u2019s original version of \u201c32 Flavors\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/2431865-Alana-Davis-32-Flavors", "page_content": "Limited Edition.

Both DiFranco and her music can be described as punk, honest, powerful, unapologetic, and at times, even jarring. DiFranco launched her music career at the age of 14. Four years later, she started her own label, Righteous Babe Records, which has allowed her to answer to no one but herself.\n\nAlthough she has enjoyed some commercial success with songs featured in major movies, DiFranco is an indie artist at heart. Constant college tours built her a following from the ground up, and even as her music eventually reached the masses through magazine exposure and coverage on MTV and VH1, she stayed true to herself and her fanbase by remaining on her own label, which became successful enough to sign other artists such as Andrew Bird.\n\nDiFranco\u2019s music also embodies her commitment to social activism. Her lyrics are raw, often blunt, and she uses both her art and her platform to support causes she believes in. Most important, DiFranco offers an unabashed honesty in her music, and her fans feel connected through her intimate revelations. With all these qualities in mind, here are the 11 best Ani DiFranco songs.\n\n11. \u201cSwan Dive\u201d\n\nNestled in the second half of DiFranco\u2019s ninth studio album, Little Plastic Castle, \u201cSwan Dive\u201d is a slow and uneasy build up to a steady beat. The staccato introduction that repeats throughout the verses holds its own in contrast to the regularity of the chorus. DiFranco\u2019s rhythmic push/pull, which mimics the lyrical dynamics, creates a palpable tension that leaves the listener cheering for the narrator, while also worrying for her safety. As DiFranco sings, \u201cGravity is nothing to me, I\u2019m moving at the speed of sound, I\u2019m just going to get my feet wet, until I drown,\u201d one wonders if she needs permission to fly or someone to protect her from herself.\n\n10. \u201cShameless\u201d\n\n\u201cShameless\u201d appears on DiFranco\u2019s seventh and most critically acclaimed album, Dilate. When she wrote and recorded this song in 1996, bisexuality was hardly recognized, let alone discussed in pop music. Her lyrics as always are unapologetic, and the driving beat and almost-growling delivery of the words let the listener know that DiFranco is not interested in anyone\u2019s opinions or criticism. As she sings about coveting another man\u2019s wife, she delivers the lines, \u201cJust please don\u2019t name this / Please don\u2019t explain this / Just blame it all on me / Say I was shameless.\u201d Ever the outsider, DiFranco offers no apologies for herself and doesn\u2019t feel she owns anyone. This song inspired many of her contemporaries and successors to follow suit.\n\n9. \u201cAs Is\u201d\n\nWhile DiFranco has a strong and gritty voice, she also has a softer, melodic side that shines on this track from Little Plastic Castle. The accompaniment is stripped down to acoustic guitar with light percussion and brush drums, underscoring a simple message of acceptance. Lest anyone think this song is proof that DiFranco has lost her edge, as she sweetly sings about catching her beloved in a lie, she dips back into a direct and cutting lyric: \u201cJust give up and admit you\u2019re an asshole / You would be in some good company.\u201d Her almost breathy delivery shows a more vulnerable side of her voice that reminds the listener that DIFranco is still as human as ever.\n\n8. \u201cGarden of Simple\u201d\n\nIn 2001, DiFranco released the double album Revelling/Reckoning. \u201cGarden of Simple\u201d the third track, opens with a syncopated guitar melody, played with one of DiFranco\u2019s alternate tunings, that allows her to provide a bass line without featuring any other instruments. The double album is mostly acoustic and full of socially conscious narratives, including this retelling of a dream. All of the lyrics are written lower case, much like an E. E. Cummings poem, and while DiFranco\u2019s signature voice conveys deeply personal lyrics, the double album looks beyond interpersonal relationships and offer her fears for the planet and society. She sings, \u201cScience chases money and money chases its tail / And the best minds of my generation can\u2019t make bail.\u201d Revelling/Reckoning was released in April, just five months before September 11, and one can\u2019t help but marvel at how prescient they really were.\n\n7. \u201cAngry Anymore\u201d\n\nThis sweet American anthem opens with a melodic banjo tune that carries throughout the entire song. Sandwiched between the psychedelic \u201cAngel Food\u201d and the torch song \u201cEverest\u201d on DiFranco\u2019s 1999 album, Up Up Up Up Up Up, \u201cAngry Anymore\u201d provides an uptempo inspiration to understand the motivations of those who raised us and to help us let go of our youthful baggage. DiFranco appears to side with her father in these lyrics, which would give any mother pause to hear: \u201cBut now I\u2019ve seen both my parents / Play out the hands they were dealt / And as each year goes by / I know more about how my father must have felt.\u201d\n\n6. \u201c32 Flavors\u201d\n\nMany came to know DiFranco\u2019s music through Alana Davis\u2019 cover of this song in 1997. But while it gave DiFranco more mainstream success than her previous work, the constraints of pop radio forced Davis to jettison some of DiFranco\u2019s more poignant verses. Conversely, Davis added her own chorus when she recorded the song, and isn\u2019t typically credited with the changes. Without the original recording, one misses these goose bump-inducing lines: \u201cAnd god help you if you are a phoenix / And you dare to rise up from the ash / A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy / While you are just flying past.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cGravel\u201d\n\nFirst recorded for Little Plastic Castle , subsequently recorded live on Living In Clip , and eventually included on the retrospective 2007 album, Canon, \u201cGravel\u201d is the quintessential DiFranco song\u2014uneasy, aggressive, and punctuated, while still anthemic. Once again, the listener is torn between cheering her on or warning her against doing something foolish as she sings, \u201cYou were never a good lay / And you were never a good friend / But oh, what can I say / I adore you.\u201d In youth one may lean toward cheering, but older listeners beg her to send the motorcyclist on his merry way.\n\n4. \u201cDilate\u201d\n\nThe title track from DiFranco\u2019s seventh studio album utilizes one of her alternate tunings, allowing her to slap bass notes while maintaining arpeggiated guitar chords. In spite of being the title track of her 1996 LP, DiFranco uses the word \u201cdilate\u201d exactly one time in the lyrics. While dilate typically means to make larger, the less-frequently used definition refers to speaking at length, which is precisely what DiFranco does here. She packs an impressive number of words into four and a half minutes, while detailing why being alone is preferable to being with someone who constantly disappoints you. \u201cI see you and I\u2019m so unsatisfied. I see you and I dilate.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cUntouchable Face\u201d\n\nThe opening track to Dilate must be quite a shock for a first-time listener. As the melodic and bittersweet lyrics begin, DiFranco details unrequited love, \u201cThink I\u2019m going for a walk now / I feel a little unsteady / I don\u2019t want no one to follow me /Except maybe you,\u201d no one could possibly anticipate the similarly phrased yet jarring interjection of the chorus: \u201cSo fuck you, and your untouchable face / Fuck you, for existing in the first place.\u201d After the initial surprise wears off, however, the listener is aware that this is classic DiFranco. It\u2019s startling to untested ears, but perfectly consistent with the folk singer\u2019s message.\n\n2. \u201cShy\u201d\n\nFrom DiFranco\u2019s sixth studio album, Not a Pretty Girl, which continued her pattern of using only guitar and percussion, \u201cShy\u201d is an unnerving track that stokes anxiety as it increases in intensity. DiFranco\u2019s guitar skills are evident, particularly in the chorus, and she is known to break strings while playing this song. The lyrics detail morning-after regret, transporting the listener to a dingy hotel room. She sings, \u201cThe sheets are twisted and damp / Well the heat is so great,\u201d and you could easily break a sweat just by listening."}, {"url": "https://www.jiosaavn.com/song/32-flavors/PxwFSD9qQ1g", "page_content": "32 Flavors is a english song released in 1997.\n\n32 Flavors is a english song released in 1997.\n\nWhich album is the song 32 Flavors from?\n\n32 Flavors is a english song from the album Blame It On Me.\n\n32 Flavors is a english song from the album Blame It On Me."}, {"url": "https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dtompkin/music/track/POBO1997_002/POBO1997_002-17.html", "page_content": "Squint your eyes and look closer\n\nI'm not between you and your ambition\n\nI am a poster girl with no poster\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\n\n\nSquint your eyes and look closer\n\nI'm not between you and your ambition\n\nI am a poster girl with no poster\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\n\n\nAnd I'm beyond your peripheral vision\n\nSo you might want to turn your head\n\nCause someday you're going to get hungry\n\nAnd eat all of the words that you just said\n\n\n\nI am what I am I am 32 flavors and then some\n\n\n\nGod help you if you are an ugly girl\n\nCourse too pretty is also your doom\n\nCause everyone harbors a secret hatred\n\nFor the prettiest girl in the room\n\nGod help you if you are a phoenix\n\nAnd you dare to rise up from the ash\n\nA thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy while\n\nYou are just flying past.\n\n\n\nI am what I am\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm taking my chances as they come\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI am nobody but I am someone\n\nSomeone\n\n\n\nI'd never try to give my life meaning by\n\nDemeaning you\n\nAnd I would like to state for the record\n\nI did everything that I could do\n\n\n\nI am beyond your peripheral vision\n\nSo you might want to turn your head\n\nCause someday you're going to be starving\n\nAnd eating all of the words that you just said\n\nThat you said\n\n\n\nI am what I am I am what I am\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm taking my chances as they come\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm looking for truth but there is none\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'll never forget where I came from\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm nobody but I am someone\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm taking my chances as they come\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nLooking for truth and there is none"}, {"url": "https://www.spin.com/2023/04/righteous-babe-our-1997-ani-difranco-cover-story/", "page_content": "This story was originally published in the August 1997 issue of SPIN.\n\nWith stardom just a compromise away, Ani DiFranco chides her fans, goofs on the media, and wishes major labels would get the bleep off her answering machine. Jonathan Van Meter uncovers the essential brattiness of folk\u2019s great white hope.\n\nTonight in Knoxville, Ani DiFranco is onstage at the Tennessee Theater doing one of the two things she does best: talking. She is talking to her audience, her fans, and, oh, what fanatics they are. Pierced, tattooed, obsessed, sexually ambiguous, passionate, young, noisy, bossy, possessive, and demanding. DiFranco\u2019s hair is dyed magenta, her T-shirt is orange, her skintight latex pants are electric lime green. She has never performed here before, and whenever she plays a new town\u2014what her manager calls \u201cbreaking in a new market\u201d\u2014it feels a little bit like she\u2019s gone back in time a couple of years, when her audiences were mostly women. New markets always bring out the original, hardcore fans: the dykes.\n\nIn a few minutes she will start doing the other thing she does best: making music. She will sing a new song, a song that she\u2019s just recently written. A song that goes, in part, like this:\n\nFrom the shape of your shaved head\n\nI recognized your silhouette\n\nAs you walked out of the sun and sat down\n\nAnd the sight of your sleepy smile\n\nEclipsed all other people\n\nAs they paused to sneer at the two girls\n\nFrom out of town\n\nThe dykes in the audience will love this song. They will feel validated by it, and why not? It\u2019s classic Ani DiFranco. Who else writes songs about sleepy, smiling, bald-headed girls in a coffee shop, in a small town, getting hostile glances from the locals?\n\nThe dykes will feel that this song is about them. What\u2019s not clear, though, is if they will follow the song to its slightly irritated conclusion, and realize that it is, quite literally, a song about them.\n\nPeople talk\n\nAbout my image\n\nLike I come in two dimensions\n\nLike lipstick is a sign of my declining mind\n\nLike what I happen to be wearing\n\nThe day that someone takes a picture\n\nIs my statement for all womankind\u2026\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. She hasn\u2019t sung this song yet. She\u2019s still talking. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl vibe! It\u2019s, like, a pitch thing!\u201d She does an imitation of the roar of a mixed-gender crowd versus the roar of a girl crowd.\n\nThen she singles out a guy in the front row. \u201cYou are a brave man. There is, like, one fucking sensitive, beautiful, brave man in this audience.\u201d Someone shouts out, \u201cMen are pigs!\u201d And DiFranco brings the proceedings to a grinding halt.\n\n\u201cOne thing I hate...,\u201d she says, quietly seething. The room falls silent. Her voice rises an octave and into the tone, if not the syntax, of a grade-school teacher admonishing her pupils. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really nice to be, like, in the groove of a girl vibe, because there\u2019s a feeling of strength, but I so want there to be a feeling of inclusion. There\u2019s a lot of sad shit that goes down in my songs, that goes down in my world and my life, but I never think of it as an us-versus-them situation.\u201d\n\nThe energy has been sucked right out of the room. A few songs later, she talks some more. \u201cI was in New York at a traumatic photo shoot. They kind of go from mildly traumatic to absolutely devastating. It always starts with a dress.\u201d\n\nShe imitates a gay male stylist. \u201c\u2018Oh, you would look exquisite in this!\u2019 I put it on, and it\u2019s see-through. And I\u2019m, like, \u2018Uhm\u2026uhm\u2026I don\u2019t think I can wear this.\u2019 Then they were trying to get me to wear pants and just my bra. And I\u2019m, like, \u2018Uhm\u2026uhm\u2026.'\u201d She fiddles with her guitar, pauses for effect. \u201cIt was Jugs magazine, so don\u2019t know why I was fighting it.\u201d\n\nThe audience roars with laughter and, finally, the bond, the connection, the love, returns.\n\nThe next day, in a rock club in Birmingham, Alabama, DiFranco is hanging out in her dressing room with candles burning all around her, all the lights off, waiting for showtime. It occurs to me that in addition to the pressure from the image-making machinery to wear see-through gowns, Ani DiFranco is getting the exact opposite pressure from the other end of the spectrum: the dyke fans and the gender-identity political freaks who feel betrayed if she isn\u2019t wearing pants\u2014like lipstick is a sign of her declining mind.\n\nWhen I share this thought she lets loose with frustration and defensiveness. \u201cLike I\u2019m supposed to have hammered out this niche for myself now. I\u2019m the stompy-booted, sort of butchy, Go-Girl Folkstress, and I\u2019m supposed to just roll with that like I\u2019m a caricature of myself\u2026. People try to turn me into my fans. I was thinking that again last night when that chick yelled out, \u2018Men are pigs.\u2019 I was thinking, \u2018You are why they stereotype me.\u2019 All my life I\u2019ve been the angry, man-hating, puppy-eating, hairy, homely, feminist bitch!\u201d\n\nShe runs out of steam, trails off, and looks down, as if slightly embarrassed by the spew of her frustration. \u201cSo I guess\u2026yeah, I cannot be a caricature. But a lot of my fans do want it simple, they want it easy. And when I insist on my own stupid personality quirks it can be offensive to them.\u201d\n\nOutside, fans are gathering, perhaps a couple hundred, waiting to be let in. DiFranco goes to surprisingly great lengths to avoid contact with her fans. She wants to go for a walk before taking the stage tonight, so she does her best to cover up all visible quirks by wearing a plain brown pair of Dickies and a baggy blue sweatshirt. She jerks the hood up and heads out the stage door, into the parking lot, and right past them. A clean getaway.\n\nNot since Bob Dylan plugged in his electric guitar have a group of fans been so freaked by an artist\u2019s evolution. Since 1990 (when, at the age of 20, she released her first album, Ani DiFranco, on her own label, Righteous Babe Records), the tiny, 5\u20193\u2033 DiFranco has been at the center of a cult of personality that has slowly grown to epic proportions. She has, quite simply, created a monster.\n\nAfter several homespun, self-produced releases, filled with overtly political, often funny, sometimes brilliant, and distinctly old-school feminist songs, DiFranco reached her own apotheosis with the 1995 release Not a Pretty Girl (which has sold 112,000 copies). The title track reads like a mission statement for young feminists everywhere. One fan I encountered\u2014a member of a white girl-gang from Oregon\u2014told me that \u201c32 Flavors,\u201d another track, was their team fight song. And then\u2026.\n\nAni DiFranco met a guy, fell in love, grew her hair out, and became a pretty girl. She even started wearing dresses and lipstick occasionally. Every song on her next album, Dilate, explored the contours of this new relationship: love, love/hate, hate. The album garnered her best reviews and sales to date (it entered the Billboard charts at No. 89 and has sold 174,000 copies), and suddenly DiFranco didn\u2019t belong just to the dykes and the feminists any longer.\n\nRIGHTEOUS BABE AN INDIE SUCCESS STORY: ANI DIFRANCO\u2019S LABEL RISES UP FROM THE GRASS ROOTS. This was the headline on the cover of Billboard, April 12, 1997. After seven years of being her own boss and touring ceaselessly around the country, after seven years of building a rabidly loyal fan base through playing small bars, coffeehouses, college campuses, and folk festivals, after seven years of the best grassroots word-of-mouth since Bruce Springsteen played the Stone Pony, Ani DiFranco suddenly popped up on the radar screen of popular culture.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t so much that her music finally caught fire with a larger audience, or that her potent, confessional lyrics had at once connected to the mainstream. It was that she was making more money per unit sold than Hootie & the Blowfish. And the story had legs. Both the Wall Street Journal and Time magazine weighed in on the subject. DiFranco found herself in the surreal position of sitting behind a desk on the Financial News Network being asked to prattle on about profit margins. Forbes magazine even got the Artist Formerly Known as Prince\u2014the major-label \u201cSlave\u201d himself, and perhaps the only person alive who cranks out more music than DiFranco\u2014on the blower for a comment. \u201cI love Ani DiFranco,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s making four dollars a record and the superstars are making two dollars, so who\u2019s got the better deal?\u201d\n\nThe music and alternative press have been lavishing praise on DiFranco\u2019s music for a few years now, but since her last two releases have cracked the Billboard charts\u2014this year\u2019s double live album Living in Clip debuted at No. 59\u2014the focus has shifted. \u201cNow, suddenly, I\u2019m a brilliant strategist,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere I used to be this stupid girl with too much \u2018tude for her own good, who is cutting off her nose to spite her face and the music industry. And everybody would say, \u2018You\u2019re selling thousands of albums, but you could be selling millions of albums, and we can help you. Don\u2019t you want people to hear your music?\u2019 And it was like\u2026.\u201d She does an imitation of Charlie Brown\u2019s teacher. \u201cWah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah.\u201d\n\nOne of those people was Danny Goldberg, president and CEO of Mercury Records. He once bragged to a reporter that Righteous Babe Records never returned his calls. When I talk to him about DiFranco, he is quick to put me in my place when I suggest that what she is doing, from a business standpoint, is unique.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s reinventing the wheel,\u201d he says, a bit defensively. \u201cFugazi did the same thing. Bad Religion did it for years. It\u2019s part of her PR shtick that she has her own label and she makes more per unit on it, and feels more in control of it. I find that less interesting. A lot of people have indie labels. There are very few artists like Ani DiFranco. If she wasn\u2019t a good artist and she had her own label, who\u2019d give a shit?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that Goldberg, the man credited with transforming Nirvana from a local Seattle band into a worldwide phenomenon, would miss the larger significance of DiFranco\u2019s fierce independence. If we are to believe the mythology of Kurt Cobain\u2019s suicide\u2014drug addiction and depression notwithstanding\u2014part of what pushed him to the edge was that he was embarrassed to be a rock star. At a time when independence is worn as a mask (witness this year\u2019s Oscars), and when otherwise smart, talented people sell their art down the river on a daily basis, DiFranco seems to stand alone. It takes a mighty will to resist the constant call of corporations when they come along with cash, limos, and the promise to make you a star. Hardly anyone ever says no. Ani DiFranco has been saying no to every single major label, week in and week out, for a couple of years now. \u201cThey don\u2019t have anything I want,\u201d she says.\n\nI ask DiFranco about the call of the music industry. \u201cWhy conquer the world?\u201d she shoots back. \u201cI was thinking about that band today\u2014one of those new, white, blond, 14- year-old bands. Hanson? No, not them. Radish. Some young, young boy. Here you have a kid that can maybe hold a tune, can write verse-chorus-verse, talented. That\u2019s the death of him. Give him ten years. Leave him alone.\u201d\n\nThe idea of pacing yourself and developing at a realistic rate as an artist seems to be lost as a virtue in our culture. The seizing of fame and money\u2014not connecting with and building a true and natural audience\u2014has become the goal for many artists today. DiFranco is an example of how to be truly, unpretentiously independent and successful.\n\n\u201cThe idea of being a rock star is adolescent fantasy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the idea of being a working musician is a fucking job. It\u2019s work. And it takes a lot of real decisive calculation in terms of holding yourself back. Consciously holding yourself back. Not just me but Scot Fisher, my manager, who runs the record company. When we get an offer to do a TV spot, we actually say no. We do crazy shit.\u201d\n\nAnd her fans don\u2019t miss a trick. When DiFranco allowed an MTV crew to film her onstage during a performance in 1995, a fan yelled, \u201cMTV sucks! What are they doing here?\u201d Tabitha Soren wrote about the experience afterwards, \u201cI have never come into contact with such protective\u2014to the point of possessive\u2014fans as DiFranco\u2019s. I realize what an awkward position I put her in.\u201d\n\nThis may be the first time in history that a journalist publicly apologized for merely existing. DiFranco even brings out the protective and possessive In the media.\n\nHaving played a guitar onstage in bars since the age of nine could have turned Ani DiFranco into the Shirley Temple of folk music, but instead she became its Jodie Foster. She was born September 23, 1970, in Buffalo, New York, to Elizabeth and Dante DiFranco. Both parents graduated from M.I.T.; Dad became a research engineer, Mom an architect. Elizabeth was one of only a few women in her class, and rode a motorcycle as a young woman.\n\nDiFranco has said that life at home with her parents and older brother was like one scary scene after another.\u201d Her parents separated when she was 11. \u201cMy mother moved out and I went with her,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cSo it was just me and my mother in a little apartment, and my mother kind of freaked out and became a housecleaner. It was like she demoted herself.\u201d\n\nWhen Ani was 15, her mother moved to Connecticut; Ani chose to stay behind in Buffalo and fend for herself, eventually getting her own apartment and living unofficially as an emancipated minor while she finished high school. Today, again, she shares a house with her mother, but it\u2019s Ani\u2019s house, a big old thing with a front porch and a pretty little lawn in downtown Buffalo that she bought a couple of years ago and renovated herself. Her mother is among the nine people who work for Righteous Babe Records.\n\nHer parents humored her and bought her a little kid\u2019s guitar when she was nine. Michael Meldrum was working at the guitar store. \u201cHe was kind of a Buffalo personality, folk-singer, barfly, small-time promoter, poet, degenerate, songwriter guy,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cWe just hit it off. I\u2019m nine, he\u2019s 30. I was a precocious kid, and maybe one of the few people who would listen to him, and he was my friend and mentor.\u201d Meldrum once told Ms. magazine, \u201cI saw a little girl with pigtails down to her knees, and braces. Big smile, open eyes, a lot of wonder\u2026. She had a great voice, a big voice coming out of this very little person\u2026.\u201d He took her out to a bar on her 11th birthday. She got served.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that DiFranco\u2014like so many people of her generation\u2014is the product of a broken home. She has been playing the adult for so long, and redefining the meaning of family in her life, that one can\u2019t help but sense her world-weariness. The difference, though, is that DiFranco is not cynical. She seems to truly love and depend on the \u201cfamily\u201d around her\u2014the crew, the band, the label folks.\n\nOne day, riding on the tour bus, DiFranco is reading aloud a glowing review of Living in Clip to Andy Stochansky, her longtime drummer, and Jason Mercer, her new bass player (replacing Sara Lee, formerly of Gang of Four). She mocks the review\u2019s verbosity, while clearly enjoying the fact that it is overwhelmingly positive. \u201c\u2018As the foil for most of DiFranco\u2019s onstage jokes and musings,'\u201d she reads, \u201c\u2018[Stochansky] plays a valuable role by affirming that this singular performer\u2019s art isn\u2019t lust a girl thing.'\u201d She looks up at Stochansky and says, \u201cBecause you have a cock, it adds a whole new dimension. There\u2019s a boy onstage. We can all rest assured.\u201d\n\nDiFranco is not an angry person, so comments like these aren\u2019t unnerving. She has an essential brattiness that\u2019s the key to her appeal. When she says \u201cFuck you,\u201d it\u2019s with a big toothy smile splashed across her face.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take me long to spot the boyfriend: Andrew Gilchrist (a.k.a. the Goat Boy, because of his strangely appealing, caprine visage) is also DiFranco\u2019s sound engineer. I see that they both wear the same ring. One of the first things I notice in the Buffalo house is a framed picture of Gilchrist, just inside the door.\n\nFor years, many people assumed DiFranco was a lesbian. When I ask her how she defines her sexuality, she says that she doesn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to different things that may or may not have to do with gender. The person that I\u2019m in love with now\u2014the Goat Boy\u2014the thing that makes our relationship so perfect is that it\u2019s so dubiously gendered. We take turns. It\u2019s supposed to be, \u2018Oh, big righteous babe falling for a man. Boo, hiss, taboo, betrayal.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018You should see him! He\u2019s more of a girl than I am!\u2019 We fell in love, and it was very tortured because we hurt other people that we were with, and that\u2019s the album Dilate. I\u2019m not playing any of those songs now.\u201d\n\nI hate forcing labels on people who avoid them, but for the sake of conversation, DiFranco seems to be, in practice, a male-oriented bisexual. When I ask her if she\u2019s ever been afraid of men, she blurts out, \u201cThey\u2019re scary! Yeah!\u201d And then backpedals. \u201cBut it\u2019s the way we\u2019re socialized\u2026. I mean, like, people are just scary fucking monsters!\u201d She laughs uproariously. \u201cI was really young and in the bar scene and men were very carnivorous. So men terrified me. But now in my life it\u2019s the women that are really carnivorous, and really the most manipulative. It\u2019s bizarre. Like, I\u2019m standing onstage playing and I look down and some woman will wag her tongue at me. Or someone will scream at me, \u2018Play this! Play that! Talk! Sing!\u2019 Imagine if it were men behaving that way. A few nights ago, some woman was yelling, \u2018Sing! Sing!\u2019 I looked right at her and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just have a child and boss it around!'\u201d\n\nAt the show in Birmingham, Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls turns up on her motorcycle. She and DiFranco are good friends. \u201cWe both have this part of our brain that makes us think that everybody should and will be nice and friendly and forthcoming,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re completely disillusioned. We have all these grand plans. One of them is the Rolling Thunder Pussy Revue. There\u2019s all these women\u2019s festivals going on this summer, and we don\u2019t think they\u2019re as adventurous as they could be. Lilith Fair\u2014right away, by the name, you know they aren\u2019t pushing the envelope hard enough.\u201d\n\nAfter the show, DiFranco and Ray hang out in the dressing room, and at one point, start talking about their tattoos, specifically one Ray just got on her chest. She has an appointment in a few days in New York with Joan Jett\u2019s tattoo artist, a woman, to have it fixed. \u201cThe guy talked me into putting it on my chest and I was going to put it on my back,\u201d says Ray. \u201cI think he was just trying to talk me into taking my shirt off. I was, like, \u2018I\u2019ve been raped by the tattoo man!'\u201d They both laugh.\n\n\u201cI got a tattoo from a guy that was kind of weird,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cThis thing on the back of my neck is basically a prison tattoo: a couple of squiggly lines, so simple you could do it with a paring knife. And it was crooked and asymmetrical. And he was not very friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you feel funny afterward?\u201d asks Ray.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cI felt very angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you feel violated?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, totally,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cI was, like, 18. Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wonder if guys feel that way when they get tattoos that are fucked-up,\u201d says Ray.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I decided I would only go to women,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cBut then, the woman who did this, I hated!\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but notice that Ani DiFranco seems to be experiencing some kind of ideological shift where gender is concerned. Part of what has made feminism appealing once again is that you don\u2019t have to hate men to feel truly empowered. Perhaps. she\u2019s finding, it\u2019s too easy and reactionary to always say that girls are better.\n\nShe calls herself \u201cThe Folksinger.\u201d As does just about everyone else in the strange, tight crew that comprises the DiFranco Family Traveling Circus. As in \u201cWhere\u2019s The Folksinger?\u201d Or \u201cHas anyone told The Folksinger?\u201d That she calls herself The Folksinger is of note because DiFranco is called so many things: self-made, independent, feminist, bisexual, folk, punk, singer/songwriter, guitar player, hero, role model, phenomenon.\n\nWhen I first encountered DiFranco in Knoxville, I told her I had just been stopped by a cop for no apparent reason and that he felt it necessary to search my rental for \u201cdrugs or guns or anything illegal.\u201d She related a story from her early touring days, when she was traveling alone with her guitar through Texas one sweltering summer day\u2014topless. A cop pulled her over, found her half naked with a box of cash and cassettes in the trunk, and demanded to know what she was doing and where she was going. She pleaded with the officer: \u201cI\u2019m a folksinger!\u201d\n\nBirmingham to Tampa, 600 miles. The band and crew, 11 in all, are hopped-up tonight as the bus takes off at 1 A.M. \u201cBus surfing!\u201d shouts DiFranco. Blinking Christmas lights are turned on, and a joint is passed around. Somebody\u2019s making blender drinks with fruit and vodka. System 7 is pumping from the sound system, and suddenly the bus has been transformed into a rolling disco. All 11 people crowd into the front lounge and dance like mad, whooping and hollering and trying to stand up as the huge bus lumbers around curves and corners. DiFranco, complaining that she can\u2019t dance to this particular choice, changes the music to James Brown. After an hour of bumping and grinding, people fall out and sit down, one by one.\n\nDiFranco scooches next to me on a banquette. James Brown is still playing. We are very stoned. \u201cDig the lyrics to this song,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Stand up baby, let me see where you\u2019re coming from.\u2019 Obviously a cry for social action. And then he says, \u2018Get involved! Get involved!\u2019 He keeps repeating it. Again, a cry for social action.\u201d At this point, we are practically sitting on top of one another, her face just inches away. \u201cHe\u2019s also an environmentalist,\u201d she says, half serious. \u201cThere\u2019s that song, \u2018What do we need? Solar power!\u2019 People think he\u2019s saying \u2018Soul power.\u2019 But he\u2019s actually saying \u2018Solar power.\u2019 Again, a political message.\u201d\n\n\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a couple of things about The Folksinger that push the boundaries of folk music. One is that she is deeply funky. On this tour she has been opening her set with a very Tribe Called Quest-ish version of a poem she wrote called \u201cI.Q.\u201d She pulls off a kind of 1990-East-Coast-hip-hop, diggity-diggity rhyme style with amazing success for a white girl from Buffalo. She is also a great dancer. In her ever-present Kiss boots\u2014silver-plated clunkers that add a few inches\u2014she jerks and swivels her body, with an innate rhythm to rival any current R&B artist.\n\nThe other thing about The Folksinger that surprises me is that she is so funny. Her performances veer into such over-the-top giddiness as to give one the impression that she is half stand-up comic. The rhythm of her between-song spiels is more Roseanne than Joan Baez.\n\nBack on the bus, after the surfing, I say, \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll is rarely funny.\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d she says, \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve always felt like the most uncool person. Because it\u2019s not cool to be friendly, it\u2019s not cool to be happy, it\u2019s not cool to be funny. For me, it\u2019s just not cool to be boring. I can\u2019t take it. So I\u2019d rather hang out with the class clowns than the cool guys.\u201d\n\nThe Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, 6 P.M. The DiFranco Family Circus has pulled into town, only to discover that they are surrounded by surreality. In the Holiday Inn next door, where we are staying, a Narcotics Anonymous convention is in full swing\u2014everywhere you look there are ex-drug addicts, every one of them looking like ten miles of rough trail. In the complex where DiFranco will perform, a Catholic high school prom is unfolding.\n\nOutside on the loading dock of the convention center, DiFranco, whose hair is now bleached blond, pulls me aside. \u201cI was thinking about something that you said last night, that you didn\u2019t expect that my show would be funny. I\u2019ve always had this basic understanding of what folk music is, that it has to do with economics, that it is sub-corporate music. Folk music is not on the radio, folk music does not make money, folk music is more community-based, politically oriented, of the people. Rock music is usually more of a commodity.\n\n\u201cBut you made me realize that another major distinction between rock\u2019n\u2019roll and folk music is humor. What references in rock do you have for humor? Rock\u2019n\u2019roll takes itself so seriously; folk music never does. Because it\u2019s not cool to be funny. It\u2019s corny. My new little manifesto is that folksingers take everything very seriously except for themselves. They talk about social issues, political issues, their country, their society, their lives, their time, their place. But in the whole rock\u2019n\u2019roll milieu, you take nothing seriously, save yourself. It\u2019s so self-serious and tortured and grandiose.\u201d\n\nThis is, of course, an oversimplification, but she has a point. Suddenly, Stochansky, who plays DiFranco\u2019s straight man onstage, gets dragged into the conversation.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything for, like, a year,\u201d says DiFranco. \u201cI just kept turning around and verbally abusing him, and eventually he just started talking. Except he\u2019d always get the audience sympathy. They\u2019d all turn to Andy and go, \u2018Awwwww.\u2019 Fucking perfect job of the universe. Walk out onstage, hit things with sticks, get sympathy from all the hot babe-age.\u201d\n\nThe day before, in Alabama, Stochansky and I had gone for a walk before the show and found a grassy lawn on which to hang out. He is what a friend of mine calls a \u201cS.N.A.G.\u201d: a Sensitive New Age Guy. He and DiFranco have been playing together for six years, and the bond is deep. \u201cShe always felt like family,\u201d he said, and then recalled the day DiFranco met his father, a Ukrainian immigrant. \u201cYou are a dirty girl,\u201d he said. To which she replied, \u201cAnd someday, I\u2019m going to be a dirty old woman.\u201d\n\nWhen Stochansky, who is from Toronto, first started playing with DiFranco, it was just the two of them onstage, and he was often one of the only men in the room. He told me about the moment things shifted. \u201cAt Christmas, a couple of years ago, in Vancouver. One night, it just happened. I came back to the dressing room and said, \u2018Ani, you\u2019re not going to believe this, but there are guys out there. Not only that, but there are probably more straight people than gay people.\u2019 I went from playing a primarily female gay audience to suddenly having guys cheer me on. I immediately felt like, \u2018No! I don\u2019t want to be in tune with you!\u201d\n\nA week later, it\u2019s \u201cSpring Fest\u201d at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and DiFranco is the headliner of a benefit for the women\u2019s studies program. Her hair is now eight shades of green.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, a bit wistfully, reminiscing about what Stochansky said. \u201cIt was the beginning of the change. It used to be all women because that\u2019s part of where I come from. The women\u2019s center would get together $200 and I\u2019d go play the school, so naturally it would be all the feminists on campus.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Vega, who is also on the bill, shows up to chat for a few minutes before she goes on. They have known each other for years; in the early \u201980s, when DiFranco was still a kid and Vega was not yet a star, Vega came to Buffalo a lot to play the local bars and stayed at DiFranco\u2019s house a few times. During her performance at this festival, Vega tells a story about how once, when she stayed with DiFranco, the young girl made a huge banner for her: WELCOME BACK TO BUFFALO.\n\nDiFranco has a song on the album Dilate called \u201cNapoleon,\u201d that goes, in part, \u201cThey told you your music / Could reach millions / That the choice was up to you / And you told me that they always / Pay for lunch / And they believe in what I do\u2026.\u201d A friend recently speculated that the song was about Vega. Whether it is or not, there is something fascinating about watching these two women interact, especially on a night when Vega is opening for DiFranco. It was ten years ago that Vega was being compared to Dylan, touted as the \u201980s savior of folk music in Rolling Stone. That this savior was a woman was duly noted. But what happened to Vega? Nothing, it seems. After the rush of her first two albums she\u2019s had almost no impact whatsoever. She pulled back when fame came calling.\n\nAs they sit and talk, Scot Fisher, DiFranco\u2019s manager and label president, makes reference to DiFranco\u2019s marketing plan. \u201cWhat is your marketing plan?\u201d asks Vega. \u201cDo you have one?\u201d Yes, we do, Fisher answers. To which Vega replies, \u201cWell, it\u2019s good to know that somebody\u2019s got one, because I don\u2019t. My manager\u2019s vision of marketing is, \u2018Do everything.\u201d\n\nDiFranco clearly wants to take her music beyond folk. Her fascination with dance music, hip-hop, and tribal beats suggests she is well on her way to expanding beyond the white, middle-class limitations of the crunchy, hippie genre where she now tenuously resides. One criticism to be leveled at DiFranco is that she indulges in far too much navel gazing: Too many of her songs are about the effect her songs are having on her audience. If she keeps growing as an artist at her current pace\u2014which is fairly astonishing\u2014and if her audience gets any bigger, DiFranco will be in the unenviable position of trying to hold back the tide. She is clearly nervous about her ever-increasing fame. Her independence may just become her cross to bear.\n\nOne day, when DiFranco and I are talking about her live performance, she says, \u201cThe pop press always goes on about how I\u2019m a person on stage, and I talk to the audience, and I engage them, and it\u2019s some kind of weird breaking down of the audience/performer wall. But that\u2019s folk music.\u201d\n\nShe is talking, as she often does, with a slightly exasperated, wryly goofy tone, her voice and posture suggesting that she just can\u2019t believe anybody would do it any other way. \u201cYou stand up there and you don\u2019t have a persona,\u201d she says, talking exactly as she does when she\u2019s onstage performing. \u201cYou just are a person.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://www.maniadb.com/album/382163", "page_content": "TRACKS Disc 1 1. 32 Flavors Alana Davis 3:45 Squint your eyes and look closer\n\nI'm not between you and your ambition\n\nI am a poster girl with no poster\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\n\n\nSquint your eyes and look closer\n\nI'm not between you and your ambition\n\nI am a poster girl with no poster\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\n\n\nAnd I'm beyond your peripheral vision\n\nSo you might want to turn your head\n\nCause someday you're going to get hungry\n\nAnd eat all of the words that you just said\n\n\n\nI am what I am I am 32 flavors and then some\n\n\n\nGod help you if you are an ugly girl\n\nCourse too pretty is also your doom\n\nCause everyone harbors a secret hatred\n\nFor the prettiest girl in the room\n\nGod help you if you are a phoenix\n\nAnd you dare to rise up from the ash\n\nA thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy while\n\nYou are just flying past.\n\n\n\nI am what I am\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm taking my chances as they come\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI am nobody but I am someone\n\nSomeone\n\n\n\nI'd never try to give my life meaning by\n\nDemeaning you\n\nAnd I would like to state for the record\n\nI did everything that I could do\n\n\n\nI am beyond your peripheral vision\n\nSo you might want to turn your head\n\nCause someday you're going to be starving\n\nAnd eating all of the words that you just said\n\nThat you said\n\n\n\nI am what I am I am what I am\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm taking my chances as they come\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm looking for truth but there is none\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'll never forget where I came from\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm nobody but I am someone\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nI'm taking my chances as they come\n\nI am 32 flavors and then some\n\nLooking for truth and there is none Squint your eyes and look closer I'm not between you and your ambition I am a poster girl with no poster I am 32 flavors and then some Squint your eyes and look closer I'm not between you and your ambition I am a poster girl with no poster I am 32 flavors and then some And I'm beyond your peripheral vision So you might want to turn your head Cause someday you're going to get hungry And eat all of the words that you just said I am what I am I am 32 flavors and then some God help you if you are an ugly girl Course too pretty is also your doom Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred For the prettiest girl in the room God help you if you are a phoenix And you dare to rise up from the ash A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy while You are just flying past.

After it originally spent a week in the top 10, at No. 9, upon its debut last November (concurrent with the chart start of parent album Midnights), the song hits a new high following the May 26 release of its remix with Ice Spice, and the wide premiere of its official video May 27.\n\nSwift achieves her milestone 25th top five Hot 100 hit. Ice Spice, now credited on \u201cKarma\u201d on the chart (as the remix accounts for over half the song\u2019s consumption in the May 26-June 1 tracking week), adds both her third top 10 and top five track \u2013 and earns her highest career rank.\n\nAs previously reported, Midnights surges back to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nThe Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data. All charts (dated June 10, 2023) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (June 6). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both Twitter and Instagram.\n\nWallen\u2019s \u201cLast Night,\u201d released on Big Loud/Mercury/Republic Records, drew 66.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1%) and 32.8 million streams (essentially even week-over-week) and sold 8,000 downloads (down 4%) in the May 26-June 1 tracking week, according to Luminate.\n\nThe song, which initially led the Hot 100 in March, becoming Wallen\u2019s first leader on the list, notches an 11th week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; rises 5-4 for a new best on Radio Songs; and dips 5-6 on Digital Song Sales, following a week on top.\n\n\u201cLast Night\u201d commands the Country Airplay chart for a fifth week, having become the first song to top the Hot 100 and Country Airplay simultaneously, and becomes Wallen\u2019s first top 10 on the Pop Airplay chart. It leads the Hot Country Songs chart, which uses the same methodology as the Hot 100, for a 17th week.\n\nSwift\u2019s \u201cKarma\u201d soars 27-2 on the Hot 100. After it first logged a week in the top 10, at No. 9, in its debut frame last November (concurrent with the No. 1 Billboard 200 debut of parent album Midnights), the song hits a new Hot 100 best following the May 26 release of its remix with Ice Spice, and the wide premiere of its official video May 27 (at midnight each day). Attendees at Swift\u2019s May 26 concert \u2014 as part of her The Eras Tour at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. \u2014 saw the clip even earlier at the show, while Ice Spice joined Swift on-stage for a live debut of the remix.\n\nThe song drew 38.4 million in airplay audience (up 15%) and 22.5 million streams (up 175%) and sold 17,000 (up 744%) May 26-June 1, as it wins top Streaming and Sales Gainer honors on the Hot 100. It bounds 50-4 on Streaming Songs; returns to Digital Song Sales at No. 2; and jumps 18-12 on Radio Songs, hitting new highs on each survey.\n\nSwift achieves her 25th top five Hot 100 entry, solely claiming the fifth-most such hits since the chart began in August 1958.\n\nMost Top Five Hot 100 Hits:\n\n35, Drake\n\n29, The Beatles\n\n28, Madonna\n\n27, Mariah Carey\n\n25, Taylor Swift\n\n24, Janet Jackson\n\n24, Rihanna\n\n21, Elvis Presley (whose career began before the chart originated)\n\n20, Justin Bieber\n\n20, Michael Jackson\n\n20, Stevie Wonder\n\nMeanwhile, Swift boasts the sixth-most top two Hot 100 hits: 17, with nine having hit No. 1 and eight having reached No. 2. She follows The Beatles (23; 20 No. 1s, three No. 2 hits); Mariah Carey (23; 19 No. 1s, four No. 2 hits); Drake (20; 11 No. 1s, nine No. 2 hits); Rihanna (18; 14 No. 1s, four No. 2 hits); and Madonna (18; 12 No. 1s, six No. 2 hits).\n\nPlus, Midnights has now generated three top two Hot 100 songs: \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d became Swift\u2019s longest-leading No. 1, for eight weeks in November-January, and \u201cLavender Haze\u201d debuted at its No. 2 peak in November, as 10 tracks from the album blanketed the top 10 in the set\u2019s starting frame and Swift made history as the first artist to rank at each spot in the top 10 in a single week.\n\nThe album is Swift\u2019s second to produce a trio of top two Hot 100 hits, after 1989 yielded three No. 1s in 2014-15: \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cBad Blood\u201d (featuring Kendrick Lamar).\n\nMidnights is the first album by any act with three top two Hot 100 hits since The Weeknd\u2019s After Hours spun off three No. 1s in 2019-21: \u201cHeartless,\u201d \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cSave Your Tears,\u201d the lattermost remixed with Ariana Grande \u2013 who, prior to that LP, posted three top two hits, including two No. 1s, from Thank U Next in 2018-19. Earlier in 2018, Drake rung up four, including three No. 1s, from his album Scorpion.\n\nIce Spice is now credited on \u201cKarma\u201d on the Hot 100, as the remix accounts for over half the song\u2019s consumption in the tracking week. She notches her third top 10 \u2013 and highest-charting hit \u2013 following \u201cBoy\u2019s a Liar, Pt. 2,\u201d with PinkPantheress (No. 3, March), and \u201cPrincess Diana,\u201d with Nicki Minaj (No. 4, April).\n\nMiley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cFlowers\u201d descends 2-3 on the Hot 100, after eight weeks at No. 1, beginning upon its debut in January. It posts a 16th week atop Radio Songs (86.8 million in audience, down 3%).\n\nNotably, \u201cFlowers\u201d ties for the third-longest reign since Radio Songs began in December 1990 \u2013 and passes Adele\u2019s \u201cEasy On Me\u201d for the longest rule for a Columbia Records single.\n\nMost Weeks at No. 1 on Radio Songs:\n\n26, \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d The Weeknd, 2020\n\n18, \u201cIris,\u201d Goo Goo Dolls, 1998\n\n16, \u201cFlowers,\u201d Miley Cyrus, 2023\n\n16, \u201cGirls Like You,\u201d Maroon 5 feat. Cardi B, 2018\n\n16, \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d Mariah Carey, 2005\n\n16, \u201cDon\u2019t Speak,\u201d No Doubt, 1996-97\n\n15, \u201cEasy On Me,\u201d Adele, 2021-22\n\n\u201cFlowers\u201d also becomes the first song by a woman to have spent its first 20 weeks on the Hot 100 in the top three. Overall, only one song has had a better such start: Harry Styles\u2019 \u201cAs It Was\u201d \u2013 also on Columbia \u2013 ranked in the top three in its first 29 weeks on the chart.\n\nLil Durk\u2019s \u201cAll My Life,\u201d featuring J. Cole, rebounds 7-4 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it launched at No. 2. It also returns to No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs, leading each multi-metric list for a second week, as parent album Almost Healed debuts at No. 3 on the Billboard 200.\n\nRema and Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cCalm Down\u201d retreats to No. 5 on the Hot 100, from its No. 4 high. It tops the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for a 40th week, extending the longest reign since the ranking began over a year ago (in partnership with music festival and global brand Afro Nation).\n\n(\u201800s and aahs: despite Swift, Cyrus and Gomez having all first hit the Hot 100 in the second half of the 2000s \u2013 Cyrus in August 2006 [via her former Hannah Montana alter ego]; Swift that September; and Gomez in January 2009 \u2013 the three artists appear in the top five together for the first time this week.)\n\nSZA\u2019s \u201cKill Bill\u201d drops 3-6 on the Hot 100, after it became her first No. 1, for a week in April. It rules the multi-metric Hot R&B Songs chart for a 24th week.\n\nEslabon Armado and Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201cElla Baila Sola\u201d slides 6-7 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 4 \u2013 the best rank ever for a regional Mexican song. It adds a ninth week at No. 1 on the multi-metric Hot Latin Songs chart.\n\nLuke Combs\u2019 cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d revs to a new No. 8 Hot 100 best, from No. 10, as it claims the chart\u2019s top Airplay Gainer award for a second consecutive week (26.3 million, up 33%). (Chapman\u2019s original version hit No. 6 in 1988.)\n\nRounding out the Hot 100\u2019s top 10, Toosii\u2019s \u201cFavorite Song\u201d falls to No. 9 from its No. 5 high and Metro Boomin, The Weeknd and 21 Savage\u2019s \u201cCreepin\u2019 \u201d backtracks 9-10, after hitting No. 3.\n\nAgain, for all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both Twitter and Instagram and all charts (dated June 10), including the Hot 100 in its entirety, will refresh on Billboard.com tomorrow (June 6).\n\nLuminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings.

Switching positions, your chances of finding foreign-language songs on an American radio station is pretty close to zero, with the notable exception of \u201cDespacito.\u201d The lack of non-English music has been pretty constant in the United States.\n\nThe situation just might be changing, however. Take Spanish, for example. With 41 million people in the United States speaking Spanish as a native language, it\u2019s reasonable to expect Spanish to have an impact on the music market. At the least, Latin music impact is growing in this country. Popular hip-hop might still be sung most often in English, yet traces of reggaeton, a genre of music originating in Puerto Rico in the 1990s, can often be heard as well.\n\nWe wanted to learn more about the history of non-English music in the United States, so we decided to take a look at the songs that made it to the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Since mid-1958, Billboard has been the foremost resource for tracking singles in the United States. This gives us over 60 years to work with, and over 1,000 number-one hits. Despite that, only eight foreign-language songs managed to make it to the top of the list. Here, we look at each of them. Scroll to the bottom to listen to our playlist of all the songs, and read on to find out the stories behind them.\n\nThe 8 Foreign-Language Songs That Topped The Billboard Hot 100\n\n1958: \u201cNel Blu Dipinto Di Blu\u201d by Domenico Modugno\n\nDespite the lack of foreign-language songs on the Billboard Hot 100, this Italian song was the number-one song of the year the very first year the Billboard list was made. Better known as \u201cVolare,\u201d this song won the Sanremo Music Festival and was Italy\u2019s 1958 entry into Eurovision, a massively popular music contest in Europe. While the song didn\u2019t win Eurovision, it was incredibly successful all around the world, and was on the top of the charts for five (non-consecutive) weeks. It even won the first-ever Grammy for \u201cSong of the Year,\u201d and it remains the only foreign-language song to have done so.\n\n1963: \u201cSukiyaki\u201d by Kyu Sakamoto\n\nAs one of the only foreign-language songs on this list performed in a non-European language, \u201cSukiyaki\u201d is somewhat of an unexpected success. The song was wildly popular in Japan with the title \u201cUe o Muite Aruk\u014d,\u201d which directly translates to \u201cI Look Up As I Walk.\u201d The name \u201cSukiyaki\u201d was chosen for the English version for some reason, even though Sukiyaki is the name of a Japanese beef dish that has nothing to do with the song. Sung by the fresh-faced Kyu Sakamoto, \u201cSukiyaki\u201d sounds deceptively upbeat, especially when you\u2019re unable to understand the lyrics. In reality, it\u2019s a rather sad song looking back at the failure of Japanese protest movements against U.S. military occupation during the 1950s. Keep in mind, this song reached the United States only 18 years after the end of World War II. It was number one for three weeks in the summer of 1963, and there was also a successful English cover version sung by A Taste of Honey in 1980.\n\n1963: \u201cDominique\u201d by The Singing Nun\n\nBecoming popular shortly after \u201cSukiyaki,\u201d \u201cDominique\u201d is also a surprising hit, especially when compared to the songs that would reach the number-one spot in the coming years of the British invasion. Sung by Jeannine Deckers, a French-speaking nun from Belgium, the song is about Saint Dominic, who founded the Dominican Order she was a member of. Some say this song may have become a hit on the radio because DJs were desperate for pleasant music to play in the aftermath of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. Whatever the reason, the song was number one for four weeks in December 1963. The story of this song does not have a very happy ending, however. Owing the Belgian government back taxes and being cash-strapped because she gave all the royalties from her music to her convent \u2014 which she left in 1966, having grown apart from the Catholic church \u2014 Deckers tried to make money by releasing a disco version of \u201cDominique\u201d in 1982. The song was a failure, and after struggling for a few years, she and a close friend killed themselves in 1985.\n\n1986: \u201cRock Me Amadeus\u201d by Falco\n\nAfter a 23-year period with no foreign-language number ones on the Billboard Hot 100, \u201cRock Me Amadeus\u201d showed up to reign for three weeks in the spring of 1986. The song is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which seems like a funny choice but is actually pretty fitting: Falco, born Johann H\u00f6lzel, was a classically trained musician who rejected his upbringing to play rock music. The song is in German (except for the \u201cRock Me\u201d part), but the words didn\u2019t really matter. The driving beat and repetitive \u201cAmadeus, Amadeus\u201d chorus were enough to make this song a staple of the 1980s. Despite other musical attempts, \u201cRock Me Amadeus\u201d was Falco\u2019s only really successful song in the United States.\n\n1987: \u201cLa Bamba\u201d by Los Lobos\n\nThe history of \u201cLa Bamba\u201d goes back further than the 1987 version by Los Lobos. It was originally a Mexican folk song, with the earliest known recording being from 1938. In 1958, it was turned into a rock-and-roll hit by Ritchie Valens, who was only 17 years old at the time. The song was the first time that Mexican music had a big impact on the United States music industry. At the time, it only reached number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, however. It wasn\u2019t until 1987 that the song reached number one and held that position for three weeks. It wasn\u2019t Valens\u2019 version, though, but the cover by Los Lobos, which was recorded as the title track for the movie La Bamba. Ritchie Valens was credited with a posthumous number-one song credit. Tragically, he died in a 1959 plane crash, just a few months after his version of \u201cLa Bamba\u201d was released.\n\n1996: \u201cMacarena (Bayside Boys Mix)\u201d by Los Del Rio\n\nLos Del Rio is perhaps the most famous example of a one-hit wonder, thanks to \u201cMacarena,\u201d which stayed on the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks. You\u2019ll notice, however, that this is the Bayside Boys Mix version of the song, which happens to include the English verses instead of the Spanish ones. The original version of this song, which has only Spanish lyrics, also ranked on the Billboard list, but it was not as successful as the English one. The song was inspired by flamenco dancer Diana Patricia Cubill\u00e1n Herrera, who impressed Los Del Rio with her dancing in Venezuela. She likely was not performing the dance the song is now famous for, which was a craze during the mid-\u201990s.\n\n2017: \u201cDespacito\u201d by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, Feat. Justin Bieber\n\nFollowing \u201cMacarena\u201d was another 21 years without any foreign-language songs at the top of the charts, and that brings us to 2017\u2019s \u201cDespacito.\u201d The song was on a number-one hit for 16 weeks in 2017, tying \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men for Billboard\u2019s longest reign. (In 2019, it was beat by the 19-week run of Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d) \u201cDespacito\u201d is one of the most successful Latin songs in history. Notably, there are two versions. There\u2019s the one solely by Puerto Rican musicians Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, which is entirely in Spanish, and the one that has verses by Justin Bieber, which includes English and Spanglish, along with Spanish. It\u2019s the latter which has achieved much more fame in the United States. Surely Justin Bieber\u2019s star power had something to do with this, though Daddy Yankee has had success with two other songs \u2014 \u201cGasolina\u201d and \u201cRompe\u201d \u2014 on the charts. However, neither of those reached the top spot.\n\n2020: \u201cLife Goes On\u201d by BTS\n\nJudging by the quick international rise of K-pop, it was only a matter of time for a song sung predominantly in Korean to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100. It also comes as little surprise that it comes from the group BTS, which is by far the most popular K-pop group in the United States. \u201cLife Goes On\u201d isn\u2019t their first song to hit number one \u2014 the group has had five others \u2014 but it is the first mostly sung in Korean. This is all the more impressive, because BTS has been shut out by a medium that has historically played a central role in the Billboard Hot 100: radio. While you couldn\u2019t turn on a radio in 2017 without hearing \u201cDespacito,\u201d BTS has not gotten nearly as much playtime as its American counterparts. The group\u2019s success is entirely thanks to its massive, avid fanbase, which has streamed the song close to 15 million times in a single week.\n\nForeign-Language Songs Playlist\n\nNote: This article was originally published on April 24, 2018.\n\nHeader Photo by AJEONG_JM / Creative Commons"}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/every-no-1-song-debut-billboard-hot-100", "page_content": "1. \"You Are Not Alone\" by Michael Jackson\n\n\"You Are Not Alone\" was released in 1995.

It also leads the multi-metric Holiday 100 chart for a 49th week, of the chart\u2019s 54 total weeks since the list launched in 2011; it has topped the tally for 34 consecutive weeks, dating to the start of the 2015-16 holiday season, and dominates as the top title on the recently-revealed Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs chart.\n\nSince its release, the song has upped its U.S. totals to 4.3 billion in radio audience, 1.4 billion streams and 3.7 million in download sales.\n\nNo. 1 in a third separate chart run: Carey\u2019s \u201cChristmas\u201d first topped the Hot 100 dated Dec. 21, 2019, and led again on the next two lists, dated Dec. 28, 2019, and Jan. 4, 2020.\n\nThe following holiday season, it returned to No. 1 on the chart dated Dec. 19, 2020, and, after a week at No. 2 (below Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cWillow\u201d), topped the Jan. 2, 2021, dated tally.\n\nAs \u201cChristmas\u201d rules the latest, Dec. 25, 2021-dated chart, it claims its sixth total week at No. 1 in its third seasonal run at the summit, becoming the first song in the Hot 100\u2019s 63-year history to lead in three distinct chart runs. The track has re-entered the survey each November or December dating to 2012.\n\n(As \u201cChristmas\u201d has made four interrupted climbs to the top of the Hot 100, on charts dated Dec. 21, 2019, Dec. 19, 2020, Jan. 2, 2021, and now Dec. 25, 2021, it ties 24kGoldn\u2019s \u201cMood,\u201d featuring iann dior, beginning in October 2020, and Drake\u2019s \u201cNice for What,\u201d in 2018, as the only songs with four separate ascents to No. 1; unlike \u201cChristmas,\u201d the latter two tracks logged their four distinct rises to No. 1 over unbroken chart stays.)\n\nLongest span atop the Hot 100: Carey\u2019s \u201cChristmas\u201d now boasts the longest span from a song\u2019s first week at No. 1 on the Hot 100 to its latest: two years and four days (Dec. 21, 2019-Dec. 25, 2021).\n\nIt passes the only other song to lead the Hot 100 over multiple runs: Chubby Checker\u2019s \u201cThe Twist,\u201d which topped the tally dated Sept. 19, 1960, before, thanks to new popularity among adult audiences, leading the lists dated Jan. 13 and 20, 1962, ruling again after a gap of a year, three months and three weeks. (Still, that break remains the longest between Hot 100 reigns.)\n\nMost weeks at No. 1 for a holiday hit: With its sixth week atop the Hot 100, Carey\u2019s \u201cChristmas\u201d extends its record for the most time at No. 1 among holiday songs. The only other seasonal single to jingle to the apex, \u201cThe Chipmunk Song,\u201d by David Seville & the Chipmunks, spent four weeks on top beginning in December 1958.\n\nCarey\u2019s record 85th week atop Hot 100: With \u201cChristmas,\u201d Carey claims her record-extending 85th week at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dating to the chart\u2019s Aug. 4, 1958, inception.\n\nMost Weeks at No. 1 on Hot 100\n\n85, Mariah Carey\n\n60, Rihanna\n\n59, The Beatles\n\n52, Drake\n\n50, Boyz II Men\n\n47, Usher\n\n41, Beyonc\u00e9\n\n37, Michael Jackson\n\n34, Elton John\n\n34, Bruno Mars\n\n\u201cChristmas\u201d became Carey\u2019s 19th Hot 100 No. 1, the most among soloists and one away from The Beatles\u2019 overall record 20. It also made Carey the first artist to have ranked at No. 1 on the chart in four distinct decades, dating to her first week on top with her debut single, \u201cVision of Love,\u201d in 1990.\n\nFurther, \u201cChristmas\u201d is Carey\u2019s record fifth Hot 100 No. 1 to rule for six weeks or more. She one-ups Boyz II Men, Drake and Usher, each with four such leaders.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s not only fitting that \u201cChristmas\u201d leads the Hot 100 dated Dec. 25, 2021, but Carey is the only artist to top the chart on multiple rankings dated Dec. 25: her \u201cHero\u201d began a four-week stay at No. 1 on the Dec. 25, 1993, Hot 100. (This week\u2019s chart is the 10th dated Dec. 25 in the list\u2019s history.)\n\nBrenda Lee\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree,\u201d originally released in 1958, rises 3-2 on the Hot 100, returning to its high reached in each of the last two holiday seasons. It dances merrily with 19.8 million in radio airplay audience (up 7%), 35.8 million streams (up 19%) and 5,900 sold (down 3%).\n\nAdele\u2019s \u201cEasy on Me\u201d slips to No. 3 on the Hot 100, after seven nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1, with 86.6 million in radio reach (up 1%), 19.2 million streams (down 7%) and 8,300 in sales (down 10%). The ballad spends a fourth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs.\n\nThe late Bobby Helms\u2019 \u201cJingle Bell Rock,\u201d from 1957, lifts 6-4 on the Hot 100 and the late Burl Ives\u2019 \u201cA Holly Jolly Christmas,\u201d from 1964, keeps at No. 5. The Yuletide standards have hit respective peaks of Nos. 3 and 4 in each of the last two holiday seasons.\n\nThe Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cStay\u201d slides 4-6 on the Hot 100, after seven weeks at No. 1. Notably, over its first 23 weeks on the chart, dating to its July debut at No. 3, the song has yet to rank below No. 6. It\u2019s one of only three titles ever to have spent its first 23 weeks or more in the top six spots, after Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cShape of You\u201d (27, in 2017) and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cRockstar,\u201d featuring 21 Savage (also 23, in 2017-18).\n\nThe late Andy Williams\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\u201d rises 10-7 on the Hot 100. Originally released in 1963, it hit a No. 5 high last holiday season.\n\nGlass Animals\u2019 \u201cHeat Waves\u201d pushes 9-8 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 7, as it tops the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts, both of which use the same multi-metric methodology as the Hot 100, for a 13th week each.\n\nWham!\u2019s \u201cLast Christmas\u201d dashes back to the Hot 100\u2019s top 10, and its No. 9 high, first reached last holiday season, from No. 13. The 1984 release advances with 23.4 million streams (up 16%), 17.1 million in airplay audience (up 7%) and 3,400 sold (up 2%).\n\nThe song became the seventh Hot 100 top 10 for the duo of George Michael (who died Dec. 25, 2016) and Andrew Ridgeley, after the pair charted its first six in 1984-86, including the No. 1s \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\u201d \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d and \u201cEverything She Wants.\u201d Michael subsequently notched 14 solo top 10s, including seven No. 1s, through 1996.\n\nRounding out the Hot 100\u2019s top 10, Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow\u2019s \u201cIndustry Baby\u201d descends 8-10, after a week at No. 1, as it posts a 17th week atop the multi-metric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts.\n\nAgain, for all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both Twitter and Instagram and all charts (dated Dec. 25), including the Hot 100 in its entirety, will refresh on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 21)."}, {"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/jimin-like-crazy-debuts-number-one-first-bts-solo-hot-100-1235297097/", "page_content": "Jimin\u2019s \u201cLike Crazy\u201d blasts in at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, marking his first leader \u2013 and the first for a member of superstar South Korean pop group BTS. He\u2019s also the first South Korean solo artist to lead the list.\n\nThe Hot 100 start for \u201cLike Crazy\u201d was largely driven by sales, with five versions available during the chart\u2019s tracking week. The song was released March 24 on Jimin\u2019s debut solo set FACE, which enters at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nThe Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data. All charts (dated April 8, 2023) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (April 4). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both Twitter and Instagram.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the Hot 100 coronation for \u201cLike Crazy,\u201d released on BigHit Music / Geffen / Interscope Records. The song begins as the 1,148th No. 1 since the chart originated in August 1958. It\u2019s the 66th title to premiere at the summit.\n\nStreams, airplay & sales: \u201cLike Crazy\u201d sold 254,000 song downloads and CD singles combined and drew 10 million streams and 64,000 radio airplay audience impressions in its first week (March 24-30).\n\nThe song\u2019s original version, sung in Korean, and its English version were released March 24, while its \u201cDeep House\u201d and \u201cUK Garage\u201d mixes and an instrumental version arrived March 26, with all available in BTS\u2019 webstore and at wide retail for 69 cents each, while a CD single of the original mix was on sale in BTS\u2019 webstore for $1.99. (All versions roll up into one listing on Billboard\u2019s charts.)\n\nThe sales sum for \u201cLike Crazy\u201d is the highest in a single week since Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d sold 328,000 (Nov. 19, 2022), sparked by seven remixes released that tracking week.\n\n\u201cLike Crazy\u201d debuts at No. 1 on the Digital Song Sales chart, where it\u2019s Jimin\u2019s third leader, and No. 35 on Streaming Songs, where he makes his first appearance. (Its airplay audience is the lowest for a Hot 100 No. 1 this decade, although it\u2019s not being actively promoted to radio; still, it has received a handful of early plays on Radio Songs reporters KIIS Los Angeles, KJYO Oklahoma City, Okla., KYLD San Francisco and WSNX Grand Rapids, Mich., all of which also contribute to the Pop Airplay chart and are owned by iHeartMedia, as well as Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart panelist KNHC Seattle.)\n\nJimin & BTS have each hit No. 1: Jimin achieves the first Hot 100 No. 1, and No. 1 debut, for a BTS member solo, with the group \u2013 which announced a break last June \u2013 having notched six leaders, five of which debuted at No. 1.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown:\n\nJimin, \u201cLike Crazy,\u201d one week at No. 1 (to date), April 8, 2023\n\nColdplay & BTS, \u201cMy Universe,\u201d one to date, Oct. 9, 2021\n\nBTS, \u201cPermission To Dance,\u201d one, July 24, 2021\n\nBTS, \u201cButter,\u201d 10, June 5, 2021\n\nBTS, \u201cLife Goes On,\u201d one, Dec. 5, 2020\n\nJawsh 685 x Jason Derulo x BTS, \u201cSavage Love (Laxed \u2013 Siren Beat),\u201d one, Oct. 17, 2020\n\n\u201cDynamite,\u201d three, beginning Sept. 5, 2020\n\nJimin makes history as the first soloist to score a solo Hot 100 debut breaking out of a group that has also debuted at No. 1 on the chart. (Travis Scott has begun atop the list solo and as part of the collaboratively credited The Scotts; in addition to his own \u201cHighest in the Room,\u201d in October 2019, and \u201cFranchise,\u201d featuring Young Thug and M.I.A., in October 2020, his and Kid Cudi\u2019s \u201cThe Scotts,\u201d billed on the chart as by The Scotts, Travis Scott and Kid Cudi [born Scott Mescudi], opened at No. 1 in May 2020.)\n\nJimin and BTS, thus, join the ranks of soloists and groups each with Hot 100 No. 1s, a list most recently bolstered, before this week, when Beyonc\u00e9 reigned with \u201cBreak My Soul\u201d for two weeks last August; Destiny\u2019s Child, with her as a member, tallied four No. 1s.\n\nFirst South Korean soloist to top Hot 100: After BTS became the first all-South Korean group to lead the Hot 100, with \u201cDynamite,\u201d Jimin becomes the first South Korean soloist to hit No. 1. Previously among South Korean solo artists, PSY reached a No. 2 best with \u201cGangnam Style\u201d for seven weeks in 2012.\n\nThe history of Asian acts atop the Hot 100 dates back to the chart\u2019s early years, as Japanese-born Kyu Sakamoto became the first to lead, with \u201cSukiyaki\u201d for three weeks in 1963. In 2010, Far*East Movement reigned with \u201cLike a G6,\u201d with the act\u2019s lineup at the time including two members of Korean heritage.\n\nBTS members solo on the Hot 100: Jimin scores not only the first Hot 100 No. 1 by a BTS member solo, but the first top 10, or even top 20, hit on the chart. Plus, of the four solo top 40 hits by the group\u2019s members, Jimin has two.\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of all 15 Hot 100 entries so far by BTS members apart from the group, ranked by peak position. All seven of the act\u2019s members have reached the chart with solo songs: J-Hope, Jimin, Jin, Jung Kook, RM, Suga and V.\n\nPeak Pos., Date, Artist, Title:\n\nNo. 1 (one week to date), April 8, 2023, Jimin, \u201cLike Crazy\u201d\n\nNo. 22, July 9, 2022, Charlie Puth feat.

It logs a seventh week atop the Radio Songs chart (106.9 million in audience, down 1%); rebounds 7-2 on Digital Song Sales (10,000, down 10%), which it led for five weeks; and holds at No. 4 on Streaming Songs (22.9 million, down 7%), following four frames on top.\n\nMorgan Wallen\u2019s \u201cLast Night\u201d slips 2-3 on the Hot 100, three weeks after it hit No. 1, as it tops Streaming Songs for a fourth week (35.8 million, essentially even week-over-week). It leads the Hot Country Songs chart, which uses the same methodology as the Hot 100, for an eighth week, as parent album One Thing at a Time controls the Billboard 200 for a fourth week.\n\nSZA\u2019s \u201cKill Bill\u201d descends 3-4 on the Hot 100, following seven weeks at its No. 2 high.
