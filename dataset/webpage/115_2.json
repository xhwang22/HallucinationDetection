In particular, actor Ha Jung-woo, who is drawing keen attention with his return after the propofol controversy two years ago, revealed the name of the actor whom he had wanted to work with since 2005.\n\nActors Ha Jung-woo, Hwang Jung-min, Park Hae-soo, Jo Woo-jin, Yoo Yeon-seok, and director Yoon Jong-bin attended the press conference for Netflix\u2019s original series \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d held on September 7th and told various stories.\n\nHa Jung-woo and Hwang Jung-min are two representative actors of the Korean film industry who boast outstanding acting skills and experiences, but \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d is the first time the two starred together in the same work.\n\nHa Jung-woo said, \u201cWhen I first joined my agency after graduating from college, he (Hwang Jung-min) took care of me a lot. One of the most memorable moments for me was when he attended the first press conference for the movie \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019 in 2005 to encourage me\u201d, expressing his gratitude to Hwang Jung-min, who took great care of him when he was a rookie actor.\n\nThe actor continued, \u201cSince then, I had dreamed of working with Hwang Jung-min. I didn\u2019t expect it to take such a long time. I felt grateful for every hour that I spent working on \u2018Narco-Saints\u2019 with him\u201d, revealing that he waited 17 years to have an opportunity to work with Hwang Jung-min.\n\nFlustered by Ha Jung-woo\u2019s confession, Hwang Jung-min jokingly said, \u201cWhat? You even dreamed of that?\u201d, and confessed that he had also wanted to work with Ha Jung-woo since he was younger. Hwang Jung-min even thanked \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d director Yoon Jong-bin for allowing him to belatedly meet Ha Jung-woo through this drama.\n\nIn fact, many other actors also wished to participate in the same production as the veteran actor Hwang Jung-min.\n\nYoo Yeon-seok, Park Hae-jin and Jo Woo-jin, who also appeared in \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d, also confessed that they met Hwang Jung-min for the first time through this work and showed their respect to the great senior, saying that they had dreamed of acting alongside Hwang Jung-min since a long time ago.\n\nIn response to the series of compliments from his juniors, Hwang Jung-min got embarrassed. Since then, Ha Jung-woo has expressed his deep affection for Hwang Jung-min wherever he goes.\n\nOn September 13th, Ha Jung-woo continued to mention Hwang Jung-min in an interview with the media. He said, \u201cIt felt very comfortable acting with him. Since he is a master, he seemed to have no pressure even when filming action scenes. He is always considerate of other actors so that we can act together comfortably\u201d, showing admiration for Hwang Jung-min\u2019s skills.\n\nHe also shared, \u201cI used to think Hwang Jung-min was a scary hyung, but after meeting him in person, I realized that he\u2019s warmer and more reliable than anyone else.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d tells the story that takes place when a civilian, who was falsely accused of being the drug lord who is taking control of the South American country Suriname, accepts the secret mission by the NIS. Since its release on September 9th, \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d, which features many talented actors, has been enjoying its box-office success.\n\nSource: insight"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/ha-jung-woo", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nHa Jung-woo (Kim Sung-hoon) was born on 11 March, 1978 in Seoul, South Korea, is an Actor,film director,screenwriter,film producer.

His breakthrough to stardom came with the role in Na Hong-jin's serial killer film The Chaser (2008). One of the leading actors of his generation in Korean cinema, Ha Jung-woo showcased his versatility across movies from many genres: road movie My Dear Enemy (2008), sports film Take Off (2009), crime drama The Yellow Sea (2010), gangster saga Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time (2012), romantic comedy Love Fiction (2012), spy thriller The Berlin File (2013), and action thriller The Terror Live (2013). He made his directorial debut through the comedy film Fasten Your Seatbelt (2013), followed by Chronicle of a Blood Merchant (2015).\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn as Kim Sung-hoon, Ha Jung-woo came from an acting family. His father Kim Yong-gun is a well-known veteran actor who has appeared in many movies and television series, while his younger brother Kim Young-hoon (stage name: Cha Hyun-woo) is an aspiring actor. Ha has said that since he was 4 or 5 years old, he has always dreamed of becoming an actor like his father. Before entering college, Ha studied at a private acting institute and at one point had actor Lee Beom-soo as his instructor. He then enrolled at Chung-Ang University as a theater major, where he acted on the stage.\n\nIn 1998, Ha began his military service, working in the Armed Forces Public Relations Department. He put his acting experience to good use during this Time, appearing in 10 promotional films for the military.\n\n2002\u20132007: Beginnings\n\nKim Sung-hoon made his acting debut in the 2002 SBS sitcom Honest Living and his feature film debut in the 2003 film Madeleine. For the next few years, Kim's acting career was relatively low-key, appearing in several supporting roles, but not receiving a lot of attention. In 2005, Kim signed with talent agency SidusHQ and on their recommendation adopted the stage name \"Ha Jung-woo.\" He then appeared in his first starring role in the indie film The Unforgiven, a blistering critique of the physical and psychological violence within military ranks.\n\nHa's subsequent roles in controversial arthouse director Kim Ki-duk's Time and Breath brought more notice to his acting talents in Korea and overseas. His portrayal of a cool-headed prosecutor who is romantically involved with a feisty police officer played by Go Hyun-jung in the popular MBC drama series H.I.T attracted female fans and gained him popularity among the masses. He also starred in the American indie film Never Forever opposite Vera Farmiga, which garnered praise from the film festival circuit.\n\n2008\u20132009: Breakout\n\nHa's breakout came in the 2008 film The Chaser, in which he played a pyschopath character loosely based on serial killer Yoo Young-chul. The movie became a huge hit at the Korean box office, raking in over 5 million ticket sales, while also garnering high praise from critics and numerous awards from local award-giving bodies. American director Martin Scorsese, rumored to be attached to a Hollywood remake of The Chaser, has complimented Ha as having as much potential as his The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Ha followed this up with a portrayal of a charming scoundrel in My Dear Enemy that same year, showcased his versatility and elevated his status as one of the most sought-after actors in the Korean film industry. From 2008-2009, he took on diverse but compelling roles in The Moonlight of Seoul, Boat, and Take Off. Take Off, based on the Korean national ski jumping team, became one of the biggest box office hits of 2009.\n\n2009\u20132013: Commercial and critical success\n\nHa reunited with his The Chaser director Na Hong-jin and costar Kim Yoon-seok in Na's sophomore feature The Yellow Sea, which netted Ha Best Actor trophies from the Asian Film Awards, Baeksang Arts Awards and the Korean Association of Film Critics. Ha then starred in the legal thriller The Client, which evoked his early days of theater, and the director praised Ha for his \"moments of true brilliance and genius\" during the production. In early 2012, Samsung Electronics produced an ambitious PPL-frequent-film project featuring Galaxy Note, their latest Tablet hybrid mobile. Titled as Cine Note, the giant project comprises three shorts by directors Kang Hyeong-cheol, Jang Hoon and E J-yong. Ha played the leading role for all the three of the films, while celebrated musician Lee Seung-chul produced music using the device, and noted webtoon artists Son Jae-ho and Lee Gwang-soo created the film\u2019s animated content.\n\nNameless Gangster: Rules of the Time was Ha's third collaboration with longtime friend director Yoon Jong-bin, also starring acclaimed veteran actor Choi Min-sik. This was followed shortly by the unconventional romantic comedy Love Fiction opposite Gong Hyo-jin. Both were box office hits. After wrapping Love Fiction, Ha along with Gong and 14 other actors went on a cross-country walking trip from Seoul to Haenam, South Jeolla Province. Their journey was chronicled in the documentary 577 Project, denoting the total distance covered in kilometers. Ha was in charge of three aspects of the production including planning, acting and casting. He said he did it to thank fans for their support after he won back-to-back Best Actor awards at the 2010 and 2011 Baeksang Arts Awards. In Ryoo Seung-wan's The Berlin File, Ha starred as a North Korean agent in Berlin who is betrayed and cut loose in the midst of a financial espionage intrigue. He then appeared the action thriller The Terror Live, playing a news anchor with an exclusive, live broadcast on a terrorist attack.\n\n2014\u2013present: Directorial works, Assassination and The Handmaiden\n\nHa then made his directorial debut with Rollercoaster (released internationally as Fasten Your Seatbelt), based on his own screenplay about the comic interactions between the cabin crew and passengers (including an arrogant Hallyu star played by Jung Kyung-ho) of a flight from Tokyo to Gimpo International Airport which becomes in danger of crashing when the plane hits a major storm.

In 2015, Ha directed, wrote and starred in Chronicle of a Blood Merchant, a film adaptation of Chinese author Yu Hua's 1995 novel. He then appeared in one of the biggest domestic hits of the year, Choi Dong-hoon's Assassination about resistance fighters given orders to kill a Japanese army commander in the colonial era.

Though it began as a hobby in his university days, Ha began painting in earnest in 2007. His paintings, all done in a hybrid of Pop art and Expressionist styles, have been displayed in several solo art exhibitions. Critics have said his paintings, with their strong colors and interesting composition are reminiscent of those by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. \"Life as an actor is like living through an invisible war. Paintings soothe me and make me rational. It is too extravagant to say that painting is my hobby; it is rather a way for me to survive as an actor,\" said Ha.\n\nIn 2011 he published a compilation of essays titled Ha Jung-woo, Good Feeling. Besides his musings on life, Ha also wrote his thoughts on famous artists such as Pablo Picasso.
