At the time of her crowning, she was a junior majoring in marketing and management at Northwood University in Midland, Michigan, from which she eventually received her B.A. degree.\n\nWinning the title brought Gist over $200,000 in cash and prizes and automatically earned her the opportunity to represent the United States in the Miss Universe pageant where she placed as first runner up to Miss Norway, Mona Grut.\n\nThroughout her reign as Miss USA, Gist captivated audiences with her stories of being from a single parent home where she had a number of siblings and having to overcome numerous financial and social obstacles. She described the family\u2019s frequent moves in some of the roughest neighborhoods in inner city Detroit and of her homes being frequently burglarized.

Her conflicts with pageant officials became well known to the public by 1991. Toward the end of her reign she filed a $20,000,000 lawsuit against the Miss USA Organization for fraud.

Although she was not a favourite prior to the pageant, she became the clear favorite of the judges, winning the interview and swimsuit preliminaries. During the semi-finals she won all three segments. During the 1990 Miss Universe competition, she listed herself as \"The beauty queen from Hell\" as a publicity stunt (since she was born in Hell, Norway. Apart from that 'hell' also means 'luck' in Norwegian). Her runner-ups were Carole Gist of the U.S. (she is incidentally, the first black woman to ever become Miss USA), and Liseth Mahecha of Colombia.\n\nDuring her reign, she appeared in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation as \"Ensign Graham\". Grudt was also the last Miss Universe to accompany Bob Hope on his USO tour.\n\nToday, Grudt is the editor of the Norwegian wedding magazine Ditt Bryllup (en. Your Wedding).\n\nAlso, Mona Grudt came on 2nd place in the Norwegian version of Dancing with the Stars, in Norway called Skal vi danse (Shall we dance).\n\nNow she is married to American Brody Bittrick, and they have 2 children."}, {"url": "https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/gist-carole-ann-marie-1969/", "page_content": "Carole Anne-Marie Gist, the first African American woman to win the Miss USA title, was born on May 8, 1969 in Detroit, Michigan. Gist, the daughter of Joan Gist and David Turner, is of African American and Cherokee heritage. Her parents divorced when she was a young child. Gist graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit in 1987 where she had been an honor student.\n\nGist first won the tile of Miss Michigan USA in 1989 and went on to win the title of Miss USA on March 2, 1990 in Wichita, Kansas. She was the first contestant from Michigan to win the Miss USA (not Miss America) title and she also broke the five year streak of winners from the state of Texas. At 5\u201911\u201d Gist was also the tallest Miss USA. At the time of her crowning, she was a junior majoring in marketing and management at Northwood University in Midland, Michigan, from which she eventually received her B.A. degree.\n\nWinning the title brought Gist over $200,000 in cash and prizes and automatically earned her the opportunity to represent the United States in the Miss Universe pageant where she placed as first runner up to Miss Norway, Mona Grut.\n\nThroughout her reign as Miss USA, Gist captivated audiences with her stories of being from a single parent home where she had a number of siblings and having to overcome numerous financial and social obstacles. She described the family\u2019s frequent moves in some of the roughest neighborhoods in inner city Detroit and of her homes being frequently burglarized. Gist claimed that money was always scarce in her family and that poverty prevented her from taking dance lessons or learning the piano and violin. Her story contrasted sharply with the middle class backgrounds of most of her competition and of previous Miss USA crown holders.\n\nControversy, however, surrounded Gist\u2019s reign as Miss USA. Her conflicts with pageant officials became well known to the public by 1991. Toward the end of her reign she filed a $20,000,000 lawsuit against the Miss USA Organization for fraud. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.\n\nFollowing her reign, Gist co-hosted a program on the WORD gospel network. Carol Ann-Marie Gist is currently married with two children. She works for a Detroit area construction company and is a fitness trainer at Wayne State University."}, {"url": "https://conandaily.com/2021/06/23/5-most-beautiful-miss-norway-2021-finalists/", "page_content": "Nora Emilie Nakken\n\nMiss Norway 2020 Sunniva Frigstad will crown her successor at \u00c5pen Scene in Oslo, Norway on August 14, 2021.

Mona Grudt of Norway crowned by Angela Visser of Holland. Seventy-one contestants competed in this year.\n\nFor the first time, the judges' individual scores were visible to the viewing audience, adding transparency to the pageant. Also in this year, a major format change that transformed the Miss Universe competition for the next decade was introduced, in which the delegates would face an extra round of elimination on finals night: the Top 6 judges' questions.\n\nIn the Parade of Nations, television viewers got to see each delegate in national costume, as well as her swimsuit, evening gown and interview preliminary scores for the first time. Host Dick Clark also called out each country individually, as compared to the 1980s where all the delegates introduced themselves in rapid succession. This format of Parade of Nations continued until 1997. The presentation of the delegates in continental order, introduced in 1989, also continued until 1997.\n\nAlso, instead of reducing the Top 10 to the usual Final 5, the judges picked a momentary Top 6. Those 6 finalists would answer questions and the field was reduced to a Final 3 who would face the traditional final question.
