At the age of 12, he obtained his first prize in drawing at the Junior Seminary of Coll\u00e8ge St-Martial in 1966.\n\nHis parents, Georgette B and \u00c9tienne L Dodard, introduced him to painting and drawing at an early age. At the age of 15, he joined the \u201cPoto Mitan\u201d, a free art school directed by Jean Claude \u201cTiga\u201d Garoute, Patrick Vilaire, and Wilfrid \u201cFrido\u201d Casimir. They were all three famous painters of the twentieth century in the Haitian artistic sector.\n\nA brilliant start to a career\n\nAlthough he began painting at a very early age, his career only really took off in 1981. Thanks to the support of Mich\u00e8le Frisch (director of the MUPANAH at the time), the Marassa gallery in P\u00e9tion-Ville hosted his first major exhibition. An exhibition that takes place around the theme \u201cAquatism\u201d. And since then, his success has been undeniable.\n\nHis paintings, exhibited in many museums abroad, will be the subject of aesthetic debates on the modernity of Haitian contemporary art. He immediately attracted the attention of many art critics, notably in Haiti, Brazil, France, the United States, and the Caribbean.\n\nHis itinerary\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that he was an accountant by training. After these studies, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts (now called ENARTS), then the National School of Bordeaux, to study plastic arts. He ended up specializing in educational graphics.\n\nOn his return from Bordeaux, he was appointed head of the graphic department of the Deschamps publishing house. For 10 years, he was the artistic director of the ironwork company \u201cMulti-ad\u201d. This company was created in collaboration with Monique Gard\u00e8re.\n\nIn the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, he studied at the Kripalu yoga center. This approach will propel him towards the learning of the being, the spiritual, and the samurai and martial arts. He was even led to the practice of Kundo. He then studied the science of Reiki (initiation to alternative medicine).\n\nPhilippe Dodard, current director of the National Superior School of Art (ENARTS), intends to fulfill the mission that this entity has given itself since its creation in the 1980s: to maintain the reputation of the Haitian culture and the influence of its art.\n\n\u201c\u2026Improve the quality of training, upgrade the various departments and offer students the best opportunities to promote the development of their talents, refound the school in perdition, renovate the foundry (to become again at the service of the Haitian nation) and restore the monument of the Indian are, among others, the objectives set,\u201d he noted in an interview with the local newspaper.\n\nCommitted artist and entrepreneur\n\nThe cultural advisor for Elisabeth D. Pr\u00e9val (former First Lady of the Republic of Haiti), he will install on the Place Saint-Pierre and the Champ de Mars \u201cPlas timoun\u201d, an art therapy center that focuses on rehabilitating street children through the arts.\n\nAs head of the ironworks site in the reconstruction project of the iron market, destroyed in the January 12 earthquake, he is saving the pride of Port-au-Prince, this historic site classified as a national heritage. This unique reconstruction was inaugurated in January 2011. \u201cIt was a rewarding experience where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of ironwork and design,\u201d says Dodard.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Dimitry and Evelyne Craan on this restoration project, I had the pleasure of training many workers. And I am happy that the project has achieved its triple dimension: to give back, through citizen involvement, life to the city; to succeed in this challenge of human management (about 400 workers were at work) and to put in place one of the symbolic monuments of the identity of Port-au-Prince, much visited by tourists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u201cDodard of the Year\u201d prize is awarded each year to a personality of the artistic milieu who has distinguished himself or herself in an artistic or sporting field. The first winner, Philippe Dodard recalls, was Madeline Paill\u00e8re, an art critic.\n\nFranck\u00e9tienne (painter and writer), Aubelin Jolicoeur and Nancy Roc (journalists), Lionnel Abelard (Karateka), Beethova Obas (musician), the former Haitian president Michel Martelly, Edwidge Danticat, more recently, have all been awarded.\n\nDodard\u2019s work : criticism\n\nHis work sparked a debate in 2006 on the issue of Haitian art and modernism, drawing on such notables as Michel Philippe Lelebourg, Michel Frisch, Franketienne, Bob Corbett, Greg Thomas, Babacard Embou, Nkil Negou, and Legrace Benson. A large-scale exhibition of his work at the Broward Library Museum in 2006 led to the publication of the book: Dodard\u2019s Work.\n\n\u201cThis book demystifies Picasso and his authority in contemporary art. The contributors look at my African, Native American, and European-inspired work. This document reflects my very spiritual bent for art, my interest in voodoo.\u201d he says. His paintings, acrylics on fabric reflect Tiga\u2019s influence, holding the \u201cArtistic Rotation\u201d method (which \u201cPotan Mitan\u201d advocated) that goes through four stages: art, craft, technicality, and science.\n\n\u201cThe use by an artist of sensitive media: earth, clay, ceramics, paper and all disciplines of art is a source of enrichment and can push his creative sense,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nIn short\n\nWith his captivating, deep, and rebellious style, he has made his mark on the postmodern art scene. His art has given soul to the Spring \u2013 2012 collection (inspired by the painter\u2019s black and white inks) of American fashion designer Donna Karan. The two will collaborate to launch a project to develop Haitian handicrafts to bring them to an international level.\n\nIn collaboration with Mich\u00e8le Frish and Roger Jaar, he created the company \u201cJivan\u201d for the collection of jewelry inspired by Haitian culture. In 1980, he received a Rotary International Foundation grant, which allowed him to continue his work.\n\nPhilippe Dodard has certainly accomplished more than many of his contemporaries. A proven entrepreneur, his worth is now estimated at over $102 million.\n\nConsidered an ace of Haitian painting, Philipe Dodard knew how to mark his time. He is one of the few entrepreneurs to have reached this level in the Haitian artistic field."}, {"url": "https://m.haitiopen.com/story/article/amazing-art-collection-at-the-marriott-port-au-prince/", "page_content": "The Marriott Port-au-Prince showcases art created by local Haitian artisans throughout the hotel\u2019s guest rooms, corridors, great room, conference areas, restaurant and courtyard.

Many of the city\u2019s key landmarks, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building and the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, were destroyed or severely damaged. During the two weeks following the earthquake a series of at least 52 aftershocks continued to rock Haiti.\n\nFor Haiti\u2019s people, the impact has continued to be felt long after the aftershocks ceased. Lives were turned upside down and priorities reassessed. Haitians and their friends on the international stage channelled their energy into rebuilding people\u2019s lives \u2013 the country\u2019s artists were no exception.\n\nDespite its poverty, Haiti has always been culturally rich, famous for its abundance of artists and vibrant art scene. The earthquake destroyed much of Haiti\u2019s cultural heritage. Irreplaceable artwork, sculptures and historical buildings lay in ruins. However, with such a rich cultural heritage and long artistic tradition to draw on, art has since been identified as one tool for building a sustainable future for Haiti. In the aftermath of the earthquake, one of Haiti\u2019s most highly regarded contemporary artists, Philippe Dodard, who has turned his hand to everything from painting and graphic design to sculpture and metal work, was called upon to play his role in rebuilding the nation.\n\nBorn in 1954, Dodard was awarded his first prize for drawing in 1966 when he was just 12 years old. Drawing led him to painting, a passion he inherited from his mother, who used to produce copies of the classical French masters. During his twenties Dodard dabbled with various styles from Impressionism to Surrealism and Cubism until he developed his own style, Aquatisme. Through fluid water-like imagery he explored \u201cthe essence of spirituality\u201d and his relationship with people and nature. As Haiti entered a period of political turmoil during the 1980\u2019s, Dodard\u2019s style evolved once again, into what has become his signature style: Use of bold black and white strokes of ink to capture the reality of life for people in Haiti and powerful symbols from the Haitian voodoo tradition. His \u201cabstract expressionist\u201d artwork, heavily influenced by African art, aims, he tells me, to \u201cspeak to your soul and appeal, not only to your sense of aesthetic, but to what humans have inside, an essential spirituality and power\u201d, like \u201cthe beat of the silent drum that you can feel inside your body and soul.\u201d\n\nTragically, the earthquake drowned out the beat of the drum for a time. Dodard told me about his personal experience of 12th January 2010.\n\n\u201cMy life changed that day\u2026 I almost died twice. I was at the Presidential Palace and I left 20 minutes before the earthquake, thanks to my agent who called me for a meeting. I was in a car very close to the Hotel Montana where all the houses collapsed completely. My phone was working \u2013 I told him \u201cjust keep on driving, don\u2019t stay there\u201d and even though the car was bumping along and he said \u201cI can\u2019t drive\u201d, I told him to \u201cjust keep on driving, go.\u201d We passed a 15 metre wall and right after that the wall collapsed on five cars behind me.\u201d\n\nThe earthquake has had a profound impact on Dodard. Ever since, he has dedicated himself to projects which use art for the benefit of Haiti and its people. He tells me \u201csince that time I have wanted my art to be useful for my community.\u201d For the entire year after the earthquake he worked with Haiti\u2019s First Lady Madame Pr\u00e9val on a project called Plas Timoun (The Children\u2019s Place), which provided a safe place for Haitian children to express how they had been affected by the earthquake through art and learn to cope with the trauma. The children who participated in the project learned not only to cope with their traumatic past but to explore their creativity and hidden talents. Dodard is now a strong advocate of the power of art and its potential to contribute to Haiti\u2019s future.\n\nBesides Plas Timoun, Dodard has worked on other projects to help rebuild the country. He played a key role in the reconstruction of the iconic Iron Market (Marche de Fer), which served as a commercial and social hub in Port-au-Prince from 1891 until the earthquake brought it down. The new market, rebuilt with as much of the original material as possible, provides a base for almost 1,000 market traders to sell their wares and stands as a potent symbol of hope for future economic and cultural regeneration.\n\nThereafter Dodard went on to work with one of the world\u2019s most famous fashion designers, who shares a passion for Haiti and the potential of its artists. On a visit to the island, Donna Karan was inspired by his artwork, writing in her blog \u201cno one captures Haiti\u2019s heart and soul like artist Philippe Dodard.\u201d Donna Karan\u2019s Spring/Summer 2012 collection featured prints inspired by Dodard\u2019s black and white paintings and were exhibited side by side in Miami\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art. He also continues to be involved in Urban Zen, the foundation she established to help develop and market the work of Haitian artisans internationally. Dodard told me about this initiative.\n\n\u201cWith Donna and her Urban Zen Foundation we are developing artisans\u2019 skills to produce very high quality products that can be sold on the international market. Working with a designer of such a high level has helped me see how Haitian art can be promoted on the international market. We are working on developing the skills of artisans, the quality of the products and developing an understanding of how to be competitive on the international market, to ensure good service and how to conduct business sustainably.\u201d\n\nDodard\u2019s current primary focus is the National School of Arts (ENARTS). In January 2012 he received a phone call from President Martelli requesting he take on the role of Director of the School. Dodard accepted. The role is in many ways a natural progression of the various projects he has been involved in up until this point. He explains his hopes for the school.\n\n\u201cIt was a school that needed to developed, to be more professional, to be equipped and develop new spaces to be built. It is a challenge for an artist. I accepted the challenge and it is my main work now\u2026 I want to make the students aware of their role in developing the country and how they can contribute to it and make a living out of that.\u201d\n\nDodard firmly believes that, with nurturing, the emerging generation of Haitian artists can make a major impact on the world stage and on Haiti\u2019s cultural and economic regeneration.\n\n\u201cWhat we have in our culture, we can really take that to sell different kinds of products and different kinds of services: performance, theatre, music, dance, fine art, fashion\u2026 The fashion industry is big \u2013 why can\u2019t Haiti be in that market? Artisans have a big role to play in that development.\u201d\n\nSo, with memories of the earthquake still raw and its impact still keenly felt, Dodard is firmly focussed on the future and the beat of the silent drum is reverberating more powerfully than ever.\n\nThis article was originally published in Issue 4 of The Caribbean Property Investor magazine.

Pioneers of the movement such as Nils-Udo became famous for creating site-specific sculptures and installations from found natural materials, then documenting his works with photography.

Her most famous work, titled Wheatfield, a Confrontation, was created during a four-month period in the spring and summer of 1982. With the support of the Public Art Fund, Denes planted a field of golden wheat on two acres of landfill near Wall Street in lower Manhattan.\n\nNow based in New York, Denes continues to work in a wide range of media.

Pr\u00e9val (former First Lady of the Republic of Haiti), he will install on the Place Saint-Pierre and the Champ de Mars \u201cPlas timoun\u201d, an art therapy center that focuses on rehabilitating street children through the arts.\n\nAs head of the ironworks site in the reconstruction project of the iron market, destroyed in the January 12 earthquake, he is saving the pride of Port-au-Prince, this historic site classified as a national heritage. This unique reconstruction was inaugurated in January 2011. \u201cIt was a rewarding experience where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of ironwork and design,\u201d says Dodard.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Dimitry and Evelyne Craan on this restoration project, I had the pleasure of training many workers. And I am happy that the project has achieved its triple dimension: to give back, through citizen involvement, life to the city; to succeed in this challenge of human management (about 400 workers were at work) and to put in place one of the symbolic monuments of the identity of Port-au-Prince, much visited by tourists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u201cDodard of the Year\u201d prize is awarded each year to a personality of the artistic milieu who has distinguished himself or herself in an artistic or sporting field. The first winner, Philippe Dodard recalls, was Madeline Paill\u00e8re, an art critic.\n\nFranck\u00e9tienne (painter and writer), Aubelin Jolicoeur and Nancy Roc (journalists), Lionnel Abelard (Karateka), Beethova Obas (musician), the former Haitian president Michel Martelly, Edwidge Danticat, more recently, have all been awarded.\n\nDodard\u2019s work : criticism\n\nHis work sparked a debate in 2006 on the issue of Haitian art and modernism, drawing on such notables as Michel Philippe Lelebourg, Michel Frisch, Franketienne, Bob Corbett, Greg Thomas, Babacard Embou, Nkil Negou, and Legrace Benson. A large-scale exhibition of his work at the Broward Library Museum in 2006 led to the publication of the book: Dodard\u2019s Work.\n\n\u201cThis book demystifies Picasso and his authority in contemporary art. The contributors look at my African, Native American, and European-inspired work. This document reflects my very spiritual bent for art, my interest in voodoo.\u201d he says. His paintings, acrylics on fabric reflect Tiga\u2019s influence, holding the \u201cArtistic Rotation\u201d method (which \u201cPotan Mitan\u201d advocated) that goes through four stages: art, craft, technicality, and science.\n\n\u201cThe use by an artist of sensitive media: earth, clay, ceramics, paper and all disciplines of art is a source of enrichment and can push his creative sense,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nIn short\n\nWith his captivating, deep, and rebellious style, he has made his mark on the postmodern art scene. His art has given soul to the Spring \u2013 2012 collection (inspired by the painter\u2019s black and white inks) of American fashion designer Donna Karan. The two will collaborate to launch a project to develop Haitian handicrafts to bring them to an international level.\n\nIn collaboration with Mich\u00e8le Frish and Roger Jaar, he created the company \u201cJivan\u201d for the collection of jewelry inspired by Haitian culture. In 1980, he received a Rotary International Foundation grant, which allowed him to continue his work.\n\nPhilippe Dodard has certainly accomplished more than many of his contemporaries. A proven entrepreneur, his worth is now estimated at over $102 million.\n\nConsidered an ace of Haitian painting, Philipe Dodard knew how to mark his time. He is one of the few entrepreneurs to have reached this level in the Haitian artistic field."}]}
