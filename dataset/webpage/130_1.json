As Head of Ceramic Design at Glasgow School of Art in its final years, he unwillingly became \u201cthe last \u2018real\u2019 expert\u201d still teaching ceramics in Scotland, according to former colleague Ian Pirie, before the department closed in 2011. It was the last single degree-level programme in ceramics left in Scotland\u2019s art schools.\n\nBorn in Voe, Shetland, in February 1951, Bill was the second child of popular shopkeepers Maggie and John Brown. He left the islands when he was 18 to do a four-year diploma at Gray\u2019s School of Art, Aberdeen, becoming the first in his family to attend higher education. He specialised in ceramics and, along with Pirie, was selected for a scholarship to do a post-graduate diploma.\n\nTheir external examiner was none other than David Leach, the eldest son of the famous potter Bernard Leach. The younger Leach was so impressed with their work he recommended they apply to join the elite Craftsmen Potters\u2019 Association in London. They were accepted and became the first makers from Scotland to gain membership.\n\nBill spent the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s running a succession of potteries in Aberdeenshire and teaching part-time at Gray\u2019s. He married my mother, Anna, and had two daughters, my sister Sunni and myself. In 1984 he left his young family and moved to North Berwick, near Edinburgh, transporting a hut from outside their small cottage in Monyroads to the backyard of ceramicist Dave Cohen. He taught part-time at Glasgow School of Art, with Cohen and Archie McCall, and at Cumbria School of Art. In 1991 he left the hut, which was by then rather damp and layered with plaster dust and cigarette ash, and moved to Glasgow to take up a full-time lecturing job at GSA.\n\nArchie McCall, who became Bill\u2019s predecessor as Head of Ceramics at GSA, writes: \u201cThose who worked with him were impressed by his fierce intellect, deep knowledge and mastery of language, often including self-deprecation or a wry punchline, timed to perfection. He worked tirelessly helping students from all parts of the art school, usually long into the evenings. His advice, though often reserved for the very last minutes of any review, was always the most positive, practical and succinct, even if a gentle \u2018well, I might sleep on that idea if I were you\u2019 summed up everything there was to say.\u201d\n\nBill\u2019s teaching and research took him to many countries including Iceland, Norway, Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Russia, the United States and Australia. Although his own work explored the use of transfer printing and other industrial processes in the context of studio crafts, his interests and expertise extended to archaeological projects with the University of Glasgow, ranging from Neolithic digs on Orkney to the recreation of pots from moulds retrieved from the site of the famous Bell\u2019s pottery in Glasgow.\n\nHe also had an excellent ear for languages and music. He was fluent in Norweigan and German, and loved playing the fiddle \u2013 in particular Swedish folk tunes.\n\nThe year 2011 marked a new phase of his life, though not at first a good one. After investing decades of his life into GSA, the closure of the ceramics department left him deeply disappointed. Archie McCall recalls: \u201cOne of his most telling comments prior to the closure of the department at GSA in 2011 was simply: \u2018I don\u2019t believe that the human race spent millions of years evolving opposable thumbs just to text message!\u2019.\u201d\n\nAt this time Dad\u2019s second marriage, to Marjorie Fernie, broke down. But ever the optimist, he started making plans: a return to his native Shetland as an independent ceramics designer. The move, which he finally made in 2013, did not dampen his interest in travel and he took the chance to work with former student Sue Mifsud, who was pottery manager of the heritage pottery Ceramika Maltija in Malta at the time.\n\n\u201cHe was the lecturer with the softly spoken voice and approachable manner and never became impatient with students,\u201d Mifsud recalls. She invited him to give a series of lectures and workshops and to start rejuvenating the pottery\u2019s moulds. \u201cThe pottery is still running today with much of its success due to Bill\u2019s hard work, skill and creativity,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen back on home soil, Billbuilt a custom-made workshop and, later, a house on a croft owned by his grandparents in Voe, Shetland. On one side the croft overlooks the house in which he was born, and on the other side the view reaches across the bay to the graveyard where his parents are buried and indeed the plot where he himself would be interred.\n\nWith typical pragmatism and poetic flair, he used the ruins of his grandparents\u2019 \u2018but and ben\u2019 as a sheltered spot to grow kale and fruit bushes, and experimented with local clay and soapstone, which he collected himself. His work played on Shetland\u2019s culture and natural heritage \u2013 not to mention his acute observational skills and dry wit \u2013 and was in high demand at local galleries. He fell in love with art lecturer S\u00f3lveig A\u00f0alsteinsd\u00f3ttir, and was the happiest me and my sister had seen him for many years.\n\nTragically, he did not have long to enjoy this stage of his life. After being diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2019, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died at home on February 3, a few weeks before his 69th birthday.\n\nDad described ceramics as a \u201ctimeless material\u201d, outliving the maker and subject to re-interpretation by every successive generation.\n\n\u201cThe things we make have different meanings, the communities of makers have different places in society and a craft that is \u2018high art\u2019 in one time and place can be the lowliest of manual work in another,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever we make now may well be around in a couple of thousand years\u2019 time and will inevitably gain status in the process. Potters do have the last laugh.\u201d\n\nBill will be remembered not only as a talented artist and teacher, but also as a loving father and grandfather, who was very proud of his family.\n\nHe is survived by S\u00f3lveig A\u00f0alsteinsd\u00f3ttir, his two daughters, and three grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://autoaction.com.au/2022/09/24/rembering-bill-brown-for-more-than-the-obvious", "page_content": "REMEMBERING BILL BROWN \u2013 FOR MORE THAN THE OBVIOUS\n\nBy Bruce Williams\n\nVALE BILL BROWN\n\nAUTO ACTION is sad to acknowledge the passing of sports and touring car racer Bill Brown who died on September 23rd at the age of 81 after a short battle with illness.\n\nSeen in the above photo with a young Dick Johnson.\n\nWhile it is the two huge crashes at Bathurst in Ford Falcons that Bill Brown is widely known for, it was his success in sports car racing in the late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s that he was most proud of.\n\nIt all began for Brown competing in some club racing in Sydney during the early \u201860\u2019s, racing a Porsche 1600 Speedster at the Homebush and Warwick Farm circuits in NSW.\n\nAs a young man, Bill Brown was great mates with Spencer Martin, and indeed they remained close friends right up till his passing.\n\nIt was via this friendship that Brown got to know racer David McKay, later of Scuderia Veloce fame. David McKay was well known for preparing and racing cars and specialised in preparing cars for longer distance events and this led to some endurance drives for Brown and Martin.\n\nIn 1964 Brown teamed up with Martin for the 500 mile race at Bathurst and the pair won their class at in a Vauxhall Viva.\n\nThe relationship with McKay grew and saw Bill Brown racing in sports cars.\n\nIn 1966, he took a class victory in the Surfers Paradise 12Hour in a Volvo P1800 he shared with David McKay.\n\nThe relationship with McKay also gave him the opportunity to race the fabulous Scuderia Veloce Ferrari 250LM.\n\nThe 250LM delivered Brown many race wins. Indeed, Brown rated his greatest race victory as that of winning the 1967 Surfers Paradise 12 Hour. In that race he shared the victory with Greg Cusack.\n\nBrown also managed to prang the very valuable Ferrari at Warwick Farm in 1967.\n\nThe relationship with Scuderia Veloce\u2019s David McKay also gave him the opportunity to race another fabulous Ferrari, when in 1968 McKay imported the Ferrari Can-Am 350. The Ferrari had been converted from one of the 1967 Le Mans 4.0 Litre V12 factory P4\u2019s.\n\nOriginally imported for Chris Amon to race, Brown drove the car at a round of the Tasman Series at Longford. During the event, Brown set an Australian speed record at the tree lined Tasmanian road circuit of 182.9 MPH (294.5 Km/h), this was the fastest ever recorded outright speed at an Australian race circuit at the time.\n\nA few months later he raced the car at Bathurst and set another record for the fastest official time down Conrod straight of 181 MPH (291 Km/h).\n\nIn 1968 Brown was part of the first Holden Dealer Racing Team, racing the new HK Holden Monaro GTS 327.\n\nIt was a clandestine \u2018Factory effort\u2019 sponsored by the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper and put together by Scuderia Veloce\u2019s David McKay.\n\nAlthough a Monaro delivered Holden its first \u2018Great race\u2019 win, it was a privateer in Bruce McPhee and Barry Mullholland who took the flag first.\n\nThe best placed car of the McKay managed Holden Dealer Racing Team Monaro\u2019s was Jim Palmer/Phil West in second, while a damaged wheel put Brown and teammate Paul Hawkins Monaro out of the race.\n\nBut for most race fans, it was the two big Bathurst crashes that Brown had during the running of the 500-mile production car races that he became infamous for.\n\nIn 1969, on the opening lap he crashed the big Falcon XW GT HO on the run down the hill from Skyline after a slight touch with another competitor. It was a big crash that saw many competitors get caught up in and the race was slowed to a crawl while the wreckage was removed.\n\nAnd then in 1971, it was the huge crash at McPhillamy Park that will live long in the memories of most touring car fans.\n\nIt is a crash that is still considered to be one of the most violent ever witnessed and is regularly played in event highlight packages.\n\nWhile running competitively in the front part of the field, Brown\u2019s XY GTHO Phase III Falcon blew a tyre in the high-speed run through McPhillamy and then after losing control and slamming into the fence, the big Falcon barrel rolled along the top of the armco narrowly missing an official and slicing the big sedan in half just behind the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMost who witnessed the incident feared that Brown had been killed or at least seriously injured, but after several minutes, with the help of officials and spectators Brown emerged from the wreckage with a few minor cuts and bruises and was thankful that the big Falcon had not ended up in the crowd.\n\nBrown kept racing and in the early 1970\u2019s was still a fast peddler in 911 Porsche\u2019s and competed in the Australian Touring Car Championship races. Later his Porsche 911 carried the Grace Bros signage.\n\nDuring the \u201970\u2019s Brown continued to race occasionally at Bathurst and last competed at Bathurst in 1978, with by then former wife Sue Ransom in Ford Capri GT 3000 Mk.1.\n\nWhile he only ever considered himself an amateur racer, he was still highly regarded for his abilities.\n\nBrown retired from a successful business life several years ago.\n\nAUTO ACTION extends our condolences to Bill Brown\u2019s family, friends and those who knew him."}, {"url": "https://www.speedcafe.com/2012/03/09/bill-brown/", "page_content": "Bill Brown raced during the 1960s when racing drivers were classed as either semi-professional or weekend warriors.\n\nBrown admits that racing was a hobby for him throughout his career, but one that he took seriously nevertheless.\n\nDuring his career Brown owned and ran newsagencies in Sydney. This was a full time job for him, but one that still allowed him to race on weekends.\n\nHe was one of Australia\u2019s more well known amateur drivers, noted for his class win in Bathurst alongside Spencer Martin in 1964 and the crash at the top of Mount Panorama in 1971 \u2013 the video of which is still keenly watched more than 40 years after the incident.\n\nFor Brown, an interest in cars and racing started early, but he didn\u2019t enter his first race until he was 21.\n\n\u201cI always had an interest in cars, when I first got my licence I bought an Austin Healy but I was never allowed to compete,\u201d Bill Brown told Speedcafe.com\n\n\u201cWhen I was 21 I said to mum that I really wanted to race and told her that for me it was always a hobby and not a professional thing.\n\n\u201cSo she gave me her blessing and I started to race.\u201d\n\nBrown started to race in 1962 and it all began with Porsches at Homebush and Warwick Farm in New South Wales.\n\n\u201cI had a 1600 Super Porsche which I used to drive at Homebush,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cI was told that I drove well and was asked if I\u2019d like to have a race and I said \u2018Not really but why not\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe went to Warwick Farm and I came second in the race and it just went from there.\n\n\u201cI actually remember in those early days, driving a (Porsche) Speedster at Warwick Farm, where I was black flagged for not wearing protective goggles.\n\n\u201cI argued that there was a windscreen, but my opinion fell on deaf ears.\u201d\n\nBeing a good friend of Spencer Martin, Brown struck a relationship with David McKay \u2013 who used to race and prepare race cars \u2013 which led to some endurance drives.\n\n\u201cDavid asked me to partner Spencer in some four or six hour races driving a Fiat and various other cars,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cSpencer and I did Bathurst in the Vauxhall which we won our class in and when Spencer left to go to Bob Jane I then drove the Ferrari 250 LM for 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cMy biggest win at the time was the 12-hour race at Surfers Paradise with Greg Cusack.\n\n\u201cThe following year, in 1968, I took over the P4 Ferrari when Chris Amon came out here, then I took up driving Porsches.\u201d\n\nBrown was known for racing in endurance events but he also won the Queensland Tourist Trophy and ran in the Toby Lee Series.\n\nWhile he did much of his racing driving Ferraris and Porsches, he also drove Fords and was part of the original Holden Dealer Team (HDT) to race at Bathurst.\n\n\u201cWe went to Lang Lang (Holden\u2019s proving ground) driving the original Monaro 327 around before it was released,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cHDT ran three cars at Bathurst, we were running reasonably well but we sliced a wheel at \u2018the Cutting\u2019 which put us out of the race.\u201d\n\nBrown raced several cars at Bathurst, including the Monaro and a Torana, but he had more disappointment there than success\n\nHaving said that 1964 was Brown\u2019s best year at Bathurst, where teaming up with Martin he won his class.\n\nBack then official line honors went to Bob Jane and George Reynolds, but Brown and Martin won \u2018A Class\u2019 in a Vauxhall ahead of his teammates who came second and fourth.\n\n\u201cI was driving for Scuderia Veloce in a Vauxhall Viva and Spencer and I were able to win the class in that race,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting, I was fortunate that I knew some people who gave me wonderful support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some great cars to drive; I was able to equip myself very well.\u201d\n\nBrown drove regularly at Bathurst but they were one-off drives. He used to go to the local dealership for his cars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d basically get a car for the Bathurst weekend,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t drive it through the year; we\u2019d drive it up to Bathurst, race and then drive it back.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need too much practice; you should be able to come to grips with a car within 20 laps.\u201d\n\nIf 1964 was memorable for winning his class at Bathurst, the 1971 event made Brown famous. On lap 43 Brown had one of the biggest accidents in the history of Bathurst, going off the track at the top of the mountain slicing his car in two.\n\n\u201cThis incident still gets played 40 years after it happened,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cI was going well, I was looking after the brakes and we were running third.\n\n\u201cWe were the quickest private car. There were three works cars and we were the first privateer after them on the grid to start with.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we had a tyre problem, the tyre was rubbing.\n\n\u201cI was actually going to pit in a couple of laps, came over the top at McPhillamy went into the corner and it just went straight ahead.\n\n\u201cI guess I was doing 170 or 180 kilometres an hour.\n\n\u201cIn those days there was a bank there, I went up into the air onto the bank, there was a wooden fence there in those days, so it caught that and the car rolled down the fence.\n\n\u201cThe car rolled down and cut in two. I walked away from it and drove home that evening.\u201d\n\nWhile he got out of the car and wasn\u2019t injured the track medics wanted to take him to hospital.\n\n\u201cI went around to have a look at the car and they said they\u2019d take me to hospital, they wanted to put me on a stretcher, but I refused,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cI thought, actually I won\u2019t tell you what I said; I thought we were in trouble then there was banging and crashing and I was rested upside down.\n\n\u201cThe car didn\u2019t have a roll cage as such, I was fortunate though when I came to rest my hat was only grazed on the left hand side, I was pretty lucky.\u201d\n\nWhat was amazing at the time was that immediately following the accident the race kept running, unlike today when a car pulls over to the side and a safety car enters the track.\n\n\u201cIn those days it was a totally different event,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cIt was about a group of people getting together to race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d buy a car off the showroom floor; we bought ours at the local Ford dealer and drove it home after the event. Today cars are purpose built.\n\n\u201cIn those days there were four or five classes and we had to contend with the faster and slower cars with a field of over 60 cars.\n\n\u201cIt was a totally different race to what it is now, it\u2019s totally professional now.\u201d\n\nWhile he raced several European cars, Brown also got to race during the era of the first true Australian super cars.\n\n\u201cThere were some impressive race cars back then, the XR and the GT-HO and Holden had the Monaro,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cThey were petro guzzlers, you look at them today or drive them and they were rough.\n\n\u201cThe gear shift, there was nothing very nice about it. Today they are beautiful to drive in comparison to those big brutes of things.\u201d\n\nBrown stopped racing in the mid 1970s, but ran at Bathurst alongside his wife in 1978 before giving it away to concentrate on the business.\n\nHe has fond memories of Bathurst in 1964 and of racing several high powered cars, particularly the Ferrari P4, but admits racing throughout his life was very much a hobby.\n\n\u201cAlthough we were total amateurs we were able to achieve a bit of success,\u201d said Brown.\n\n\u201cI stopped racing to focus on the business and while I haven\u2019t done much racing since I have been invited to drive out at Eastern Creek on a couple of occasions and enjoyed it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m retired now. I sold my last business, which was a food business, about four years ago.\n\n\u201cNow I just wander around, do some travel with the family and muck around with a couple of cars.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s accident at Bathurst in 1971 (Note the race is still running despite the accident)"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Wells-Brown", "page_content": "William Wells Brown, (born 1814?, near Lexington, Ky., U.S.\u2014died Nov. 6, 1884, Chelsea, Mass.), American writer who is considered to be the first African-American to publish a novel.

He grew up near St. Louis, Mo., where he served various masters, including the abolitionist Elijah P. Lovejoy. Brown escaped in 1834 and adopted the name of a Quaker, Wells Brown, who aided him when he was a runaway. He settled in the Great Lakes region before moving to the Boston area. In 1847 his popular autobiography Narrative of William W. Brown, a Fugitive Slave was published. Its highly dramatic content is set forth in a remarkably detached style. Having educated himself, Brown began lecturing on abolitionism and temperance reform.

He averaged nearly 47 in Tests, and over fifty in first-class cricket, making 39 first-class hundreds. He would have undoubtedly played more Test cricket if it were not for the war. An unspectacular bat, he was a superb glancer, and deft placer of the ball. He had a full range of shots, however, and was hard to tie down.\n\nBrown's cricket career got off to a most inauspicious start when in his debut first-class innings for New South Wales in 1932 he was run out for a duck without facing a ball. He made a good impression in the Sheffield Shield, and to the surprise of some was picked to tour England in 1934. He had an outstanding tour; his 119 against Lancashire earned him a place in the first Test, where his second innings 73 helped Australia earn victory after Woodfull, Ponsford and Bradman had failed. He made his debut Test hundred in the second Test, as Australia experienced a rare loss at Lord's, and was promoted to open with Ponsford in the third Test where he made a useful 72. He failed in the final two Tests, but had proven himself as a Test player of class, ending up third in the Test averages.\n\nHe scored consistently on the 1935-36 tour of South Africa, with four fifties and a century in the five Tests, but was less successful in the two home Tests he played against England. 1936 saw him accept a coaching position in Brisbane and he represented Queensland from 1936-37. In 1937-38 he was appointed Queensland captain and by 1938 he was at the height of his ability, and stood out in a side marked by outstanding batsmen (Bradman, Fingleton, McCabe and Hassett). He made a century in the first Test after Australia had followed on, and he carried his bat for a superb unbeaten 206 at Lord's. He missed the third Test through injury, but was the top Australian scorer in either innings at the Oval Test so dominated by Hutton.\n\nDuring the war he served in the Pacific with the RAAF as a flight lieutenant. After the war he was not the dominating player he had been before, and he had lost possibly his most productive cricket years. He did captain Australia in their inaugural Test against New Zealand, presiding over a 2-day rout, and making the highest score of the match. In the final Test against India in 1947-48 he was most unluckily run out for 99, but was chosen to tour England with the \"Invincibles\" in 1948. He played in the first two Tests but then lost his place to Neil Harvey. He made eight centuries on that tour, but with the advent of fine young players like Morris and Harvey, he retired at the end of the following season after captaining the Australian second team to New Zealand. He was a Queensland selector from 1950-51 to 1959-60 and an Australian selector in 1952-53. In 1992 the Queensland Cricket Association elected him a life member.\n\nA likeable, popular and modest man was awarded Medal of the Order of Australia in 2000 for services to cricket. He died on March 16, 2008, aged 95, after being ill for a few months.\n\nDavid Liverman"}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/429601.html", "page_content": "Obituary, 2009\n\nBill Brown\n\nBROWN, WILLIAM ALFRED, OAM, died on March 16, 2008, aged 95. Bill Brown was Australia's oldest Test cricketer, and when he died his contribution to the country's cricket was immediately eulogised in the Australian parliament by the leaders of both main parties.\n\nThe journalist Ray Robinson called Brown \"the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia\". His approach was not one of extravagance or power, but based on an immaculate defence, out of which grew the ability to cut precisely and unfurl the occasional restrained drive. Above all, though, there was his predilection for the on side, crowned by the delicacy of his grass-hugging leg-glance. Brown was never regarded as a crowd-pleaser, though his highest first-class score of 265 not out, against Derbyshire in 1938, came at almost a run a minute. Perhaps Australian spectators never quite realised his quality: injury decreed that only five of his 22 Tests were at home, while his greatest deeds were performed in far corners of foreign fields.\n\nBrown's dairy-farmer father moved the family from rural Queensland to Sydney in 1914; by the time he was 20, the son was playing for his adopted state, making 69 against the Bodyline attack in his first season. Controversially selected, aged 21, ahead of Jack Fingleton for the 1934 Ashes tour, Brown adapted well to English conditions, passing 70 in each of the first three Tests, including 105 in the defeat at Lord's. \"The boy Brown\" was lauded by Neville Cardus in the Manchester Guardian, for playing \"with a bat as straight as a tall hat, immaculate and calm and ever so old-headed.\" Cardus added: \"He is a young man who, I imagine, never gets into a state about anything.\" Brown was even more prolific in South Africa in 1935-36, when he and Fingleton put together three century Test opening stands (and two more in the nineties), their best effort coming at Cape Town where they each made hundreds in a partnership of 233. He also joined Fingleton in the menacing squad of short legs for the bowling of Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett. An injured thumb kept Brown out of the start of the 1936-37 Ashes series but, back in England in 1938, he made centuries in the first two Tests, his 206 at Lord's being the first double by a batsman carrying his bat in a Test. \"I have seldom seen a young man play the veteran's part as easefully as Brown did today,\" wrote Cardus this time. England seemed to face the prospect of bowling at him for years.\n\nIn 1936-37 Brown had returned to Brisbane, attracted by the offer of secure employment as a car salesman. His presence provided much-needed stiffening to a vulnerable Queensland side; a year later he became captain and in 1938-39 he hit 990 runs in six Sheffield Shield matches at an average of 110. But Brown had other enemies to face now besides England: he joined the Royal Australian Air Force, serving as a pilot of transport and supply planes in the Pacific and achieving the rank of flight-lieutenant.\n\nHaving captained the Australian side to New Zealand in 1945-46, where the single representative match was accorded Test status retrospectively, Brown missed all of the following season's Ashes series because of a broken thumb. During the inaugural visit of the Indians to Australia in 1947-48, he gained notoriety because of his carelessness in being twice run out at Sydney by Vinoo Mankad for backing up too far, initially in the Australian XI game in which Don Bradman scored his 100th hundred, and then again in the second Test. Fifty years later, Brown was characteristically insisting that the incidents were his own fault and that the bowler had warned him on each occasion. On top of that, he was run out in the fifth Test on 99 (his only home Test fifty) by a smart return to the keeper from Mankad. Running out the non-striker while he is backing up is still known as \"Mankading\" in Australia.\n\nBrown was part of Bradman's great 1948 team in England, but the successful opening partnership of Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris meant that he was moved to the middle order and then dropped after two quiet Tests, even though he averaged 57.92 for the tour overall, with eight centuries. He retired in 1950, having already opened a sports store in Brisbane, which was an immediate success. He was a state selector throughout the 1950s and a national selector in 1952-53. Brown grew old gracefully, attending the Brisbane and Sydney Tests annually with dignity and wry self-deprecation. \"He was the most reticent cricketer I've ever known,\" said the writer David Frith. \"Not just modest, but intensely modest. Even when he came to the press box at Lord's, he wouldn't talk about his batting there. He wanted to talk about the other people. It was sad in a way.\" Brown, the last surviving pre-war Wisden Cricketer of the Year, was much admired by the modernday Australian team, and Steve Waugh would get him to present the baggy green cap to Test debutants.\n\n\u00a9 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"}]}
