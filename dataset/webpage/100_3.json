He is not an active politician ever since.\n\nLife and work\n\nTathagata Satpathy is the younger son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy and Devendra Satpathy. He is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.\n\nIn 2000, Satpathy joined the Orissa Gana Parishad ( a non political outfit), and served as its secretary general. After Naveen Patnaik got elected in 2000, Satpathy had used his newspaper Dharitri to criticise his policies which he does even now. In March 2004, just before the 2004 Indian general election, Satpathy reconciled with BJD. He said that he was forced to quit OGP due its changing into a political party as also forming an alliance with Janaki Ballabh Patnaik-led Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nHis nephew Suparno Satpathy had unsuccessfully contested him in 2014 for the office of MP Lok Sabha, Dhenkanal.\n\nIn March 2015, Tathagata Satpathy became the first Indian Member of Parliament to hold an official \"Ask Me Anything\" session on the content-sharing website Reddit. In April, Satpathy came forward in support of net neutrality, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) come out with a consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services. In December 2015, Satpathy had supported a bill to decriminalise homosexuality. The bill was introduced by INC leader Shashi Tharoor. But, it was defeated with 71 against, 1 abstaining and 24 in favour.\n\nViews and opinions\n\nOn net neutrality\n\nIn March 2014, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a formal consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services and whether telecom operators should be allowed to charge separately for some messaging apps. Soon afterwards, Tathagata Satpathy wrote an open letter to TRAI stating his support for net neutrality. In the letter, he said such a policy would hinder the Digital India project and kill new startups. He said that he used such apps to interact with his constituency and this policy will hinder his functioning as a representative.\n\nOn legalisation of cannabis\n\nTathagata Satpathy has criticised the ban on cannabis in India, while pointing out the long history of its usage as a ritual and recreational intoxicant. He has said that cannabis was banned in India while alcohol was not, because of \"an elitist bias\" as cannabis was a poor man's drug. He has said the addiction depends on person's character and not on the intoxicant. He has suggested an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to allow recreational and medicinal usage of marijuana. During his \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit in March 2015, Satpathy admitted that he smoked cannabis when he was young. In August 2015, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, he proposed the decriminalisation of cannabis. In December 2015, he repeated his proposal during the winter session, saying that banning cannabis has forced villagers to turn to alcohol.\n\nOn homosexuality and moral policing\n\nTathagata Satpathy has condemned the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality in India, calling it \"archaic\" and called for its repeal. He had supported a bill introduced by INC MP Shashi Tharoor to decriminalise homosexuality during the 2015 winter session of the Parliament. When the bill was defeated, Satpathy called it a very sad day. Satpathy has also condemned moral policing and called for a repeal of laws banning pornography in India.\n\nOn privacy and Aadhaar\n\nTathagata Satpathy has raised concerns that the Aadhaar project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future. He has questioned why a new identity card project was created despite having several identity cards systems. He has also criticised the decision to present the Aadhaar Bill, 2016 as a money bill. He pointed out that although the bill allows the sharing of biometric under circumstances of national security, there was no concrete definition of national security included in the bill.\n\nOn religious laws and missionaries\n\nSatpathy supports the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India. He has criticised those current laws which are based on various religions, saying that the world is moving beyond religious scriptures and such laws only divide the society. He has also said that a lot of faith-based foreign aid comes to Odisha through missionaries. They offer the poor Dalits free education and jobs, this results in mass conversions to Christianity. Satpathy has said that politicians should use the dictionary definition of secularism to avoid confusion.\n\nOther opinions\n\nSatpathy has supported the inclusion of Members of Parliament under the Jan Lokpal Bill to curb corruption. In December 2015, he criticised the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 during a debate, saying that the government was favouring big corporations with such laws. He has also criticised the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana calling it flawed and that it looks good only on paper. He said it forces him to choose only 8 villages from his constituency for development out of 3000. Satpathy has opposed the proposal to make Hindi the national language.\n\nSatpathy has criticised the construction of new nuclear power plants in India, claiming that most of the world was now moving away from nuclear energy. He has also claimed that Areva nuclear firm of France sold outdated technology to Maharashtra. He has also said that the centre should release the data regarding the safety of nuclear power plants as they are in other countries."}, {"url": "https://www.livemint.com/Politics/cEdbfFmpXQ6GNImduzrRTI/Who-is-Tathagata-Satpathy.html", "page_content": "New Delhi: Amidst the cacophony of aggressive voices from both the government and the opposition during the debate on the Jawaharlal Nehru University row and the death of Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula, the speech by senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Tathagata Satpathy came as a breath of fresh air.\n\n\u201cI am heartbroken to say that the youth of the country doesn\u2019t deserve us. We are the most undeserving set of people to be in this House today,\" Satpathy, who represents Dhenkanal Lok Sabha constituency in the Lok Sabha, said.\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cI am not interested in taking sides with any of these parties. I am here to hear who has a word of solace and point of solution to the problems that the nation is facing today. Is it only votes that matter? Is it just us and them?\"\n\nHis speech went viral on social media with people praising him for taking the matter above politics. This is not the first time that Satpathy has stood out among other parliamentarians. On several other occasions in the past, he has articulated his views on women\u2019s reservation, crimes against women, net neutrality, Section 377 and even legalisation of cannabis.\n\nDuring an AMA (ask me anything) session on Reddit last year, Satpathy admitted that he had smoked cannabis. \u201cWhile in college, I have smoked (and unlike Bill Clinton have inhaled) cannabis many a times. In villages of Orissa, many people openly smoke and, as their representative, I am not entitled to be judgmental.\"\n\nSpeaking to Mint after his speech in Parliament, Satpathy said he speaks his mind, does not fear controversies and believes in change through debate.\n\nThe 59-year-old, also the chief whip of the BJD, is the son of Odisha\u2019s only woman chief minister Nandini Satpathy. He is currently serving his fourth term as a member of the lower house of Parliament. A journalist by profession, Satpathy is the owner and editor of leading Odia daily Dharitri and English daily Orissa Post.\n\n\u201cWe have been harping on rights for far too long. Time has changed to expose the wrongs,\" Satpathy said. He added that it is time politicians start talking truthfully and make citizens conscious of their duties and responsibilities. \u201cIndia is going through a churning. I am an optimist. I see good times ahead.\"\n\nEven during the monsoon session last year, when 25 Congress MPs were suspended, Satpathy spoke up in the lower house and made a strong plea against taking up any legislative business in the absence of MPs from several opposition parties, including Congress.\n\nThough Satpathy does not have a personal Twitter or Facebook account, his office runs a Twitter account on his behalf at @SatpathyLive. \u201cI am more a print media guy. I regret to say that I am not very social media savvy, though I am very social. I love to sit down with my friends and chat,\" he said.\n\nHis attendance record in the current Lok Sabha has been 93% as opposed to an average of 83% for parliamentarians. In the 16th Lok Sabha, he has participated in a total of 34 debates and asked three questions, according to the New Delhi-based PRS Legislative Research.\n\n\u201cParliament is partisan when it comes to giving more time and importance to leaders from parties. Someone like Satpathy would be heard and much more noticed outside Parliament than inside. His is a sane and rational voice. The point that he made on Tuesday about us and them is very critical.

The beauty of this country is in its pluralism and inclusiveness. For a country like India, its government should and is duty bound to uphold this composite culture. It is for this reason that constitution has made specific provisions related to religious freedom, languages, ethnicity, and so on.\n\nLanguages especially are an eccentric part of this diverse culture and thus an entire part XVII is dedicated to role of the Union and the states as far as language is concerned.\n\nThe argument on language is not new in India. Early from the day of Periyar opposing Rajagopalachari\u2019s Hindi education in TN schools to constituent assembly debates on Hindi to the very recent anti-Hindi protests by Karnataka Rakshana Vedike on Namma Metro signings, we have seen numerous examples of language activism.\n\nLatest to join this bandwagon is a BJD MP from the Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, Shri Tathagata Satpathy. He has stirred the hornet\u2019s nest on Twitter by bringing back this debate.\n\nIt all started on 11th August, with Panchayati Raj minister Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, who is also a BJP MP from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, sent a letter to Shri Satpathy on \u201cNew India Manthan\u201d programme being undertaken by the ministry. The letter outlined about the programme details to be held between 21st Aug to 25th Aug, 2017 at all district as well as panchayat levels. It also requested Shri Satpathy, being an MP, to attend one of the district level programme. Here is a copy of the letter:\n\nAs a response to the above letter, Shri Satpathy tweeted the following:\n\nReplied in Oriya to Hon\u2019ble Union Minister Sri Narendra S Tomar expressing inability to comprehend his Hindi letter.\n\n-TS pic.twitter.com/gRVfgUrOln \u2014 Office of T Satpathy (@SatpathyLive) August 19, 2017\n\n\n\nWhat has particularly caught the eye of the national media and tweeples is Shri Satpathy\u2019s reply to Shri Tomar in Odia.\n\nFor our non Odia readers, a translation of the letter is as follows:\n\n\u201cRespected Shri Tomar mahodaya I have received your letter and I am thankful to you for that. I regret in conveying you that because your letter was written in Hindi, I could not understand it. I would like to note here that, because our state is a category C state, please exchange communications in either English or Odia with us. May Lord Jagannath bless you\u201d\n\nSounds fair, right? If someone sends a letter in his native language, the recipient has a \u2018right\u2019 to reply in his own native language. Shri Satpathy is being lauded for this act too.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the matter in its entirety, beyond what meets the eye.\n\nHere is the constitution on communication between states and union \u2013 there is Article 346 titled \u201cOfficial language for communication between one state and another or between State and the Union\u201d. In very clear and unambiguous term, the article states that the official language of the Union shall be the official language of communication between Union and states. Article 343 confers Hindi as the official language of the Union along with English. Further, Article 346 suggests that the communication between states can be in Hindi, provided both states agree to it.\n\nA fine reading of article 343 will suggest that Hindi was originally planned to be the only official language of India, with English being the other official language for period of 15 years from the date of commencement of Constitution. However, as agitation against Hindi intensified, the union govt passed Official languages act \u2013 1963, which made English a permanent official language along with Hindi.\n\nFurther to Article 346 on communication between union and states, the act clarified that English to be used for communication between union and a state which has not adopted Hindi as its official language. It is this provision, which Shri Satpathy cites in his letter.\n\nNow, if Shri Tomar has violated the provisions of the act by sending a letter in Hindi to Shri Satpathy, he could have pointed that out in a dignified way instead of playing it to gallery and replying in Odia, which also violates the same act, which Shri Satpathy points out and draws allegiance to.\n\nYou can\u2019t use Odia to communicate between the state and union \u2013 neither by the constitution nor by the said act. It has to be either Hindi or English. This is besides the point that Shri Tomar can argue that his letter was not a communication from Union to state, but from a union minister to a fellow MP.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the legality of the matter \u2014 seemingly both Shri Satpahy and Shri Tomar might have violated that \u2014 which is of importance here. Shri Satpathy has gone one step ahead and attributed some undignified racial slur against Hindi speaking people.\n\nAs per the BJD MP, Hindi speaking people are best suited for being a car park attendant or a lift operator only:\n\nHindi = at best, car park attendant or lift operator. English = access across social and national borders. TS \u2014 Office of T Satpathy (@SatpathyLive) August 19, 2017\n\n\n\nNow this is where his intentions go for a toss.\n\nSo was it violation of an act or a constitutional provision by Shri Tomar which he was protesting against, or was it an agenda against Hindi and Hindi speaking people? Not just that, dignity of labour should be respected and should not be attributed to racial slurs, something which Shri Satpathy, born with a silver spoon, who draws his political influence from his mother who was the Chief Minister of Odisha, will never understand.\n\nWhen called out for this unsavoury comments a certain class of people, he claimed that he was doing it to fight for his mother tongue:\n\nFighting for my mother tongue sounds disgusting and undignified to you, is it? TS \u2014 Office of T Satpathy (@SatpathyLive) August 20, 2017\n\n\n\nIt may be worthwhile to note here that BJD party president \u2014 a party to which Shri Satpathy belongs \u2014 who also happens to be the CM of Odisha, Shri Naveen Patnaik, is not able to read, write and speak Odia, the official language of Odisha.\n\nWill Shri Satpathy take his fight for his mother tongue to his chief\u2019s door if he is actually fighting for it and not mere posturing to earn brownie points on social media?\n\nAnd coming back to the legality and constitutionality, to which Shri Satpathy seems to draw allegiance to (and he should), he on time and again has refused to abide by the 113th amendment of constitution, which renames \u201cOrissa\u201d to \u201cOdisha\u201d and \u201cOriya\u201d to \u201cOdia\u201d.\n\nThis is what he said when pointed out about the same:\n\nFor me: Orissa / Oriya. Forever. TS \u2014 Office of T Satpathy (@SatpathyLive) August 19, 2017\n\n\n\nIn fact, an English daily published from Odisha, of which Shri Satpathy is the editor, has retained the name \u201cThe Orissa Post\u201d and deliberately prints \u201cOrissa\u201d and \u201cOria\u201d in all its text.\n\nSo, Shri Satpathy, you can\u2019t invoke constitution and acts selectively suiting your own convenience while proudly proclaiming to refuse to abide by the same on other occasions. Remember, if you don\u2019t care about 113th amendment, then Shri Tomar can say the same to your objection based on Official languages act.\n\nThe issue of language is close to heart of many, but please behave like an MP and show some dignity to the post you hold, if not to yourself. Having a rebellious attitude is fine, but breaking law publicly to show that you are a maverick is very unbecoming of a public representative.\n\nLet all language flourish and let us all play a part in uplifting our language without demeaning other languages.

A language officially recognized, or \u201cscheduled,\u201d in the Indian constitution, it is also the main official language of the Indian state of Odisha (Oriya). The language has several dialects; Mughalbandi (Coastal Odia) is the standard dialect and the language of education.\n\nOldest of the eastern group of the Indo-Aryan family, Odia is derived from Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. Odia arguably dates back to the 10th century ce, though it was almost indistinguishable from Bengali until the 11th century. The first poetic classic was composed in the 15th century, and literary prose began to take shape in the 18th century.\n\nBritannica Quiz Languages & Alphabets\n\nOdia has been heavily influenced by the Dravidian languages as well as Arabic, Persian, and English. Its lexicon has been enriched by borrowings from these languages as well as from Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Sanskrit. Words borrowed from Sanskrit occur in two forms: tatsama (close to the original form) and tadbhava (remote from the original form).\n\nOdia allows compounding, but unlike Sanskrit it does not allow elision. The use of compounds is more a feature of written than of spoken Odia. Odia has 6 pure vowels, 9 diphthongs, 28 consonants (3 of them retroflex), 4 semivowels, and no consonant-ending words. The written form uses three diacritics: visarga, anusvara, and candrabindu.\n\nOdia grammar distinguishes between singular and plural number; first, second, and third person; and masculine and feminine gender, although the gender of the noun has no morphological consequences for the pronoun and the verb. It is an inflectionally rich language. Nominals carry number and case inflections, while adjectives carry inflections indicating degree and, for the tatsama adjectives, gender.\n\nOdia is a subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV) language with a three-tier tense system. The finite verb agrees with its subject in person and number and also marks the honorific form. The main moods are indicative, imperative, interrogative, and subjunctive. The copula does not surface if the sentence is in the present tense. It is possible for main clauses\u2014and some subordinate clauses\u2014to be without a subject.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Other historical changes include the loss of some plural markers and some postpositions. The indirect speech, relative clauses, and passive constructions found in English have emerged in Odia, although these are considered nonstandard forms. New discursive forms such as the essay and news reporting and analysis have also come to Odia from English.
