The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux. While shy guy Andy wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ever-increasing limelight, he let his memorable drum parts do the talking. By 2010 Fall Out Boy were burned out and a three-year hiatus was quickly announced.\n\nAndy fed his passion for heavy metal and hardcore punk, recording and touring with bands including Enabler and Earth Crisis, and forming heavy rock band The Damned Things with Trohman. Andy still uses downtime from Fall Out Boy to play with hardcore band, Sect. Fall Out Boy returned refreshed and fighting fit in 2012, releasing three chart-topping albums in a row, culminating in this year\u2019s Mania.\n\nWhile the band\u2019s sound has evolved through the years, their core DNA remains, and Fall Out Boy continue to sell out arenas around the world. We hooked up with Andy Hurley during the recent UK tour to learn more about the band\u2019s incredible journey.\n\nYou joined Fall Out Boy around 2003. What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/andy-hurley-33226.php", "page_content": "He studied anthropology and history in college as making a serious career in music wasn\u2019t on his mind at that time. Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/andy_hurley/early_life", "page_content": "Early Life\n\nHurley was born in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.

Turns out he had plenty to say about his kit and laying down the beats for the record. Check out part two of our interview right here.\n\n\n\nWhat kit did you use in the studio?\n\n\"I used the drum tech's kit. It was a Tama Starclassic. I can't remember everything but I know it was a 13\" rack and 16\" floor. And then I usually used a bell brass or Black Beauty snare.\"\n\nHow does that differ from what you'd use in the studio with Fall Out Boy?\n\n\"On the last Fall Out Boy record I used one of my C&C touring kits. It was for the Infinity On High tour. It just had a really good studio sound. It's hard with drum kits, especially if you use them on tour, they don't always sound great in the studio. They don't always resonate well because they can get warped while you're on tour. But it's not too different. All the sizes I used on the record are the same as I'd use with Fall Out Boy.\"\n\nWhy did you decide to use the tech's kit on the album?\n\n\"I do that a lot. I do it with Fall Out Boy too. I just think that the drum tech on a record is tuning everything and he has equipment that he's really comfortable with. And he can tune it at the drop of a hat. For Fall Out Boy we'd always have a bunch of kits and just pick which sounds the best. It's always the most important thing when you're recording - what sounds best sonically. This was the same thing, his kit just sounded awesome.\"\n\nHow do you go about getting your sound when you're using an unfamiliar kit in the studio?\n\n\"I get to figure out what it's going to sound like because you always to an hour of line checking in the studio. You're always going through getting the right sounds. So I get to sit and jam with it for a little bit and make sure that it sounds like I want it to. The only thing that ever really changes is the snares. That's a song by song thing. With this band Joe, Rob and I worked on that. Because I went into this band not knowing what the vocals were going to sound like, they had a better idea of how the snare was going to ride on the tracks. But I like the snares that I like so I always push for those.\"\n\nDo you typically know the drum sound you want before you even head into the studio?\n\n\"Yeah. Like I've always loved metal snares. They're just so heavy to me. I've been using a Black Beauty while on tour with Fall Out Boy and now I'm renting a kit because now we're a new band and we're kind of breaking even so you take what they give you. I'm super stoked with the set that I have though.\""}, {"url": "https://blogdigger.com/andy-hurley/", "page_content": "Andy Hurley is an incredibly talented musician and artist who has made a name for himself through his work in several hardcore punk bands, as well as his current role as the drummer for the rock band Fall Out Boy.\n\nBorn in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, Andy began playing drums at the age of 12 and joined his first hardcore punk band, Racetraitor, in 1996.

Today we've flagged up our two part interview with Fall Out Boy/The Damned Things drummer Andy Hurley.\n\n\n\nThe Damned Things aren't content with being part of one revival. Nope, they've got their foot in two camps. Not content with being part of classic rock's mass rise, they're also one of the latest batch of many killer 'supergroups'.\n\n\n\nAs they ready their debut album, Andy Hurley gave us the lowdown on how the Thin Lizzy loving, star-filled recorded their debut album.\n\n\n\nDid you change much around in terms of kit from what you'd use with Fall Out Boy?\n\n\"Not really. I'm using a new ride but that's about it. I used a china in the studio as well that I don't use with Fall Out Boy, but I haven't been using it live. Generally I keep my kit the same in terms of outside of the brass I keep the actual drum kit the same.\"\n\n\"We really went for a live Zeppelin big room kind of sound...\"\n\nWas it more a case tweaking rather than major overhauls?\n\n\"Definitely. Especially when we're recording there's a lot of different snares we used and we used them differently to how we would use them with Fall Out Boy. We used a lot of snares in the studio, so many I can't even remember them all. The drum tech on the record had like 20 snares to choose from. I feel like the go to is always a Black Beauty or a bell brass though. Those are always great rock snare drums.\"\n\nWas there much experimenting with your sound and kit in the studio?\n\n\"Yeah, that's important too. We really went for a live Zeppelin big room kind of sound with this. It's not to a grid, it's not all chopped up and corrected in Pro Tools. That's a big difference. I play live with Fall Out Boy too, but with music like that you definitely grid it a little bit more. But it's not too different because you're using big chunks of a song and you just use multiple takes. But I feel like we used more takes for this because we wanted to get actual complete songs.\"\n\nDid that approach take some getting used to?\n\n\"Yeah that was a big difference. It came pretty quickly though. I'm always pretty quick when we're recording. I think I had less time to learn these songs than I normally would because once we started nailing it down in the studio things were going fast and there were a few songs that were maybe 90 percent done and then in the studio we experimented with kick patterns and changing up arrangements here and there.\"\n\nDoes going for the one take approach help when you take the songs out live?\n\n\"Definitely. You learn the songs that way. You get to know them really well. And it gives the album a live vibe. That's definitely the kind of vibe that we wanted to go for. It's a lot more live sounding and raw, that 70s classic rock sound.\""}, {"url": "https://flypaper.soundfly.com/discover/a-brief-ish-history-of-the-drum-kit/", "page_content": "+ Learn to craft more compelling beats and warped, broken rhythms with Son Lux\u2019s Ian Chang. His innovative course is out now on Soundfly.\n\nIn the beginning, there was sound. Shortly after the first humans realized they could hear, someone must have had the bright idea of taking a stick and hitting it against a rock. The rest is history.\n\nAlthough the geographical and ethnological origins of the first drums have probably been debated over by anthropologists and ethnomusicologists for centuries, it\u2019s safe to say that the drum is one of the oldest instruments in human history (aside from our voice). Drums have shaped and defined cultures around the world, and have impacted how those cultures communicate and express themselves. And they continue to do so today around the globe.\n\nBut how did the modern drum kit that we know and love come into existence? The answer to that question is simple: completely by accident!\n\nImmigrants coming to America between the late 1800s and early 20th century brought their various percussion instruments with them and the modern drum is the result of this cultural mixing. So how did the drum kit as we know form and how did it evolve into what it is today?\n\nThe Creation of the Modern Drum Set\n\nThe earliest drumming traditions started on the continent of Africa. However, the drum kit itself is an American invention. During the 1840s, drummers in marching bands as well as musical theatre companies in Europe and America would use a variety of individual hand percussion instruments. In order to cover more roles, by about the 1860s, bands started to experiment with multiple percussion instruments, combining them into what was then known as a trap set.\n\nA technique known as double drumming was developed so that a drummer could play the bass drum and snare with sticks while using a pedal to control the cymbals. This pedal ended up influencing the creation of the original hi-hat, but at the time, it was known as the low boy.\n\nEventually bass drum pedals were developed, which allowed drummers to stand and play with their feet, keeping both of their hands free to play other instruments. During the early 1900s companies like Gretsch, Ludwig, and Slingerland began developing commercially marketable drum set equipment, from pedals to snare drums, brushes, and even entire kits. And, as drum equipment developed, so did the music.\n\nOriginally double drumming was a technique used to simulate the marching band sound of having two separate players playing both the bass drum and the snare drum. These simple marching beats would become more and more syncopated, due to the increasing influence and popularity of African and Caribbean rhythms.\n\nThe music that developed in the American South (New Orleans particularly) \u2014 ragtime and early jazz \u2014 was an amalgamation of both European and African cultures, traditional marching melodies, and blues-influenced harmonies combined with rhythms from the East, which had already made their way into second lines.\n\nWith new styles of music becoming associated with parties and nightlife, as opposed to the classical concert hall, the drum kit began to earn a constant place on the band stage.\n\nAs the modern drum set began to take shape, various other percussion instruments were added to the arsenal. Tom-tom drums were based on the traditional, cylindrically-shaped tuned drums of China and Japan. And early drum sets often contained woodblocks, small cymbals, and an array of other percussion instruments that could be used to make special effects for musical theatre or silent movies.\n\nDrum sets from the 1920s also frequently included beautiful paintings, as signatures of the companies and artisans that manufactured them.\n\nIn 1929, a Turkish immigrant named Avedis Zildjian III continued his family\u2019s cymbal manufacturing tradition, which had begun in 1618 in Constantinople, by setting up the first mainstream cymbal company in America. Founded in Quincy, Massachusetts, the Zildjian Cymbal Company went on to invent the most popular cymbal types used today, including the crash, ride, splash, sizzle, and hi-hats.\n\nBut their company really lucked out with the start of World War II. The increase in military bands meant that the Zildjian Company received war funds from the US Government to produce cymbals for the army and navy, while they continued to produce their mainstream cymbals. Copper and tin were both heavily rationed and regulated by the War Production Board, and Zildjan was one of only a handful of artisanal metal manufacturing companies to receive military support, though they had to reduce their master metalsmith staff to just three men.\n\nThroughout the 1930s and \u201940s, Avedis made friends with all the popular drummers of the time, including Gene Krupa, Chick Webb, \u201cPapa\u201d Jo Jones, and eventually Buddy Rich. These drummers not only marketed the company\u2019s product but helped Avedis design cymbals that would actual change the way drummers played the drums. After he created thin ride cymbals, swing drummers began to move time-keeping away from the snare drum, which had been standard in earlier marching styles.\n\nInnovative changes such as this would kick start the next era of drumming.\n\nThe Drums in Mainstream Music\n\nAs the drum set started to take form so did popular American music. By the late 1940s, swing drumming had morphed into a new form of jazz called bebop. Swing bands were usually large ensembles featuring many musicians and the drums were so big and loud that they could project over the entire ensemble. Not long after this era, jazz began to evolve into hard bop and club jazz, and large bands eventually gave way to smaller combos and ensembles.\n\nDrummers didn\u2019t need to play as loudly in these ensembles, and as recording technologies and microphones improved, drum kits were able to be recorded with greater clarity. This resulted in a greater emphasis on sound quality and musical finesse \u2014 as opposed to the steamroller energy of big band drummers. Much like punk music, bebop was the anti-establishment answer to the popular swing music of the \u201920s and \u201930s.\n\nBebop drummers started to prefer a simple four-piece setup (bass drum, snare drum, rack tom, floor tom) with the addition of one or two cymbals, and a hi-hat.\n\nDrumming would take another huge leap forward in 1947 with Roy Brown\u2019s \u201cGood Rockin\u2019 Tonight.\u201d The song was done in the jump blues style, which is rhythmically sort of like a shuffle, and makes lyrical references to \u201crock\u201d as a description of the musical style. Around the late \u201940s and early \u201950s, drummers who played on \u201crace records\u201d (78rpm blues and gospel records marketed primarily to African Americans and which would later go on to serve as the foundation for R&B) started incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythms from New Orleans and the Caribbean into a backbeat, with heavy accents on beats two and four.\n\nOne of the most popular rhythms at the time was later-dubbed the \u201cBo Diddley Beat\u201d (we did an entire article on that!) and the shuffle.\n\nOne drummer who pioneered this new drumming vernacular, thus influencing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and R&B, was Earl Palmer. Palmer is credited as being the most recorded drummer in history. He\u2019s also responsible for modernizing the backbeat and recording classic songs for Little Richard, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Roy Brown, Sam Cooke, Ike and Tina Turner, The Beach Boys, The Supremes, BB King, and many more, and has appeared on countless soundtracks.\n\nAs drumming styles continued to develop so did the equipment.\n\nIn 1963, a frustrated percussionist from the Boston Symphony Orchestra decided that commercially available sticks and mallets were not good enough and decided to make his own. That\u2019s when Vic Firth\u2019s famous drumsticks were born. Firth\u2019s company would go on to create the industry standard in stick and mallet manufacturing by patching sticks by pitch and weight as well as by creating the standard paper matchbox holster that most drumsticks are packaged in today.\n\nOnly a few years before Firth changed drumsticks forever, Remo Belli and Sam Muchnick had discovered their own innovation in drum heads. Drum heads had traditionally been made from calfskin and were hard to keep in tune due to weather fluctuations. After WWII, Belli decided to experiment with a film-based drum head and eventually settled on a polyester film known as mylar for its consistency of tone and because this material was more resistant to weather and water.\n\nThey called their company Remo. These heads were initially received with very little appreciation by the drumming community, but eventually Remo\u2019s heads caught on and became the standard for drumhead companies\n\nElsewhere in the United States in the mid-1960s, funk music was beginning to catch on, and re-establish new waves of rhythmic complexity and loop-based composition. Rock \u2018n\u2019 roll was well-established as America\u2019s favorite music, and so drummers started to become focal points for audiences and audio engineers alike. Drummers were now playing bigger venues and needed bigger and more powerful drums, as well as a wide variety of sounds to compete for attention with guitars, keyboards, and vocals.\n\nDrum kit manufacturers started to pop up all over the world, using different materials such as wood, metal, and even synthetics such as acrylic and fiberglass.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, fusion, math rock, and heavy metal had pushed the limits of what drummers could physically play, both technically and as a result of hugely expanding kits that included multiple racks of toms, gongs, and special cymbals. Bass drums even became as big as circus drums. And drummers started to use double kick pedals to play twice as fast, and even using multiple bass drums (although early jazz drummers such as Louie Bellson had experimented with that back in the late 1930s).\n\nIt seemed like drums couldn\u2019t go much further than where they were now. Except that they did innovate, they became electronic. Enter: The drum machine.\n\nDrum Machines, Drum Triggers, and The Future of Electronic Drum Sounds\n\nElectronic rhythm boxes had actually been around since the 1940s and were simple metronomic machines meant simply to accompany a pianist or guitarist playing a cocktail jazz gig. These machines came with tape loops loaded with preset rhythms that couldn\u2019t be altered very much. By the late 1970s, the innovations of companies such as Roland and Korg brought drum machines to the forefront of popular music.\n\nMarvin Gaye\u2019s classic slow jam \u201cSexual Healing\u201d was one of the first popular songs in the United States to primarily feature a drum machine (Roland\u2019s TR-808) in place of a drummer. But artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, Robin Gibbs, and even Pink Floyd had been experimenting with drum machines and electronic drums since the early 1970s.\n\nThe Simmons company would make the first successful commercially-available electronic drum kits. These kits were heavily used in the early 1980s by bands such as Rush and Duran Duran. Eventually Roland and Yamaha would go on to make their own versions of electronic drum kits. And these would become the industry standard.\n\nSome of the early electronic drums and drum machines sound terrible by today\u2019s standards. But this innovation changed music forever. The first major change was computer-generated drum sounds. Instead of trying to sample and mimic acoustic drums, the Roland 808, 909, 707, and 606 had unique synthesized drum sounds that came right machines\u2019 circuitry.\n\nThe second innovation in drum electronics that has perhaps sent us even further down the road, was the idea of quantized or computer-generated grooves. Drum machines can only play grooves that are metronomically exact without any fluctuation in the tempo, so the feel tends to be a bit rigid. Human drummers, on the other hand, can do a lot more to create flexible time feels, playing ahead of or behind the beat, etc.\n\nBut the convenience and \u201cmodernness\u201d of this new electronic sound became increasingly popular as electronic dance music, techno, synthesizer pop, and disco took over dance floors around the world in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\n\nThe way people heard rhythm changed too.\n\nDrummers still wanted ways to break free of the grid, and escape quantized tempos and beat patterns, while also being able to use this new world of synthesized drum sounds. And that\u2019s what led to the creation of drum triggers: devices that cue an electronic sample when an acoustic drum is hit. It\u2019s essentially a sensor that is usually connected to a drum machine or some sort of software.\n\nOnce again Roland found themselves at the forefront of technological advancements for electronic drums. They introduced various series of electronic drums that not only triggered drum samples but could be used as MIDI instruments to trigger any sound. Their V Drum series introduced the mesh drum head which now allowed drummers to get a more realistic feel when playing electronic drums. And Roland made numerous MIDI sensors specifically for drums, including a very popular sampler called the SPD (which features the SPD-SX and SPD-30).\n\nIn order to both perform and compete with today\u2019s top hits, which skew electronic, it is commonplace for drummers to augment their acoustic kits with an SPD or other drum machine pad, as well as with MIDI-enabled triggers.\n\nAnd what\u2019s more, they\u2019re finding acoustic ways to mimic electronic noises and sounds too with tape, stacked cymbals and objects, motorized gadgets, etc. Qasim Naqvi is known for being able to mimic the style of sampled and chopped drum beats with his acoustic kit, Graham Dunning makes electronic dance music using nothing but contact miked prepared turntables, Chris Dave is simply a one-man syncopated machine with his kit, and Ian Chang is known for his ability to apply electronic concepts to his acoustic kit via simple playable techniques.\n\nAnd just like his band mate in Son Lux, Ryan Lott, Ian Chang has a new online course out on Soundfly that breaks down and demystifies his process, and teaches his grandest pieces of advice for creating more compelling beats with abstract rhythms and warped beats. Check it out!\n\nAs the drum set continues to evolve and more musicians experiment with blurring the boundaries between acoustic and electronic music, a new company has created an innovative approach to drum triggers. Sunhouse\u2019s Sensory Percussion maps the different regions of a drum surface and allows a drummer to trigger multiple electronic samples from various regions or other spatial and acoustic parameters of the drum.\n\nThis revolutionary technology now gives drummers the complete freedom to turn any type of drum set into any instrument or sound imaginable.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where the drum set will go next, but it\u2019s clear that this instrument will continue to evolve well into the future. Now go grab a pair of sticks and make some noise!\n\nKeep on Grooving\u2026\n\nContinue your learning with hundreds of lessons on songwriting, mixing, recording and production, composing, beat making, and more on Soundfly, with artist-led courses by Kimbra, Com Truise, Jlin, Kiefer, RJD2, and our newest, The Pocket Queen: Moving at Your Own Tempo."}, {"url": "https://www.celebnetworthpost.com/andy-hurley", "page_content": "Andy Hurley\n\nAndy Hurley was born on May 31, 1980 in Menomonee Falls, United States (42 years old).
