During the six years since Dragonette\u2019s last recording, 2016\u2019s \u201cRoyal Blues,\u201d Sorbara experienced the final dissolution of the original creative partnership at the heart of Dragonette, the start of a new romantic relationship and the subsequent birth of her first child followed by the further life-disrupting chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the while wrestling with what form her musical career would take in the future.\n\nAll this upheaval audibly informs what might just be Dragonette\u2019s finest album yet, a mature, three-dimensional pop offering that grapples with the simultaneous terror and thrilling potential of Big Change before confidently accepting that sometimes Big Change is the only way forward.\n\n\u201cDragonette was on the gurney,\u201d admitted Sorbara over a post-rehearsal pint at her local microbrewery in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. \u201cI was just, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna go make some music and we\u2019ll defibrillate you if we need you. I\u2019m gonna go make this record and we\u2019ll see what it is and then maybe we\u2019ll take you off life support.\u2019 And then I was, like, \u2018No, no. I have to.\u2019 Because now Dragonette feels like mine.\u201d\n\nIt seems odd that Sorbara, 43, would be nervous about carrying Dragonette \u2014 which she formed with her ex-husband, Dan Kurtz, 15 years ago \u2014 ahead as a solo act since she began performing and recording as a solo act when she was just 16.\n\nBut once she and Kurtz decided, after making \u201cRoyal Blues\u201d together six years ago despite their recent separation, to part ways creatively, as well, it took her some time to claim the name and the legacy of Dragonette as her own. And also to realize that she was now in a position to do whatever she wanted with it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to wrap up shop. I was doing well just floating around the world writing with other people, doing collaborations,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d started writing for other artists, and I love collaborating and I love writing and I love releasing music. It was just the idea of having to put something that\u2019s just mine behind my name and being the only person in the picture.\u201d\n\nA series of encounters with potential label suitors didn\u2019t help her disenchantment, as A&R professionals offered Sorbara \u2014 whose done just fine penning top-shelf pop fodder in the past with the likes of Martin Solveig and Kaskade, as well as for other artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Keith Urban \u2014 guidance towards the future in the form of radio-ready playlists that really didn\u2019t sit comfortably with her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to diss what\u2019s on the radio but it just was, like, \u2018If I\u2019m supposed to try to get on the radio, I don\u2019t want to make music anymore,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018Music used to be better and now it sucks.\u2019 I just don\u2019t want to make that. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just not for me. Maybe I aged out of it. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like it was bad music. It was just, like, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 My soul just reacted in a way where I thought \u2018If that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do, maybe I\u2019m not a band anymore because I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA fortunate encounter with producer Dan Farber, who\u2019s worked with Lizzo and Dizzee Rascal in the past, during a \u201crandom\u201d writing trip to Los Angeles proved to be the catalyst for \u201cTwennies\u201d \u2014 even if it took Sorbara some time to wake up to that fact.\n\nOne of the first tunes the two wrote together was the sweet, bossa nova-tinged ballad \u201cThis Is All You Get,\u201d yet at the time of its creation Sorbara deemed it a bad fit for Dragonette. Yet as time moved on, it dawned on her that now that Dragonette was just her, Dragonette could sound like whatever the hell she wanted Dragonette to sound like. She could even re-embrace her \u201cinner Ani DiFranco\u201d and take the music in directions that hearken back to her formative years as a folk singer/songwriter. Farber was a willing co-conspirator.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so amazing. I\u2019ve worked with so many people over the last 10 years when I started just walking in with strangers or whatever,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never made a musical connection where all of a sudden you\u2019re speaking a creative language with such easy flow and there\u2019s no weird judginess and I\u2019m not going to censor anything and that was how it was from the very beginning. We wrote that song and I was, like, \u2018Too bad it\u2019s not Dragonette.\u2019 But with time and space and feeling like I could do whatever I want, it went from being \u2018I can do whatever I want. This has to be a Dragonette record and this is how I make this thing mine.\u2019 It was a thing I had to do to own the past 15 years of my life.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cTwennies\u201d thrown out to the world at large on Oct. 28, Dragonette returns to a Toronto stage on Thursday at the Axis Club. It\u2019s one of only a handful of gigs she\u2019s done since the last record, but the first \u2014 a trip to the Planet Pride celebrations in Brooklyn last summer which she almost cancelled at the last minute \u2014 gave her inner confirmation that she was capable of claiming Dragonette as her own.\n\nAfter performing the worldwide smash \u201cHello,\u201d a 2010 collaboration with DJ/producer Solveig that was back on the Billboard charts this year thanks to its inclusion in the TV series \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d before the Planet Pride crowd Sorbara wandered around and heard \u201cHello,\u201d her Kaskade cut \u201cFire In Your New Shoes\u201d and her Galantis co-write \u201cPeanut Butter Jelly\u201d being spun to delirious crowds by other DJs. It was a welcome boost of confidence.\n\n\u201cI wrote all these songs but I\u2019d never in my life allowed myself to feel that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like something happening outside of me and I couldn\u2019t take ownership of it and, for some reason, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because now Dragonette is me and it\u2019s mine I feel myself more holistically in this thing and I\u2019m like \u2018Wow, I did all those things.\u2019 And those songs are living on. \u2018Hello\u2019 was on the top of the f---ing Billboard charts this year. That\u2019s a f---ing classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is not tooting my own horn or saying \u2018Look at all this sh--- I did,\u2019 but for the past 10 years I never took ownership of it. I just flew down there by myself. I had no entourage. I was a floater. And then I got up onstage and I sang for the first performance and something about the aloneness of me there, I think, made me realize all of a sudden \u2018Oh, I had to do this.\u2019 I woke up to my autonomy and my ownership of all this stuff and then I kept hearing my songs and all of a sudden I owned them and I was me.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/life/together/people/2021/01/17/at-home-with-chef-cory-vitiello-dragonette-singer-martina-sorbara-and-their-adorable-toddler-barlow.html", "page_content": "What\u2019s life in lockdown with a two-year-old like? \u201cThe greatest!\u201d says Martina Sorbara. \u201cWe\u2019re really fortunate,\u201d says her partner, chef Cory Vitiello, of life at home with Barlow, who turned two in September. \u201cWe just have so much time during this critical stage to spend with him and watch him grow and enjoy every step.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s busy schedules usually mean that they\u2019re anywhere but at their home, which is between High Park and Roncesvalles Village. All that changed with the lockdown in March 2020, when Dragonette, Sorbara\u2019s indie-pop project, was put on hold, and Vitiello, founder of elevated-takeout-rotisserie-chicken joint Flock Rotisserie + Greens, faced a wave of heartbreaking April cancellations, including Biblio Bash, the Toronto Public Library fundraiser with his catering partner 10Tation, and his annual fundraising dinner for children\u2019s cancer charity Camp Ooch at Cactus Club Caf\u00e9, where he is head of culinary development for Toronto.\n\nBut the silver lining has been the extra time at home with their son. Right now, Barlow is learning to talk (\u201cHe calls me \u2018hon\u2019 and \u2018babe,\u2019\u201d Sorbara says with a laugh), and he graduated early from potty training, which the couple initiated once they realized that their normally packed schedules had dramatically freed up.\n\nIt\u2019s created plenty of time for lazy Sundays. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Sundays about us,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special. We lock ourselves in, do our crosswords and cook.\u201d On a typical weekend, the family will get up early and go for a stroll through High Park or Roncesvalles Village. They\u2019re regulars at the Roncy caf\u00e9 Reunion Island, sometimes scooping up a legendary breakfast sandwich from the Gold Standard takeout window. \u201cThey treat Barlow like a VIP,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nVitiello, a chef since he was 15, spent most Sundays during the first two decades of his 25-year career working hectic shifts in kitchens. After closing his acclaimed Harbord Room restaurant in 2016, his life changed. Now, in contrast to the harried pace of a restaurant kitchen, Vitiello savours the slower speed of cooking at home. He starts the day by picking up fresh ingredients from local merchants, such as fish market Hooked or Roncesvalles produce stand Ko Fruit Market.\n\nThough veggies and fish are usually the core ingredients of his mains, a high-quality cut of meat constitutes a special Sunday treat. Braised meats, especially short ribs, have been a favourite comfort food over the winter. While Sorbara is a pescatarian, Vitiello says he has \u201cno problem spending the whole Sunday cooking this braise that could feed 15 people, even though there is only one person in the house who eats it.\u201d Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to find some outside assistance. \u201cI usually take some to the neighbours [as a] surprise,\u201d he says.\n\nSorbara is a whiz in the kitchen, too, whipping up pastries to satisfy Vitiello\u2019s sweet tooth. She\u2019s happiest, however, spending a cosy Sunday working away on a crossword, a pastime Vitiello has picked up as well, along with his Sudoku habit.\n\nSorbara is a veteran puzzle master \u2014 she enjoys making crosswords as birthday gifts for her father, York University chancellor Gregory Sorbara. A highlight of her 2020 was receiving a thoughtful rejection from the New York Times for a crossword she\u2019d submitted that had the theme of shape-shifting. \u201cI\u2019m going to submit another one, and I have high hopes!\u201d she says.\n\nTo carve out time for themselves, they take turns putting Barlow down for his nap and to bed at night. \u201cAnd our glory time is when we finally get him down to bed and we have our evening to ourselves,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nThat\u2019s when the strategy board games come out. Their current favourite is A Few Acres of Snow, an out-of-print two-player game from 2011 based on the struggle between the French and the British to occupy Canada. Sorbara learned the game from her cousin, a board-game collector. \u201cIt\u2019s hilariously nerdy,\u201d she says. Vitiello also juggles three ongoing poker groups on Zoom: a game with friends, a game with fellow chefs and a game with \u201cthe old-timers, Martina\u2019s father and his friends.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight remains watching their baby boy grow. \u201cIn the past year, I think we have seen three different versions of him and had to say goodbye to some really sweet versions only to [witness the] birth [of] the next incarnation of who this child is,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cIt\u2019s been so special to see that growth together.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-dragonette-martina-sorbara/", "page_content": "When electro-pop group Dragonette landed on the music scene in 2007 with their debut disc, Galore, Canadian radio was busy taking the charts hostage with unstylish, postgrunge burnout bands (think Our Lady Peace and Finger Eleven). Fortunately, Martina Sorbara, Dragonette\u2019s frontwoman, lyricist and creative director, came along. She changed the EDM-challenged and glamour-deficient musical landscape of CanCon for the better.\n\nDragonette \u2013 which went from a trio to a solo act, owing to Sorbara\u2019s divorce with the band\u2019s former bassist \u2013 reframed Canadian music culture as a chic hub that went beyond the plaid-plagued, Sk8er Boi aesthetic of the time. Sorbara\u2019s slick video concepts (think Bj\u00f6rk meets BTS), highly danceable choruses (Cyndi Lauper once dubbed Dragonette, \u201cthe future of pop\u201d) and forward-fashion sense (which prompted a collab with designer Jean Paul Gaultier) presented the world with a fresh example of Canada\u2019s musical DNA \u2013 one that integrated dance, soul, visual art and fashion.\n\nOn the cusp of Dragonette\u2019s fifth album, Twennies, and the album release party at the Axis Club in Toronto on Nov. 16, the Italian-Canadian talent dishes on motherhood, her new-found creative control and making art in the digital age.\n\nWhat is motivating you most while fronting Dragonette alone postdivorce?\n\nI\u2019m realizing how much I have to offer and all the self-worth that comes with that. I had an eye-opening experience with a big producer \u2013 who I won\u2019t name. I was in the studio with him and he couldn\u2019t play chords to a certain song, he just wasn\u2019t getting it. I had so much patience for him fumbling around. In the old days, I wouldn\u2019t dream of showing a guy how to play something but at a certain point, I asked, \u201cCan I try?\u201d and played the chords easily. I realized that for some reason, I had to dim myself in the past because I was presuming knowledge that isn\u2019t even there \u2013 presuming he knows better than me. I realize that this experience with the producer was just PTSD. Now, I\u2019m just taking ownership and not being the host for any parasites any more.\n\nThis album possesses nostalgia for a time with no social media. Why is this theme important to you?\n\nWell, the digital onslaught happening right now does make you nostalgic, doesn\u2019t it? Remember a night out with no photos and just a flip phone? Think of the hours of your life unaccounted for because you\u2019re just looking at your phone. Not having your mind think in a digital way is kind of a relief too. The angle that we\u2019re looking at things [with] is warped \u2013 our experience is constantly shifting into that question: \u201cIs this social media? Or real life?\u201d I feel like we\u2019re constantly flipping from our brain eyes to our screen eyes.\n\nDragonette\u2019s album covers and videos look like they were born for Instagram and TikTok. Does the vast number of references you see now cultivate or confuse your vision?\n\nYou can have your mind blown away multiple times a day online but sometimes, you have to realize that your mind doesn\u2019t actually get blown away because you\u2019re just desensitized to the amount of colour and action you see on screen. Artists have this double-edged sword with social media because there\u2019s just so much of it and it\u2019s hard to put it in any kind of mental Rolodex and think, oh this is so inspiring! A certain aesthetic on Instagram and TikTok might be hard to get excited about because once it\u2019s out there you feel like it\u2019s already been done.\n\nWhich pieces of art in your own collection fuel you?\n\nA piece of work from [Toronto-based artist duo] the Broadbent Sisters. I found out about it because I worked with their brother, [artist] Justin Broadbent, for album cover art and he had a photo of their work on his computer. The image is a rainbow staircase decorated with all these flowers around it. I\u2019m also obsessed [Mallorca-based] artist Louise Despont \u2013 who uses ink and pencil on repurposed ledger paper \u2013 I have a piece that looks very tribal. I also have a portrait of a cat by [London-based] artist Christopher Page.\n\nAside from creating songs, you also make art. What mediums have you been in to lately?\n\nI\u2019m working toward having my own exhibit. I\u2019m working on drawings and sculptures. I have a series of faces with numbers on them. It\u2019s almost like hidden faces and expressions. I have line drawings \u2013 one is of a disco ball and I\u2019m doing these big pen drawings that are taking more than 12 hours to finish. I\u2019m also making ceramic necklaces and before the pandemic I made a piggy bank shaped like a vagina.\n\nYou grew up in what you called a hippie commune in British Columbia and made guitars with your hands. Are you doing DIY craft lessons with your son?\n\nI\u2019m so obsessed with making things. It\u2019s my whole reason of living. I try to do crafts with my kid but I also don\u2019t want to force him enjoy the same things that I enjoy, but I would love it if he was an obsessive maker too. I\u2019m still learning about how to be a mom. In terms of inhabiting the music-making persona of Dragonette \u2013 having a baby was also not clear to me. I didn\u2019t understand. I felt like my body cleaved into two different people.\n\nHaving [Chef] Corey Vitello as a partner must come with perks. What are the best dishes he\u2019s made you so far?\n\nWe had morels growing in our garden and I picked them and made him make me just a very simple morel pasta \u2013 that felt very special because they are so hard to find. He was developing a dish of miso, trout with asparagus and enoki mushrooms that was beautiful. He\u2019s finishing his cookbook soon so a lot of the food we eat is in that. This spring at our house he was doing food shoots downstairs and I was in the studio making music, so it was intense.\n\nYou have a slew of fashion-inspired songs like Fire In Your New Shoes, Big Sunglasses, New Suit and T-Shirt. Where do you like to shop?\n\nVSP Consignment. I like treasure hunting because it\u2019s so hard to shop for new clothes. When I see five of the same outfit on a sales rack, it\u2019s a real turn-off \u2013 that\u2019s why I buy vintage. I wasn\u2019t watching Beverly Hills, 90210, Sex and the City or reading Cosmo and getting socialized to be obsessed with the shoe and the purse or any accessories when I was growing up, so that affects the way I do things. I have such a different relationship with fashion. I have a lot of fun putting together quirky, unique outfits but I\u2019m not looking at trends."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/martina-sorbara", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMartina Sorbara was born on 13 November, 1978 in Toronto, Canada, is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

Rating: NNNNN\n\nmartina sorbara\u2019s wildly colour-ful, whimsically decorated loft in downtown Toronto is a bit like Pee- wee\u2019s Playhouse. There\u2019s the orange drum kit and two pianos. There are two guitars crafted from scratch by Sorbara herself, each bearing intricate designs matching tattoos on her neck and right hip.\n\nAdd a vintage mint-green Singer her grandma gave her, her sketches, photography and clothing \u00ad\u2013 yes, also created by Sorbara \u00ad\u2013 and you get the sense that this is an artist with uncommon range.\n\nBut at the moment, it\u2019s the rainy-day pop on her charmingly understated second disc, The Cure For Bad Deeds, that\u2019s generating attention. And that\u2019s because Sorbara \u00ad\u2013 when teamed with percussionist sidekick Adam Hay \u00ad\u2013 holds a funny sway over people.\n\nA recent Rivoli showcase, stuffed to brimming with habitually blabby agents, publicists, record company reps and other industry types, was a marvel of good behaviour. Sorbara, moving between guitar and keyboard, silenced the room and kept it silenced until the end.\n\nSorbara\u2019s upper-register voice, even when breezily relaying everyday scenarios, carries the pathos of a torch singer six bourbons into her night.\n\nYet the 22-year-old insists, \u201cI don\u2019t know where that sadness comes from, because I have such a satisfying career and life. I don\u2019t mean to write sad songs. They just seem to come out that way.\u201d\n\nSigning a record deal, then endlessly touring and promoting herself \u00ad\u2013 the obvious next step \u00ad\u2013 isn\u2019t a notion Sorbara is entirely comfortable with.\n\nSinger sewing machines and Sorbara\u2019s much-loved fuchsia couch (where visitors to her pad must sit for a photograph while wearing a matching pink coat) don\u2019t travel well in the back of a U-haul.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the road, I just think about going home,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut then as soon as I get home, I want to play for more people.\n\n\u201cI have this faith that everything I\u2019m doing, whether it\u2019s sewing or making a lamp, feeds the songwriting, even if it just provides a form of meditation,\u201d Sorbara says, curling up in her kitchen chair.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be able to support myself doing something I love. That way I can continue to do other things that won\u2019t bring in money, like guitar-making,\u201d which she says she does not so much to achieve a unique sound but because she grooves on sculpting mahogany.\n\nThanks to her progressive parents, Sorbara has been immersed in music and art literally forever. She, her twin brother and four other siblings attended the Waldorf alternative school in Thornhill from kindergarten on. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most well-rounded school,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I would definitely send a kid of mine there. What they teach is what I consider most important \u00ad\u2013 art.\u201d\n\nHer launch into professional music happened coincidentally enough. According to Sorbara, her dad \u00ad\u2013 an MPP with no connections to the music world but a passing acquaintance through his political office with TV hosts Paula Todd and Steve Paikin \u00ad\u2013 asked for their recommendation of someone \u201cnot too weaselly\u201d in the business to forward an early demo tape to. The Studio 2 hosts suggested Sony A&R senior VP Mike Roth.\n\n\u201cAround three or four years ago, I met with Mike Roth and he said he liked my stuff and mentioned a development deal, but nothing ever happened,\u201d Sorbara says.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw Martina perform,\u201d Roth recalls, \u201cshe played guitar like Bruce Cockburn, sang like Kate Bush and then she told me she had built the guitar she was playing. I was, like, \u201cOh, my god.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to be a musician. She was going to spend a year in Europe, and so my attitude was \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m here.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the wake of that,\u201d Sorbara continues, \u201cI made Unplaceables (her now-unavailable debut) just to have something on hand and to get a sense of what\u2019s involved in making records. It was very low-key, just me and my guitar and piano.\u201d\n\nFollowing the development deal, signed in 98, Sorbara, at Sony\u2019s request, paired with several producers \u00ad\u2013 Philosopher King Jon Levine, Matt DeMatteo and Dave Martin \u00ad\u2013 to lay down demos. Sorbara recalls the experience as enlightening, saying she especially enjoyed the sessions cut with DeMatteo, which included a cover of Madonna\u2019s Like A Virgin.\n\n\u201cI learned that the stuff I write can go in a million different places,\u201d Sorbara says. But both Roth and Sorbara agree the results weren\u2019t electrifying. Roth says a Sony-Sorbara pact \u201cmight still develop. I\u2019m keeping close tabs on what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Sorbara says maybe, maybe not.\n\nSorbara\u2019s fast track might have paused there had it not been for the 99 Blue Skies Folk Festival just outside Kingston, which both Sorbara and Moxy Fr\u00fcvous singer/percussionist Jian Ghomeshi were playing. At that moment, Sorbara was ready to get serious with another record while Ghomeshi, already a veteran performer, was looking to explore other areas of the business.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s unique about my relationship with Martina,\u201d says Ghomeshi, who also manages the singer, \u201cis that before it became more formal, we had a chance to interact as performers, so it was very organic. And even though I was interested in getting into other sides of the business, it had to be a labour of love to keep me interested.\u201d\n\nGhomeshi\u2019s impact has been two-fold. As a producer, he focused on Sorbara\u2019s vocal performance while keeping effects to a minimum in order to showcase her guitar and piano playing. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t take my music to some big production level I wasn\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d Sorbara confirms. \u201cThat was my fear with Sony, that I\u2019d just take this big jump and there would be no logical progression that anyone could see.\u201d\n\nAnd as a manager, Ghomeshi has provided Sorbara with a realistic portrait of how the business functions and a point of entry into the local scene.\n\nArtists such as Andy Stochansky, Danny Michel and Maury LaFoy, ex-posed to Sorbara through Ghomeshi\u2019s considerable cheerleading, have helped by teaming up for gigs or guesting on the album. All the songs on Cure For Bad Deeds, however, were authored by Sorbara alone. Which makes people\u2019s response really matter to her.\n\n\u201cOne of the most meaningful compliments I ever got came from a man who used to visit the cafe I used to work at, the Little York on King East, every morning. My CD was for sale there, and one day I pointed it out to him. He said, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll buy it\u2019 \u00ad\u2013 you know, sort of to support the little coffee-house chick.\n\n\u201cShortly after that, I got an e-mail from him that said something like, \u201cI thought I was doing you a favour by buying your CD, but in fact it was you who did me the favour.'\u201dMARTINA SORBARA with SID SIX at Ted\u2019s Wrecking Yard (549 College), Monday (December 18), $7. 928-5012."}, {"url": "https://www.rcmusic.com/about-us/news/the-royal-conservatory-of-music-re-names-school-in", "page_content": "The Royal Conservatory of Music Renames School in Honour of Alumnus Oscar Peterson\n\nPublished on September 9, 2021\n\n\n\nThe Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) is proud to announce that the Royal Conservatory School \u2013 its community school \u2013 has been renamed the Oscar Peterson School of Music in honour of the legendary jazz pianist, and beloved alumnus and Honorary Fellow of The Royal Conservatory.\n\n\n\nDr. Peterson, widely regarded as one of the foremost jazz pianists of his generation, started his music training using the curriculum of the RCM Certificate Program, known for its internationally acclaimed standard of music education and achievement, and credited his classical music training as foundational to his success. He also asked his students to learn Bach, particularly The Well-Tempered Clavier and The Goldberg Variations, among others, as he considered these to be essential learning for pianists.\n\n\n\nDr. Peter Simon, The Royal Conservatory\u2019s President & CEO stated: \u201cIt is The RCM\u2019s immense pleasure to honour Oscar Peterson, one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century, by naming our school after him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI had the privilege of meeting and speaking with Oscar several times \u2013 we discussed his early training and how he developed his extraordinary command of the keyboard. He studied initially with his sister, Daisy, using the curriculum of The RCM to learn pieces and theory. He subsequently studied with Paul de Marky \u2013 a pianist whose teacher had studied with Franz Liszt and thus was able to pass along the virtuoso piano techniques that Liszt developed. Oscar believed that a classical grounding was essential for any musician and from this base, one could go anywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn behalf of the Peterson family, Ms. Kelly Peterson said: \u201cThe renaming of the Royal Conservatory School would have humbled Oscar tremendously \u2013 and he would have been thrilled. It was Oscar\u2019s belief that music education is extremely important for every single person, regardless of whether they intend to pursue a career in music or not, and that his classical music training gave him his technical foundation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe RCM will also launch the Oscar Peterson Program, a scholarship program offering tuition-free music instruction to underserved youth, in the fall of 2022. Details will be announced early next year.\n\n\n\nIn an CBC Radio interview about establishing Toronto\u2019s Advanced School of Contemporary Music in the 1960s, Dr. Peterson was asked about the importance of a classical grounding and how it laid the foundation for a wide range of genres and styles. He stated that classical training is \u201cquite definitely essential for any musician \u2026 these are theories and practices we employ in the development of students\u201d.\n\n\n\nThis is the second time that The Royal Conservatory has named one of its schools after an RCM alumnus. In 1997, The Royal Conservatory of Music Professional School was renamed The Glenn Gould School."}, {"url": "https://www.rcmusic.com/ggs/home", "page_content": "Faculty\n\nWorld-Renowned Performing Artists John O\u2019Conor, piano\n\nOur acclaimed faculty of performing artists all share a deep commitment to developing supportive, mentoring relationships with their students.

The term and institution derive from the Italian conservatorio, which in the Renaissance period and earlier denoted a type of orphanage often attached to a hospital (hence the term ospedale also applied to such institutions). The foundlings (conservati) were given musical instruction at state expense; Naples was the centre for boys and Venice for girls. The conservatori were thus the first secular institutions equipped for training in practical music (the choir schools of the Middle Ages were attached to churches, and music in medieval universities was a theoretical subject comparable to mathematics). Institutions such as the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 (founded 1346, Venice) and the Conservatorio dei Poveri di Ges\u00f9 Cristo (founded 1589, Naples) either trained or had as faculty members most of the leading composers of 17th- and 18th-century Italian opera.\n\nThe first secular school of music for students at large was established in Paris. Founded in 1784, it was reorganized and renamed the Conservatoire National de Musique et d\u2019Art Dramatique in 1795 by the National Convention (the Revolutionary regime of 1792\u201395) as a result of the efforts of the bandmaster Bernard Sarrette. Its chief purpose was to train musicians to participate in public concerts, f\u00eates, and celebrations organized by the republic. A state subsidy was granted, admission was by competitive examination, and tuition was free. Later the curriculum was enlarged to include all branches of composition, instrumental and vocal technique, and acting (enabling students to train for the various Parisian opera houses and theatres). Eventually the institution\u2019s political aim was abandoned. Although many famous pupils later revolted against the Conservatoire\u2019s academic severities, it became the acknowledged centre of musical practice and erudition. It was renamed the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique in 1957.\n\nThroughout the 19th century the French model was copied, with modifications, in Europe and in the U.S. Conservatories were founded in Milan (1807), Naples (1808), Prague (1811; the first such institution in central Europe), and Vienna (the Akademie, founded in 1817 by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde [Society of Friends of Music]). The composers Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann founded the Leipzig Conservatory (now called the Staatliche Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik) in 1843. Not all of the German schools, however, followed the principles of the Conservatoire nor did all similar institutions in Great Britain, of which the most notable were the Royal Academy of Music (1822; royal charter, 1830) and the Royal College of Music (first called the National Training-School of Music; founded 1882, royal charter 1883). The Royal Irish Academy of Music was founded in 1848 and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 1890.\n\nSuch institutions began to appear in the United States in the 1860s. Two of the first were those at Oberlin, Ohio (1865), and the Peabody Conservatory of Music, Baltimore, founded 1857 (first classes held in 1868). The New England Conservatory of Music and the Boston Conservatory of Music (both in Boston) followed in 1867 and the National Conservatory of Music in New York City in 1885. Other important institutions of music in the United States are the Eastman School of Music at Rochester, N.Y. (1919), and the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia (1924). The Institute of Musical Art (1905) and the Juilliard Graduate School (1924) were united in 1926 to form the Juilliard School of Music, in New York City; this institution became the Juilliard School in 1968. Canadian conservatories include that at Toronto (1886). Australia has the Adelaide Conservatorium (1898)."}, {"url": "https://www.rcmusic.com/bios/george-thurgood", "page_content": "George Thurgood\n\nARCT (The Royal Conservatory); Bachelor of Music, Master of Music, Bachelor of Arts, and PhD candidate (University of Toronto)\n\nGeorge Thurgood studied composition and arranging at the Berklee College of Music.
