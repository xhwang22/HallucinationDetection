{"During Tim Finchem's tenure, the PGA Tour grew from a domestic tour to an international tour, with events in more than 30 countries.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/17597649/tim-finchem-rich-legacy-pga-tour-saw-financial-windfall-tenure-commissioner", "page_content": "ATLANTA -- Consider it fitting that what was billed as the final \"formal\" end-of-season speech of Tim Finchem's career was held Tuesday morning at the Tour Championship in something called the FedEx hospitality venue.\n\nThat's not a knock on the outgoing PGA Tour commissioner, who is poised to retire at year's end after more than 22 years on the job. It's just the opposite.\n\nFinchem will be remembered for ushering in the Tiger Woods era, capitalizing financially on the frenzy, and maintaining that boon through global economic crises and the downturn of Woods' career. He will be remembered for inventing a season-ending playoff system that created not only a viable conclusion but also greater monetary windfalls for his membership. He will be remembered for overseeing a transition of the tour from a pleated-pants, country-club set to a promising alternative for any athletic kid who would've previously opted for other endeavors.\n\nAll of these rivers flow into the same ocean. The greatest legacy of Finchem's career is money -- securing it for his tour, increasing it for his players, and producing more of it from various sources than ever before.\n\nTim Finchem, who soon will retire from his role as PGA Tour commissioner, addresses the media at East Lake Golf Club, site of this week's Tour Championship. Stan Badz/PGA TOUR\n\nAnd so, yes, it's fitting that his final address occurred at the FedEx hospitality venue, the name alone epitomizing the intrinsic value that the commissioner has heaped upon the tour over the past two decades.\n\nNot that he's buying any of it.\n\nWhile seated in the swanky suite off the new 18th hole sponsored by a company that will reward a lone playoff champion with $10 million later this week, Finchem took the honorable road. Asked about the greatest legacy of his tenure, he didn't mention anything about \"financial impact\" or \"economic progress\" or so many other money-related phrases he's so often repeated over the years. Instead, he pointed to his people.\n\n\"I'm proudest about the quality of our team and the interface with the players,\" he answered. \"Working with these people is just a fabulous experience. Watching their growth, the number of good people that have come to us, has been really rewarding. If you have that kind of strength, then good things happen. So I'm really comfortable with watching the transition now going forward and what's going to happen. I think some of the changes that are already being made, even before I step aside, are really, really good changes.\"\n\nAgain, it's honorable. It's also a bit misguided.\n\nLet's allow the numbers to do the talking. When Finchem took over for Deane Beman during the 1994 season, there were 44 events on the schedule. The total combined prize money was $56.4 million, with a top winner's share of $540,000. This year? With 46 events, the prize money is $320.4 million and the greatest winner's share is $1.89 million.\n\nThat's a 568 percent increase in total prize money and a 350 percent increase in the highest winning paycheck while adding just two events to the calendar.\n\nAs if to only further this point, most of this year's winners have earned more than the value of most entire tournament purses from the year Finchem became commissioner.\n\nFinchem congratulates Tigers Woods on winning the 2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. The PGA Tour cashed in on Woods' popularity and dominance during Finchem's tenure as commissioner. AP Photo/Phil Long\n\nSure, much of this is the direct correlation of Woods' rise as the game's most dominant player and one of the world's most popular athletes. But that doesn't mean marketing and selling a tour that included him was ever a foolproof proposition.\n\n\"By '98, Tiger was dominant,\" Finchem said Tuesday. \"So the questions were: How do you manage to grow the tour when your dominant player is playing 17 or 18 times and you have 46 events? How does that work? Well, between '96 and today, every one of those tournaments has grown in virtually every category almost every year. The lesson there is that fans like golf. They demonstrated that they like having a dominant player. ... [It] demonstrated that we can grow, and I think that's a good lesson for the future.\"\n\nIt's a future that soon won't include Finchem, at least not on a formal basis.\n\nHe maintained that he'll still be happy to serve as a consultant to incoming commissioner Jay Monahan, if need be. Finchem will work on his handicap, which is either a 4.3 or a 6.5, depending on which GHIN number you trust. And if you're wondering what to get for the man who has everything, he said the perfect retirement gift would be riding 18 holes in a golf cart at Latrobe Country Club alongside none other than Arnold Palmer.\n\nOther than that, Finchem can rest easy when he steps down, secure in the knowledge that he didn't just leave the PGA Tour in a better place than when he started, but he ushered it through one era and into the next, producing a level of financial stability that will endure as his lasting legacy -- even if he doesn't think so."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-golf-arnold-palmer-greg-norman-tim-finchem-c0013a0ad79d0206f610deb639a426f5", "page_content": "Tiger Woods of the US on the 11th hole during the first round of the British Open golf championship on the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland, Thursday July 14, 2022.

Woods was scheduled to go to Wilmington Country Club on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022, for a private meeting of top players to discuss the threat of Saudi-funded LIV Golf, according to two people aware of the plans at the BMW Championship. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the privacy of the meeting. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Greg Norman braced for another fight with the PGA Tour and was equipped with what he often referred to as the tour\u2019s \u201cplaybook\u201d from the first time he tried to start a rival league.\n\nThis version might have a similar ending.\n\nNorman\u2019s first attempt to assemble an exclusive field to play for big money around the world never got off the ground. The PGA Tour wielded its political influence, Arnold Palmer stood behind the heritage of the tour and that was that.\n\nAnd then the PGA Tour stole his idea.\n\nWhat emerged were the World Golf Championships, the richest events (back when a $5 million purse meant something) with no cut and a limited field. Former PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem publicly thanked Norman for his \u201cdetermination and suggestions of 1994\u201d when the first WGC was played.\n\nIn that respect, this is starting to feel like a repeat.\n\nReports over the weekend \u2014 the most thorough from No Laying Up, which has engaged top players on its podcast for years \u2014 pointed to a plan to create up to 15 tournaments offering some of the richest purses for a limited field of elite players.\n\nThose were the most pertinent details that emerged from a players-only meeting last week. Norman must feel as though he has seen all this before.\n\nBut this was less about trying to quash Saudi-funded LIV Golf and more about taking the PGA Tour in a modern direction that emphasizes its biggest names. And what makes this different from 1994 is how the movement unfolded.\n\nNo Laying Up reported 23 players in attendance at the invitation-only meeting. That included \u2014 it starts with, really \u2014 Tiger Woods, who flew to Delaware from Florida for the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the top guys together more often than we do,\u201d Rory McIlroy said the next morning, the closest any player came to a public revelation. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all in the same tournaments, all in the same weeks.\u201d\n\nFor now, the plan is somewhere between a vision and reality. The players have been in touch with Commissioner Jay Monahan, and he could provide a better sense of where it all stands when he speaks Wednesday ahead of the Tour Championship .\n\nBut the value of that meeting went far deeper than details.\n\nBy all accounts, the players left inspired, unified and unusually quiet. Xander Schauffele smiled when he referred to the silence as a \u201ccode,\u201d which is not to suggest he was joking.\n\nSaid one player, speaking on condition of anonymity to honor such a code, \u201cWhen was the last time all the top players got together in the same room? That has never happened before.\u201d\n\nIt spoke to the ownership the players have taken of their tour, and their determination to stave off the greatest threat professional golf has faced.\n\nWorth noting is 16 of the top 20 players in the world ranking were in the room. Among those missing, one didn\u2019t become a PGA Tour member until three weeks ago (Tom Kim). Another is reported to be leaving for LIV Golf after this week (Cameron Smith).\n\nHideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im might have required translation, though they should have been included. Matsuyama was said to be curious why he wasn\u2019t invited. Two people who know of his plans say the Japanese star is not going anywhere. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Matsuyama has not said anything publicly about his plans.\n\nSome of those players still might leave for LIV one day. After Brooks Koepka did an about-face in the span of one week in June, no one should be surprised by any defection.\n\nIf so, what they leave behind might be similar to what they are joining.\n\nIf this is the path forward for the PGA Tour, is it the answer?\n\nShort fields, no cuts, big money. Where you have heard that one before? More than a WGC concept, it sounds like it was torn from the gospel of what Norman was preaching, minus the concept of team golf with silly names.\n\nBut it will have far more relevance under the umbrella of a tour, the identity of professional golf for more than 50 years. And it won\u2019t have the scrutiny over the source of funding \u2014 the Public Investment Fund \u2014 that LIV Golf seems to constantly face.\n\nOne other difference in the playbook is Norman\u2019s first challenge in 1994 never made it to court.\n\nFor the three LIV golfers who sought a temporary restraining order to compete in the FedEx Cup playoffs, the ruling against them was a big setback. At this point, players who sign with LIV Golf should not expect to play anywhere on the PGA Tour until at least 2024, and the majority of them might miss out on all the majors unless they go through open qualifiers.\n\nAll the while, the PGA Tour could be headed toward a new model of small fields, big purses, guaranteed money because of no cuts and the option to play other PGA Tour stops that have special meaning to them and still have a good purse.\n\nPerhaps the tour should have thought of this sooner.\n\nIn the long run, maybe it\u2019s better this way. One of the messages that came out of the antitrust lawsuit filed by defectors is that every PGA Tour player had a right to feel like a defendant. \u201cThis is your tour,\u201d they were told.\n\nNow they\u2019re acting like it really is.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://www.pgatour.com/news/2020/04/20/former-pga-tour-commissioner-tim-finchem-to-be-inducted-world-golf-hall-of-game-2021-class.html", "page_content": "ST.

He created signature events in today\u2019s game, including the FedExCup and the FedExCup Playoffs, the Presidents Cup and the World Golf Championships.\n\n\n\nFinchem\u2019s impact expanded far beyond the PGA TOUR as he left his mark on the global game. He spearheaded efforts to coordinate the bid for golf\u2019s return to the Olympics, which became a reality in the 2016 Games after a 112-year absence.\n\n\n\nFinchem worked to ensure giving back was part of the fabric of the PGA TOUR\u2019s business model and was instrumental in founding the First Tee in 1997. Since inception, Finchem has helped First Tee grow and develop into the positive youth development organization it is today, having reached more than 15 million young people on golf courses, in schools and after-school locations. During his tenure as Commissioner, the PGA TOUR and its tournaments raised more than $2 billion in charitable contributions.\n\n\n\n\u201cTim Finchem\u2019s vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\u201d said Jay Monahan, PGA TOUR Commissioner and World Golf Foundation Board Chairman. \u201cHis enshrinement into the World Golf Hall of Fame will forever stand as a testament to his tireless dedication and contributions, but more importantly, so will the countless lives \u2013 whether those are the players on the PGA TOUR and beyond, millions of First Tee participants, or charitable organizations around the world \u2013 impacted by his life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\n\nFinchem joins Tiger Woods and Marion Hollins as part of the 2021 Induction Class.

Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, also was elected as a contributor.\n\nFinchem was PGA Tour commissioner when the World Golf Hall of Fame opened in 1998 in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n\"One of the great things about that is to get know the inductees who I didn't know in other aspects of my job,'' Finchem said Monday. \"It's a tremendous list of people. To be included in that group is very powerful. I want to thank those who thought I was deserving of it. In many ways, I didn't feel I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long.''\n\nFinchem found it fitting that he joins the induction class of 2021 with Tiger Woods, whom he first saw at a college tournament his first year as commissioner in 1994. Later that year, Finchem noticed players finishing up their rounds at the World Series of Golf at Firestone and watching an 18-year-old Woods win the first of three straight U.S. Amateurs.\n\nWoods was elected through the male player category a month ago.

Along with winning twice in seven starts, Woods won the Masters in his first attempt as a pro by setting 20 records, including a 12-shot victory that set off the first wave of \"Tigermania.''\n\nFinchem seized on it.\n\nHe was in the middle of negotiating a new network television contract, and prize money spiked. More deals followed in 2001, 2006 and 2012.

It continues on today. As a sport, we were blessed he didn't like tennis.''\n\nIt wasn't just money, however.\n\nFinchem created The First Tee program shortly after Woods won the Masters. Turning back Greg Norman's proposal for a world tour, Finchem came up with the World Golf Championships series in 1999 that led to three events for players from the leading six tours around the world. He also took advantage of a growing class of international players from outside Europe -- Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh among those -- by starting the Presidents Cup in 1994.\n\nAt the heart of Finchem's work was making the PGA Tour logo recognizable around the world, a symbol of strength.\n\nThe PGA Tour had a development circuit (now called the Korn Ferry Tour) and a senior tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) for players 50 and older. Now it has circuits in Canada (Mackenzie Tour), Latin America and China.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" said Jay Monahan, whom Finchem groomed as his successor.\n\nMonahan delivered the news to Finchem during The Players Championship, two days before golf joined so many other sports in shutting down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome of Finchem's best work came during tough times.

Don't we have PGA professionals to teach and grow the game?\n\nFinchem said there's only one thing to do in those situations.\n\n\"If you're in a leadership position, you do the research, involve the best and brightest from your staff and you set the goals,\" said the 74-year-old Finchem, who retired from the PGA Tour at the end of the 2016 season, following 22 years as the commissioner. \"If you've done your homework, proceeded correctly and made the right calls, they will have an impact.\"\n\nHOF MC:David Feherty will preside over World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony as Tiger Woods to be inducted\n\nGallery:World Golf Hall of Fame opens exhibit honoring Tiger Woods, Tim Finchem, Susie Maxwell Berning, Marion Hollins\n\n'He's the reason we're out here:' Tiger Woods' career takes center stage for World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony\n\nAnd Finchem, the son of a career Marine officer who built a legal and political career before getting involved in golf, will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday at the PGA Tour's Global Home because of the impact he made on multiple fronts.\n\nFinchem will join Tiger Woods, Susie Maxwell Berning and the late Marion Hollins in the induction ceremony, which will be held at 7 p.m. and aired by Golf Channel.

Under his direction, the Tour's total purses jumped from less than $60 million per year in 1994 to more than $250 million by 2006. The World Golf Championships and the FedEx Cup playoffs ensured the best players in the world would be on the same golf course the same week more often. And he took further steps to enhance The Players Championship, renovating the course in 2006, building the new clubhouse and bumping the purse to keep it the most lucrative in golf.\n\nThere are even critics of the success the Tour had under Finchem. Tiger Woods, they say, should get the bulk of the credit after he burst on the scene and went on to win 15 majors, two Players and 82 Tour titles, transforming the game of golf into a more athletic pursuit open to anyone of any race or background who could shoot the scores.\n\nFinchem will never deny that Woods being the game's top player for 20 of his 22 years as the commissioner was a huge factor, especially on the three new TV deals that were negotiated on Finchem's watch.\n\nBut Finchem had the foresight and business acumen to take advantage of Woods' dominance, such as involving Woods and his father Earl heavily in the launching of The First Tee, the World Golf Foundation's initiative to make golf more accessible and affordable to youth in at-risk areas and situations.\n\nThe First Tee is celebrating its 25th year with 150 worldwide chapters, 10,000 schools in its program to make golf part of a P.E. curriculum and more than 3 million kids reached per year through golf and its Life Skills and educational programs.\n\n\"There's no question about his impact,\" Finchem said of Woods. \"And there's no question that going forward, Tiger will have even more of an impact if he wants to be involved and show leadership more than he already has. His presence in anything related to golf is incredibly strong.\"\n\nFinchem was asked jokingly two years ago what the sport would have looked like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a much more difficult job,\u201d he admitted.\n\nFinchem expanded the international reach of the Tour through the WGC events, the Presidents Cup, developmental tours in China, South American and Canada, taking Tour events to Mexico, Japan, Korea and China, and finally throwing the weight of the Tour and the World Golf Foundation behind the drive to return golf to the Olympics.\n\nFinchem said the secret to success is never admitting that you\u2019ve been as successful as you\u2019re going to get.\n\n\"You always ask yourself, 'is there a better way for this to work?'\" Finchem said. \"Asking that question has resulted in hard work at organizing and working together with various organizations in golf and our international activity in golf. The more we focused on that, the more we learned, and the more we learned the more effective we were.\"\n\nFinchem, who graduated from the University of Richmond in 1969 (he had a debate scholarship) and got his law degree from Virginia, had a practice in Virginia Beach and got involved in local politics, moving quickly to the national scene when he worked President Jimmy Carter's campaign in 1976, then served on President Carter's Office of Economic Affairs.\n\nFinchem was later the national campaign chairman for Walter Mondale when he ran against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nHe started at the PGA Tour as the vice-president of business affairs and quickly climbed the ladder to be Beman's successor, serving as chief operating officer of the Tour and then deputy commissioner.\n\n\"He was the right guy at the right time,\" Beman said. \"He was always there to back up and do the things that needed to be done.

And Tim, to his credit, understood the value that golf brought and that there was a confluence to Tiger \u2013 a social aspect, he was telegenic to the \u2018Nth\u2019 power, he was made for the moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nFinchem is on record as calling Woods \u201cthe most recognizable athlete on the planet\u201d and that \u201che changed the landscape and effected TV (viewership and contracts), sponsorships and took golf to a whole new level.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrowne wouldn\u2019t dispute any of that. He also agrees that it shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed that for all the might each of them wielded, rarely were they not on the same page.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think that either one of them tried to pull anything over on the other,\u201d said Browne. \u201cI think Tiger knew that his relevance in history was through the PGA TOUR, that he understands that the value of his legacy is built around the records he attains.\n\n\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s relevance was to try and grow the game and he knew how to do it. If something needed to be done, he picked up the phone and would get a response.\u201d\n\n\n\nTaken as individuals, the game was lucky to have them. Taken in tandem, the game saw growth no one could have envisioned. Browne suggests avoiding the chicken-or-egg discussion when it comes to these two men.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to assignation, who gets the credit, or who did what, I don\u2019t think either one cares,\u201d he said. \u201cTiger Woods wanted to be the greatest player. Tim wanted to grow the game. Both did that \u2026 and they left the game better than it was when they came into it. That\u2019s the definition of greatness. That\u2019s why they deserve everything they get. It\u2019s why they\u2019re going into the Hall of Fame.\u201d\n\n\n\nTogether.

During 22 years overseeing the Tour, Finchem\u2019s career aligned almost identically with the Tour career\u2019s of Woods and Phil Mickelson.\n\nIt has been widely noted how prize money in professional golf increased exponentially during Woods\u2019 ascension, but Finchem also helped the Tour extend its fingers into all pools of pro golf. What was once three tours under one umbrella became six.\n\n\u201cTim Finchem\u2019s vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\u201d commissioner Jay Monahan said.\n\nFinchem also helped create the First Tee, a junior golf initiative that works to introduce the game to prospective young players.\n\nIn the late 90s, Finchem was also able to push forward the World Golf Championship series, which stand to this day as some of the highest-paying purses in golf. Though the events have changed locations over the years, they are co-managed by the European Tour and PGA Tour, incentivizing a more international game. He was also a key figurehead behind golf\u2019s inclusion in the 2016 Olympics.\n\nIt is unclear to this point when the induction ceremony will take place.\n\nTo receive GOLF\u2019s newsletters, subscribe for free here."}, {"url": "https://africa.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/29070837/tim-finchem-former-pga-tour-commissioner-elected-world-golf-hall-fame", "page_content": "Tim Finchem, who expanded the PGA Tour's footprint around the world and negotiated TV contracts that more than tripled prize money during his two decades as commissioner, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nFinchem was elected through the contributor category and will become the 10th administrator to be inducted, joining predecessor Deane Beman. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, also was elected as a contributor.\n\nFinchem was PGA Tour commissioner when the World Golf Hall of Fame opened in 1998 in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n\"One of the great things about that is to get know the inductees who I didn't know in other aspects of my job,'' Finchem said Monday. \"It's a tremendous list of people. To be included in that group is very powerful. I want to thank those who thought I was deserving of it. In many ways, I didn't feel I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long.''\n\nFinchem found it fitting that he joins the induction class of 2021 with Tiger Woods, whom he first saw at a college tournament his first year as commissioner in 1994. Later that year, Finchem noticed players finishing up their rounds at the World Series of Golf at Firestone and watching an 18-year-old Woods win the first of three straight U.S. Amateurs.\n\nWoods was elected through the male player category a month ago. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, was elected as a contributor.\n\n\"It is the greatest honor to be elected to join golf's most legendary players and contributors in the World Golf Hall of Fame,\" Finchem said. \"I am especially proud to stand alongside one of the world's all-time greats, Tiger Woods, in the Class of 2021 and look forward to what will be an exciting year ahead.\"\n\nWoods joined the PGA Tour in 1996 after two years at Stanford and brought enormous attention to himself and to the tour. Along with winning twice in seven starts, Woods won the Masters in his first attempt as a pro by setting 20 records, including a 12-shot victory that set off the first wave of \"Tigermania.''\n\nFinchem seized on it.\n\nHe was in the middle of negotiating a new network television contract, and prize money spiked. More deals followed in 2001, 2006 and 2012. PGA Tour prize money went from under $100 million on three tours in 1994 when Finchem was appointed commissioner to more than $400 million over six tours when he retired at the end of 2016.\n\nFormer PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, left, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame. He'll be part of a 2021 class that will also include Tiger Woods. AP Photo/Phil Long\n\nFinchem laughed Monday when asked what his job would have been like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\"It would have been a much more difficult job,'' he said. \"Tiger coming on the scene ... took our sport to another level. It continues on today. As a sport, we were blessed he didn't like tennis.''\n\nIt wasn't just money, however.\n\nFinchem created The First Tee program shortly after Woods won the Masters. Turning back Greg Norman's proposal for a world tour, Finchem came up with the World Golf Championships series in 1999 that led to three events for players from the leading six tours around the world. He also took advantage of a growing class of international players from outside Europe -- Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh among those -- by starting the Presidents Cup in 1994.\n\nAt the heart of Finchem's work was making the PGA Tour logo recognizable around the world, a symbol of strength.\n\nThe PGA Tour had a development circuit (now called the Korn Ferry Tour) and a senior tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) for players 50 and older. Now it has circuits in Canada (Mackenzie Tour), Latin America and China.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" said Jay Monahan, whom Finchem groomed as his successor.\n\nMonahan delivered the news to Finchem during The Players Championship, two days before golf joined so many other sports in shutting down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome of Finchem's best work came during tough times. He kept the PGA Tour fully sponsored during the recession in 2008 and, as a show of strength, kept prize money from shrinking.\n\nThe Hall of Fame is expected to announce a fourth inductee later this week."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/7450463/", "page_content": "The contract extension he signed several years ago seemed to be perfectly timed for PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem: It would end the year he turned 65, and after the sometimes-volatile network television negotiations were concluded.\n\nSo as 2012 drew closer, it was natural to ask Finchem whether he planned to continue or walk off into the sunset, his goals accomplished, a robust golf tour left for somebody else to run.\n\nSometimes he joked about wanting to die in office. Other times he said he purposely was not thinking about it yet. Ultimately, Finchem said, it would come down to his desire to continue -- and the desire of the players and the PGA Tour's policy board to keep him.\n\n\"As long as our team here is comfortable with my leadership, then I will most likely be open to staying,\" he said. \"But those are big ifs.\"\n\nApparently not that big.\n\nThe PGA Tour announced Wednesday that Finchem's contract, which was set to expire at the end of the year, has been renewed for another four years, taking him through the 2016 season. Finchem turns 65 in April, and if he completes the new term, he will have been in the position for 22 years.\n\nFinchem is only the third commissioner in the tour's history, following Joe Dey and former player Deane Beman, who gave way to Finchem in 1994 after his own 20-year run. Dey became the first commissioner when the PGA Tour broke away from the PGA of America in 1968.\n\nThe tour has prospered under Finchem's leadership.\n\nFrom total purses of $56 million his first year to some $290 million today; the formation of World Golf Championship events; the moving of the Players Championship to May; the growth of the Presidents Cup; the implementation of the FedEx Cup.\n\nSure, Finchem has had the great benefit of seeing Tiger Woods come along just a few years after he took the job. Woods turned pro in the summer of 1996, and Finchem was able to get record numbers in his TV deals due to the presence and history-making success of one of sports' most recognizable figures.\n\nAnd that money trickles down to all the players, who saw huge increases in purses.\n\nBut Finchem has been at his best in recent years, when the economy suffered, when Woods' game slumped in the aftermath of personal issues, when sponsors were bailing on tour events and the networks pushed back on rights fees."}]}
