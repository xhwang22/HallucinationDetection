By the 1940s, two full Academy Awards were given out for cinematography each year, divided into black & white and color. This would continue until 1967 when color and black & white films would finally be judged against each other for a single Best Achievement in Cinematography award.

It encompasses all the technical aspects of camera work, lighting, color, framing, and movement that create the visual language of a film. When you see all of these aspects at their full potential, you can\u2019t help but remember those images forever.\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Cinematography celebrates the best shots from that year\u2019s films. Although the category was not initially tied to a specific film, and instead focuses on the cinematographers themselves.\n\nThe Oscar for Best Cinematography is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize exceptional achievements in the art and craft of cinematography. The award is given to the director of photography, who is responsible for the visual style and look of the film, including lighting, camera angles, and visual effects. The award recognizes the technical and artistic excellence of the cinematographer's work in creating the visual language of the film and how it enhances storytelling.\n\nBefore we get into the complete list of Best Cinematography winners, let\u2019s get into the history of the award and its most significant moments in our industry.\n\nCredit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nA Brief History of the Academy Award\u2019s Best Cinematography Category\n\nThe award recognized the role of the cinematographer in shaping the visual language of films and bringing stories to life through lighting, camera angles, and visual effects. The award has been presented since the 1st Academy Awards in 1929, and winners are chosen by members of the Academy who work in the field of cinematography. Winning the award is considered one of the highest honors for a cinematographer, and it often leads to increased recognition and opportunities in the film industry.\n\nThe Oscar for Best Cinematography was not initially tied to a specific film in its first year, but to all the work by nominated cinematographers during the qualifying period. This caused problems when two cinematographers were nominated for their work on one film and other films they had worked on were also listed.\n\nCredit: Paramount Pictures Since 1931, the system changed to nominate each individual for a single film. From 1929 to 1967, there were separate awards for color and black-and-white cinematography.\n\nFloyd Crosby won the award for Tabu in 1931, the last silent film to win in this category. Hal Mohr won the only write-in Academy Award in 1935 for Cleopatra. Rachel Morrison became the first woman to receive a nomination in 2018. In 2019, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n became the first winner of this category to have also served as the director of the film.\n\nThe cinematographer who has won the most Oscars is Joseph Ruttenberg, who won four times for his work on the films The Great Waltz (1938), Mrs. Miniver (1942), Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), and Gigi (1958). Other cinematographers who have won multiple Oscars for Best Cinematography include Leon Shamroy, Winton C. Hoch, and Conrad L. Hall, who each won three times, and Emmanuel Lubezki, who won three times in a row for his work on Gravity (2013), Birdman (2014), and The Revenant (2015).\n\nSo, which films and DPs have won the award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars?\n\nCheck out the complete list below!\n\nCredit: General Film Distributors\n\nAll of the Academy Award Winners for Best Cinematography\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of all the Oscar winners for Best Cinematography since the category was first introduced in 1928:\n\n2021: Greig Fraser \u2013 Dune\n\n2020/21: Erik Messerschmidt \u2013 Mank\n\n2019: Roger Deakins \u2013 1917\n\n2018: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n \u2013 Roma\n\n2017: Roger Deakins \u2013 Blade Runner 2049\n\n2016: Linus Sandgren \u2013 La La Land\n\n2015: Emmanuel Lubezki \u2013 The Revenant\n\n2014: Emmanuel Lubezki \u2013 Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\n\n2013: Emmanuel Lubezki \u2013 Gravity\n\n2012: Claudio Miranda \u2013 Life of Pi\n\n2011: Robert Richardson \u2013 Hugo\n\n2010: Wally Pfister \u2013 Inception\n\n2009: Mauro Fiore - Avatar\n\n2008: Anthony Dod Mantle \u2013 Slumdog Millionaire\n\n2007: Robert Elswit \u2013 There Will Be Blood\n\n2006: Guillermo Navarro \u2013 Pan's Labyrinth\n\n2005: Dion Beebe \u2013 Memoirs of a Geisha\n\n2004: Robert Richardson \u2013 The Aviator\n\n2003: Russell Boyd \u2013 Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\n2002: Conrad L.

Though camera technology has evolved drastically since the invention of cinema, movies with well-structured, visually-engaging camerawork have stood the test of time. On most films, the primary artist behind the camera is the cinematographer (also known as the director of photography), who is responsible for the camera technology utilized on set and the composition of shots in order to help create the director's vision of the film.\n\nSince the very first Oscars ceremony, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography has represented the highest achievement for cinematographers. Over the decades, the rules for the cinematography category have largely remained the same.\n\nFun Fact Cinematographer George J. Folsey, ASC, was nominated for 13 Academy Awards for Best Cinematography from 1934 through 1964 without a win. In 1945 and 1955 he was nominated in both the Black-and-White and Color categories.\n\nHistory of the Best Cinematography Oscar\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Cinematography has been awarded since the inaugural Academy Awards, held in 1929. It is one of only a few categories to have been awarded every year at the Oscars. The first winners were Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, who were awarded for the 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1938, a second Academy Award for Best Cinematography was presented as a Special Achievement Award for color cinematography (at the time, a majority of films released each year were shot in black-and-white because of the expense of the color process).\n\nBeginning in 1939, there were two competitive categories: one for black-and-white film and a second for color film. The first film to win in the Oscar in the Best Cinematography Color category was 1939's Gone with the Wind, shot by Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan.\n\nThe categories were combined in 1967 (though no black-and-white cinematography Oscar was awarded in 1957). Since 1967, only two films released in black-and-white have won the Oscar for Best Cinematography: Schindler's List (1993) and Roma (2018), though other black-and-white films have been nominated. These nominees include Raging Bull (1980), Zelig (1983), The Artist (2011), and Nebraska (2013).\n\nRequirements and Eligibility\n\nAny feature that qualifies under the standard Academy Awards rules is eligible in the Best Cinematography category, and all eligible films appear on a nominations ballot that is voted on in a preferential vote by the Cinematographers Branch of the Academy. The five films that receive the highest number of votes and the corresponding credited cinematographers are deemed the nominees for the categories. The five nominees are then voted on by all members of the Academy.\n\nThough most films have one credited cinematographer, a handful of Academy-nominated films have had more than one. The last film with two credited cinematographers to win was 1982's Gandhi (Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor).\n\nThe only Oscar winner to win an award by write-in vote was Hal Mohr, who won Best Cinematography for 1935's A Midsummer Night's Dream during a very brief period when the Academy allowed write-in candidates. The rule was changed shortly after Mohr's win to exclude write-in candidates.\n\nNotable Winners\n\nLeon Shamroy and Joseph Ruttenberg are tied for most awards in the Best Cinematography category. They have each won four times. In addition, Shamroy is tied with Charles Lang for most nominations in the category (18 each). However, Lang had only one win (for 1932's A Farewell to Arms).\n\nWhile eight individuals have won three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, perhaps the most notable is Emmanuel Lubezki. Lubezki won his three Oscars in back-to-back-to-back years for Gravity (2013), Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), and The Revenant (2015), which was a first for the Best Cinematography category. Prior to that, Lubezki was nominated five times without a win. Fourteen individuals have won the Best Cinematography Oscar twice.\n\nWhile cinematography has historically been a male-dominated field, it is still surprising that a woman was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography until Rachel Morrison was nominated for Mudbound (2017).\n\nIn a rare feat, filmmaker Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n won both the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and the Academy Award for Best Director for Roma (2018). The film also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film."}, {"url": "https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/oscar-nominees-best-movies-2022/", "page_content": "When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the nominees for the 94th Oscars, it simultaneously ended months of speculation and kicked off a new frenzy of predictions. Debates about Oscar nominees may be over, but the final sprint of campaigning has just begun, with nominees are turning on the charm as voters begin to make tough decisions about which films to honor.\n\nFor many cinephiles, the lull between nominations and the show is a great time to get caught up on movies they may have missed. You probably saw some of the biggest titles, but the Academy nominated a very eclectic group of films. With nominees ranging from indie darlings to foreign documentaries to blockbusters in the crafts categories, odds are good that you missed something important.\n\nFor many, the Oscar nominations can serve as a cheat sheet to plug any gaps in your film viewing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from the past year. While plenty of great films were left out of contention, movie buffs looking for a primer on the best films of 2021 could do a lot worse than watching the 37 movies that received nominations. Keep reading for a roundup of every feature film nominated for an Oscar this year, as well as our thoughts about why you need to know about them."}]}
