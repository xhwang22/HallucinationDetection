Picture by Rui Vieira/PA Wire\n\nA FORMER leader of the Alliance Party believes preparation for a border poll should begin immediately, with academics in Ireland and Britain taking the lead.\n\nJohn Cushnahan, who led Alliance for three years up to 1987 before becoming a Fine Gael MEP, said it was important to learn from the \"mistake\" of the Brexit referendum and its \"disastrous consequences\" for Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.\n\nHe was speaking last night at the University of Cambridge, where he addressed the topic of 'Revisiting the Good Friday Agreement and the conditions necessary for holding a border poll'.\n\nMr Cushnahan said that the 2016 EU referendum was \"preceded by little or no attempt to inform the electorate about the real issues\".\n\n\"Therefore, prior to any border poll taking place, we must ensure that the electorates in both parts of Ireland are fully informed beforehand, and I don\u2019t mean on the eve of the poll itself \u2013 the process of educating them should take place now,\" he said.\n\nThe one-time civil rights activist said the campaign for a referendum on Irish unity had been largely led by Sinn F\u00e9in and its supporters.\n\n\"Regrettably it has consisted mainly of sloganising but has offered no detail, or substance or how it can be achieved. Furthermore, the fact they have shown little respect for the unionist tradition or British identity is totally counterproductive,\" he said.\n\n\"This is all the more worrying when, if as the opinion polls are predicting that after the next elections in both parts of Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in will be the largest political party on the island of Ireland.\"\n\nThe former Alliance leader said the Sinn F\u00e9in's new-found status would \"place on them an important responsibility to unequivocally prove that they will actually support the principle that the unionist tradition will be treated respectfully and equally in any future al Ireland arrangement\".\n\n\"However, my fear is that Sinn F\u00e9in are merely replicating the Boris Johnson campaign on Brexit where both are cynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage,\" he said.\n\nMr Cushnahan said the debate about Irish unity needed to be \"inclusive and informed\", a role he believes would be best fulfilled by the academic community.\n\nHe said the British and Irish governments should fund an inter-university project involving institutions in the north, the Republic and Britain.\n\n\"Their task should be to provide a detailed analysis of the options without coming to conclusions about any particular one of them,\" he said.\n\nThe former MEP said the research should examine various political/institutional/constitutional options, including a consideration of the current constitutional structure with proposals to strengthen all -Ireland co-operation in education, health and the economy.\n\nHowever, he said the main area of consideration should be an all-Ireland constitutional arrangement, where governance options such as a unitary state, federal state, confederal state should be discussed, alongside proposals on funding for areas like pensions and defence.\n\nHe also advocates the \"continued monitoring of further possible shocks\" such as Scottish independence.\n\n\"All of these actions would be intended to inform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll that might take place,\" Mr Cushnahan said."}, {"url": "https://seamusdubhghaill.com/2018/07/23/birth-of-former-politician-john-cushnahan/", "page_content": "John Walls Cushnahan, former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is born in Belfast, Northern Ireland on July 23, 1948.

As I\u2019ve previously stated it was a dirty war and many young men and women became involved due to the prevailing circumstances. John continuously targets only republicans as I have never read any such letters from him condemning state or loyalist violence and murder etc. Not a word from him about the cold blooded murder of our old St Mary\u2019s school friend shot in the back by a member of the Parachute Regiment or condemnation of the murders of his former Belfast citizens in the Ballymurphy massacre. Maybe he\u2019s still annoyed that his beloved Fine Gael had to cancel their proposed Black and Tans commemoration. Yet again they misread the feelings of the Irish people. It\u2019s no longer the six counties John has forsaken. What happened to Yvonne Dunlop was a terrible tragedy and in all probability her family may have been oblivious to the recent tribute, only for John and his fellow northern conservatives trying to score political points. I\u2019m sure Thomas McIlwee\u2019s family, as probable readers of The Irish News, are not endeared by John\u2019s selective condemnation. Though of no comfort to Yvonne\u2019s family, he was sentenced for manslaughter, not murder. I wonder what John thinks of 10,000 people singing about Michael Collins, falsely claimed by Fine Gael as their founding member, at the F\u00e9ile in the Falls Park last Sunday (maybe Fine Gael supporters). He states it is wrong \u2013 only for republicans though \u2013 to acknowledge \u2018terrorists\u2019 \u2013 yet Fine Gael commemorate the most famous IRA man every year. Maybe John is in a deflective mode? \u2018Merrion Gate\u2019, cuckoo funds, vulture fund housing, Leo\u2019s \u20ac210 million GP contract and Katherine Zappone\u2019s appointment (also cancelled) are what voters are interested in. Some of these scandals are on par with John\u2019s fellow British Conservatives. Finally, I loved Mary Kelly\u2019s Oscar Wilde quote in her column (August 14) \u2013 \u201csome people grow old and wise, others just grow old\u201d.\n\nT\u00d3MAS \u00d3 DUBHAGAIN\n\nBelfast BT11\n\nInsensitive to denigrate republicans on 40th anniversary of hunger strike\n\nI was extremely disappointed that The Irish News chose to give John Cushnahan\u2019s contentious views a platform. Where on earth was he when the referendum on the Eighth Amendment was being debated? Nobody can claim that the groups and individuals in the repeal campaign were not glorifying acts of murder. Repeal has already led to more violent deaths than the Tan War, Civil War and Troubles. I do not recall John having anything to say about the repealers waving hooked crosses and doing Roman salutes in protest against the Rally for Life in O\u2019Connell street. Also, he quotes statistics about the Troubles but republicans hit military targets with over half of their operations. That\u2019s a boast that neither the British state forces nor loyalist paramilitaries can make but we never hear John bellyaching every July and November. John also had the audacity to comment on legacy issues. Four British soldiers were convicted of Troubles offences, none of them did long sentences, yet between 20,000 and 25,000 republicans did sentences which accumulated to more than a million years. No parity of esteem, so again I ask what was the point in the Good Friday Agreement?\n\nThere is no genuine peace and reconciliation due to anti-republicans and John is one of them. Another glorification of murder which John was silent on were the Soldier F banners in Bloomfield and Holywood Arches. He said his stance applies to other organisations but can he point to an example of him condemning the Free State army or guards for their violence? I don\u2019t think his timing was coincidental either and it was provocative and insensitive to denigrate republicans on the fortieth anniversary of the hunger strike.\n\n\u00c9AMONN MacGRIANNA\n\nBelfast BT11\n\nChance for carers to share experiences\n\nThe last 18 months has been a challenging period for many \u2013 not least unpaid carers; people looking after a family member or friend who has a disability, illness, mental health condition or who needs extra help as they grow older.\n\nThere are an estimated 210,000 adult carers in Northern Ireland. Many have cared round the clock for loved ones with complex needs, while others are providing additional support for a few hours a week. Some are looking after a relative in their own home, while others travel miles to care for a friend.\n\nLast year 85 per cent of carers in Northern Ireland responding to a Carers UK survey said they took on more care for the person they support during the crisis.\n\nCarers have been pushed to breaking point and need support to resume their lives. It\u2019s thanks to carers telling us about their experiences that we are able to explain to politicians and policy makers the challenges they face, and fight for lasting change. Never, has this been more important.\n\nIt\u2019s the 10th anniversary of Carers UK\u2019s State of Caring Survey - by filling it in (at www.carersuk.org/survey) unpaid carers in Northern Ireland can help inform the UK\u2019s most comprehensive study into people\u2019s experiences of looking after a loved one. It has never been more important for unpaid carers to share their experiences and have their voices heard.\n\nCLARE-ANNE MAGEE\n\nhead of carers Northern Ireland\n\nNumber of flaws in perennial argument\n\nThere are a number of flaws in Jim Curran\u2019s perennial argument in favour of changing Northern Ireland\u2019s education system (August 13). Perhaps the most basic flaw is that many \u2013 and if not the majority then certainly the most influential \u2013 parents fully support the status quo.\n\nAdmittedly it is the children of these parents that probably benefit the most from the status quo and there isn\u2019t a chance in hell of getting them to agree to change the education system unless they think it will further benefit their own children.\n\nTherefore, it would arguably make far more sense to first identify those pupils and schools that currently perform less well, and then set in train the policies, support and funding necessary to improve their lot \u2013 now. Otherwise those disadvantaged by the current system will remain just another footnote in this sterile perennial academic debate.\n\nDR BERNARD MULHOLLAND\n\nBelfast BT9"}, {"url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/d-us/home", "page_content": "\n\nThe 84th Inter-Parliamentary Meeting (IPM) of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) took place on 21-22 May 2022 in Paris at the Embassy of Romania to France and in Bazoches-sur-Guyonne at the Jean Monnet House.\n\n\n\nDuring the IPM, 10 Members of the European Parliament - led by MEP Rados\u0142aw Sikorski (EPP - PL), Chair of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the United States and European Parliament co-Chair of the TLD - and 8 Members of the House of Representatives of the US Congress - led by Congressman Jim Costa (D - California), the US Co-Chair of the TLD - discussed transatlantic dialogue and cooperation and held lively exchanges on topical policy issues, such as transatlantic support to Ukraine, the policy stance towards Russia and China, EU-US Transatlantic Dialogue on Trade and Technology, energy security and climate.

We need an EU Foreign Secretary who merges the functions of\n\nthe High Representative and the External Relations Commissioner. This person would ideally be a Vice President of the Commission appointed by a qualified majority vote of the Council and approved by the European Parliament. This procedure would confer a double legitimacy on the new Foreign Policy Supremo.\n\n\"We must rebuild the transatlantic alliance but it must be where we are not simply fodder for US policy objectives. We must be able to influence a policy to which both parties are totally committed. The key to it is to ensure that the EU will in the future have an effective coherent foreign policy. And while some may have reason to doubt that we can do it, there are many more convincing arguments why we can\", he concluded.\n\nPOOR\n\nOn a similar theme Munster Fianna Fail MEP Gerard Collins said: \"We cannot deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light. Consensus building which is at the centre of the policies being pursued by the Greek Presidency could not become a reality because of the polarised viewpoints being taken by different countries in Europe to the war in Iraq. The Greek Government did try valiantly to secure a common political position on Iraq in Europe but notwithstanding their tena\n\ncious and determined efforts, this objective could not be secured.\n\nSpeaking at a session of the European Parliament in Brussels he added: \"Putting it in very simple and blunt terms, we are here today to try and pick up the pieces from what has been a very bruising experience for all the member states within the European Union. We must remember that the EU has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild in the face of adversity.\n\n\"We must now ensure that we pick ourselves up from this position and we must try and rebuild the US-Europe relationship as a matter of urgency and we must continue to work with the United Nations whose authority has been badly shaken in recent times. I like many others greatly wish for a speedy end to the war in Iraq\", he told Parliament."}], "John Cushnahan was a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Cushnahan", "page_content": "John Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael.\n\nIrish politician\n\nQuick facts: John Cushnahan, Leader of the Alliance Party ... \u25bc\n\nCushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics.

This has produced centrifugal tendencies in Northern Irish politics, benefiting Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP at the expense of the political centre, and failing to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of first ministers.\n\nThere is still no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the nationalist and unionist traditions, and \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of republican and loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. He calls for public apologies from those who perpetrated and supported paramilitary violence, greater efforts on integrated housing and education, action plans to remove peace walls (the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, actually entrenching division), and more reciprocal, mutual respect, criticising for instance Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s veto of a monument to commemorate the Northern Ireland Centenary at Stormont.\n\nIn the case of a border poll, Cushnahan wants to avoid the pitfalls of Brexit, where voters had minimal information on the realistic options and consequences after a Leave victory. He calls for the British and Irish governments to fund a multi-university research project, to explore in detail the options for Irish unification. This work should examine different state models for a united Ireland \u2013 a \u201cunitary, federal or confederal\u201d state \u2013 as well as possible \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, \u201cgovernment culture and citizenship\u201d, and how contingencies such as Scottish independence would affect unification. This research would provide \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d, without recommending a particular course of action. The ultimate decision would lie with the electorate, but they should be as well informed as possible.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former student Civil Rights activist and General Secretary of the Alliance Party (1974-82) when he was the party\u2019s only full-time politician. John was a Councillor for North Belfast 1977-85 and in 1982, was elected as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the staunchly unionist constituency of North Down. John was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was Alliance Party Chief Whip (1982-4 ) and party leader 1984-7. When the Unionist parties used the Assembly's procedures to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in December 1985, John called on the British Government to dissolve the Assembly. This terminated his income as a full-time politician. Despite this, he led the Alliance Party into the June 1987 Westminster Election where the party doubled its share of the vote from 5-10% (this tally was not exceeded until 2019). He retired as Alliance Leader in September 1987. In 1989, he was invited by Fine Gael to contest the European Parliament (EP) election in the strongly nationalist Munster constituency. After being re-elected twice, he retired in 2004. During this period, John was elected Vice President of the EP Regional Policy and Foreign Affairs Committees and was EP rapporteur on Interreg, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kashmir. John was also appointed by the EU Council as Head of Mission to lead multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams in South Asia on five occasions, the objective of which was to strengthen Democracy and Human Rights in the region.\n\nWatch the conversation\n\nWhat was said?\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d, says John Cushnahan, but it has fallen far short of its aspirations. After the Agreement was ratified, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. Cushnahan paints a bleak picture of the peace process and democracy\u2019s success in post-conflict Northern Ireland. There is no bill of rights, no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in education and housing. The \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of Republican and Loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. The biggest failure for Cushnahan, however, is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political institutions\u201d. He notes how the Stormont Executive has collapsed at least six times since 1999 (nine according some academics), and hasn\u2019t sat for ten out of twenty two years since power-sharing was installed. But Cushnahan is still convinced and determined that the Good Friday Agreement can be amended to finally meet aspirations.\n\nJohn Cushnahan was born in 1948 to a working-class Catholic family in the lower Falls, Belfast. He was involved in student civil rights activism before entering elected politics. He became General Secretary of the Alliance Party in 1974, at the time the party\u2019s only full time employee, and sat on the Belfast City Council from 1977-85. He served as Alliance Party leader from 1984-7, a difficult period in which Alliance backed the Anglo-Irish Agreement against concerted Unionist opposition. When Unionists blocked the Agreement, which would give the Irish Republic a consultative role in governing Northern Ireland, Cushnahan called on the British Government to prorogue Stormont. Stormont was dissolved in 1986, and Cushnahan soon after resigned his position in Alliance and moved to the Republic. Joining Fine Gael, he served as a member of the European Parliament from 1989-2004. Barry Colfer commends him for having \u201cdone more than most to build bridges North-South and East-West in British and Irish politics\u201d. Long retired from elected office, Cushnahan is still deeply engaged with politics, brimming with analysis and suggestions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should just discard the Good Friday Agreement\u201d, Cushnahan says. We should \u201creview it, see where it\u2019s defective and make corrective decisions\u201d. He particularly wants revisions to the power-sharing system established by Good Friday and the subsequent St Andrew's Agreement (2006), in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership. Cushnahan argues that this system has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. These centrifugal tendencies have weakened the political centre in Northern Ireland \u2013 the UUP, Alliance and SDLP \u2013 and have failed to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of the first minister roles.\n\nCushnahan also wants greater efforts towards reconciliation, to meet the unfulfilled aspirations of Good Friday. Audience member, former Alliance Chairman, Phillip McGarry, asks whether Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d defence of IRA violence serves to \u201cundermine\u201d reconciliation, while Fergal McCarthy enquires about possible policies for reconciliation? Cushnahan offers some solutions. He calls for a roadmap to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in cities such as Belfast \u2013 they are the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, and only entrench segregation. He also calls for greater efforts at integrating education and housing. With regards to housing, he suggests removing all paramilitary murals as a productive first step. Cushnahan is scathing about all attempts to defend paramilitary violence. \u201cHow can anyone expect reconciliation in Northern Ireland when paramilitaries on both sides continue to glorify their actions?\u201d They should publicly apologise and commit to peaceful, democratic methods in future. Apologies would \u201cgive some comfort to the 3000 families whose relatives were slaughtered in the Troubles. And that would be an important psychological first step.\u201d\n\nCushnahan also addresses the framework for a border poll. Noting the ambiguities of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland Act of 1998 on how a poll should be initiated, Cushnahan argues that two thirds of Assembly votes should be required to schedule one. If a poll is scheduled, Cushnahan is determined to avoid the pitfalls of the Brexit referendum, where voters had minimal information on the realistic consequences of a Leave vote. He criticises Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s campaigns for reunification as \u201csloganizing\u201d and insubstantial, and draws parallels between the party and Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories \u2013 both are \u201ccynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage\u201d.\n\nCushnahan wants voters to be as informed as possible before a border poll, and calls for the British and Irish governments to fund multi-university research projects with \u201cdetailed analysis of the options\u201d for Irish unification. This research, \u201ccoordinated under a single organisational umbrella\u201d, would explore diverse aspects of unification. It would cover potential state models (unitary, federal and confederal), \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, government and citizenship in a united Ireland, and the effects of \u201cpossible shocks\u201d such as Scottish independence. Publishing this research should \u201cinform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll\u201d.\n\nHowever, Cushnahan doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s \u201cany possibility in the near future of an all-Ireland settlement.\u201d So, in the meantime, we have to try and make Stormont work. \u201cIf we can\u2019t unite Northern Ireland, how the hell can we unite Ireland?\" A question which will inevitably be asked again in this series and as the political fallout from Brexit continues to animate these islands."}, {"url": "https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/03/01/news/former-alliance-leader-john-cushnahan-calls-for-universities-to-spearhead-border-poll-preparations-2601472/", "page_content": "John Cushnahan said preparations for border poll needed to begin immediately.

Furthermore, the fact they have shown little respect for the unionist tradition or British identity is totally counterproductive,\" he said.\n\n\"This is all the more worrying when, if as the opinion polls are predicting that after the next elections in both parts of Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in will be the largest political party on the island of Ireland.\"\n\nThe former Alliance leader said the Sinn F\u00e9in's new-found status would \"place on them an important responsibility to unequivocally prove that they will actually support the principle that the unionist tradition will be treated respectfully and equally in any future al Ireland arrangement\".\n\n\"However, my fear is that Sinn F\u00e9in are merely replicating the Boris Johnson campaign on Brexit where both are cynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage,\" he said.\n\nMr Cushnahan said the debate about Irish unity needed to be \"inclusive and informed\", a role he believes would be best fulfilled by the academic community.\n\nHe said the British and Irish governments should fund an inter-university project involving institutions in the north, the Republic and Britain.\n\n\"Their task should be to provide a detailed analysis of the options without coming to conclusions about any particular one of them,\" he said.\n\nThe former MEP said the research should examine various political/institutional/constitutional options, including a consideration of the current constitutional structure with proposals to strengthen all -Ireland co-operation in education, health and the economy.\n\nHowever, he said the main area of consideration should be an all-Ireland constitutional arrangement, where governance options such as a unitary state, federal state, confederal state should be discussed, alongside proposals on funding for areas like pensions and defence.\n\nHe also advocates the \"continued monitoring of further possible shocks\" such as Scottish independence.\n\n\"All of these actions would be intended to inform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll that might take place,\" Mr Cushnahan said."}, {"url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/dpal/about/history", "page_content": "The European Parliament's first delegation for Palestine was created in November 1993 as an ad hoc delegation, after the Oslo accords were signed by the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\n\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, a \"standing\" - that is, permanent - Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council (DPLC) was set up on 12 December 1996.\n\n\n\nThe Delegation was renamed \"Delegation for relations with Palestine (DPAL) on 9 September 2015, after the European Parliament's recognised Palestinian statehood on 17 December 2014.\n\n\n\nThe European Parliament's political groups have previously explored the possibility of creating a single, separate delegation responsible for managing relations with Israel and the Palestinian territories.

As I\u2019ve previously stated it was a dirty war and many young men and women became involved due to the prevailing circumstances. John continuously targets only republicans as I have never read any such letters from him condemning state or loyalist violence and murder etc. Not a word from him about the cold blooded murder of our old St Mary\u2019s school friend shot in the back by a member of the Parachute Regiment or condemnation of the murders of his former Belfast citizens in the Ballymurphy massacre. Maybe he\u2019s still annoyed that his beloved Fine Gael had to cancel their proposed Black and Tans commemoration. Yet again they misread the feelings of the Irish people. It\u2019s no longer the six counties John has forsaken. What happened to Yvonne Dunlop was a terrible tragedy and in all probability her family may have been oblivious to the recent tribute, only for John and his fellow northern conservatives trying to score political points. I\u2019m sure Thomas McIlwee\u2019s family, as probable readers of The Irish News, are not endeared by John\u2019s selective condemnation. Though of no comfort to Yvonne\u2019s family, he was sentenced for manslaughter, not murder. I wonder what John thinks of 10,000 people singing about Michael Collins, falsely claimed by Fine Gael as their founding member, at the F\u00e9ile in the Falls Park last Sunday (maybe Fine Gael supporters). He states it is wrong \u2013 only for republicans though \u2013 to acknowledge \u2018terrorists\u2019 \u2013 yet Fine Gael commemorate the most famous IRA man every year. Maybe John is in a deflective mode? \u2018Merrion Gate\u2019, cuckoo funds, vulture fund housing, Leo\u2019s \u20ac210 million GP contract and Katherine Zappone\u2019s appointment (also cancelled) are what voters are interested in. Some of these scandals are on par with John\u2019s fellow British Conservatives. Finally, I loved Mary Kelly\u2019s Oscar Wilde quote in her column (August 14) \u2013 \u201csome people grow old and wise, others just grow old\u201d.\n\nT\u00d3MAS \u00d3 DUBHAGAIN\n\nBelfast BT11\n\nInsensitive to denigrate republicans on 40th anniversary of hunger strike\n\nI was extremely disappointed that The Irish News chose to give John Cushnahan\u2019s contentious views a platform. Where on earth was he when the referendum on the Eighth Amendment was being debated? Nobody can claim that the groups and individuals in the repeal campaign were not glorifying acts of murder. Repeal has already led to more violent deaths than the Tan War, Civil War and Troubles. I do not recall John having anything to say about the repealers waving hooked crosses and doing Roman salutes in protest against the Rally for Life in O\u2019Connell street. Also, he quotes statistics about the Troubles but republicans hit military targets with over half of their operations. That\u2019s a boast that neither the British state forces nor loyalist paramilitaries can make but we never hear John bellyaching every July and November. John also had the audacity to comment on legacy issues. Four British soldiers were convicted of Troubles offences, none of them did long sentences, yet between 20,000 and 25,000 republicans did sentences which accumulated to more than a million years. No parity of esteem, so again I ask what was the point in the Good Friday Agreement?\n\nThere is no genuine peace and reconciliation due to anti-republicans and John is one of them. Another glorification of murder which John was silent on were the Soldier F banners in Bloomfield and Holywood Arches. He said his stance applies to other organisations but can he point to an example of him condemning the Free State army or guards for their violence? I don\u2019t think his timing was coincidental either and it was provocative and insensitive to denigrate republicans on the fortieth anniversary of the hunger strike.\n\n\u00c9AMONN MacGRIANNA\n\nBelfast BT11\n\nChance for carers to share experiences\n\nThe last 18 months has been a challenging period for many \u2013 not least unpaid carers; people looking after a family member or friend who has a disability, illness, mental health condition or who needs extra help as they grow older.\n\nThere are an estimated 210,000 adult carers in Northern Ireland. Many have cared round the clock for loved ones with complex needs, while others are providing additional support for a few hours a week. Some are looking after a relative in their own home, while others travel miles to care for a friend.\n\nLast year 85 per cent of carers in Northern Ireland responding to a Carers UK survey said they took on more care for the person they support during the crisis.\n\nCarers have been pushed to breaking point and need support to resume their lives. It\u2019s thanks to carers telling us about their experiences that we are able to explain to politicians and policy makers the challenges they face, and fight for lasting change. Never, has this been more important.\n\nIt\u2019s the 10th anniversary of Carers UK\u2019s State of Caring Survey - by filling it in (at www.carersuk.org/survey) unpaid carers in Northern Ireland can help inform the UK\u2019s most comprehensive study into people\u2019s experiences of looking after a loved one.

Perhaps the most basic flaw is that many \u2013 and if not the majority then certainly the most influential \u2013 parents fully support the status quo.\n\nAdmittedly it is the children of these parents that probably benefit the most from the status quo and there isn\u2019t a chance in hell of getting them to agree to change the education system unless they think it will further benefit their own children.\n\nTherefore, it would arguably make far more sense to first identify those pupils and schools that currently perform less well, and then set in train the policies, support and funding necessary to improve their lot \u2013 now. Otherwise those disadvantaged by the current system will remain just another footnote in this sterile perennial academic debate.\n\nDR BERNARD MULHOLLAND\n\nBelfast BT9"}, {"url": "https://parltrack.org/mep/John%20Walls%20CUSHNAHAN", "page_content": "Birth date 1948-07-23T00:00:00 place Belfast\n\nCV B.Ed., Queen's University, Belfast (1973).
