As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.

He was accompanied by four others: Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderain. All five were killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca.\n\nEarly Life\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane he discovered a love of flying.\n\n\u200d\n\nHis family was somewhat unusual. His brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen he joined the army he was stationed in Las Vegas NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident he learned to live life to the fullest.[1]\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen Nate was asked by a friend to fix a plane somewhere in Mexico, he finally agreed. After he repaired the plane, he discovered a need for his skill in the field of mission-work and also a new awareness of the value of missions. After going to Wheaton College, Nate married Marjorie Farris (commonly called Marj) in 1948 and eventually moved to Shell Mera, Ecuador. Here, Nate built his family a house which would also serve as a guesthouse and a radio center with the other missionaries.[2]\n\nLife in Ecuador, Meeting the Huaroni\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a Huaorani settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadorians, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force. They attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Nate Saint Died\n\nTheir initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.[3] Nate Saint was the first of the five missionaries to be speared to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. Life magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. After 51 years, the school has closed in 2017 due to falling enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition.

They forget that they too are expending their lives... and when the bubble has burst they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\" \u201cSon, we can\u2019t shoot the Waodani. They\u2019re not ready for heaven... we are.\u201d \"When life's flight is over, and we unload our cargo at the other end, the fellow who got rid of unnecessary weight will have the most valuable cargo to present the Lord.\" \"If God would grant us the vision, the word sacrifice would disappear from our lips and thoughts; we would hate the things that seem now so dear to us; our lives would suddenly be too short, we would despise time-robbing distractions and charge the enemy with all our energies in the name of Christ. May God help us ourselves by the eternities that separate the Aucas from a Comprehension of Christmas and Him, who, though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor so that we might, through his poverty, be made rich.\" \"I would rather die now than to live a life of oblivious ease in so sick a world.\" \"As we have a high old time this Christmas may we who know Christ hear the cry of the damned as they hurtle headlong into the Christless night without ever a chance.

Rachel Saint lived with the Huaroni two years after he died. She served as a missionary to Peru before later joining Nate in Ecuador. Nate had six brothers and one sister. Nate\u2019s father, Lawrence Saint, was a famous stain-glass artist, who worked on the Washington National Cathedral. His father was also a painter, specializing in landscape painting and silhouette cutting. As a kid, Nate built an 8-foot sailboat and took apart a car engine just to put it back together again.\n\nSources\n\nThis information is provided under the Wikipedia Creative Common License."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14667889/nathanael-saint", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

He was killed by Woadani Indians during Operation Auca, an attempt to reach them with the gospel.\n\nEarly life\n\nSaint was born in Pennsylvania, and was the seventh of eight children. Saint's parents were devout Presbyterians who attended church three times a week and held family devotions every day. Saint's father was also a prominent stained glass artist, and designed 18 windows in Washington National Cathedral. Saint's brother Phil and sister Rachel also became well-known missionaries, though in very different ways. When Saint was seven years old, his older brother Sam, who was a pilot, gave him a plane ride. This red left him with a lifelong interest in aviation. In high school he began pilot lessons, and then joined the United States Army during World War II. Saint was unable to enter the Air Corps, due to a crippling disease. This caused him to leave the Army and enroll at Wheaton College. About the same time Saint left the military, he received a letter from his father telling him of a new organization that was to become the Mission Aviation Fellowship, today a major mission board. Saint signed up, and was sent to the field early, before he had graduated college. He married Marjorie Farris, a registered nurse he met in California on Valentine's Day 1948. That same year they left for Ecuador and set up house at Shell Mera, and abandoned Shell Oil Company outpost.\n\nOperation Auca\n\nIn September 1955, Saint became the first to discover a Woadani village from the air. At the time, virtually all contact with this tribe had ended in violence, and the Ecuadorian government was threatening to send in troops. And so, with the intention of being the first to make peaceful contact with the tribe, Saint began to make regular gift drops over their village beginning in October of that year. He devised a special maneuver for accomplishing this feet. By letting out a great length of rope from the plane with a bucket at the end, and drawing the plane into a very tight circle, Saint could cause the bucket end of the rope to remain almost perfectly still on the ground. By this method, the missionaries were able to give gifts to the natives, and even receive gifts in return without needing an airstrip. Early in January of the next year, Saint discovered a fairly wide sandbar along the Curaray River in Woadani territory. By flying low over the sandbar at a certain speed, and dropping bags of flour at regular intervals, he was able to determine its length. It was about 650 feet long, which was just barely long enough to land the plane on. And so, on January 3, Saint, along with four other missionaries landed at this sandbar, which they called \"Palm Beach\". Their first peaceful contact with the Woadani came on January 6 when a man and two women emerged from the jungle. Saint gave the man two rides in the airplane, which delighted him. They also shared hamburgers and bug repelant with them. Then two days later, ten Woadani returned to Palm Beach. They ambushed and killed all five of the men. Saint's body was later discovered by a search team floating in the river. He had two chanta wood spears in his body, one in his stomach and another in his head, just behind his right eye. He was buried nearby in a mass grave with three other of the men.\n\nLegacy\n\nToday Saint is remembered as a modern Christian martyr. His story continues to inspire many. There have also been several books written about him, such as Jungle Pilot, but Russell T. Hill.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://dianaleaghmatthews.com/nate-saint/", "page_content": "Nathaniel Saint was a Christian missionary pilot to Ecuador, who was killed while attempting to spread the word of God.\n\nHe was born on August 30, 1923 in Hershey, Pennsylvania and had a sister named Rachel and a brother, Sam.

Five did and Died\u201d. This was the title of the January 30, 1956, Life magazine article that told of five missionaries who\n\nlost their lives while striving to accomplish the command given by Jesus Christ in Mark 16:15. Operation Auca was an attempt by five American\n\nmissionary families to contact the Huaorani people of the rainforest of Ecuador. The Huaorani, also known as Aucas (a modification of awqa, the Quechua word for \u201cenemies\u201d), were an isolated tribe known for their violence against both their own people and outsiders who entered their territory. With the intention of being the first Christians to evangelize the previously unreached Huaorani, the missionaries began making regular flights over Huaorani settlements in September 1955, dropping gifts. After several months of exchanging gifts, on January 3, 1956, the missionaries established a camp at \u201cPalm Beach,\u201d a sandbar along the Curaray River, a few miles from Huaorani settlements. Their efforts ended on January 8, 1956, when all five\u2014Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian\u2014were attacked and speared by a group of Huaorani warriors. The news of their deaths was broadcast around the world, and Life magazine covered the event with a photo essay.\n\nThe deaths of the men galvanized the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring of funding for evangelism efforts around the world. Their work is still frequently remembered in Christian publications, and in 2006 was the subject of the major motion picture film production, End of the Spear. Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Sumner Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaoranis. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of those involved in the killing. Only eternity will tell how many lives have been impacted around the world for the cause of Christ because of the obedience of these missionaries to surrender their lives to preach the Gospel.\n\nArtist note: Pictured left to right: (Row 1) Pete Fleming, Nate Saint and Jim Elliot; (Row 2) Roger Youderian and Ed McCully"}, {"url": "https://www.wikizero.com/m/Nate_Saint", "page_content": "Christian missionary killed in Ecuador (1923\u20131956)\n\nNathanael Saint (30 August 1923 \u2013 8 January 1956) was an evangelical Christian missionary pilot who, along with four others, was killed in Ecuador while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nSaint was born in 1923.

When he joined the army he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he nearly died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park.[1][page needed]\n\nBecoming a missionary [ edit ]\n\nWhen Saint was asked by a friend to fix a plane somewhere in Mexico, he agreed. After he repaired the plane, he discovered a need for his skill in the field of mission work and also a new awareness of the value of missions. After going to Wheaton College, Saint married Marjorie Farris (commonly called Marj) in 1948 and eventually moved to Shell, Ecuador. Here, Saint built his family a house which would also serve as a guesthouse and a radio center with the other missionaries.\n\nOperation Auca [ edit ]\n\nIn September 1955, Saint was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a Huaorani (also known as Auca) settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The team decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.[2] Saint was the third of the five missionaries to be speared to death.[3]\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. Life magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. A small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bore Saint's name for 51 years until the school closed in 2017 due to falling enrollment.[4]\n\nRachel, Saint's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.[2]\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Van Der Puy died in 2003, and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Highland Memorial Park, south of Ocala, Florida.\n\nSaint's older son, Steve, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted. As of 2006, Steve Saint works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye.[5] A documentary based on the story, Beyond Gates of Splendor, was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, End of the Spear, was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write Jungle Pilot, based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians. Steven Curtis Chapman wrote the song \"No Greater Love\" from his album Declaration as a tribute to Saint and his fellow missionaries.\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}]}
