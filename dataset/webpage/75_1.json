{"John Reed Jr. is best remembered for his first-hand account of the Russian Revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World (1919).": [{"url": "https://library.harvard.edu/collections/russian-revolution-0", "page_content": "Russia\u2019s revolutionary period (1905-1917) reshaped power dynamics throughout the world. Its impact is documented through pamphlets, literature, newspapers, and the personal papers of revolutionaries, counter-revolutionaries, and members of the imperial family and army.\n\nRevolutionary Material\n\nOne of Houghton\u2019s most notable revolutionary-related collections is the Leon Trotsky papers from his years in the Soviet Union, including Trotsky\u2019s manuscript speeches and his correspondence with Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Georgy Chicherin and other members of the early Soviet government. Houghton is also home to Trotsky\u2019s Exile Papers, showing his continued impact on world politics . (The harrowing story of how Harvard obtained Trotsky\u2019s papers is detailed in this Crimson article .)\n\nThe Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Casta\u00f1\u00e9 collection of political broadsides from revolutionary Russia, 1917-1920 is a visually rich collection of striking examples of posters produced by the Bolshevik government to celebrate revolutionary anniversaries and spread information. It is complemented by Houghton's collection of anti-revolutionary posters.\n\nHoughton is also home to a robust collection\u2014over 1,100 volumes\u2014of revolutionary literature published between 1826 and 1920. Works by 19th-century Russian revolutionary writers Mikhail Bakunin and Nikolay Chernyshevsky and early 20th-century revolutionaries such as Anatoly Lunacharsky and Vladimir Lenin document the nuances of the struggle. The collection can be browsed in HOLLIS using this search . (Toggling the date or publication location on the left-hand side will narrow the search.)\n\nThe counter-revolutionary perspective is documented in the papers of figures such as the Social democrat and Duma representative, Grigori\u012d Aleksinski\u012d , and the Grand Duke of Russia, Dmitri\u012d Pavlovich . The Russian civil war is highlighted in the Iuri\u012d Nikiforovich Danilov papers which include correspondence with commanders of the Russian White Army.\n\nTwo collections held at Houghton offer information on the assasination of the Russian Imperial family (who abdicated in 1917) and the rumored disappearance of the Grand Duchess Anastasia: the Sokolov Collection of documents concerning the investigation into the death of Nicholas II, 1918-1920 and the Edward Huntington Fallows \"Anastasia\" papers .\n\nThe making of a first-hand account of the Russian Revolution is found in the John Reed papers, 1910-1920 . Reed, a Harvard graduate, was an American Socialist who traveled to Russia just before the October Revolution and famously described the events in his book, Ten Days that Shook the World . The collection includes correspondence, manuscripts, printed material, ephemera and photographs of well-known figures such as Lenin, Trotsky, and Kerensky, as well as images of daily life in Russia during the revolution.\n\nRelated Collections at Harvard Library\n\nThe Charles Claflin Davis papers at the Harvard Law School Library offer crucial evidence of the Russian refugee experience. In the early 1920s Davis served as the Director of the South Eastern Base of the American Red Cross in Constantinople, which assisted many of Russia\u2019s refugees fleeing from civil war. The collection consists of letters, photos, albums of children's art, newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, a ledger, an almanac, and citations.\n\nThe Fung Library holds the papers of Poliksena Shishkina-Iavein, a prominent women\u2019s rights activist who played a pivotal role in the 1917 universal suffrage movement that secured electoral rights for the women of Russia. The collection contains over 140 digitized images of Shishkina-Iavein and the Russian League for Women's Equal Rights. Widener Library is home to a wide range of important revolutionary-era periodicals and pamphlets such as Poliarnaia zviezda, Prosvieshchenie , and Okrainy Rossii ."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/john.reed/3734528", "page_content": "The War in Eastern Europe (Classic Reprint)\n\n(Thb Eastern phases of the war are by far the most confusi...)\n\nThb Eastern phases of the war are by far the most confusing and uncertain, a book explaining the political or military situations in Russia, the Balkans, and Turkey, however sound at the time of acceptance for publication, would probably be utterly misleading when it came from the press. But while physical circum- stances change, human nature never does; and it was chiefly with humanity that John Reed and Boardman Robinson were concerned when they travelled through these countries for the Metropolitan Magazine: just as the novelist or the biographer presents the personality of a character so do they present the personality of a nation. As I look back on it all, says Mr. Reed, it seems to me that the most important thing to know about the war is how the different peoples live; their environment, tradition, and the revealing things they do and say. In time of peace, many human qualities are covered up which come to the surface in a sharp crisis; but on the other hand, much of personal and racial quality is submerged in time of great public stress. And in this book Robinson and I have simply tried to give our impressions of human beings as we found them in the countries of Eastern Europe, from A pril to October, 1915.

Though he thought of himself as a poet and fiction writer, it was as a journalist that Reed gained acclaim. Known for crossing over the line from objective reporting into advocacy for a cause, Reed\u2019s work as both a war correspondent and an activist led Walter Lippmann, a contemporary reporter, to say that \u201cwith Jack Reed reporting begins.\u201d As critic Elmer Bendiner of the Nation explained, \u201cThe name of John Reed is breathed nowadays like a sigh for lost innocence. He was a journalist of a sort that has gone out of style . . . a reporter on horseback seeking his story in the faces and gestures of the living warriors, not in word games of press handouts or news conferences.\u201d The leader of the Communist Labor Party in the United States, Reed is the only American and one of the few foreigners to have ever been buried at the foot of the Kremlin wall.\n\n\n\nBorn and raised in a wealthy family in Oregon, Reed was educated at Harvard and began his writing career there, writing poetry and plays and serving on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and Harvard Monthly. After his graduation in 1910, he moved to Greenwich Village and joined the staff of the American Magazine as both a contributor and editor. It was during this time that Reed first became interested in social problems, and quickly became a radical. \u201cJohn Reed was so active in radical politics as to have too little time left for poetry,\u201d wrote Harriet Monroe in Poetry magazine, explaining why Reed\u2019s poetry career had never reached its full potential. \u201cKnowing himself for a poet, he hoped to prove his vocation by many poems worthy to endure; but life was so exciting, and the social struggle in these States and Mexico, in Finland, Russia\u2014everywhere\u2014so tempting to a fighting radical, that poetry had to wait for the leisure which\u2014alas!\u2014never came.\u201d In 1913, Reed joined the staff of The Masses, a periodical that reflected his political views. For The Masses, he wrote an account of the silk workers\u2019s strike in Paterson, New Jersey; during the writing of the article, he was arrested for his attempts to speak on behalf of the strikers. He went on to write a play about the strike, which he produced in Madison Square Garden, performed by the strikers themselves.\n\n\n\nIn 1914, Reed was hired as a war correspondent by Metropolitan magazine to cover the Mexican revolution. Reed followed Pancho Villa\u2019s army and lived among his soldiers for four months, traveling with them across the desert, sleeping on the ground, celebrating in looted haciendas, and being with them in battle. The resulting series of articles, republished in book form as Insurgent Mexico, attracted more critical attention and earned Reed the reputation \u201cthe American Kipling.\u201d Insurgent Mexico, divided into six sections, provides descriptions of the Desert War, the attack on Torre\u00f3n, rebel leader Pancho Villa, and an interview with Carranza, another leader of the rebellion. \u201cThe articles he sent back from the border were as hot as the Mexican desert,\u201d reported Walter Lippman, writing for the New Republic, \u201cand Villa\u2019s revolution, till then reported only as a nuisance, began to unfold itself into throngs of moving people in a gorgeous panorama of earth and sky.\u201d\n\n\n\nRobert Rosenstone, in his biography of Reed, Romantic Revolutionary, noted that the book\u2019s \u201cartistically arranged scenes have a balance, coherence and integrity that daily experience lacks. Skies often turn blood-red after battles, simple peons speak with uncanny folk wisdom, the narrator has sudden flashing insights into the symbolic meanings of complex events\u2014such things occur too often to be taken as a literal transcription of what Reed saw, heard and did.\u201d Granville Hicks, in his biography John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary, said of this quality in the work, Reed \u201cwas indifferent to the accuracy of the historian, but he had the integrity of a poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot all critics were won over by Reed\u2019s narrative style. A reviewer for the Nation commented, \u201cThe book is a lurid exaggeration of some few aspects, and the frenzied manner of the whole composition aims not so much at depicting sober truths as at shocking the reader by disgusting naturalism in describing an irregular assortment of horrors such as were to be found nowhere else in the world at the time that Reed wrote.\u201d Critics in the late twentieth century, however, recognized the merits of Insurgent Mexico; a writer in History Today called it \u201ca classic indeed,\u201d and Richard Elman of the Nation claimed that the book was \u201cReed\u2019s finest writing, a book of such vividness, empathy and daring that much of what passes for personal journalism today does seem callow by comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nReed himself described his travel to Mexico in his essay \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d printed in the New Republic. \u201cA terrible curiosity urged me on,\u201d he described. \u201cI felt I had to know how I would act under fire, how I would get along with these primitive folks at war. And I discovered that bullets are not very terrifying, that the fear of death is not such a great thing, and that the Mexicans are wonderfully congenial. . . . I loved them and I loved the life. I found myself again. I wrote better than I have ever written.\u201d\n\n\n\nReed returned from Mexico a popular figure, but his acclaim soon faded due to his opposition to World War I and his participation in the Socialist Party. Many magazines would no longer print his work, and his next book, The War in Eastern Europe, was called by Harry Henderson in the Massachusetts Review a \u201cdismal failure.\u201d The articles for this book were again commissioned by Metropolitan, and Reed traveled to Europe, behind both Allied and German lines. Because of Reed\u2019s socialist views, he was not granted the same insider\u2019s view as he had been in Mexico. Though he used the same form as he had for Insurgent Mexico, without his being able to identify with a specific cause, according to Henderson, \u201cReed becomes entirely disoriented as a narrator.\u201d Unable to recreate his earlier successes, Reed began co-writing and producing short plays for the Provincetown Players with Louise Bryant and Eugene O\u2019Neill. Bryant became his wife in 1917.\n\n\n\nIn August of 1917, Reed and Bryant sailed to Russia to cover the coming revolution. As a supporter of communism, Reed quickly sided with Vladimir Lenin and his supporters, and was an enthusiastic witness to the Bolshevik revolution in Petrograd. Reed alone among the foreign correspondents was given an insider\u2019s view and treated as a fellow to the cause. He kept a diary of his conversations with educated leaders and peasants alike. The book that recorded the events of the revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, is, according to Henderson, \u201cthe great case in the history of eye-witness accounts of the right reporter being in the right place at the right time.\u201d Ten Days that Shook the World was \u201cthe first major account in America of the revolution\u2019s universal impact,\u201d according to John Stuart in his introduction to The Education of John Reed, and is often considered by critics the finest first-hand account of the Russian revolution.\n\n\n\nBertram D. Wolfe, in his book Strange Communists I Have Known, explained that Reed \u201ctried to see it all and put it all on paper. The dream of the Bolsheviks, the realities of their deeds, and the tension between the dream and reality are in his pages.\u201d Stuart praised Reed, declaring, \u201cWhat he wrote about the Russian Revolution in Ten Days that Shook the World, with its extraordinary weaving of significant detail into a triumphal theme, was a measure of the great leap forward he had made.\u201d But the reception of the book in America at the time was not positive. Even before its publication, Reed had not been allowed to return to the United States due to a sedition charge against him for articles he had written for The Masses. When he was finally allowed entrance into the country, he turned from journalism to politics, and organized the Communist Labor Party, one of the two rival communist parties in the United States. When Ten Days that Shook the World was published in 1919, Reed was indicted as a communist leader during the \u201cRed Scare\u201d after World War I, due to his radical stance and obvious support of communism. He fled the country, eventually returning to Russia where he died of typhus. Reed was buried, honored as a Soviet hero, under the Kremlin wall facing the Red Square, the only American and one of the few foreigners to receive such an honor."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/John-Reed-%28journalist%29", "page_content": "John Silas \"Jack\" Reed (October 22, 1887 \u2013 October 17, 1920) was an American journalist, poet, and socialist activist, best remembered for his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World. He was married to writer and feminist Louise Bryant. Reed died in Russia in 1920 and is one of only three Americans buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the others being labor organizer Bill Haywood, and Charles Ruthenburg (the founder of the Communist Party USA).\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandmother's mansion in Portland, Oregon, with Chinese servants in today's Goose Hollow neighborhood. He wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. A memorial bench overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace in Washington Park. His mother, Margaret Green Reed, was the daughter of a leading Portland citizen who had made a fortune through three enterprises: as owner of the first gas works in Oregon, owner of the first pig iron smelter on the west coast, and as second owner of the Portland water works. John's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer who had come to town from the East. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland\u2019s business community. The family's wealth came from the Green side, not the Eastern-transplanted Reed side. His parents were married in 1886.\n\nA sickly child, young \"Jack\" grew up surrounded by nurses and servants, and his upper-class playmates were carefully selected. His brother, Harry, was two years younger. Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school. Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious. In September 1904, Jack was sent to Morristown School in New Jersey to prepare for college as his father, who never attended a university, wanted his sons to go to Harvard. At this prep school, Jack continued his track record of poor classroom performance, although he did make the football team and showed literary promise.\n\nReed failed in his first attempt on the admission exam but passed on his second try and in the fall of 1906 he entered Harvard College. Tall, handsome, and light-hearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club. He served on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and The Harvard Monthly and as president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held the position of \u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and also wrote music and lyrics for their show Diana's Debut. Reed failed to make the Harvard teams for football and crew, but excelled in other sports of lesser prestige, swimming and water polo. He was also made Ivy orator and poet in his senior year of college.\n\nReed also attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but he never joined. Still, the club left its impact on his psyche. The group had social legislation introduced into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration for the establishment of a course in Socialism. Reed later recalled:\n\nAll this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H.G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910, and that summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring. Reed chose to work for his fare to Europe on a cattle boat and experience the way of a common laborer. Reed's traveling was encouraged by his favorite professor, Charles Townsend Copeland or \"Copey\", who told him he must \"see life\" if he wanted to successfully write about it.\n\nBohemian journalist\n\nJohn Reed had determined to become a journalist and he set out to make his mark in the big city in which that industry was based, New York. Reed made use of a valuable contact he had made at Harvard, the muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens, who appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on The American Magazine, reading manuscripts, correcting proofs, and later helping with the composition. Reed supplemented his insufficient salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called Landscape Architecture.\n\nReed made his home in Greenwich Village, a burgeoning hub of poets and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a freelance journalist that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in The Saturday Evening Post. Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by Collier's, The Forum, and The Century Magazine. One of his poems was set to music by composer Arthur Foote, and the editors at The American came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and Ida Tarbell, and once aroused it quickly led him to a far more radical position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of The Masses, edited by Max Eastman. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of strikers in the New Jersey silk mills. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term that followed further radicalized him. Reed allied himself with the syndicalist trade union the Industrial Workers of the World. His account of his experiences appeared in June as an article, \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader Bill Haywood, Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in Madison Square Garden as a benefit for the strikers.\n\nIn the autumn of 1913 Reed was sent to Mexico by the Metropolitan Magazine to report the Mexican Revolution. He shared the perils of Pancho Villa's army for four months, and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was Venustiano Carranza) when it defeated Federal forces at Torre\u00f3n, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City. Reed adored Villa, while Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's time with the Villistas resulted in a series of outstanding magazine articles that brought Reed a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the plight of the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention, which came shortly after he left. Reed's Mexican reports were later republished in book form as Insurgent Mexico, which appeared in 1914.\n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in Colorado, scene of the recent Ludlow massacre. There he spent a little more than a week and investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July), and came to believe much more deeply in class conflict. That summer he spent in Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together Insurgent Mexico and interviewing President Wilson on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at White House insistence, was not a success.\n\nWar correspondent\n\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after Germany declared war on France, he set sail for neutral Italy, having been sent by the Metropolitan. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in Naples, and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed saw the war as having emerged from imperialist commercial rivalries and showed little sympathy for any of the participants. In an unsigned piece entitled \"The Traders\u2019 War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of The Masses, Reed passionately wrote:\n\n\"The real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted. It is a clash of Traders...\n\n\n\n\"What has democracy to do in alliance with Nicholas, the Tsar? Is it Liberalism which is marching from the Petersburg of Father Gapon, from the Odessa of the pogroms?...\n\n\n\n\"No. There is a falling out among commercial rivals....\n\n\n\n\"We, who are Socialists, must hope \u2014 we may even expect \u2014 that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far-reaching social changes \u2014 and a long step forward towards our goal of Peace among Men.\n\n\n\n\"But we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about Liberalism going forth to Holy War against Tyranny.\n\n\n\nIn France, he was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of accessing the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman. The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed Karl Liebknecht, one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the Second International, and by its replacement with militarism and nationalism.\n\nHe returned to New York in the middle of that month and occupied himself writing about the war. A return to Central Europe followed in 1915, a journey on which he was accompanied by Canadian artist and frequent Masses contributor Boardman Robinson. Traveling from Thessaloniki, they met scenes of profound devastation in Serbia (including a bombed-out Belgrade), also going through Bulgaria and Romania. They passed through the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Bessarabia, and in Che\u0142m they were arrested, incarcerated for several weeks and liable to be shot for espionage had the American ambassador not shown some interest.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the ambassador in Petrograd was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time it was the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) who finally secured permission for them to leave, but not before all their papers were seized in Kiev. In Bucharest the duo spent time piecing together their journey, with Reed at one point traveling to Constantinople in hopes of seeing action at Gallipoli. These experiences led to Reed's book, The War in Eastern Europe, published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, he paid a visit to his mother in Portland, where he met and fell in love with Louise Bryant, who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both had affairs with others rather freely, in accord with the bohemian sensibilities of sexual liberation in common currency in that day. Early in 1916 Reed met Eugene O'Neill, and beginning that May the three rented a cottage in Provincetown. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.\n\nThat summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. Reed himself endorsed Woodrow Wilson, believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war. In November 1916 he married Bryant in Peekskill, New York. In the same year he underwent an operation to remove a kidney at Johns Hopkins Hospital and was hospitalized until mid-December. The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a conscientious objector. During 1916 he also published privately Tamburlaine and Other Poems in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, the radical Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the Metropolitan was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his Cape Cod cottage to birth control activist and sex educator Margaret Sanger. When Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the People's Council in Washington: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\" In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles for The Masses, which the United States Postal Service refused to mail, and for Seven Arts, which lost its financial backing as a result of an article by Reed and one earlier in the summer by Randolph Bourne, and ceased publication. Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor and his career lay in ruins.\n\nWitness to the Russian Revolution\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the State Department with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in Stockholm. The pair were going as working journalists to see for themselves and report upon the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of Finland, the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed military coup of monarchist General Lavr Kornilov, an attempt to topple the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles and several of the subject nationalities of the old empire, such as Finland and Ukraine, autonomous and seeking to forge a military accommodation with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant wound up at ground zero for the October Revolution, in which the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (bolshevik) headed by Vladimir Lenin toppled the Kerensky government in what they believed to be the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nThe food situation in the capital was dire. Reed later recalled:\n\nThe last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down \u2014 milk and everything of that sort.\"\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government saw this as a clear effort to replace its own regime with another and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press, issuing warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and preparing to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets and at 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the Winter Palace, seat of Kerensky's government. Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government and went to work for the new People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news of the actions of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met Leon Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the Constituent Assembly on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted and he took employment with an American, Raymond Robins of the Red Cross. Robins wished to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied, but in the dummy issue he prepared he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved, and two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of Red Guards prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack. Reed then attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, where he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted. In January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York; as the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, his credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). The appointment was viewed as a massive blunder by most Americans in Petrograd, and the businessman Alex Gumberg directly approached Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for the setting up of a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew the nomination; thereafter, Reed mentioned Gumberg's name only with a string of epithets attached.\n\nBoth Reed and Bryant netted books from their Russian experiences, with Bryant's Six Red Months in Russia appearing first and Reed's 10 Days That Shook the World, published early in 1919, garnering the most notice.\n\nBryant made her way home to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28. On his way back to the USA, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to Finland. In Turku harbor, when Reed was boarding a ship on his way to Stockholm, Finnish police arrested Reed and took him to Kakola prison in Turku until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to Kristiania, Norway via Stockholm. Because he remained under indictment in the Masses case, Reed was immediately met by federal authorities, who held him on board his ship for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the raw material from which he intended to write his book, were seized, and he was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, Morris Hillquit, promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day. His papers were not returned to him until November.\n\nRadical political activist\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant took pains to defend the Bolsheviks and oppose American intervention, but a hyper-patriotic public incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany gave him a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in The Masses and particularly a headline, \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy\", had been largely instrumental in bringing an indictment against that magazine for sedition. The first Masses trial ended in a hung jury the day before he arrived; the defendants, including himself, were to be retried, so after returning, he immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.\n\nThe second Masses trial also ended in a hung jury. In Philadelphia, he stood outside a closed hall on May 31, harangued a crowd of 1,000 until police dragged him away, was charged with inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. He was now more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive; his third arrest since his return from Russia came on September 14, when he was charged with violating the Sedition Act and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia held in the United States (in The Bronx), when Reed passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well. He tried to prevent Allied intervention, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the Ukraine and Japanese designs on Siberia, but this came to naught.\n\nOn February 21\u201322, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a Senate committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient; Reed followed on the 22nd, delivering quick, subtle testimony which was, however, savagely distorted by the press. Later that day he went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted. Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of The New York Communist, the weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals then split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the Communist Labor Party of America (Reed's, in the creation of which he had been indispensable) and, the next day, the Communist Party of America. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, The Voice of Labor, and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, The Communist. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat, which he saw as a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"\n\nComintern functionary\n\nIndicted for sedition and hoping to secure Comintern backing for the CLP, Reed fled from America in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate by means of a forged passport, working his way to Bergen as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to Kristiania, crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to Moscow by train. In the cold winter of 1919\u201320, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages; filling notebooks; and carrying on an affair with a Russian woman. His feelings about the revolution were now ambiguous: on the one hand, he told Emma Goldman, who had recently arrived aboard Buford and especially complained about the Cheka, that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate. However, he suggested that she see Angelica Balabanoff, a critic of the current situation, indicating he wanted Goldman to hear the other side.\n\nReed, although facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, tried to return home in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America. Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to Petrograd. In March, he crossed into Helsinki, where he had radical friends, including the future politician and SDKL member of parliament Hella Wuolijoki. With their help he was hidden in the hold of a freighter. On the 13th, customs officials found him in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was the seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. As a result of his silence, he was not able to be tried for treason, and was instead convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe US Secretary of State was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finns for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate. Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained illegally, and his physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from depression and insomnia, wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a hunger strike. He was finally released in early June, and sailed for Tallinn, Estonia, on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to Petrograd, recuperating from malnutrition and scurvy caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively, but his spirits were high.\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow and, after discussing with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish tramp steamer and arrived in Gothenburg on August 10. At the same time, Reed attended the second Comintern congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians, who assumed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, making it necessary for the Communist party to work within the existing institutions \u2013 a policy Reed felt would be disastrous. He was contemptuous of the bullying tactics displayed during the congress by Karl Radek and Grigory Zinoviev, who ordered Reed to attend the Congress of the Peoples of the East to be held at Baku on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through countryside devastated by civil war and infected by typhus. Reed was reluctant to go and asked to arrive later, as he had planned to go first to Petrograd, where Bryant was arriving from Murmansk. Zinoviev insisted Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\" Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance. Reed's actions and feelings during this time are a matter of speculation, but years after abandoning Communism, his friend Benjamin Gitlow asserted that the treatment Reed received from Zinoviev filled Reed with bitter disillusionment for the Communist movement.\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took her to meet Lenin, Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\nDeath\n\nReed was determined to return home, but fell ill on September 25. At first thought, mistakenly, to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and was found to have spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. His mind started to wander, and then he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920. After a hero's funeral, his body was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe uses of Reed as a symbol in popular culture have been varied. Some have dismissed him as a \"romantic revolutionary\" and a \"playboy\", a vapid dilettante pretending to profess revolutionary sensibilities. For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amidst solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon. Others, such as his old friend and comrade Benjamin Gitlow, claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism late in his life and have thus sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own anti-communist cause.\n\nReed has also been an influence upon the cinema. Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein's influential 1927 silent film October: Ten Days That Shook the World was based on Reed's book.\n\nJohn Dos Passos included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work 1919, the second part of his U.S.A. trilogy.\n\nHalf a century later, Warren Beatty made the 1981 film Reds, based on Reed's life. Beatty starred as Reed, while Diane Keaton played Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson Eugene O'Neill. The movie won three Academy Awards, and was nominated for nine others.\n\nThe 1958 Soviet film In October Days (Russian: \u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f), directed by the highly regarded Sergei Vasilyev, also featured roles for Reed and Bryant.\n\nTwo films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution: the 1973 film Reed: Insurgent Mexico, by Mexican director Paul Leduc, and the two-part Mexican\u2013Soviet-Italian co-production consisting of Red Bells (1982) and Red Bells II (1983), both directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, with Franco Nero as Reed."}, {"url": "https://fampeople.com/cat-john-reed-journalist", "page_content": "John Reed (journalist) : biography\n\nJohn Silas \"Jack\" Reed (October 22, 1887 \u2013 October 17, 1920) was an American journalist, poet, and socialist activist, best remembered for his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World. He was married to writer and feminist Louise Bryant. Reed died in Russia in 1920, and was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandmother\u2019s mansion in Portland, Oregon.Granville Hicks with John Stuart, John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary. New York: Macmillan, 1936. Page 1. His mother, Margaret Green Reed, was the daughter of a leading Portland citizen who had made a fortune through three enterprises: as owner of the first gas works in Oregon, owner of the first pig iron smelter on the west coast, and as second owner of the Portland water works.Hicks with Stuart, John Reed, p. 2. John\u2019s father, Charles Jerome Reed, was the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer who had come to town from the East. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland\u2019s business community.Eric Homberger, John Reed. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1990. Pages 7-8. The family\u2019s wealth came from the Green side, not the Eastern-transplanted Reed side. His parents were married in 1886.\n\nJohn Reed, John Reed, John Reed, John Reed,\n\nReed failed in his first attempt on the admission exam but passed on his second try and in the fall of 1906 he entered Harvard College.Homberger, John Reed, p. 15. Tall, handsome, and light-hearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club. He served on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and the Harvard Monthly and as president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held the position of \u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and also wrote music and lyrics for their show Diana\u2019s Debut. Reed failed to make the Harvard teams for football and crew, but excelled in other sports of lesser prestige, swimming and water polo.Homberger, John Reed, p. 16. He was also made Ivy orator and poet in his senior year of college.\n\nReed also attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but he never joined. Still, the club left its impact on his psyche. The group had social legislation introduced into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration for the establishment of a course in Socialism.Hicks with Stuart, John Reed, page 33. Reed later recalled: All this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H.G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.Quoted in Hicks with Stuart, John Reed, p. 33.\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910, and that summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring.Hicks with Stuart, John Reed, p. 51.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nReed was determined to return home, but fell ill on September 25. At first thought but mistaken to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and was found to have spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade.

The sentries in the square had all disappeared. The great semi-circle of government buildings seemed deserted. We went into the Hotel France for dinner, and right in the middle of soup the waiter, very pale in the face, came up and insisted that we move to the main dining-room at the back of the house, because they were going to put out the lights in the caf\u00e9. \u201cThere will be much shooting,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen we came out on the Morskaya again it was quite dark, except for one flickering street light on the corner of the Nevsky. Under this stood a big armoured automobile, with racing engine and oil-smoke pouring out of it. A small boy had climbed up the side of the thing and was looking down the barrel of a machine gun. Soldiers and sailors stood around, evidently waiting for something. We walked back up to the Red Arch, where a knot of soldiers was gathered staring at the brightly-lighted Winter Palace and talking in loud tones.\n\n\u201cNo, comrades,\u201d one was saying. \u201cHow can we shoot at them? The Women\u2019s Battalion is in there \u2013 they will say we have fired on Russian women.\u201d\n\nAs we reached the Nevsky again another armoured car came around the corner, and a man poked his head out of the turret-top.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d he yelled. \u201cLet\u2019s go on through and attack!\u201d\n\nThe driver of the other car came over, and shouted so as to be heard above the roaring engine. \u201cThe committee says to wait. They have got artillery behind the wood-piles in there...\u201d\n\nHere the street cars had stopped running, few people passed, and there were no lights; but a few blocks away we could see the trams, the crowds, the lighted shop-windows and the electric signs of the moving-picture shows \u2013 life going on as usual.\n\nWe had tickets to the ballet at the Marinsky Theatre \u2013 all theatres were open \u2013 but it was too exciting out of doors...\n\nIn the darkness we stumbled over lumber-piles barricading the Police Bridge, and before the Stroganov Palace made out some soldiers wheeling into position a three-inch field gun. Men in various uniforms were coming and going in an aimless way, and doing a great deal of talking.\n\nUp the Nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading. On every corner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion. Pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at the street-crossings, red-faced old men in rich fur coats shook their fists at them, smartly-dressed women screamed epithets; the soldiers argued feebly, with embarrassed grins. Armoured cars went up and down the street, named after the first Tsars \u2013 Oleg, Rurik, Svietoslav \u2013 and daubed with huge red letters, \u201cRSDRP\u201d (Rossiskaya Partia). At the Mikhailovsky a man appeared with an armful of newspapers, and was immediately stormed by frantic people, offering a rouble, five roubles, ten roubles, tearing at each other like animals. It was Rabotchi i Soldat, announcing the victory of the Proletarian Revolution, the liberation of the Bolsheviki still in prison, calling upon the Army front and rear for support \u2013 a feverish little sheet of four pages, running to enormous type, containing no news...\n\nCover of Bezbozhnik, a Soviet atheist magazine marking the 13th anniversary of the October Revolution, 1930 | Image credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\nOn the corner of the Sadovaya about two thousand citizens had gathered, staring up at the roof of a tall building, where a tiny red spark glowed and waned.\n\n\u201cSee!\u201d said a tall peasant, pointing to it. \u201cIt is a provocator. Presently he will fire on the people...\u201d Apparently no one thought of going to investigate.\n\nThe massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up, and from every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dim in the gloom.\n\nAutomobiles and motorcycles came and went; an enormous elephant-coloured armoured automobile, with two red flags flying from the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, and at the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bonfire. At the inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which the sentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down. The canvas covers had been taken off the four rapid-fire guns on each side of the doorway, and the ammunition belts hung snakelike from their breeches. A dun herd of armoured cars stood under the trees in the courtyard, engines going. The long, bare, dimly-illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet, calling, shouting...there was an atmosphere of recklessness. A crowd came pouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round black fur hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders, soldiers in rough dirt-coloured coats and grey fur shapki pinched flat, a leader or so \u2013 Lunatcharsky, Kameniev \u2013 hurrying along in the centre of a group all talking at once, with harassed anxious faces, and bulging portfolios under their arms. The extraordinary meeting of the Petrograd Soviet was over. I stopped Kameniev \u2013 a quick moving little man, with a wide, vivacious face set close to his shoulders. Without preface he read in rapid French a copy of the resolution just passed:\n\nThe Petrograd Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies, saluting the victorious Revolution of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison, particularly emphasises the unity, organisation, discipline, and complete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising; rarely has less blood been spilled, and rarely has an insurrection succeeded so well. The Soviet expresses its firm conviction that the workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 government which, as the government of the Soviets, will be created by the Revolution, and which will assure the industrial proletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants, will march firmly toward socialism, the only means by which the country can be spared the miseries and unheard-of horrors of war. The new workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 government will propose immediately a just and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries. It will suppress immediately the great landed property, and transfer the land to the peasants. It will establish workmen\u2019s control over production and distribution of manufactured products, and will set up a general control over the banks, which it will transform into a state monopoly. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies calls upon the workers and the peasants of Russia to support with all their energy and all their devotion the Proletarian Revolution. The Soviet expresses its conviction that the city workers, allies of the poor peasants, will assure complete revolutionary order, indispensable to the victory of socialism. The Soviet is convinced that the proletariat of the countries of Western Europe will aid us in conducting the cause of socialism to a real and lasting victory.\n\n\u201cYou consider it won then?\u201d\n\nHe lifted his shoulders. \u201cThere is much to do. Horribly much. It is just beginning...\u201d\n\nIt had been a momentous session. In the name of the Military Revolutionary Committee Trotzky had declared that the provisional government no longer existed.\n\n\u201cThe characteristic of bourgeois governments,\u201d he said, \u201cis to deceive the people. We, the Soviets of Workers\u2019, Soldiers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Deputies, are going to try an experiment unique in history; we are going to found a power which will have no other aim but to satisfy the needs of the soldiers, workers, and peasants.\u201d\n\nLenin had appeared, welcomed with a mighty ovation, prophesying world-wide social revolution... And Zinoviev, crying, \u201cThis day we have paid our debt to the international proletariat, and struck a terrible blow at the war, a terrible body blow at all the imperialists and particularly at Wilhelm the Executioner...\n\nThen Trotzky, that telegrams had been sent to the front announcing the victorious insurrection, but no reply had come. Troops were said to be marching against Petrograd \u2013 a delegation must be sent to tell them the truth.\n\nCries, \u201cYou are anticipating the will of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets!\u201d\n\nTrotzky, coldly, \u201cThe will of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets has been anticipated by the rising of the Petrograd workers and soldiers!\u201d\n\nSo we came into the great meeting hall, pushing through the clamorous mob at the door. In the rows of seats, under the white chandeliers, packed immovably in the aisles and on the sides, perched on every window-sill, and even the edge of the platform, the representatives of the workers and soldiers of all Russia waited in anxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairman\u2019s bell.\n\nThere was no heat in the hall but the stifling heat of unwashed human bodies. A foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke rose from the mass and hung in the thick air. Occasionally some one in authority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to smoke; then everybody, smokers and all, took up the cry \u201cDon\u2019t smoke, comrades!\u201d and went on smoking. Petrovsky, anarchist delegate from the Obukhov factory, made a seat for me beside him. Unshaven and filthy, he was reeling from three nights\u2019 sleepless work on the Military Revolutionary Committee.\n\nThe Petrograd Soviet Assembly meeting in 1917 | Image credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\nOn the platform sat the leaders of the old Tsay-ee-kah\u2014for the last time dominating the turbulent Soviets, which they had ruled from the first days, and which were now risen against them. It was the end of the first period of the Russian revolution, which these men had attempted to guide in careful ways. The three greatest of them were not there: Kerensky, flying to the front through country towns all doubtfully heaving up; Tcheidze, the old eagle, who had contemptuously retired to his own Georgian mountains, there to sicken with consumption; and the high-souled Tseretelli, also mortally stricken, who, nevertheless, would return and pour out his beautiful eloquence for a lost cause. Gotz sat there, Dan, Lieber, Bogdanov, Broido, Fillipovsky \u2013 white-faced, hollow-eyed and indignant. Below them the second siezd of the All-Russian Soviets boiled and swirled, and over their heads the Military Revolutionary Committee functioned white-hot, holding in its hands the threads of insurrection and striking with a long arm. It was 10.40 pm.\n\nDan, a mild-faced, baldish figure in a shapeless military surgeon\u2019s uniform, was ringing the bell. Silence fell sharply, intense, broken by the scuffling and disputing of the people at the door.\n\n\u201cWe have the power in our hands,\u201d he began sadly, stopped for a moment, and then went on in a low voice.\n\n\u201cComrades! The Congress of Soviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such an extraordinary moment that you will understand why the Tsay-ee-kah considers it unnecessary to address you with a political speech. This will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that I am a member of the Tsay-ee-kah, and that at this very moment our party comrades are in the Winter Palace under bombardment, sacrificing themselves to execute the duty put on them by the Tsay-ee-kah.\u201d (Confused uproar.)\n\n\u201cI declare the first session of the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies open!\u201d\n\nExcerpted from Ten Days That Shook The World by John Reed."}, {"url": "https://www.poemhunter.com/john-reed/", "page_content": "The Best Poem Of John Reed\n\nLove At Sea\n\n\n\nWind smothers the snarling of the great ships,\n\nAnd the serene gulls are stronger than turbines;\n\nMile upon mile the hiss of a stumbling wave breaks unbroken\u2014\n\nYet stronger is the power of your lips for my lips.\n\n\n\nThis cool green liquid death shall toss us living\n\nHigher than high heaven and deeper than sighs\u2014\n\nBut O the abrupt, stiff, sloping, resistless foam\n\nShall not forbid our taking and our giving!\n\n\n\nLife wrenched from its roots-What wretchedness!\n\nWhat waving of lost tentacles like blind sea-things!\n\nEven the still ooze beneath is quick and profound\u2014\n\nI am less and more than I was, you are more and less.\n\n\n\nI cried upon God last night, and God was not where I cried;\n\nHe was slipping and balancing on the thoughtless shifting planes of sea.\n\nCareless and cruel, he will unchain the appalling sea-gray engines\u2014\n\nBut the speech of your body to my body will not be denied!"}, {"url": "https://alphahistory.com/russianrevolution/historian-john-reed/", "page_content": "John Reed was more journalist than historian and his popular Russian Revolution book, Ten Days that Shook the World, is more partisan commentary than history.

If they had not succeeded to the Government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind that the armies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow in December, and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar.

But in telling the story of those great day I have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested insetting down the truth. Preface\n\nSo, with the crash of artillery, in the dark, with hatred, and fear, and reckless daring, new Russia was being born.\n\nI suddenly realized that the devout Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which it was a glory to die\u2026.\n\nCarlyle, in his French Revolution, has described the French people as distinguished above all others by their faculty of standing in queue. Russia had accustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of Nicholas the Blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then continued intermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as the regular order of things.\n\nThe ladies of the minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon, carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, and half a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the Tsar were back, or that the Germans would come, or anything that would solve the servant problem\u2026. The daughter of a friend of mine came home one afternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor had called her \"Comrade!\n\nA soldier was speaking - from the Five Hundred and Forty-eight Division, wherever and whatever that was: \"Comrades,\" he cried, and there was real anguish in his drawn face and despairing gestures. \"The people at the top are always calling upon us to sacrifice more, sacrifice, while those who have everything are left unmolested. We are at war with Germany. Would we invite German generals to serve on our Staff? Well we're at war with the capitalists too, and yet we invite them into our Government...\" Ch. 1, p. 19\n\nWhen the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to the workers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we have something to fight for, and we'll fight for it!\"\n\nCh.1, p.19\n\nQuotes about John Reed [ edit ]\n\nI was probably the only person with whom she (Louise Bryant) talked freely and bitterly of Jack's experiences in Russia and his disillusion. She was convinced that this disillusion had robbed him of that will to live which might have saved his life. Angelica Balabanoff My Life As a Rebel (1938)\n\n\n\nJohn Reed had burst into my room like a sudden ray of light, the old buoyant, adventurous Jack that I used to know in the States. He was about to return to America, by way of Latvia. Rather a hazardous journey, he said, but he would take even greater risks to bring the inspiring message of Soviet Russia to his native land. \"Wonderful, marvellous, isn't it, E.G.?\" he exclaimed. \"Your dream of years now realized in Russia, your dream scorned and persecuted in my country, but made real by the magic wand of Lenin and his band of despised Bolsheviks. Did you ever expect such a thing to happen in the country ruled by the tsars for centuries?\" \"Not by Lenin and his comrades, dear Jack,\" I corrected, \"though I do not deny their great part. But by the whole Russian people, preceded by a glorious revolutionary past. No other land of our days has been so literally nurtured by the blood of her martyrs, a long procession of pioneers who went to their death that new life may spring from their graves.\" Jack insisted that the young generation cannot for ever be tied to the apron-strings of the old, particularly when those strings are tightly drawn around its throat. \"Look at your old pioneers, the Breshkovskayas and Tchaikovskys, the Chernovs and Kerenskys and the rest of them,\" he cried heatedly; \"see where they are now! With the Black Hundreds, the Jew-baiters, and the ducal clique, aiding them to crush the Revolution. I don't give a damn for their past. I am concerned only in what the treacherous gang has been doing during the past three years. To the wall with them! I say. I have learned one mighty expressive Russian word, 'razstrellyat'!\" (execute by shooting).

In its pages you could find brilliant artists and cartoonists, like John Sloan, Stuart Davis, and Art Young; one of the best journalists in our history, John Reed (journalist), a writer full of an indignation against American injustice that was itself utterly American; a shrewd and caustic propagandist like Max Eastman; some gifted writers of fiction, like Sherwood Anderson; and one of the few serious theoretical minds American socialism has produced, William English Walling. All joined in a rumpus of revolt, tearing to shreds the genteel tradition that had been dominant in American culture, poking fun at moral prudishness and literary timidity, mocking the deceits of bourgeois individualism, and preaching a peculiarly uncomplicated version of the class struggle. There has never been, and probably never will again be, another radical magazine in the U. S. quite like The Masses, with its slapdash gathering of energy, youth, hope.

History cannot be recalled, but in this instance at least, nostalgia seems a part of realism. For who among us, if enabled by some feat of imagination, would not change places with the men of The Masses in their days of glory?
