Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://www.myfootball.com.au/news/emily-gielnik-redefining-success-and-failure", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik is redefining success and herself\n\nThe highs and lows of football not only define someone as football, but also as person. Westfield Matildas\u2019 forward Emily Gielnik embodies that notion.\n\nWith the world firmly placed on pause during the period of COVID-19, restrictions have shut down the normality of life around the globe.\n\nBeing in lockdown with your thoughts to keep you company can be in equal parts challenging and invigorating. For Emily Gielnik, isolation has been a time for reflection and consideration.\n\n\u201cI saw the light; you communicate more and you get to look at life from a different perspective,\u201d she said from her apartment in Munich, Germany.\n\n\u201cI was actually feeling quite fortunate. Even though football is my job, my career, my life and it\u2019s hard to go from doing what you love to not be doing it at all, but watching the news really put things into perspective for me.\u201d\n\nA TIME OF REFLECTION\n\nAfter returning from the AFC Women\u2019s Olympic Qualifiers, Emily Gielnik and her Bayern Munich teammates soon found themselves returning to their homes as COVID-19 restrictions came into effect in Germany.\n\nFor the 28-year-old, the restrictions occurred at a fortuitous time with both her mum and partner on hand to ride out the opening weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to have her [Mum] here,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201c[We were] just sharing some good quality time. There was definitely a lot of laughs and a lot of cooking happening!\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter years of intermittent separation, the time mother and daughter spent together away from reality was a blessing.\n\n\u201cWhen you go over to their [her parents] house and you see them on the weekend, it\u2019s so rushed and you're not really there. You're replying to people and on social media. I feel like she was here, and I was actually engaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been in quarantine, it would have been a lot different if she was here. I was at full time training and I would have only seen her a little bit in the morning and a little bit in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nFATHER & FRIEND\n\nEmily Gielnik admits that her life story is much like her football story; a tale of a late bloomer.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, with basketball and rugby being her first loves, Gielnik didn\u2019t playing football until the age of twelve. Even then, it was after much encouragement on the part of the teenager to coax her parents to let her take to the pitch.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of persuading in terms of my Mum and her letting me play soccer because she thought it's such high injury sport - although I played rugby against boys so I can't comprehend it,\u201d she laughed.\n\nGielnik made the switch from rugby to football and never looked back (Supplied: Emily Gielnik)\n\nWhile her Mum may have been apprehensive about those first steps, Gielnik\u2019s Dad was right beside her every step of the way.\n\n\u201cI had that Dad that was always taking me to every sporting event possible,\u201d she remembered fondly.\n\n\u201cHe would watch all my basketball games; all my football games and he was without a doubt that man that is running up and down the sidelines of the game and yelling at you to stop watching the play.\u201d\n\nGielnik credits her father\u2019s patience and support for pushing her to the next level. Criticism, no matter how constructive, can be a difficult to take on as a teenager. Looking back with the time and distance, Gielnik has no doubt his influence shaped her into the player she needed to be in order become a professional player.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be pro one day,\u201d she said \u201cI didn't grow up with this those skills or that coaching, I just had my Dad,\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he could sense that I wanted to get there so then he was criticising me, maybe at times he was criticising me too tough.\u201d\n\nHe just wanted to make me better because maybe he could see that I could make it to the top and he knew I could be good.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 15, Gielnik made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour but as her friends and teammates made their way into the Queensland Academy of Sport, Gielnik never received a letter.\n\nOpportunities can pop up in the strangest of places and while on a school trip where she visited the Australian Institute of Sport, Gielnik got her chance to train with the Westfield Matildas. Her letter from QAS came shortly after.\n\nThat finally put Gielnik on the path she had wanted for so long. A season with the QAS resulted in the striker earning a contract the following year with a star studded Brisbane Roar outfit.\n\nGielnik settling into the Matildas (Photo Credit: Rachel Bach / By the White Line)\n\nAfter a successful 2011/12 season with Roar, where she earned the moniker of \u2018super sub\u2019, Gielnik finally earned a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nHer first appearance for the Westfield Matildas came in Japan in 2012. While it might have been an ocean away, her father wasn\u2019t far away from her thoughts. These days he is a fixture Westfield Matildas home matches and proudly boasts the number 15.\n\n\u201cHe wears that jersey with pride\u2026you can\u2019t miss him!\u201d Gielnik laughed.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the starting line-up whomever is next to me is like \u2018oh my god Em, that\u2019s your Dad\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm actually playing for two people. Sometimes he lines up a shot and fully kicks like an air swing on the sideline. He's got like that as if he's kicked it. He's a part of the game, like he's a part of us.\u201d\n\nREDEFINING SUCCESS\n\nIn a scripted Disney production, realising a dream and playing for the Westfield Matildas should have been the beginning of a long and steady stint in the senior national team.\n\nHowever, in real life, Gielnik\u2019s ride was set to be a rollercoaster instead. That first run with the national team was followed by long periods away, and more frustrating periods of being close but not quite close enough.\n\n2015 saw her omission from the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and 2016 resulted in heartbreak after being a part of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification campaign.\n\nEach time, the Queenslander has dusted herself off \u2013 although it has not been without some soul searching and exploring different outlets for self fulfillment.\n\n\n\n\"After I got cut from the Olympics, I started to realise that I\u2019ve got to do something that makes me happy now and I opened the gym [ShredEm Fitness],\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEverything just went so well, and I had never been so happy so of course my football just skyrocketed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like obsessed with helping people. I was obsessed with helping someone from being so miserable and not comfortable at any other gyms and then they came and gave me a shot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wasn't then putting so much pressure about making the Matildas squad or proving myself that stage I was like I got this gym now I'm just going to play W- League enjoy it and love it.\u201d\n\nOf course I was missing and craving the Matildas, but I stopped putting so much heavy pressure on myself thinking that that's all I wanted. I had the gym and so that created some happiness and some drive for me.\u201d\n\nEventually the off the field success began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it. A breakthrough 2017 Algarve Cup, a brilliant Westfield W-League season with Melbourne Victory in 2018/19 culminated in being named to her first major tournament squads for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2019.\n\nFinding her confidence and goal scoring touch for the Westfield Matildas saw big clubs around the world begin to take notice of the powerful forward.\n\nAfter stints in the United States, Japan and Norway, Gielnik joined Frauen Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.\n\n\u201cI heard from KK and Emily (Van Egmond), and people that have played in Germany, that their regiment was just craziness,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor some reason I was longing for that environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoving halfway across the world with a language barrier was a welcome challenge for Gielnik but the move has also tested her in ways that were unforeseen. It has also precipitated further introspection from a larger than life figure.\n\nWhatever the level of football, success is a personal and intimate topic. It is one that, in her quiet times, she has had to grapple with and redefine to her own satisfaction.\n\n\u201cTo put it this way, I don't personally feel like I've accomplished everything I wanted to at this club,\u201d Gielnik said quietly.\n\n\u201cI got to play for this club but in all fairness, I don't feel like I've been successful at this club. I haven't come here and scored a ton of goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to overcome the feeling of failure and that's how I've actually felt here at Bayern and although I had a massive part of the team and I work hard \u2026 I don't feel as part of the success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physical challenges are what I thought I was getting here, but I'm getting the mental challenge here as a footballer.\u201d\n\nOn her own personal football journey, Bayern has proved to be one of the biggest challenges and the most instructive.\n\nGielnik\u2019s time in Germany over the last year has become her greatest learning experience, demonstrating that perseverance and determination aren\u2019t easily earned traits.\n\n\u201cI could have left on several occasions and I had offers in the transfer window to great clubs, but I thought about it and you know that\u2019s just not me.\u201d\n\nLeaving and giving up and quitting it wasn\u2019t me. I still wanted the opportunity to turn it around and see the light and to make the best of it and that's just like a part of my personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success, I will say, is that I came here as a player that the coach wanted. He wanted me because I was that different player but then wanted me to adjust adapt to the German style football and that's not in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to stay true to myself.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik is not sure what her next move will be. What is certain that wherever she goes she will once again be better equipped to face it.\n\nAfter all, they do say good things come to those who are wait \u2013 or a late bloomers."}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-ii-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik\u2019s road to the national team from a 14 year old in the stands to a 20 year old Matildas debutante was the prologue.\n\nThe main feature would begin once she reached her dream. It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/140cee9f/Emily-Gielnik", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

Like Cinderella it was a race against the clock for Australian football player Emily Gielnik, but she has managed to escape the confines of her moonboot, trading Velcro straps for leather lace-ups just in time to make the Matildas squad for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup in Jordan. Moments before boarding her plane to Portugal for the 2018 Algarve Cup in early March, Gielnik received news that the excruciating pain in her ankle was a result of bone stress. She says it was a blessing in disguise as any further strain would have caused a fracture, sidelining the Matildas forward for 3-6 months. With a grueling strength and conditioning program combined with some TLC, Gielnik has beaten the odds and found her happily ever after in the Australian squad.\n\nGielnik says her most recent injury is the result of a prior ankle fracture following one of the biggest performances that sparked her professional career in 2012. Gielnik made her debut for the Young Matildas in the FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Vietnam scoring a hat-trick and changing the game for the green and gold, from three goals down to a 4-3 win. She says however, an evolution in her career has occurred more recently, coincidently in last year\u2019s Algarve Cup, scoring three goals during the tournament against big name teams including China and The Netherlands.\n\n\u201cIt was a turning point for me not just scoring the goals but having a good tournament and the realisation that I wanted to do it (football) full-time and take it more seriously,\u201d Gielnik says.\n\nGielnik, 25, was a late bloomer to the sport at age 12 when she began playing for Redlands United, already setting her sights high towards Brisbane Roar and Young Matildas. She says her pathway into the sport was quite different to others as it happened during a school trip to the Australian Institute of Sport where the Matildas were holding a training session.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my sports teacher who asked the coach at the time, Tom Sermanni, if I could have a session with them,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cHe (Sermanni) asked me to come back the next day and I played a game with them. Straight away he made the call to get me into the QAS (Queensland Academy of Sport) with Jeff Hopkins who was the head coach at the time.\u201d\n\nGielnik\u2019s professional football career began with the Brisbane Roar in 2009 where she later was dubbed the super-sub coming off the bench time and time again to score 12 goals in 2011-12 season.\n\n\u201cI got second highest goal scorer for that year and I only played 5-10 minutes every game,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure to keep going on and scoring but it actually just kept happening.\u201d\n\nHaving recently finished her eighth season loyal to her club, Gielnik is eager to go all the way with Brisbane Roar after they were knocked out in a devastating loss in Westfield W-League semi-final despite finishing minor premiers.\n\n\u201cSo we didn\u2019t win and that\u2019s just football; in the most important games any team can win on any given day and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gielnik\u2019s season never ends with W-League. Throughout her career she has ventured to international clubs including Liverpool, Ottawa Fury in Canada, Urawa Red Diamonds in Japan and Avaldsnes IL in Norway. She says although the style of play differs from place to place, the W-league provides a high standard of football.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are far behind and sometimes I think we are a little bit ahead. Now we are starting to attract international big names as well as those in the American league coming over to play W-League.\u201d\n\nDespite the W-League producing strong competition Gielnik says women\u2019s football has a lot of catching up to do in the male oriented sport but it is growing every year. She says Brisbane Roar is already contributing to that growth by including the young Roar girls under-17s team to compete in the NPL Queensland Women\u2019s competition.\n\n\u201cI think it is a foot in the door for the girls to be exposed.\u201d\n\nShe says the biggest issue is the lack of opportunities for exposure and is why Brisbane Roar are trying to provide a platform for youth girls teams as young as 13-14.\n\n\u201cI think it needs a bit of work (the football pathway) but its heading in the right direction, so it\u2019s a positive.\u201d\n\nShe says her biggest advice to young up and comers is to be doing extra work outside of training.\n\n\u201cThose willing to work a bit hard will be rewarded in the end.\u201d\n\nOn top of her already busy schedule Gielnik also holds private coaching for girls that she believes are quite talented, this is on top of owning her own strength and condition gym ShedEm, teaching 16 classes a week.\n\nBeing selected to play for the green and gold in the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup has crossed one goal off Gielnik\u2019s list and if all goes well she is eager to compete in 2018 Tournament of Nations in the US after Matildas won the major competition last year putting them on the map.\n\nThe Matildas kick-off their Asian Cup campaign in Jordan on Sunday, April 8.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup group stage fixtures\n\nAustralia | v | Korea Republic\n\nApril 8 | King Abdullah Stadium II, Amman, Jordan.\n\nKick-off: 3.00am (EST) Fox Sports\n\nVietnam | v | Australia\n\nApril 11 | Amman International Stadium, Amman, Jordan\n\nKick-off: 3.00am (EST) Fox Sport\n\nJapan | v | Australia\n\nApril 13 | Amman International Stadium, Amman, Jordan.\n\nKick-off: 11:45pm (EST) on Fox Sports\n\n2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup groups\n\nGroup A: Jordan (Current FIFA world ranking: 50), China PR (13), Thailand (29), Philippines (70)\n\nGroup B: Japan (8), Australia (6), Korea Republic (15), Vietnam (31)\n\nMatildas squad:\n\nLydia Williams (GK), Caitlin Cooper, Aivi Luik, Clare Polkinghorne, Laura Alleway, Chloe Logarzo, Steph Catley, Elise Kellond-Knight, Alex Chidiac, Emily van Egmond, Lisa de Vanna, Casey Dumont (GK, Tameka Butt, Alanna Kennedy, Emily Gielnik, Hayley Raso, Kyah Simon, Mackenzie Arnold (GK), Katrina Gorry, Sam Kerr, Ellie Carpenter, Larissa Crummer, Michelle Heyman."}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/w-league/emily-gielniks-move-to-melbourne-victory-is-paying-off-as-the-matilda-looks-to-lock-in-a-world-cup-spot/news-story/4ed1095158941733f24e097ec4ca275b", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik had a decision to make.\n\nLess than a year out from the Women\u2019s World Cup, the dynamic winger had two options: stay at W-League powerhouse Brisbane Roar, the club she\u2019d joined as a teenager \u2014 or take on a new challenge.\n\nThe latter option was joining her former Roar manager Jeff Hopkins at Melbourne Victory \u2014 a club trying to return from three years in the finals wilderness.\n\nWith the pain of missing out on the Matildas\u2019 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics squads still burning fiercely, Gielnik turned her back on the comfort of home and threw herself headlong into a move interstate.\n\n\u201cWell to be honest, Jeff has asked me (to come to Victory) the last couple of years and it wasn\u2019t until this year I made the move,\u201d Gielnik told foxsports.com.au.\n\n\u201cI think I personally needed a bit of a challenge, a change of environment, just being around a different diverse of players and I just really needed to challenge myself in football.\n\n\u201cSo I really feel like I just needed something new to be honest, I just didn\u2019t want to become stagnant and be at the same place for such a long time.\n\n\u201cBut my loyalty was really, really important to me. If I could\u2019ve, I would\u2019ve stayed at Brisbane for the rest of my life, the rest of my football career.\n\n\u201cBut I really think that looking at the bigger picture in terms of the World Cup, this was a really critical move for me and \u2026 when I made the decision, it wasn\u2019t overnight it was weeks and weeks and it was an emotional one.\n\n\u201cSo it was a really calculated decision and I think so far for me, it\u2019s proven to be a good one.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik and Laura Alleway celebrate (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nSix weeks into the W-League season, Gielnik is reaping the rewards of her bold move.\n\nVictory is sitting pretty, undefeated and outright top of the table, with the winger nominated for the PFA\u2019s recent W-League player of the month award.\n\nIn her five appearances for Victory, Gielnik has scored one goal, assisted one, made 10 key passes, created 11 chances and provided 23 crosses.\n\nShe\u2019s also combined beautifully with captain Natasha Dowie and star playmaker Christine Nairn, with the trio comprising one of the W-League\u2019s most intimidating attacks.\n\n\u201cI think if you look at it in the perspective of a couple of weeks, it feels really good, obviously because of where we are as a team and everything,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd me personally, I\u2019ve already felt a lot of improvement. Most importantly, it\u2019s just in my happiness and my mentality more than anything and I\u2019ve got a really good support network in terms of leaving home as well.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously the staff here is great and obviously Jeff has the best intentions for me, so they\u2019re really going above and beyond to try and cater for everything that I need football-wise. So that was really important to me in the lead up to making that decision to play for Victory.\n\n\u201cBut obviously I already feel a really good shift and a good change for me so far but I think there\u2019s still over half a season to go and much more improvement that I\u2019m longing for, definitely, with the World Cup being obviously in my sights but the team being the priority of course at the moment.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik.

So that was a big thing for me.\n\n\u201cPurely because football is not forever and that dream job is something I can always come back to, no matter the age. So I really just want to \u2014 after years and years of sacrifice to football, I thought this was really the ultimate thing to do just to give it everything that I\u2019ve got and enjoy every single challenge and experience because I\u2019m obviously lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a contracted Matilda at the moment.\n\n\u201cSo I weighed up some options and it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t take it (football) seriously before, it\u2019s just more that I\u2019ve really made it a massive part of my life, which it has been for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve been a lot happier and a lot more focused and I\u2019ve really dedicated a lot of my time to it off the field as well now, more from a mental aspect and keeping myself in good condition and in other parts of fitness to make sure that I\u2019m physically good on the park.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik. (AAP Image/David Crosling) Source: AAP\n\nThis week Gielnik is set to face Brisbane for the first time since her move.\n\nWhile the winger admits she\u2019s trying not to think about the experience of facing her old club, in front of her family and friends, there are understandably some nerves.\n\nThat said, she\u2019s had plenty of people to lean on, with fellow ex-Roar players Angie Beard, Laura Alleway and Casey Dumont among the teammates she has at Victory.\n\nGielnik has also thrived under Hopkins, with the Victory manager a tough, but supportive leader, and it\u2019s clear the winger is enjoying her time in Melbourne.\n\nWhile Gielnik came into a team that had struggled in recent years, it was also a club that had locked in a solid base of quality experienced and young players.\n\nThe Victory recruit highlights the culture and attitude of the group, along with the quality of the likes of Nairn and Dowie, as key reasons behind her renewed happiness and love of the game.\n\nEmily Gielnik celebrates with Christine Nairn. (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re strong all over the park and I\u2019m not just talking performance-wise and physically and in terms of football \u2014 I\u2019m talking in terms of team culture and the positivity and we\u2019ve got massive, massive depth within our team,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s been almost the glue and something that\u2019s been really critical this season that was really important to me ... so it\u2019s really enjoyable and to be honest I\u2019m really enjoying football.\n\n\u201cAnd I think players say this a lot of times, like they say they enjoy football and sometimes you can have ups and downs and football\u2019s not (fun) all the time but I think I\u2019ve actually started to \u2014 apart from when I was a kid \u2014 have fun with it again.\u201d\n\nGielnik is certainly playing like someone enjoying her football.\n\nThe Matilda has been in fine form for both club and country, recently showcasing her ability to have an impact off the bench with a tremendous goal against Chile in Newcastle.\n\nAustralia celebrate a goal from Emily Gielnik. (Photo by Ashley Feder/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nGielnik\u2019s steely resolve before and during games is hard to miss, and while she\u2019s enjoying her football, there is a clear drive behind her relentless approach.\n\nAs a 23-year-old, Gielnik missed out on the 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup squad \u2014 having been cut by former coach Hesterine de Reus, before Alen Stajcic took over.\n\nThen, a year later, she missed out on the Olympics by one spot.\n\nNow 26, and a bona fide star of the W-League, Gielnik is clearly determined not to experience that disappointment again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one because now things have been going well for the Matildas and stuff but at the end of the day I\u2019ve never been to a World Cup or an Olympics,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed out shyly of the Olympics by one spot and I was training with that team during the Olympic qualifiers and everything and to pull up short and to be cut from the World Cup (hurt) and this is the opportunity of a lifetime now and I most definitely don\u2019t want anything distracting me (and) I don\u2019t want to waste it.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m really making sure I don\u2019t lose focus on it and I give myself the best opportunity but I don\u2019t lose myself as well while I\u2019m doing that.\n\n\u201cSo yeah, it\u2019s a big dream of mine and it would be a goal \u2014 a life goal to be achieved to be honest \u2014 and I think W-League\u2019s the platform for that, without putting too much pressure on myself.\n\n\u201cBut it really is a platform for it and obviously a good opportunity for other players on a larger scale as well.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://uk.soccerway.com/players/emily-gielnik/164110/", "page_content": "Matches of E.

After stopping basketball due to injuries she took up soccer and was eventually signed by Brisbane Roar for the second season of the W\u2013League.[1] At Brisbane she became recognised as a \"super sub\" for her knack of coming off the substitutes' bench to score late goals.[2] Gielnik played eight seasons at Brisbane, appearing in 83 games and scoring 30 goals. She won the W-League Championship in 2010\u201311 and the Premiership in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318.[3]\n\nLiverpool LFC and Ottawa Fury, 2012\u20132013\n\nIn May 2012, Gielnik signed for English club Liverpool L.F.C., during the 2012 FA WSL season.[4] In October 2012, she was one of ten players to be released by Liverpool's new manager Mark Beard.[5] In 2013, Gielnik joined Ottawa Fury for their W-League season.[6]\n\nUrawa Red Diamonds, 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 Olympics, Gielnik joined Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds.[7]\n\nAvaldsnes IL, 2017\n\nGielnik joined Norwegen team Avaldsnes IL for the 2017 season. She had a breakout season with the team, scoring eight goals in league play. Avaldsnes finished second in the Toppserien and won the Norwegian Cup.[8]\n\nMelbourne Victory, 2018\u20132019\n\nGielnik signed with Melbourne Victory for the 2018\u201319 W-League season.\n\nBayern Munich, 2019\u20132020\n\nOn 23 August 2019, Gielnik joined German Frauen-Bundesliga club Bayern Munich.[9] In July 2020, she left the club after making only 6 appearances, partially due to injury.[10]\n\nVittsj\u00f6, 2020\n\nA week after leaving Bayern Munich, Gielnik signed with another European club, joining Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6.[11]\n\nBrisbane Roar, 2020\u2013\n\nIn November 2020, Gielnik returned Australia, signing with her hometown club, Brisbane Roar.[12]\n\nInternational career\n\nGielnik scored a hat-trick on her international debut for Australia U-19s in October 2011.[1] She made her first appearance for the senior Matildas team in a 3\u20130 friendly defeat to World champions Japan in Tokyo on 11 July 2012.[13]\n\nGielnik was named to the Australian squad for 2016 Olympic Qualifying, she scored a goal against Vietnam.[14] Australia won the tournament and qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nGielnik was part of the Matildas squad that won the 2017 Tournament of Nations and defeated the United States for the first time ever.[15]\n\nAt the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup Gielnik appeared in three matches for Australia.

However, they lost 1\u20130 to Sweden in the semi-final and were then beaten 4\u20133 in the bronze medal playoff by USA.[19] Full details.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nInternational goals\n\nHonors\n\nClub\n\nBrisbane Roar\n\nAvaldsnes IL\n\nNorwegian Cup: 2017\n\nMelbourne Victory\n\nInternational\n\nAustralia\n\nIndividual\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-i-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "If there was ever a moment that encapsulates the evolution of Emily Gielnik, it was a superb strike against Korea Republic in the 2019 Cup of Nations.\n\nDeep in the match, the 26 year old drifted in from the left wing, sized up the full back, cut inside and rifled a strike at the near post.\n\nIt was a strike of a player full of confidence and at the height of her powers.\n\nGielnik has become a hot topic of conversation for women\u2019s football fans of late, with her newly-commanding presence on the pitch leaving those new to the game wondering where this prolific forward came from.\n\nHer story is one of resilience, grit and determination. One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://www.myfootball.com.au/news/watch-gielniks-stunning-goal-bayerns-huge-champions-league-win", "page_content": "Westfield Matildas attacker Emily Gielnik has scored her first goal for Bayern Munich as the German club put one foot in the Semi Finals of the UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\nGielnik scored Bayern\u2019s fourth goal in an emphatic 5-0 win away at Kazakhstan side BIIK Kazygurt in the first leg of their Quarter Final tie.\n\nAnd it was an impressive strike from the 27-year-old forward.\n\nRacing on to an impressive through ball, Gielnik hit her shot first time from just outside the box, curling the ball past the keeper into the far corner of the net.\n\nSEE GIELNIK'S GOAL IN THE TWEET BELOW\n\n\n\nIt was her first full 90 minutes since joining the German giants in August.\n\nGielnik, who has played 31 times for the Westfield Matildas, will hope she can carry her goalscoring form into the weekend\u2019s Frauen Bundesliga match against Potsdam.\n\nThe Quarter Final second leg tie will be played in Munich on Thursday, August 31.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Alex Chidiac\u2019s Atletico Madrid picked up a solid result in their first leg away from home against English heavyweights Manchester City.\n\nAn 81st-minute goal from Veronica Charlyn Corra allowed Atletico to snatch a 1-1 draw to take back to Madrid for the second leg in a fortnight.\n\nJoe Montemurro\u2019s Arsenal are also in the box seat for a spot in the Women\u2019s UCL Semi Finals after crushing Czech side Slavia Prague 5-2 away from home.\n\nGALLERY: Westfield Matildas' 40th anniversary celebrations\n\nNEWS: Ex-Westfield Matildas star Munoz calls time on playing career\n\n'IT MEANT SO MUCH TO US': Dolan remembers history-making international"}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/watch-gielniks-stunning-goal-bayerns-huge-champions-league-win", "page_content": "Westfield Matildas attacker Emily Gielnik has scored her first goal for Bayern Munich as the German club put one foot in the Semi Finals of the UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\nGielnik scored Bayern\u2019s fourth goal in an emphatic 5-0 win away at Kazakhstan side BIIK Kazygurt in the first leg of their Quarter Final tie.\n\nAnd it was an impressive strike from the 27-year-old forward.\n\nRacing on to an impressive through ball, Gielnik hit her shot first time from just outside the box, curling the ball past the keeper into the far corner of the net.\n\nSEE GIELNIK'S GOAL IN THE TWEET BELOW\n\n\n\nIt was her first full 90 minutes since joining the German giants in August.\n\nGielnik, who has played 31 times for the Westfield Matildas, will hope she can carry her goalscoring form into the weekend\u2019s Frauen Bundesliga match against Potsdam.\n\nThe Quarter Final second leg tie will be played in Munich on Thursday, August 31.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Alex Chidiac\u2019s Atletico Madrid picked up a solid result in their first leg away from home against English heavyweights Manchester City.\n\nAn 81st-minute goal from Veronica Charlyn Corra allowed Atletico to snatch a 1-1 draw to take back to Madrid for the second leg in a fortnight.\n\nJoe Montemurro\u2019s Arsenal are also in the box seat for a spot in the Women\u2019s UCL Semi Finals after crushing Czech side Slavia Prague 5-2 away from home.\n\nGALLERY: Westfield Matildas' 40th anniversary celebrations\n\nNEWS: Ex-Westfield Matildas star Munoz calls time on playing career\n\n'IT MEANT SO MUCH TO US': Dolan remembers history-making international"}, {"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/140cee9f/Emily-Gielnik", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

But football was definitely the right choice.\n\n\u201cMy Mum didn\u2019t want me playing football initially, she thought basketball was a safer option, I loved it, but then it became too much once I played football as well at the age of 12, I had to decide, and football took over.\u201d\n\nA good choice. Gielnik's gilded, and nomadic, career has taken her to the top flights in Canada, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Germany - where she played for Bayern Munich - as well as Australia. Now she intends to make Villa a more permanent home.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a personal preference of mine, I\u2019ve always only signed a one-year contract,\u201d Gielnik added. \u201cThis is the first year where I\u2019ve signed a 1+1. That\u2019s a big shift for me, which means I\u2019ve had a good feeling about this club.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to really experience all the different styles of football and the different cultures, and where I can develop in different countries, so I\u2019m pretty fortunate that I\u2019ve been around the world. That was my decision, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done it that way, I\u2019ve definitely grown from having been in all those situations, and now I\u2019ve landed here.\u201d\n\nYet, Gielnik is not a Women\u2019s Super League debutant. Her goal for Villa at Brighton was her first in the WSL for more than nine years, since she netted for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw away at Notts County in 2012. She spent one season on Merseyside, but knows she returns now transformed as a player, and to a completely changed league.\n\n\u201cIt was always on my radar, to end up back in the WSL, but I don\u2019t really want to count it as being in the WSL 10 years ago, because that was not the league it is now. The WSL has come on leaps and bounds. Back then with Liverpool, I was only training twice a week, so I\u2019m kind of treating this as my first time here.\"\n\nLife at Villa - who host league leaders Arsenal on Saturday - is going well so far, as they have seven points from their opening three goals, boosted by her strike at Brighton, a calm finish into the corner after being played through one-on-one.\n\n\u201cGetting the winner and getting my first goal, I felt I kind of needed to get that one out of the way,\" she said. \"Those first few games, you want to start strong and get some points on the board early.\u201d\n\nThe English league looks set to suit Gielnik's strong, quick and clinical style. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the most technical striker but I\u2019m a very counter-attacking, ball-in-behind, fast-paced, off-the-shoulder kind of player,\" she added. \"I\u2019m not much of a dribbler, but I love on the end of crosses and I also love delivering crosses, breaking the lines and getting in behind.\u201d\n\nHer move to Villa was one that almost didn\u2019t happen, after multiple approaches from the West Midlands club, before she was ultimately persuaded to move on September\u2019s deadline day after a short spell with Swedish top-tier side Vittsjo GIK.\n\nGielnik explained: \u201cI\u2019d had several conversations with my agent, just telling him to politely decline any others that had come through during the Olympics, so there were a few knock-backs already to Carla [Ward], but she was pretty persistent and that actually worked on me in the end because I actually needed a change. Carla had belief in me and wants me to progress. I told her how adamant I am to improve and get better and she is willing to provide that.\n\n\u201cThe question I asked Carla was just about the team: Is it good people and is it a good environment? Those were the two big things for me. After a few phone calls, it turned out to be the right thing for me to do. Now I\u2019ve landed here so hopefully I can gain some consistency here at this club and lead myself into the 2023 World Cup.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58421345", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nEmily Gielnik has scored 10 times in 43 international appearances for Australia\n\nAston Villa have signed Australia international striker Emily Gielnik for the 2021-22 Women's Super League season from Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6 GIK.\n\nGielnik, 29, will be making her second appearance in English club football after spending a season with Liverpool in 2012-13.\n\nThe move, subject to international travel clearance, is Villa boss Carla Ward's ninth summer signing.\n\n\"Emily is someone we've monitored for a few months,\" said Ward.\n\n\"She's a player with a wealth of domestic and international experience.
