Epstein\u201d and \u201cprolific\u201d and you\u2019ll get plenty of hits. Other searches will produce multiple items documenting that Epstein, who is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law, has long been one of the country\u2019s most productive and influential legal scholars. On April 20, NYU Law and the University of Chicago Law School (Epstein\u2019s former academic home, where he is now a senior lecturer) will jointly sponsor an event in Chicago to honor Epstein\u2019s 50-year career. Even focusing just on the most recent quintile of his career\u2014since the fall of 2007, when he began teaching regularly at NYU\u2014there is plenty to celebrate, as his output and activity have continued at a brisk pace.\n\nScholarly productivity has long been assessed by quantifying traditional publications, and Epstein has no shortage of those. Between September 1, 2007, and March 1, 2018, he authored 123 academic journal articles and 30 book chapters; he also wrote or edited 10 books.\n\nTo focus only on Epstein\u2019s academic writing, though, is to miss a substantial portion of his oeuvre. A leading exponent of libertarian (or, in his preferred formulation, \u201cclassical liberal\u201d) thought, Epstein is a multiplatform threat, disseminating his ideas on myriad topics through online columns, podcasts, radio broadcasts, Twitter, and other outlets.\n\nThe conservative website Ricochet, which features Epstein on podcasts, referred to him in a tweet as \u201cThe Human Paragraph.\u201d Words, Epstein acknowledges, flow easily for him. \u201cIf you can get yourself to a topic sentence,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can usually see a problem through to the end.\u201d Credit Epstein with more than 450 topic sentences for the opinion pieces he has written since August 2008, primarily for Defining Ideas, an online journal of Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, where Epstein is a senior fellow. Based on their average length, these pieces total about 750,000 words. Under \"The Libertarian\" moniker, he's done hundreds of podcasts for Hoover, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy his own estimate, Epstein delivers between 75 and 100 lectures and talks a year. During a two-day visit to Philadelphia this February, he delivered four, all without notes, as is typical for his appearances. \u201cIf you like to talk, it\u2019s not a great burden,\u201d he explains. With material from a single five-hour recording session, the Federalist Society has produced a YouTube playlist featuring 14 brief videos of Epstein explaining the common law and plans to post nine more this summer on contracts as well as additional segments next year on torts.\n\n\u201cThey put me on a stool and said, \u2018Start talking,\u2019\u201d Epstein recalls. \u201cPretty soon it was like a rock rolling downhill.\u201d\n\nEmploying yet another medium, Epstein has done two \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d interviews on Reddit, the social news and media site.\n\nBeyond how much he produces, Epstein scores high on another metric for law professors: influence. The yardstick for this is law journal citations, and Epstein ranks in the upper echelons in a tally published in 2014 as well as in a current count in the HeinOnline database that includes citations over the past decade. Courts also cite his scholarship frequently.\n\nLess amenable to measurement, but still emblematic of Epstein\u2019s influence is the Classical Liberal Institute (CLI), which he co-founded at NYU Law in 2013 with Mario Rizzo, an economics professor at NYU. CLI shapes law, policy, and scholarship through its conferences, publications, and fellows program and works closely with its affiliate scholars even after they leave NYU.\n\nOf final note is the breadth of Epstein\u2019s scholarship and teaching. Among the topics he wrote about just in 2017, for example, are patents, right-to-work laws, takings law, Brexit, and Kantian moral theory. Over the course of his career, he has taught courses on 30 different subjects (16 since arriving at NYU Law), including Roman law, military law, and water law. \u201cI will write or teach about anything, and happily learn as I teach,\u201d he says.\n\nPosted April 17, 2018\n\nIllustration: Robert Neubecker"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/132710.Richard_A_Epstein", "page_content": "Richard A.

land. That is a big risk, but it is also a potential advantage, because it allows a kind of independence and outsider\u2019s perspective\u2014in his case, the perspective of an outsider who has a particular view of the foundations of private law. When he contends that he aims to defend \u201cwith a passionate intensity the classical liberal vision of the Constitution,\u201d he should be understood to be proceeding not as a scholar of eighteenth-century constitutional debates but as an enthusiast for a certain understanding of Anglo-American common law, one that can be connected with important strands in eighteenth-century political thought.\n\nTo give content to what he calls (controversially) \u201cthe classical liberal vision,\u201d Epstein offers a foil, the villain of the piece, which he calls the \u201cmodern progressive\u201d or \u201csocial democratic\u201d approach. He identifies that approach with the 1930s, when, he urges, policymakers jettisoned \u201cthe traditional safeguards against excessive state power.\u201d As a matter of law, their ill-advised, and constitutionally illegitimate, reforms became possible for two reasons. First, the progressives saw ambiguity in the constitutional text, thus licensing those reforms. Second, the progressives insisted that unelected judges should recede in favor of We the People, acting through elected representatives. Epstein does not deny that the Constitution is sometimes ambiguous. Importantly, he acknowledges that \u201cour basic conception of the proper scope of government action will, and should, influence the resolution of key interpretive disputes.\u201d But he emphasizes that a \u201cdetailed textual analysis\u201d has priority over our preferred views about political theory.\n\nMuch of his book consists of comprehensive and exceptionally detailed accounts of how constitutional provisions ought to be understood. In many places his discussion is highly technical, but in some important respects\u2014of course not in all\u2014you can take it as a careful and sophisticated guide to Tea Party constitutionalism. He believes, for example, that in interpreting the Commerce Clause, courts should not allow Congress to exercise the broad authority that it now has to regulate private activity on the ground that interstate commerce might be involved. He believes that the Affordable Care Act does not fit with the original constitutional plan, and he has written that \u201cknocking out the individual mandate should be a piece of cake,\u201d but he would go much further. In his opinion, the National Labor Relations Act is unconstitutional insofar as it \u201cdid not solve any national problem.\u201d He contends that \u201cone should do everything possible to curtail or at least cut back the affirmative scope of the federal government under the Commerce Clause on the ground that the new powers are chiefly used to create national cartels that are antithetical to the basic provisions of classical liberal theory.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/more-than-vs-over-why-the-associated-press-changed-its-stance/", "page_content": "Associated Press style used to discourage writers from using \"over\" to mean \"more than,\" but that changed in 2014 because there was never a grammatical reason for the rule. It was simply the preference of some influential editors. Current AP editors decided to bring the organization in line with all the other major style guides, and now it's fine for AP writers to use \"over\" if they think it sounds better.\n\nI recently got a listener question about \u201cmore than\u201d and \u201cover\u201d:\n\n\u201dHi, Mignon. My name is Andrea. About 20 years ago, my husband Brian and I were working as reporters at a local newspaper. For the style guide they were very specific when talking about an amount of money such as more than or less than $1 million. We were not allowed to use the words \u201cover\u201d or \u201cunder\u201d because they signified a position, a physical position in space like over or under a bridge. Recently, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of news outlets and television shows are using the \u201cover a million\u201d and \u201cunder a million,\u201d and I was just wondering if this was something specific to the newspaper we were working at or if it\u2019s a change in style overall. Thanks, Mignon. Love the Podcast. Bye.\u201d\n\nThanks, Andrea.\n\nYou\u2019re not imagining it, and news outlets haven\u2019t gotten more sloppy. There was a change in Associated Press style.\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of person who pays super close attention to the AP Stylebook updates every year, one of the most attention grabbing changes in 2014 was to the entry on \u201cmore than\u201d and \u201cover.\u201d Before 2014, AP writers followed the style you learned at your local paper: never use \u201cover\u201d or \u201cunder\u201d to talk about numbers. You were supposed to use \u201cmore than\u201d or \u201cless than.\u201d But in 2014, the AP Stylebook changed to say you can write it either way\u2014that both are acceptable in all uses to indicate a greater or lesser numerical value. Examples:\n\nSalaries went up more than $20 a week.\n\n$20 a week. Salaries went up over $20 a week.\n\nAnd\n\nThe stock fell to less than $40 per share.\n\n$40 per share. The stock fell to under $40 per share.\n\nBoth are fine now.\n\nI was lucky enough to be in the room when two of the editors of the AP Stylebook, David Minthorn and Darrell Christian, announced the changes at ACES: The Society for Copy Editing annual meeting.\n\nThere was some mild rumbling, but the real ruckus happened on Twitter. Before the talk was even over, Matthew Crowley from the Las Vegas Review-Journal announced to the room that somebody had already tweeted \u201cmore than my dead body.\u201d [Get it? That\u2019s a joke because \u201cmore than\u201d can\u2019t be substituted for \u201cover\u201d in \u201cover my dead body.\u201d]\n\nMore than my dead body! RT @TheSlot Some @APStylebook changes at #ACES2014 \u2026 \u201cover\u201d is fine for \u201cmore than,\u201d \u2026 \u2014 Mike Shor (@MikeShor) March 20, 2014\n\nReading comments online, a widely expressed sentiment was that the AP was getting soft, giving up, and caving to the lowest common denominator, but it is not that simple.\n\nA day or two after that session, I talked to people at the meeting who didn\u2019t think the change was a big deal and who thought the stories that had come out about copy editors freaking out were overdone. People did seem to be freaking out online, but I didn\u2019t witness a lot of freak-outs among the professional copy editors at the annual meeting.\n\nSimilarly, after the meeting, copyediting.com had an article calling the change a \u201cnod to reality,\u201d and pointing out that \u201cIn a handout for a recent ACES one-day editorial bootcamp, \u201cmore than\u201d versus \u201cover\u201d appeared under the heading \u201cNot Rules at All,\u201d and the advice was to worry about it only if you\u2019ve got nothing more pressing to worry about.\u201d Mark Allen, who wrote the article and goes by @EditorMark on Twitter, tweeted \u201cAP\u2019s \u2018over\u2019 vs. \u2018more than\u2019 decision acknowledges what most of us were doing anyway.\u201d\n\nThe history of the more-than-is-better-than-over rule is instructive.\n\nNo rationale exists for the \u2018over can\u2019t mean more than\u2019 rule\n\nThe \u201crule\u201d against using \u201cover\u201d in a sense such as \u201cover 20 camels marched down the street\u201d was popularized in the late 1800s by William Cullen Bryant, an influential New York Evening Post editor. He wrote a list of words to be avoided that he called the \u201cIndex Expurgatorius.\u201d The first entry on the list reads simply:\n\nAbove and over, for \u201cmore than.\u201d\n\nOther words on the list that he didn\u2019t like included \u201cjeopardize,\u201d \u201clocated,\u201d \u201ctalented,\u201d \u201cpants\u201d for \u201cpantaloons,\u201d and \u201cretire\u201d as an active verb. (I adore these kinds of lists from old style guides. They\u2019re always fascinating. For example, I was surprised to see that Bryant also objected to the phrase \u201con yesterday.\u201d I hear complaints about that today, and I had thought it was a relatively new regionalism\u2014but nope, apparently it was annoying people all the way back in the 1800s.)\n\nBryant gave no rationale for his dictum. Apparently, he just didn\u2019t like \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cover\u201d for \u201cmore than,\u201d but his preference propagated throughout newspaper style guides and became what the Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage calls \u201ca hoary American newspaper tradition.\u201d (\u201cHoary\u201d originally meant \u201cgray or white with age,\u201d and can also now mean \u201ctiresome or stale.\u201d)\n\nBryant is often cited as the originator of the rule, but Jan Freeman pointed out on Twitter that there is an earlier source. Walton Burgess wrote a book in 1856 called Five Hundred Mistakes of Daily Occurrence in Speaking, Pronouncing, and Writing the English Language. Mistake #130 in his book reads, \u201cThere were not over twenty persons present :\u201d say, \u2018more than.\u2019 Such a use of this word is not frequent among writers of reputation. It may, however, be less improperly employed, where the sense invests it with more of a semblance to its literal signification: as, \u2018This pair of chickens will weigh over seven pounds.\u2019 Even in this case, it is better to say \u2018more than.\u2019\u201d It seems he needs to make up his mind. It\u2019s OK, but then it\u2019s not OK. I don\u2019t know whether Bryant got the rule from Burgess, but either way, there\u2019s still no rationale. It\u2019s a rule one or two guys made up.\n\n@EditorMark @meperl On over/more than, MWDEU & AHD miss 1856 source: Burgess, \u201c500 Mistakes in \u2026 English Language. (Bryant rule is c. 1870.) \u2014 Jan Freeman (@Jan__Freeman) March 25, 2014\n\n\u2018Over\u2019 to mean \u2018more than\u2019 is already widely accepted\n\nEven before the AP Stylebook change, nearly all modern style guides had come out strongly against the \u201crule.\u201d Bryan Garner called it a \u201cbaseless crotchet\u201d and the American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style said it may be \u201csafely ignored.\u201d After the announcement, Carol Fisher Saller, editor of the Chicago Manual of Style Q&A section, reminded people that this has been Chicago\u2019s style for years. Even the previous editions of the AP Stylebook had taken a softened stance on \u201cover,\u201d saying that \u201cmore than\u201d is \u201cpreferred with numerals,\u201d but not going so far as to say that \u201cover\u201d is wrong. The oldest edition I have is from 1998, and even going back that far, it says \u201cmore than\u201d is preferred, not that it\u2019s required, which surprised me. Like Andrea who asked the question today, when I worked at college newspapers years ago, I had absorbed the idea that it was a hard-and-fast rule that you shouldn\u2019t use \u201cover\u201d and \u201cunder\u201d with numbers, not that it was just less preferable.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s always a good idea to look things up. Your memories can be wrong.\n\nAP accepts \u201cover\u201d for \u201cmore than\u201d? About time (CMOS 5.220)! #ACES2014 \u2014 SubversiveCopyEditor (@SubvCopyEd) March 20, 2014\n\nI asked Minthorn and Christian why they made the change, and they said, \u201cBecause it makes sense.\u201d They noted the overwhelming common usage and said, \u201cWe were swimming against the tide to go the other way. There\u2019s no logical, grammatical reason for not using \u2018over\u2019 with numbers. There are contexts where \u2018more than\u2019 might work better, but \u2018over\u2019 is appropriate in the overwhelming majority of cases.\u201d\n\n\u2018Under\u2019 can also mean \u2018less than\u2019\n\nAs a side note, Bill Walsh, author of Yes, I Could Care Less and a long-time copy editor at the Washington Post, asked at the ACES conference if the change meant the AP would also accept \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cless than,\u201d and the editors said they would.\n\nTo sum up, Andrea and her husband are noticing a real change. It wasn\u2019t just the newspaper they worked for that followed the old recommendations, it was all journalists who followed AP style. But now the AP Stylebook is the same as most of the other major style books. It\u2019s now fine for AP writers to write the either \u201cmore than 50 people attended the rally\u201d or \u201cover 50 people attended the rally,\u201d just as it\u2019s been fine for other writers to do all along. You don\u2019t have to use \u201cover\u201d if you don\u2019t like how it sounds, but it\u2019s no longer considered less acceptable than \u201cmore than\u201d by the Associated Press. And the same goes for \u201cunder\u201d and \u201cless than.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-high-society-contacts.html", "page_content": "Epstein in his townhouse in 2015. Photo: Christopher Anderson for New York Magazine\n\nPerhaps, at long last, a serial rapist and pedophile may be brought to justice, more than a dozen years after he was first charged with crimes that have brutalized countless girls and women. But what won\u2019t change is this: the cesspool of elites, many of them in New York, who allowed Jeffrey Epstein to flourish with impunity. For decades, important, influential, \u201cserious\u201d people attended Epstein\u2019s dinner parties, rode his private jet, and furthered the fiction that he was some kind of genius hedge-fund billionaire. How do we explain why they looked the other way, or flattered Epstein, even as they must have noticed he was often in the company of a young harem? Easy: They got something in exchange from him, whether it was a free ride on that airborne \u201cLolita Express,\u201d some other form of monetary largesse, entr\u00e9e into the extravagant celebrity soir\u00e9es he hosted at his townhouse, or, possibly and harrowingly, a pound or two of female flesh.\n\nIf you watch Fox News, you will believe Bill Clinton was Epstein\u2019s No. 1 pal and enabler. If you watch MSNBC, this scandal is usually all about Donald Trump. In fact, both presidents are guilty (at the very least) of giving Epstein cover and credibility. There are so many unanswered questions about Epstein, but one that looms over all of them is whether the bipartisan crowd who cleared a path for him will cover its tracks before we can get answers \u2014 not just Clinton and Trump and all those who drank at Epstein\u2019s trough but also (among others) institutions like Harvard, Dalton, and the Council on Foreign Relations, or lawyers like the New York prosecutor Cy Vance Jr., whose office tried to downgrade Epstein\u2019s sex-offender status; Kenneth Starr, who tried to pressure Republican Justice Department officials to keep the Epstein case from ever being prosecuted; and Alan Dershowitz, who tried to pressure the Pulitzer Prizes to shut out the Miami Herald for its epic investigative reporting that cracked open the case anew.\n\nIn 2015, Gawker published Epstein\u2019s \u201clittle black book,\u201d which had surfaced in court proceedings after a former employee took it from Epstein\u2019s home around 2005 and later tried to sell it. He said that the book had been created by people who worked for Epstein and that it contained the names and phone numbers of more than 100 victims, plus hundreds of social contacts. Along with the logs of Epstein\u2019s private plane, released in 2015, the book paints a picture of a man deeply enmeshed in the highest social circles.\n\nCollectively, these documents constitute just a glance at the way society opened itself to Epstein in New York, Hollywood, and Palm Beach. In the weeks since his arrest, we have learned even more about the cliques he traveled in and the way they protected him. Though some observers have likened Epstein\u2019s enigmatic rise as a glamorous social magnet to that of Jay Gatsby, a more appropriate archetype may be the fixer, sexual hedonist, and (ultimately disbarred) lawyer Roy Cohn. In the 1970s and early \u201980s, Cohn was a favor broker for boldface chums as various as the top Democratic-machine politicians, the mobster Carmine \u201cLilo\u201d Galante, Nancy Reagan, the proprietors of Studio 54, the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, Andy Warhol, the publishers Rupert Murdoch and Si Newhouse, Dershowitz, and the ambitious young real-estate developer Donald Trump.\n\nThis project is meant to catalogue how Epstein\u2019s secure footing in elite spheres helped hide his crimes. It includes influential names listed in his black book, people he flew, funded, and schmoozed, along with others whose connections to him have drawn renewed attention. Certainly, not everyone cited here knew of everything he was up to; Malcolm Gladwell told New York, \u201cI don\u2019t remember much except being baffled as to who this Epstein guy was and why we were all on his plane.\u201d Some said they never met Epstein at all, or knew of him only through his ex-girlfriend and alleged accomplice, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Others backed away from him after the scandal. But all of the influential people listed here were attached in some way to Epstein\u2019s world. The sum of their names constitutes a more concrete accounting of Epstein\u2019s power than could any accounting of his disputed wealth. Consider this a pointillist portrait of enablement that all too chillingly overlaps with a significant slice of the Establishment.\n\n\u2014Frank Rich\n\nHis Contacts, A to Z\n\nA guided tour of a perverse power list.\n\nAllen, Woody: Director.\n\nWith Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in 2013. Photo: Elder Ordonez/Elder Ordonez/Splash News\n\nEpstein kept a photo of his friend Allen, the sexual pariah, on his wall and was photographed walking with him on the Upper East Side. They had more than a neighborhood in common. For years before his relationship with Mia Farrow, Allen had carried on with a 16-year-old girl he\u2019d met at Elaine\u2019s named Babi Christina Engelhardt. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she wondered if she was the inspiration for Manhattan, Allen\u2019s 1979 movie about a man in his 40s who dates a high-school student, which was nominated for two Academy Awards. Engelhardt had sex with Allen more than 100 times, she says, sometimes with Farrow. \u201cThe whole thing was a game that was being operated solely by Woody so we never quite knew where we stood,\u201d she said.

She also created a foundation so Epstein could donate to her breast-cancer charity without attaching his name. \u201cThe Dubins are horrified by the new allegations against Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cHad they been aware of the vile and unspeakable conduct described in these new allegations, they would have cut off all ties and certainly never have allowed their children to be in his presence.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, The Duke of York: Looking for a friend.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nWith Prince Andrew in Central Park in 2010. Photo: Jae Donnelly/News Licensing\n\nEpstein and the second son of Queen Elizabeth II have been friends for years and were introduced, it is generally thought, by Brit Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend and longtime aide-de-camp. Epstein has entertained the prince at his townhouse, where he would toss aside regal formalities and refer to him simply, and to English ears heretically, as \u201cAndy.\u201d Prince Andrew has had Epstein and Maxwell to shooting parties at Sandringham House, the queen\u2019s country retreat in Norfolk. Theirs is an unusual alliance, given their stations \u2014 the born royal and the Brooklyn boy who made it big \u2014 but its disparities may be part of the point. \u201cJeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time in his life,\u201d a source told Vanity Fair about the two. \u201cIt was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax.\u201d\n\nBut their relationship, and their relaxing, took on darker shades as time went on. Andrew stood by Epstein after his release from a 13-month prison sentence and was the star attraction at the party he threw to reenter society. (Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos also came.) The British press wrung its hands with equal parts pain and glee when it was discovered that Sarah, the perennially indebted Duchess of York \u2014 Fergie to her Weight Watchers fans \u2014 had accepted \u00a315,000 from Epstein to pay off one of her creditors, a deal brokered by her ex-husband, and that a former employee at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach manse had alleged in a sworn deposition that the duke was a longtime guest, enjoying massages and naked pool parties. (Prince Andrew denied ever attending, or any awareness of, naked pool parties.) The ongoing affiliation with Epstein likely contributed to the end of Andrew\u2019s duties as a U.K. trade envoy. In 2015, Virginia Roberts Giuffre alleged in a court filing that Andrew was one of the powerful friends to whom Epstein lent her out for sex. Buckingham Palace issued a statement emphatically denying the allegation. She hasn\u2019t pressed her case further in court. But a photograph of the duke with his arm around a 17-year-old Roberts Giuffre, with Maxwell grinning beside them, didn\u2019t help. \u2014Matthew Schneier\n\nAssaf, Vittorio: Restaurateur.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nStarted the Upper East Side institution Serafina.\n\nBand, Doug: Influence peddler.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nA onetime White House intern who climbed his way to being Bill Clinton\u2019s bag carrier, body man, fixer, and all-purpose gatekeeper, Band arranged for the former president to travel to Africa on Epstein\u2019s 727 in 2002.

Neither Bannon nor Epstein has commented on the substance of their meeting, but when Ivanka Trump condemned Roy Moore\u2019s campaign in Alabama, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children,\u201d Bannon, who backed Moore, responded, \u201cWhat about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\u201d It was a clear reference to the woman who had accused Donald Trump and Epstein of raping her when she was 13.\n\nBarr, Donald: The headmaster who offered entr\u00e9e.\n\nIn the 1975 Dalton School yearbook. Photo: The Dalton School\n\nBarr was ousted shortly before Epstein, 21 and without a college degree, showed up for his first day of work teaching math and physics at the Manhattan\u2019s elite Dalton School in the early 1970s. Barr announced his resignation soon after, in February 1974: \u201cHe was disliked by the faculty, he was highly controversial, he hadn\u2019t raised much money, he was very conservative,\u201d said the board\u2019s chairman. Barr\u2019s leadership style was described as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d at the time. Memorably, several former students told the New York Times that Epstein was overly familiar with teenage girls at the school. Donald\u2019s son William would intersect with Epstein\u2019s orbit while serving as a counsel at Kirkland and Ellis in 2009. The law firm secured Epstein his obscenely lenient 2007 non-prosecution deal, which the Justice Department is now reviewing. In July, Barr the son refused to recuse himself from the ongoing Epstein investigation.\n\nBarrack, Tom: Trump adviser and private-equity manager.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nIn Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff wrote that Trump, Epstein, and Barrack were a \u201cset of nightlife musketeers\u201d in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\n\nBerger, Sandy: National-security adviser for Bill Clinton.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nBerggruen, Nicolas: Billionaire investor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBerkman, Bill: New York businessman.\n\nNames found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nA wealthy executive whose family established the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard, Berkman was sued in 2014 by his administrative assistant, who said she was forced to read emails Berkman had sent to a colleague containing \u201cpictures of random and unsuspecting women on the street\u201d \u2014 that is, creepshots.

Vicky Ward, who profiled Epstein for Vanity Fair in 2003, said Epstein heavily leaned on Black, who is her ex-husband\u2019s uncle (and was her ex-husband\u2019s then-boss), to try to exert his influence on Ward.\n\nBlack, Leon: Private-equity tycoon.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management and chairman of MoMA, Black made Epstein the director of his family foundation in 2001. The foundation continued to list Epstein as director on its tax forms until 2012, four years after he had pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. The foundation now says that Epstein resigned in 2007 and that his name continued to appear on its rolls owing to a \u201crecording error.\u201d In 2011, he was listed as an investor in Environmental Solutions Worldwide, a Pennsylvania company, alongside several people close to Black, including his four children. Black himself was seen with Epstein at a movie screening just a few months after Epstein finished probation in 2010, and Epstein was spotted at a party at Black\u2019s home in the Hamptons as recently as 2015.\n\nBlack, Roy: An Epstein lawyer.\n\nThe trial attorney and legal analyst\u2019s client roster has included Justin Bieber, Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis, and Rush Limbaugh. Black is perhaps best known for representing William Kennedy Smith against rape charges in Palm Beach in 1991. (The Kennedy nephew was acquitted.) In 2005, Black played the \u201cmanaging partner\u201d on NBC\u2019s The Law Firm, a knockoff of The Apprentice for up-and-coming lawyers.\n\nBlaine, David: Magician.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBlaine put on a private show for Epstein\u2019s dinner guests in 2003, doing card tricks for the likes of Sergey Brin, Mort Zuckerman, and Bill Clinton aide Doug Band.

Bolkiah and his brother are famous for their lavish spending, including a collection of 2,500 cars and a $1.5 billion palace. Bolkiah was once sued by Miss USA 1997, who claimed she had been held as a sex slave. The suit was dismissed on the grounds that Bolkiah had sovereign immunity.\n\nBond, Annabelle: British socialite.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBonomi, Andrea: Italian businessman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe chairman and founder of Investindustrial was a key character in the Paradise Papers international tax-shelter scandal.\n\nBorrico, Michael: Long Island contractor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDescribed by Social Life magazine as the \u201cambassador of the all-important Hamptons polo culture,\u201d Borrico is known for hosting polo matches at his estate in Water Mill.\n\nBourke, Frederic: A founder of Dooney & Bourke.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBourke went to prison for a scheme to bribe government officials in Azerbaijan.\n\nBowles, Hamish: European editor-at-large for Vogue.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBrandolini, Muriel: Interior designer.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nHer clients have included Matt Lauer and the Crown Prince and Princess of Greece.\n\nBranson, Richard: Founder of Virgin Group.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nLike Epstein, Branson enjoys entertaining on a private island.\n\nBriatore, Flavio: Italian millionaire businessman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nA friend of Trump, a convicted card cheat, and an accused Formula 1 race fixer, Briatore was a longtime fugitive in the Virgin Islands.\n\nBrockman, John: Agent for scientific \u201cfreethinkers.\u201d\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nFrom left, John Brockman, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, Katinka Matson, and Richard Dawkins flying to a TED conference in 2002 aboard Epstein's plane, pictured below Photo: Dailymail.com.

All men, of course. But the group selfies probably shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise \u2014 documents of an age in which every millionaire doesn\u2019t just fancy himself a philosopher-king but expects to be treated as such, and every public intellectual wants to be seen as a kind of celebrity.\n\nCultural shifts like these require visionaries, networkers, salespeople. Brockman is one. A Warhol Factory kid turned freelance philosopher of science turned literary agent to Dawkins and Dennett and Pinker (and many others), in the 1980s he formed a casual salon of like-minded scientists and futurists that came to be known as the Reality Club, a knock against the poststructuralism then dominant in the academy. In the 1990s, he rebranded it as the Edge Foundation, an organization whose central event was an annual online symposium devoted to a single, broad question. In 2000, it was \u201cWhat is today\u2019s most important underreported story?\u201d In 2006, \u201cWhat is your dangerous idea?\u201d\n\nEpstein was a regular contributor, and his plane \u2014 to judge from the photographs, at least \u2014 was an especially appealing way for other contributors to get to ted. They could also catch Epstein at Harvard, where so many of them taught and where he became so prolific a donor that one whole academic program seemed to be run like his private Renaissance ateliers. Epstein had long described himself as a \u201cscientific philanthropist,\u201d and in a press release put out by the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation announcing its \u201csubstantial backing\u201d of Edge, he called it \u201cthe world\u2019s smartest think tank.\u201d\n\nMany in Brockman\u2019s Edge community are, or were, inarguably significant figures in the American intellectual Establishment: Freeman Dyson, Jared Diamond, Craig Venter, John Horgan, Paul Bloom (to name a random but representative sample). They are also among the gods and heroes of the Trump-era internet community of \u201cfreethinkers,\u201d whom Eric Weinstein, the venture capitalist and regular Edge contributor, memorably called \u201cthe intellectual dark web.\u201d The name suggests a self-glamorizing style of dangerous discourse, and as soon as the community was identified, it was criticized as revanchist, an effort to reopen areas of intellectual inquiry \u2014 about innate differences between the races, say, or the genders \u2014 now considered problematic, at a minimum. But to listen to the IDW warriors themselves \u2014 talking about the \u201cwar on free speech\u201d as though their universities had sent assassins their way rather than tenured chairs \u2014 their crusade seems motivated just as much by a thin-skinned sense of their own world-historical significance. They were special people, deserving of special acclaim and, of course, special privileges.\n\nMany contributions to Edge were plausibly the products of genuinely special minds. Epstein\u2019s were not. In 2008, the year he went to jail for prostitution, the prompt was \u201cWhat have you changed your mind about?\u201d Epstein replied, \u201cThe question presupposes a well defined \u2018you\u2019 and an implied ability that is under \u2018your\u2019 control to change your \u2018mind.\u2019 The \u2018you\u2019 I now believe is distributed amongst others (family friends, in hierarchal structures), i.e. suicide bombers, believe their sacrifice is for the other parts of their \u2018you.\u2019 The question carries with it an intention that I believe is out of one\u2019s control. My mind changed as a result of its interaction with its environment. Why? Because it is a part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeffrey has the mind of a physicist,\u201d the Harvard professor Martin Nowak has said, incredibly. But what he really did have was the life of a very rich person \u2014 unable to see any world he felt unqualified to enter and surrounded by too many people enamored with his money to ever hear the word no. \u2014David Wallace-Wells\n\nBronfman Jr., Edgar: Executive.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe former Warner Music Group CEO, son of the late Seagram\u2019s CEO Edgar Bronfman Sr., is related to the NXIVM-sex-cult Bronfmans. His son has a child with pop star M.I.A.\n\nBrunel, Jean-Luc: Model scout.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nBrunel was accused in court testimony of having used his agency to supply Epstein with girls. (He was not charged.) He also has a long history of allegations that he had abused his fashion-world position. In 1988, he was the subject of a 60 Minutes investigation alleging that he and a fellow agent sexually assaulted nearly two dozen models. He denied the claims but later told Model author Michael Gross, \u201cYou get laid tonight with a model, is that a crime?\u201d In 2005, Brunel co-founded the Mc2 modeling agency; Epstein invested $1 million, according to a 2010 deposition.\n\nBuck, Joan Juliet: Fashion editor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nIn 2003, Buck met Maxwell at a fashion party at a New York City boutique. Buck had recently moved on from her seven-year tenure as the editor of Paris Vogue and was writing for its American counterpart and living in New Mexico. She was a lifelong resident of a rarefied social world. Maxwell, a regular on that particular circuit, quickly made a connection. \u201cOh, Jeffrey\u2019s got a ranch in Santa Fe, blah blah blah,\u201d Buck recently remembered their conversation going. She gave Maxwell her Santa Fe number and later asked a friend about Epstein and New Mexico. \u201cHis ranch?\u201d the friend replied. \u201cAs we say in Texas, all hat, no cattle.\u201d\n\nBurkle, Ron: Supermarket magnate.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nBurkle took what were described as humanitarian trips to Africa with Bill Clinton on Epstein\u2019s private Boeing 727. According to a 2008 Vanity Fair feature about the former president, \u201cBurkle\u2019s usual means of transport is the custom-converted Boeing 757 that Clinton calls \u2018Ron Air\u2019 and that Burkle\u2019s own circle of young aides privately refer to as \u2018Air Fuck One.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBushnell, Candace: Columnist who inspired Sex and the City.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBusson, Arpad: French financier.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDuring a custody battle with ex Uma Thurman, her lawyer asked Busson, a prominent hedge-funder, if he had ever said he was \u201caddicted to prostitutes.\u201d (He said no.)\n\nCalacanis, Jason: Businessman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAn investor in Uber, Calacanis was a fixture in the early-aughts New York tech scene as the founder and editor of Silicon Alley Reporter. (\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many propositions I get, it\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d he told the Observer in 2000.)

Photo: Christopher Anderson for New York Magazine\n\nClinton, Bill: President and problem.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nAs soon as the Epstein news broke two weeks ago, the taunting and tallying began, suffocating in its familiarity. First were the jeering reminders, as if we didn\u2019t know it in our every molecule: It wasn\u2019t just Donald Trump who\u2019d be ensnared in this stygian nightmare of underage sexual assault and trafficking of girls, it was Bill Clinton, who\u2019d been a friend and repeat flier on Epstein\u2019s plane. Then came the numbers, the attempts to quantify the nature of the Clinton-Epstein relationship. Clinton issued a statement toting up four plane trips, one Epstein meeting in Clinton\u2019s Harlem office, one visit to Epstein\u2019s home, and zero trips to his island. Meanwhile, reporters recalled that Gawker\u2019s published flight logs had tallied 12 separate plane legs and that Epstein had more than 20 numbers and email addresses for Clinton and one signed photo of him in his home, along with one of Woody Allen and one of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll of this was presented as if these numbers could clarify some exact science of guilt or complicity. The reality is: Yes, Clinton was grimy and had grimy friends, and, more broadly, this is how powerful men have behaved toward women and one another. Yes, we know it\u2019s dirty and mean and exhausting and true.\n\nWe know, of course, because the shadow of Clinton\u2019s sexual history and his associations with other men who have terrible legacies of sexually inappropriate-to-criminal behavior have for decades hung like a greasy and unscrubbable film over the Democratic Party he once led. Clinton palled around not just with Epstein but with Charlie Rose and Harvey Weinstein and Trump himself.\n\nThey hung out together and flew together and went to each other\u2019s offices and visited each other\u2019s homes and appeared on each other\u2019s TV shows and had each other\u2019s phone numbers and attended each other\u2019s weddings and created a circle of money and protection. The prosecutorial and defensive math \u2014 the haggling over flights and phone numbers \u2014 is just used to complicate this basic reality.\n\nThose on the left have been going over how we\u2019re supposed to feel about him for decades, but in the arguing about it, we have been asked to focus again and again on Clinton and his dick and what he did or didn\u2019t do with it. The questions we\u2019ve asked ourselves and one another have become defining.\n\nAre we morally compromised in our defense of him or sexually uptight in our condemnation? Are we shills for having not believed he should have resigned, or doing the bidding of a vindictive right wing if we say that, in retrospect, he probably should have?\n\nMeanwhile, how much energy and time have been spent circling round this man and how we\u2019ve felt about him, when in fact his behaviors were symptomatic of far broader and more damaging assumptions about men, power, and access to \u2014 as Trump has so memorably voiced it \u2014 pussies?\n\nAfter all, Clinton was elected president during a period that may turn out to be an aberration, just as the kinds of dominating, sexually aggressive behaviors that had been norms for his West Wing predecessors had become officially unacceptable, and 24 years before those behaviors would again become a presidential norm. So yes, Clinton got in trouble, yet still managed to sail out of office beloved by many, his reputation as the Big Dog mostly only enhanced by revelations of his exploits.\n\nBut the election of Trump over Clinton\u2019s wife, and the broad conversation around sexual assault and harassment that has erupted in its wake, has recast his behavior more profoundly. The buffoonery, the smallness and tantrums of Trump, has helped make clear what always should have been: that the out-of-control behavior toward women by powerful men, the lack of self-control or amount of self-regard that undergirded their reckless treatment of women, spoke not of virility or authority but of their immaturity. And the people who have paid the biggest price for these men\u2019s fixation on sex as a measure of manhood have, of course, not been the men themselves.\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, it has been Monica Lewinsky, whose life and name became defined by her relationship to him. It has been his wife, Hillary, who, in addition to having been celebrated and pilloried for her defense of her husband, also had to conduct one of her three historic presidential debates with women who\u2019d accused him of sexual misconduct sitting in the audience, invited there by her opponent as props to unsettle and disempower her. It has been decades of left feminist women who have had Clinton\u2019s misdeeds thrown in our faces as proof of our own hypocrisy.\n\nI try sometimes to imagine a contemporary Democratic Party without Bill Clinton in its recent past \u2014 yes, of course, from a policy perspective, but also simply from a personal one. What if so much energy had not been eaten up by his colleagues, by his wife, by feminists, by his supporters and friends and critics, all of whom had to dance around him, explain their associations with him, or carefully lay out their objections to him without coming off as frigid reactionaries?\n\nWhat else might we have done with our politics had we not been worrying about Clinton and his grubby buddies? What further power have they taken from us? \u2014Rebecca Traister\n\nClinton, Chelsea: First Daughter.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell attended her wedding after Epstein had first been charged.

Photo: Rick Friedman/Polaris\n\nFor around a decade, Dershowitz kept casual company with Epstein, who introduced him to his friends, like Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew.\n\n(Dershowitz says he and the prince ended up not getting along because they disagreed about Israel.) Dershowitz visited Epstein\u2019s mansions in New York and Palm Beach and occasionally accompanied him on his private plane. He says these trips were family oriented. Once, Epstein lent him the Palm Beach home so he could attend a granddaughter\u2019s soccer tournament. Another time, he and his nephew flew down to watch a space launch with another Epstein connection, a top NASA official. He and his wife, Carolyn Cohen, once stayed with Epstein on his island in the Caribbean, where they were joined by another Harvard professor and his family.\n\nWhen Epstein first started to attract media attention in the early aughts, mainly because of his friendship with former president Bill Clinton, Dershowitz served as a character witness for the reclusive financier.\n\nHe told Vanity Fair that he shared manuscripts of his books with Epstein before they were published and swore that his money was irrelevant. \u201cI would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\nBut Dershowitz says their interactions changed in 2005, when Epstein faced a local police investigation into his relations with underage girls in Palm Beach and he hired Dershowitz as a lawyer. With his assistance, Epstein was able to whittle down the state\u2019s indictment against him to a single count of soliciting prostitution. But in the years to come, as Epstein\u2019s legal problems compounded, they would eventually ensnare Dershowitz himself. He is also accused of having sex with two of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims. \u201cThe stories are so phantasmological,\u201d Dershowitz says. He recognizes that the #MeToo movement has surfaced countless accounts of preposterous-sounding sexual misbehavior by powerful men and almost all of them have turned out to be true. But Dershowitz swears he is different. \u201cMine is the only case, singular, the only one, where I never met the people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence we\u2019ve ever met, no evidence we were ever in the same place at the same time, ever.\u201d\n\nToday, Dershowitz claims he and Epstein were never really even friends, despite their proximity. \u201cHe was an acquaintance,\u201d he says. \u201cIn retrospect, I wish I hadn\u2019t taken the case, but I didn\u2019t see a problem with taking the case.

He came from a modest Coney Island background, had no college degree, and worked a job \u2014 as a math teacher at Dalton and a tutor to Greenberg\u2019s son \u2014 that was unlikely to support his tastes, which were apparently of the private islands\u2013and\u2013gilded desk\u2013purportedly\u2013belonging\u2013to\u2013J. P. Morgan variety. At Bear Stearns, Epstein made a name for himself in the \u201cspecial-products division,\u201d essentially figuring out how to help the rich pay less taxes. \u201cHe would recommend certain tax-advantageous transactions,\u201d Greenberg\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, James \u201cJimmy\u201d Cayne, told New York in 2002. Cayne, who succeeded Greenberg in 1993, seems to have become the closer party to Epstein, whose mysterious departure from the firm he publicly defended decades after Epstein\u2019s departure. \u201cJeffrey said specifically, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself,\u2019 \u201d Cayne insisted, despite transcripts from an SEC deposition that suggest other concerns around them both. It\u2019s easier to imagine Cayne, a cigar-chomping, archetypal fat cat who was infamously off playing bridge when Bear Stearns collapsed in 2008, as a member of Epstein\u2019s inner circle than his mentor, a folksy, bow-tie-wearing soul who referred to his successor as \u201ccrude,\u201d \u201cfull of himself,\u201d and \u201cwarped\u201d in a memoir published shortly before his death. At the very least, it seems Cayne and Epstein were both capable of, ah, massaging the truth. \u2014Jessica Pressler\n\nGuest, Cornelia: Socialite.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nShe was dubbed \u201cdebutante of the decade\u201d in 1986.\n\nGutfreund, John: CEO of Salomon Brothers.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nHamilton, George: Actor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe overtanned C-lister that Hollywood turns to when casting any vaguely and/or mysteriously aristocratic cameo role.\n\nHandler, Chelsea: Comedian.\n\nAttended a dinner at Epstein\u2019s townhouse for Prince Andrew in 2010. \u201cIt was just one of those strange nights,\u201d she later said.\n\nHaskell, Nikki: Socialite.\n\nEpstein dated Haskell, one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest friends. \u201cJeffrey didn\u2019t talk about his past, although he claimed to have been a concert pianist,\u201d Haskell told the Daily Mail in 1992. \u201cHe told me he was a spy hired by corporations to find major amounts of money which had been embezzled.\u201d\n\nHawking, Stephen: Physicist.\n\nIn 2006, the world\u2019s most famous brain visited Little St. James, Epstein\u2019s private island, which came to be known as \u201cPedophile Island.\u201d Hawking, who was in the Caribbean for a conference, was photographed at a barbecue on the island and aboard a submarine for a tour.

He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and, after his release in 2013, began sounding the alarm on Epstein, who had worked at Hoffenberg\u2019s Towers Financial Corporation after leaving Bear Stearns. He claimed that Epstein had been his co-conspirator in the scheme and that Epstein\u2019s fortune was built on Towers Financial\u2019s fraud. \u201cHe was great at moving money illegally,\u201d Hoffenberg says. \u201cHe was the deeper architect to getting things accomplished.\u201d\n\nHoffenberg claims he was introduced to Epstein by Douglas Leese, a mysterious British arms dealer, and that he paid Epstein $25,000 a month as Towers Financial began making risky plays to take over companies like Pan American World Airways and Emery Air Freight. Advisers on the Pan Am deal included Richard Nixon\u2019s attorney general John Mitchell, Nixon\u2019s brother Edward, and John Lehman, a former secretary of the Navy. The move fell apart after the Lockerbie bombing, and when Towers Financial later went belly-up, Hoffenberg says, the two of them engineered a Ponzi scheme to fill the hole.\n\n\u201cHe has a magnificent personality,\u201d Hoffenberg says. \u201cHe\u2019s very easy to interact with, very social, very easy to bond with, an unusually nice person. And he\u2019s pretty dynamic on financial savvy. He could move money in different areas to get the stock prices to go up and down.\u201d\n\nHoffenberg still owes his victims some $1 billion in restitution, and in 2016 he sued Epstein to recover some of the money. (He eventually dropped the suit.) Last year, two victims brought a suit against Epstein making the same claims as Hoffenberg but voluntarily dismissed the suit two months later.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to see an entire story about this supposed billionaire and the story about his financial empire, which is as big as the tragedy with the girls,\u201d Hoffenberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s billions of dollars, and it\u2019s a fiasco.\u201d \u2014James D.

Was it money? Probably. The word is that Epstein paid his \u201cexecutive assistants\u201d $200,000 a year and let them order takeout from Le Cirque. When Groff had a baby, Epstein gave her a Mercedes and paid for a full-time nanny. \u201cThere is no way I could lose Lesley to motherhood,\u201d he told the New York Times in 2005 (for a front-page story on the indispensability of good help for Wall Street tycoons).\n\nMarcinkova, referred to in court documents as Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave,\u201d hails from the former Yugoslavia; Ross, a model, is from Poland. Kellen (who has since married a NASCAR driver) was a scheduler, making sure that Epstein always had a slate full of girls, and it was she who sometimes walked the girls up the stairs in the Florida mansion and laid the oils out on the massage table. Marcinkova would have sex with the girls for Epstein\u2019s viewing pleasure and sometimes all together. Groff booked travel, and Ross also helped with the calendar. After the Miami Herald published its investigation in 2018, Epstein wired the \u201cpossible co-conspirators\u201d $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, prosecutors say, to buy their silence. Since then, none of them have been reached for comment. \u2014Lisa Miller\n\nKennedy, Ethel: Human-rights advocate.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWidow of Robert Kennedy.\n\nKennedy, Ted: Senator.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nEpstein had his home number.\n\nKent, Geoffrey: High-end safari entrepreneur.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nKerry, John: Secretary of State.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe seven numbers listed for Kerry in Epstein\u2019s address book include the direct line to his presidential campaign.\n\nKhashoggi, Adnan: Saudi Arabian man of mystery.\n\nTo bolster their argument that private-jet owner Epstein is a massive flight risk, SDNY prosecutors produced an expired Austrian passport under an alias that listed Saudi Arabia as Epstein\u2019s primary country of residence. His lawyers claim the fake ID was for the \u201cpersonal protection\u201d of \u201can affluent member of the Jewish faith\u201d traveling in the Middle East, but it could also point to one of his more secretive income sources.\n\nAccording to his former friend the journalist Jesse Kornbluth, in the mid-1980s Epstein said he \u201cworked for governments to recover money looted by African dictators\u201d and occasionally subcontracted to those same autocrats to \u201chelp them hide their stolen money.\u201d A source who spoke with journalist Vicky Ward said one of Epstein\u2019s clients was the late Saudi arms dealer Khashoggi, a middleman in the Iran-Contra scandal who helped smuggle cash for the Marcos family out of the Philippines. In 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland for concealing assets and later faced fraud and racketeering charges in the U.S. (He was later acquitted.) That year, he sold his 282-foot yacht to the Sultan of Brunei, who soon flipped it to Donald Trump. \u2014Matt Stieb\n\nKissinger, Henry: Secretary of State and national-security adviser.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nOne of the century\u2019s most notorious practitioners of cutthroat realpolitik, Kissinger served on the Council on Foreign Relations with Epstein.\n\nKissinger, Nancy: Philanthropist.\n\nEpstein and Kissinger served on the Rockefeller University board alongside Nobel laureate Joseph Goldstein, socialite Brooke Astor, and Texas billionaire Robert Bass.\n\nKleman, Leah: Art dealer.\n\nShe told Vanity Fair in 2003 that Epstein lived like a \u201cmodern maharaja\u201d and described his haggling over art prices as \u201csomething like a scene out of the movie Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.\u201d\n\nKoch, David: Plutocrat.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nKosslyn, Stephen: Harvard psychologist.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\n\u201cHe is amazing,\u201d Kosslyn said of Epstein in a 2002 New York profile. \u201cLike a honeybee \u2014 he talks to all these different people and cross-pollinates.

Photo: Patrick McMullan/Getty Images\n\nShe was there at the socialites\u2019 dos: Cornelia Guest\u2019s holiday bash, Georgette Mosbacher\u2019s party for the writer Michael Gross. At real-estate mogul Aby Rosen\u2019s birthday, at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s cocktail party. At film screenings and store openings and fashion shows, at Tina Brown\u2019s home and Arianna Huffington\u2019s and the Time 100 Gala. For years, though not lately, Maxwell was a constant on the New York social scene in its most Upper East iteration. She was a friend of everyone, if an intimate of few.\n\nMaxwell seemed to know many rich and powerful men \u2014 articles mention her dining with Bill Clinton, photos show her partying with Elon Musk and deep in conversation with Stephen Schwarzman \u2014 but her most durable connection has been with Epstein. She was, as he once put it, his \u201cbest friend.\u201d Maxwell, 57, has been accused in civil suits of serving as his procuress, luring women and girls into Epstein\u2019s web.\n\nIn court documents, Epstein\u2019s accusers allege that Maxwell \u2014 who denies all and has never been criminally charged \u2014 acted as a recruiter, an instructor, and in some cases a participant in the abuse he practiced. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Maxwell recruited her on behalf of Epstein when Giuffre was a 16-year-old spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, where Epstein has a home, said much of her grooming came from Maxwell. \u201cThe training started immediately,\u201d Giuffre said in a video interview with the Miami Herald. \u201cIt was everything down to how to give a blow job, how to be quiet, be subservient, give Jeffrey what he wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery pretty girl in New York, in those days, Ghislaine would invite to Jeffrey\u2019s,\u201d said Euan Rellie, an investment banker and social fixture who has known Maxwell for years and who, along with his wife, the author and socialite Lucy Sykes, was a fellow guest at a dinner for Prince Andrew at Epstein\u2019s townhouse in the early aughts. Maxwell and Epstein had been attached, but she was \u201cnow an employee of his, as I understood it,\u201d Rellie said. \u201cHer job was to jazz up his social life by getting fashionable young women to show up.\u201d He presumed the young women to be in their 20s.\n\nTabloid reports on Maxwell claim she managed Epstein\u2019s properties from his office on Madison Avenue, which appeared in public records for many years as one of Maxwell\u2019s addresses. Epstein, for his part, said she wasn\u2019t on the payroll, yet she did errands for him: hunted for a yoga teacher in California and acted as intermediary when he wanted to give his friend the billionaire Les Wexner a family portrait painted by Nelson Shanks.\n\nShe was said to be wickedly funny and unusually knowledgeable, glamorous, and, on top of that, British. (\u201cI think New Yorkers are charmed by that high-end English accent,\u201d photographer Patrick McMullan said.)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she was exotic. She had explored the seas and could pilot a helicopter, or maybe a submarine, one acquaintance thought \u2014 a MacGyver of the gala circuit.\n\nMaxwell arrived in New York in the early \u201990s, on the cusp of her 30th birthday. English-born and poshly educated, she was the favorite daughter of Robert Maxwell, the English media mogul, whose holdings included newspapers, notably the tabloid Daily Mirror in London, and the Macmillan publishing house in the U.S. Ghislaine had founded a social club for women in London and worked for another of her father\u2019s papers, and, according to the New York Post, she came as his emissary to American society when he bought the New York Daily News in 1991.\n\nBut that same year, Robert was found dead \u2014 by suicide, murder, or accident (the official inquest\u2019s ruling, though opinions vary) \u2014 in the Atlantic, off the Canary Islands. (He was last seen on the deck of his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.) Soon after, he was discovered to have plundered the pension funds of the Mirror to shore up his floundering empire. Ghislaine was reported to have an income for life from a family trust, but at \u00a380,000 a year, it would hardly be enough to sustain a high-flying lifestyle.\n\nThe meet-cute of Epstein and Maxwell in New York is unclear, and neither has historically gone into any great detail. By 1992, they were already linked, showing up at a Mar-a-Lago party with each other in Palm Beach, where Trump and Epstein ogled women together in front of NBC cameras. Suffice it to say they were romantically linked and then platonically linked. (Epstein told people his former paramours move \u201cup, not down,\u201d to friend status.)\n\nFor a woman seen everywhere about town, she is curiously silent in the press, except where ocean conservation is concerned. In 2008, she hosted a cocktail party for the board of the nonprofit Oceana at her townhouse on East 65th Street. And by 2012, she had launched the TerraMar Project, a conservation nonprofit of her own, of which, according to tax filings, she was president but from which she drew no salary. She gave a ted Talk about its work and talked it up at the U.N. and in the press, which credited TerraMar as her \u201cbrainchild.\u201d\n\nFrom the New York social world, she has vanished. \u201cI have not seen her in a zillion years,\u201d one acquaintance said. The party photos dried up in 2016. Her 65th Street townhouse was sold for just over $15 million that year. Where is she now? One social-watcher guessed the islands; others think Europe. She incorporated a company \u2014 Ellmax, a play on her name \u2014 in the U.K., and TerraMar\u2019s last two years of tax filings listed the address of an accounting firm near Boston.

Despite what various friends and colleagues all said about what a genius he was, I found him tedious and distasteful. Even before I knew about the criminality, I found it irritating to talk to him, all the more so because the reason he was in the conversation was because he had given money to these various projects. He likes schmoozing with smart and intellectual people, but he couldn\u2019t really or had very little interest in exploring an issue. He\u2019d wisecrack, change subjects, or get bored after a few seconds.

Let\u2019s also forget the life-size doll hanging from a chandelier, and the chess set with figures of his staff as pieces to play with. Let\u2019s instead focus on the very lush Euro-Orientalist d\u00e9cor of Epstein\u2019s 21,000-square-foot seven-story Beaux-Arts mansion, decorated by none other than the late great Alberto Pinto, one of the world\u2019s top prestige interior designers. His clientele included princes, moguls, and wannabe princes, as captains of industry so frequently are, and Epstein clearly aspired to that provenance and history. He flew Pinto on his private plane, as he did other architects and designers (Jean-Michel Gathy, Ricardo Legorreta, and Peter Marino are also listed in Epstein\u2019s flight logs), and lived like a modern pasha in rooms lavished with money that bought custom-tooled gold leather walls (at least they were made to look like tooled-leather walls) and leopard-print upholstered armchairs in the dining room that appear to be covered in silk velvet. It was exactly the sort of project Pinto relished, flexing all the artisanal muscle that a designer of his stature can exercise when cushioning his client\u2019s home. \u2014Wendy Goodman\n\nPittman, Bob: Chairman and CEO of iHeartMedia, Inc.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nPosen, Felix: Philanthropist\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nFormer business partner of Marc Rich (who was famously indicted for tax evasion and trading with Iran, before being even more famously pardoned by President Clinton), with whom he paired on deals in the Soviet Union before the fall of communism.\n\nPritzker, Tom: Executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nKnown to dine with Epstein in the early aughts.\n\nRadziwill, Carole: Author and television personality.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe daughter-in-law of Lee Radziwill and a Real Housewife of New York.\n\nRanieri, Lewis: The \u201cfather\u201d of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAnother Epstein dinner partner.\n\nRichardson, Bill: Former New Mexico governor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nZorro Ranch, Epstein\u2019s New Mexico property.

Written call logs from 2005 and 2006 show Epstein and his own assistant calling dozens of times, making plans for lunch and tea in Manhattan or to try to meet up in Paris. Epstein also called with a total of five women\u2019s names and phone numbers. One woman was described as \u201cworld\u2019s most perfect assistant she used to work for Harvey Weinstein he\u2019s lucky if he can get her.\u201d Another entry reads, \u201cJeffrey Epstein wants to talk to you before you call these two girls.\u201d A fourth woman shows up on the manifests of Epstein\u2019s jet, including on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip across Africa, and wound up working at the Clinton Foundation. Two former staffers remember another Epstein referral, a young woman not mentioned in the logs, who interned at the show. In all, Rose hired three (\u201cJeffrey Epstein from time to time recommended various candidates for open positions at the Charlie Rose Show,\u201d Rose\u2019s representative said in a statement, but said the ex-host only learned about Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse years later, when he pleaded guilty in Florida). When I called one of these women recently, she was stunned to learn she was one of many women Epstein recommended for the job. \u201cI was being offered up for abuse,\u201d said the woman, who was 22 at the time she worked for Rose. It helped her understand not only how her boss Rose \u2014 whom in 2017 she would accuse, along with 34 other adult women, of sexual harassment \u2014 had treated her, but also how the rest of the staff had seen her. And it helped her understand a grim version of networking among powerful men. \u2014Irin Carmon\n\nSacco, Amy: Nightlife impresario.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe undisputed club queen of aughts New York, Sacco ran Lot 61 in Chelsea, which was famous for using fresh fruit in its drinks, and later Bungalow 8, which prided itself on discretion, the kind of place where celebrities could behave badly and not have to worry about appearing in \u201cPage Six.\u201d Sacco was a pioneer of marrying nightlife with concierge-style indulgences for the very rich: Her staff would get you whatever you needed: pizza delivery, peanut M&M\u2019s, a private flight to Miami leaving from Teterboro as soon as you could get there.\n\nSchank, Roger: Chief learning officer at Trump University.\n\nVisited Epstein in prison in 2008.\n\nSchumer, Chuck: New York\u2019s senior senator.\n\nOne of many politicians to receive donations from Epstein over the years.

Epstein also gave to a handful of politicians in New Mexico, where he\u2019d purchase the Zorro Ranch from former governor Bruce King and where he was not required to register as a sex offender.

Everyone needs to feel that they belong.\u201d At least a certain kind of accomplished person, no matter, frankly, how they went about getting there (who was she to judge?). Known for her movie premieres and other guest-list-driven social events, she bragged that she \u201cruined the Hamptons\u201d to Vanity Fair in a profile back in 1996.\n\nPublicity-party invites are an amoral game, driven by status and FOMO. Like everyone, she worked with Harvey Weinstein when he was an Oscar machine, the toast of the town. So you can\u2019t blame Siegal for including someone who already knew all the boldface power people. In 2008, in the teeth of the accusations against Epstein, he was spotted by a New York party reporter, \u201cunshaven, smiling that feline-monkey grin,\u201d at the Siegal-engineered screening of the HBO film Bernard and Doris at the Time Warner Center. But after prison, apparently Epstein needed her more than ever: In a Times story on how Manhattan\u2019s A-list refused to shun him, Siegal in particular was willing to help him (for free, apparently), \u201cusing her gate-keeping powers to usher Mr. Epstein, a friend, into screenings and events.\u201d In 2010, she threw a dinner party at his Upper East Side townhouse for Prince Andrew, Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, Charlie Rose, and Woody Allen. She and Epstein might have had other reasons to get along: Siegal, who has just turned 72, is a self-invention as well, without a particularly pedigreed background. Also notable is the fact that, as she told Vanity Fair in 2012, \u201cmy favorite way to travel\u201d to Cannes is \u201con a friend\u2019s G5 from Teterboro to Nice.\u201d \u2014Carl Swanson\n\nSlater, Rodney: Secretary of Transportation under Bill Clinton.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nFlight logs record Slater taking a flight from Ghana to Nigeria in September 2002.\n\nSoros, Peter: Nephew of George Soros.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nConspiracy theorists looking through Epstein\u2019s black book will be disappointed that George Soros never appears \u2014 but they can find Peter.\n\nSpacey, Kevin: Actor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nFlew with Bill Clinton to Africa (and, according to flight logs, the Azores) on Epstein\u2019s plane.\n\nSpector, Warren: Bear Stearns executive.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nStanbury, Caroline: Socialite.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWent on to star on Bravo\u2019s Ladies of London.\n\nStarr, Kenneth: Former United States solicitor general.\n\nObviously, lawyers do not share guilt for their clients\u2019 crimes. But it\u2019s striking that Kenneth Starr chose to join Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s defense team in 2007, after his moral fulminations against Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual perfidy. His obsessive pursuit of President Clinton made him a folk hero on the right, representing the defense of traditional sexual virtue and the notion that it was under assault by Bill Clinton and the liberal elite. His special-prosecutor exploits propelled him to the presidency of the conservative Baptist Baylor University. During his tenure, the football program engaged in a horrific pattern of sexual abuse that led to the dismissal of the football coach and the removal of Starr after an investigation found \u201cactions by University administrators that directly discouraged some complainants from reporting or participating in student conduct processes.\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps coincidental, but Starr has tracked the broader conversion of the religious right from sexual shaming to sexual shamelessness. In an era when Donald Trump has exposed the hollowness of so many values conservatives allegedly hold dear, it is fitting that this Zelig of right-wing sexual hypocrisy has made yet another cameo. \u2014Jonathan Chait\n\nStephanopoulos, George: Former White House communications director.\n\nAttended a dinner at Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse for Prince Andrew in 2010. \u201cThat dinner was the first and last time I\u2019ve seen him,\u201d Stephanopoulos said recently. \u201cIt was a mistake to go.\u201d\n\nSummers, Larry: Former Treasury secretary.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nWith Robert Trivers and Larry Summers at Harvard in 2004. Photo: Rick Friedman/Polaris\n\nBy the time the accusations of Epstein trafficking in girls surfaced, Larry Summers was out as Harvard\u2019s president, having alienated much of the faculty, including two black professors who jumped ship, and spitballing about women\u2019s biological inferiority in the sciences. But his tenure \u2014 2001 to \u201906, bookended by serving as Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama\u2019s director of the National Economic Council \u2014 overlapped with a high-water mark of Harvard\u2019s love affair with Epstein. Epstein, reads a story published in the Harvard Crimson in 2003, \u201chas found Harvard the perfect staging ground for his intellectual pursuits.\u201d Then-president Summers didn\u2019t comment, but Alan Dershowitz confided that Epstein \u201cspeaks well of Larry, and I think he admires Larry\u2019s economic thinking.\u201d Lucky Larry, to be recognized by such an eminence.\n\nEpstein, of course, was not an alumnus of Harvard (or anywhere), or a faculty member, but he was a donor. Asked by the Crimson in 2006 whether Epstein\u2019s $6.5 million donation should be returned, interim president Derek Bok referred to an earlier statement that Harvard has no \u201cobligation to investigate each donor and impose detailed moral standards.\u201d Summers imposed his own moral standards, hitching a ride on Epstein\u2019s plane. (A representative had no comment.) Even after Epstein registered as a sex offender, the Boston Globe reported, Summers\u2019s wife, Harvard English professor Elisa New, accepted Epstein\u2019s $110,000 donation to her PBS poetry show. \u2014Irin Carmon\n\nTaymor, Julie: Director.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nResponsible for one of the biggest hits in Broadway history, The Lion King, and one of the biggest flops, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.\n\nTrivers, Robert: Evolutionary biologist.\n\nIn 2015, he defended Epstein, saying, \u201cBy the time they\u2019re 14 or 15, they\u2019re like grown women were 60 years ago, so I don\u2019t see these acts as so heinous.\u201d This month, he called his past statement \u201cstupid and offensive.\u201d\n\nTrump, Donald: President and partygoer.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAt a party at Mar-a-Lago on November 1992. Photo: via NBC\n\nThere it was, yet another tape. This time, the now-president was filmed, in footage dredged up by NBC, in 1992 at Mar-a-Lago, hosting a party attended by a bevy of Buffalo Bills cheerleaders \u2014 and Epstein, from whom Trump has tried to distance himself since the arrest. He knew him only like anyone else in Palm Beach knew him, he said recently, although there were several entries for Trump in the black book, including a \u201cdirect emergency contact,\u201d and 17 years ago Trump had boasted to this magazine that he\u2019d known him forever and that he was a \u201cterrific guy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the denial in the face of evidence that, yes, he really did hang out with the guy that makes this set of film so classically Trumpian. The tape distills Trump to a certain essence: In this frame, he dances, snapping his fingers and spinning, surrounded by women \u2014 but profoundly alone, backing off and avoiding eye contact the second a woman moves in to dance with him. In another frame, he smiles with self-satisfaction as a crowd of women chants his name. Surrounded by a group of cheerleaders about to pose for a picture, he reaches around the waist of one and pulls her sharply in to him, then briskly cups her behind in a businesslike, joyless fashion while she reaches for her hair to maintain smiling composure. It\u2019s as if he thinks it\u2019s his vaguely grim duty, as an American man playing the campiest possible version of swinging billionaire bachelor, to grab the closest available body part.\n\nAnd most telling is his sideline locker-room talk with Epstein, whom the camera catches entering the party, greeted warmly by Trump. Like teenagers, they stand at the edges of the dance floor, pointing out the women they like, laughing at private jokes about them, rating them as hot. Here, there is joy. You see in this moment two outer-borough boys who have successfully crashed the Manhattan Establishment, who have boorishly, clumsily used money to get everything they want \u2014 but whose desires have never moved beyond an adolescent vision of the world, of women, of men, of the good life, of who merits consideration and who can be used.\n\nIn middle age, Trump had enough self-control to understand that his worst instincts were best received by men who were an awful lot like him. Now, as an old man \u2014 the oldest teenager ever \u2014 Trump has lost even that filter. He\u2019s turned the whole country into his bunga-bunga party, made a Mar-a-Lago of the world stage, and divided us into Epsteins and cheerleaders \u2014 either co-conspirators who love the license his immaturity grants or else disposable collateral damage. \u2014Noreen Malone\n\nRead More: NBC Obtained Trump-Epstein Footage After Trump Kissed an Anchor Without Consent\n\nTrump, Ivana: Donald Trump\u2019s first ex-wife.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nTrump, Ivanka: Daughter of Donald and Ivana Trump.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nTrump, Melania: Wife of Donald Trump.\n\nWith Trump, Melania, and Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.

Tuttle, a designer of luxury resorts by trade, renovated the main compound on Epstein\u2019s 70-acre private island in 2003. Sometime between 2009 and 2013, a \u201ctemple\u201d appeared on the island: a large, boxy, blue-and-white-striped structure with a golden dome, surrounded by palm trees. In the days after Epstein\u2019s arrest, the temple became the object of fervent speculation online. It was the kind of irresistible conspiracy-bait that exemplifies the Epstein story: On the one hand, shouldn\u2019t it be enough that a mysteriously wealthy banker with connections to the globe\u2019s most powerful people was apparently operating a child sex-trafficking ring without dabbling in theories about occult island temples? On the other hand, though, once you\u2019ve accepted that, why would occult island temples be so out of the question? On the edges, the Epstein saga could seem less like a news story than like a brutal, unreadable fairy tales. Or maybe it was a desire to take a story about financial power and social privilege colluding to protect a criminal predator and transform it into something more terrible and monumental. After weeks of speculation, the first eyewitness account revealed that what the \u201ctemple\u201d contained wasn\u2019t a necromantic shrine but a gym, decorated with a framed photograph of a topless woman. \u2014Max Read\n\nVance, Cyrus Jr.: Prosecutor in the crosshairs.\n\nThere are currently 475 level-three sex offenders registered in New York County, but in 2011, when an attorney from the office of Cy Vance, Manhattan DA, argued that Epstein\u2019s risk level should be reduced, Justice Ruth Pickholz responded, \u201cI have to tell you I am a little overwhelmed because I have never seen a prosecutor\u2019s office do anything like this.\u201d Pickholz denied the request \u2014 Epstein\u2019s risk assessment put him 20 points above the required threshold for the highest level of offender \u2014 and the DA\u2019s office later reversed its request. Though there\u2019s no indication Vance and Epstein were friendly, his office has been criticized previously for declining to pursue sex-crimes charges against Harvey Weinstein that coincided with a donation from his attorneys (though Weinstein has since been charged by Vance\u2019s office) and fraud charges against Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. \u2014Irin Carmon\n\nWachner, Linda: Head of the textile corporation behind Calvin Klein and Speedo.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWallace, Mike: 60 Minutes journalist.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWalters, Barbara: Broadcast journalist and TV personality.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWeinstein, Bob: Former co-chairman of Miramax Films and the Weinstein Company.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWexner, Leslie: The money behind the money.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nRetailing billionaire Leslie Wexner was Epstein\u2019s only known client, the man who transferred the rights to that famous townhouse to him for free in 2011, years after they were supposed to no longer be in contact. The relationship stretches back to the late 1980s, a time when Wexner\u2019s star was on the rise. A 1985 cover story for New York visited him in Columbus, Ohio, where his retail empire was built. Journalist Julie Baumgold described how he, not unlike Epstein, was a self-made man, addicted to self-improvement, how he didn\u2019t know how to pronounce La Grenouille correctly and wanted to have his picture taken at the Whitney, and noted that \u201cWexner is what used to be known as a \u2018confirmed bachelor.\u2019 \u201d (He later married and has four children.) Not long after that piece, he was introduced to Epstein, who had left Bear Stearns under a cloud and was broke. He and Wexner hit it off, and Epstein soon began managing Wexner\u2019s finances. Wexner\u2019s credibility lent plausibility to the notion that Epstein managed billions from his Caribbean-island redoubt. Associates of Wexner, who is now worth $6.6 billion, didn\u2019t understand the attraction. Soon after the men began working together, Epstein moved into Wexner\u2019s Upper East Side mansion. Wexner bought the seven-story townhouse in 1989 for $13.2 million but apparently lived there only for a few months. The title was transferred in 2011 to a Virgin Islands entity controlled by Epstein. It is now worth $56 million. \u2014Michelle Celarier and Carl Swanson\n\nRead More: Who Is Les Wexner, and How Is He Connected to Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nWiesel, Elie: Nobel Prize winner.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nZagat, Nina and Jim: Publishers.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nZuckerman, Mort: Media mogul and newspaper publisher.\n\nZuckerman went into business with Epstein \u2014 briefly \u2014 in 2004, spending $25 million to invest in Radar, but he pulled the plug after just three issues.

(On Sunday, he backed down and extended federal social-distancing guidelines for at least another month.) According to the Washington Post, \u201cConservatives close to Trump and numerous administration officials have been circulating an article by Richard A. Epstein of the Hoover Institution, titled \u2018Coronavirus Perspective,\u2019 which plays down the extent of the spread and the threat.\u201d\n\nEpstein, a professor at New York University School of Law, published the article on the Web site of the Hoover Institution, on March 16th. In it, he questioned the World Health Organization\u2019s decision to declare the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, said that \u201cpublic officials have gone overboard,\u201d and suggested that about five hundred people would die from COVID-19 in the U.S. Epstein later updated his estimate to five thousand, saying that the previous number had been an error. So far, there have been more than two thousand coronavirus-related fatalities in America; epidemiologists\u2019 projections of the total deaths range widely, depending on the success of social distancing and the availability of medical resources, but they tend to be much higher than Epstein\u2019s. (On Sunday, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated that there could be between a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand deaths in the U.S.) In a follow-up article, published on March 23rd and titled \u201cCoronavirus Overreaction,\u201d Epstein wrote, \u201cProgressives think they can run everyone\u2019s lives through central planning, but the state of the economy suggests otherwise. Looking at the costs, the public commands have led to a crash in the stock market, and may only save a small fraction of the lives that are at risk.\u201d\n\nEpstein has long been one of the most cited legal scholars in the country, and is known for his libertarian-minded reading of the Constitution, which envisions a restrained federal government that respects private property. He has also been known to engage with controversial subjects; last fall, he published an article on the Hoover Institution Web site that argued, \u201cThe professional skeptics are right: there is today no compelling evidence of an impending climate emergency.\u201d Last Wednesday, I spoke by phone with Epstein about his views of the coronavirus pandemic. He was initially wary of talking, and asked to record his own version of the call, which I agreed to. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, Epstein made a number of comments about viruses that have been strongly disputed by medical professionals. We have included factual corrections alongside those statements.\n\nWhat did you want to achieve with your pieces?\n\nWhat did I want to achieve with my pieces? First of all, I am not a politician. What I did is that I looked at the standard model that was put out in the New York Times [in an Op-Ed by Nicholas Kristof and Stuart A. Thompson, published on March 13th], which was backed up by other models in other places, and it occurred to me that I just did not think that the underlying assumptions there were sound. The single most important thing to me was not to get my own estimate of what the number is. The most important thing was to look at that curve, which seemed to suggest that there would be ten million cases a day during a ten-day or so band in the middle of July, and to explain why, in relationship to all other things I know about evolutionary theory, that this just has to be wrong. The better way to have phrased the paper would have been to say that the traditional models, which were used for the last flu season, for the 2009 H1N1 situation, are much better approximations of what is likely to happen than these rather scary kinds of projections.\n\nYou wrote last week, \u201cIn the United States, if the total death toll increases at about the same rate, the current 67 deaths should translate into about 500 deaths at the end.\u201d We are currently at eight hundred deaths\u2014over eight hundred deaths. [This was true when we spoke; the number is now over two thousand.]\n\nFirst of all, let me just say I wrote an amendment to that, the thing I regret most in that whole paper. But I was not so much interested in explaining why my number was right. I was interested in explaining why the other projections were wrong.\n\nO.K., but your number was surpassed in about a week, and now we\u2019re already\u2014\n\nI understand that, but the point about that is that, first of all, there was a simple stupid error, which is you would never want to put it in a model that total deaths in the United States relative to the world would be one per cent. So if you just inflated it to five per cent or ten per cent, then all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a number which is either five or ten times as high.\n\nSecondly, suppose I should have been wiser in this and said, as I referred to the flu vaccine and later on to the H1N1 situation, if those are your benchmarks, then the number goes up to, say, between fifteen thousand and forty thousand deaths, as opposed to the one million-plus that are projected. [The Times model projected, without interventions by governments or citizens, a million deaths in the U.S.; with such interventions, the model showed that number dramatically decreasing.] And, remember, the one million-plus is on a model which is universal and worldwide, and you should expect to see something like that somewhere else. And there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that any of the situations, even in Italy, is going to approach the kinds of numbers that you had there. And so I am truly sorry about that [five hundred] number. I regard it as the single worst public-relations gaffe I\u2019ve made in my entire life. But the question to ask, Isaac, is not whether I chose the right number but whether I had the right model.\n\nSomething else you wrote, in an earlier piece, was, \u201cWhy has there been such a dramatic mismatch in the responses to ordinary flu and the coronavirus?\u201d Is that a question you\u2019re still unsure about?\n\nLook, the basic problem is, I think, in effect, that the tendency on the part of many people to treat this particular thing as unique is a mistake. There\u2019s an underlying, standard model that you want to use, and the question is how you stuff it full of parameters. That is, numbers you add into it to make what\u2019s going on. And, so, the situation that you get is you cannot use any exponential system because essentially then everybody is going to be dead, because things just keep doubling, doubling, and doubling.\n\nSo you have to develop a model which is going to explain why there\u2019s a fairly rapid increase at the outset, and then why the thing starts to turn flat, ultimately down, and then disappears. That\u2019s the strategy that you have to do. And so the theory here is one that I actually worked with and I thought worked pretty well in the AIDS stuff, which I worked on back in the early nineteen-eighties. And the model goes something like this. You start off with this virus, and there\u2019s a range, some of which are very serious and some of which are less, so it\u2019s a theory of natural selection with a normal distribution set. And, if you\u2019re moving into a new environment like the [Life Care Center] of Kirkland or like the cruise ship, what happens is you have people who are completely unaware of what is going on. And so you take a population like in Kirkland, which is fragile and old, you get somebody in who has a strong version of the virus, and the thing will just absolutely rip through the population and kill everybody in it within a very short period of time. [Daniel Kuritzkes, the chief of the infectious-diseases division at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, in Boston, said, after being read this passage, \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that there are strong and weak variations of the coronavirus circulating. There may be minor variations person to person or location to location in the actual genetic sequence, but there is no evidence that they have different virulence or that a less virulent version is overtaking a more virulent version.\u201d]"}]}
