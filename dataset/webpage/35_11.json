Flanagan, Jr. has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\n\n\n\nMr. Flanagan first garnered inspiration for his 44 years of general law practice during his formative years while working at his local library.\n\n\n\nExhibiting particular interest in J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Flanagan quickly recognized his desire to pursue a career in law because at that time the only avenues to becoming a special agent were as an attorney or as a certified public accountant. So he decided then that he would become a lawyer, and in high school he interned at the law office of William, O. Ellis in Redwood City, CA.\n\n\n\nHe obtained his undergrad degree in Political Science at Stanford University. Because he was enrolled in the NROTC program, he graduated with a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve. His active duty consisted primarily of Basic School and then serving as a Communications Officer with a Top-Secret Crypto clearance running the Crypto Center for the First Marine Air Wing in Japan. He then returned home and attended Stanford University Law School for a JD degree in Law. During law school he interned with the general law practice firm of Crist, Peters, and Donegan in Palo Alto, CA.\n\n\n\nAfter law school, realizing that he wanted to be in a general law practice to help people solve their legal problems, he was a legislative intern with the California Assembly Water Committee, and wrote his first book, California Water Districts. Having married his wife Charlotte while in law school, he then moved with her to Fresno, where she was raised, to practice law. Being a country boy at heart he wanted to practice law in a rural area. His first two years of practice was with the firm of Creede, Dawson, & McElrath as an associate. The next 11 years of practice was as a partner with the firm of Pettitt, Blumberg, Sherr, and Flanagan. The senior partners of those two firms became his mentors on the general practice of law in office, court, and appeals. In 1975, he left the firm and went into a solo general practice of his own until he retired in 2006.\n\n\n\nDuring his law practice Mr, Flanagan also was: a judge pro-tem in the Fresno Superior Court; a weekly newspaper columnist at two local newspapers; taught at several colleges creating and teaching courses in Water Law and Dispute Resolution; and also active in community affairs, being a member, board member, or chair of numerous community and church organizations, several of which he still writes commentaries for their monthly bulletins.\n\n\n\nHe is still an active member of Rotary (Senior Active at the North Fresno Club), the Marine Corps League (life), the Military Officers Association of America (life), and the Catholic Professional & Breakfast Club.\n\n\n\nDuring his law practice Mr. Flanagan had been a member of the California State Bar (received a commendation letter for 50 years of service), the Fresno Bar Association, the Oregon State Bar for several years, and admitted to practice before the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth District, as well as the United States District Courts for the Northern, Southern, and Eastern Districts of California. Two of his winning appellate cases are in the California Reports.\n\n\n\nOn retirement from the practice of law in 2006, Mr. Flanagan served for 8 years on the staff of the Fresno Chamber of Commerce (after 34 years of serving various Chamber of Commerce organizations). In 2014, Mr. Flanagan left the Chamber job to finish writing a book titled Managing Conflict \u2013 Strategies to Create and Teach Resolution of Conflict, Lawyers & Judges Publishing Co. (2016). Three years later he was co-author of another book, Resolving Conflict by Mediation, a Primer, Scholars Press (2019) with Gregory J. Zubacz, Associate Provost and former Chair of the Peacemaking and Conflict Studies at Fresno Pacific University.\n\n\n\nMr. Flanagan plans to write at least three more books (Conversations without Conflict, Dinosaur Lawyer (a commentary on the disappearance of the general practitioner in both medicine and law and the effect on the public, mainly the lack of affordability of, and access to, service particularly in rural areas), and Irish Boy (a commentary of his life as the youngest of two grandsons of grandparents who were all born in the Republic of Ireland and became naturalized citizens of the U.S. after leaving behind the conflict that they referred to as \"the troubles\").\n\n\n\nAs a testament to his professional success, Mr. Flanagan has been featured in multiple editions of Who's Who in America, in the West, in the World, in American Law, and in American Education.\n\n\n\nAbout Marquis Who's Who\u00ae\n\nSince 1899, when A. N. Marquis printed the First Edition of Who's Who in America\u00ae, Marquis Who's Who\u00ae has chronicled the lives of the most accomplished individuals and innovators from every significant field of endeavor, including politics, business, medicine, law, education, art, religion and entertainment.

He married Ann M Saunders on 22 Jun 1820 in Fluvanna County VA. She was also born about 1795 according to DAR records.\n\nUntil now, few details were known about John outside of his marriage to Ann, the 1840 census in St Francis County, Arkansas, and his known son William J. I have always wanted to find out what happened to John and have been searching out details about him for the past few years. By delving into available records, I have discovered many more details beyond research that stopped in the 1960\u2019s (as far as I can tell) with Dr. Edward Latane Flanagan and Kate Flanagan McGuire. He did not die in St Francis County; he died in Madison County, MS sometime after 1845 but before December 1853.\n\nThis study is presented as a series of events in chronological order. Most of these events are not known to most researchers, but because of what we know about John and his son William, along with 1) the emergence of a letter written in 1844 by John\u2019s brother Simpson B Flanagan which I discovered in a Louisa County VA chancery case and 2) the compiled research papers prepared by Dr. Edward Latane Flanagan (1882-1965) which are housed at the Virginia Museum of History and Culture (formerly known as Virginia Historical Society), much new light can be shed on John.\n\nThe theory pieces together many moving parts, which should not be a surprise when researching a family that hasn\u2019t been researched in depth for 60 years.\n\nWhen: 22 Jun 1820\n\nWhere: Fluvanna Co VA\n\nWhat: John Flanagan marries Ann M Saunders\n\nSource: \u201cFluvanna County, Virginia Marriage Bonds 1781-1860,\u201d Genealogical Society of Utah, May 1938, page 29 [https://www.familysearch.org/library/books/viewer/194364/?offset=0#page=17&viewer=picture&o=&n=0&q=]\n\nWhen: 4 Nov 1821\n\nWhere: Fluvanna Co VA\n\nWhat: John and Ann\u2019s son William J is born\n\nSource: Letter written by Henrietta (Flanagan) Moore (1849-1928) to her niece Kate (Flanagan) McGuire; postmark is illegible, but the letter is addressed to \u201cKate McGuire,\u201d and Kate Flanagan married Herman McGuire in 1921.

My research shows that there was only one sister, Susan, who had a daughter Miranda Hall who married Perry Kuykendall. All told, Susan was married 3 times: 1) Isaac Mitchell, probably in AR, 2) Amos Hall in White Co IL, and 3) James B Hanmore in Gallatin Co IL. I have researched Susan extensively and will provide information about her in a separate research paper.

I don\u2019t believe all these individuals are children of John and Ann or Mary. There are 2 individuals who are engaged in \u201cLearned Professions and Engineers,\u201d and I have serious doubts that John\u2019s children received any sort of formal schooling outside of rural public schools. The males in the 20<30 bracket are probably individuals living at John\u2019s household, and the 2 females in the 20<30 bracket are probably wives of 2 of those men.\n\nJohn appears on the first line of the page of this census. On the third line is Isaac Mitchell, the first husband of John\u2019s daughter Susan Rebecca. Isaac falls into the age bracket of 20<30, while the eldest female in the household is in the 15<30 age bracket, and this would fit John\u2019s daughter Susan Rebecca. In Isaac\u2019s household there is also a male child under 5 years of age. It is of interest to note that there are Isaac Mitchell\u2019s in Giles Co TN as well, but they are still in Giles Co TN after this Isaac Mitchell has gone to Arkansas, but it should be noted that the 1850 census for him shows he was born in TN; the Susan Rebecca Flanagan analysis should be consulted for more details.\n\nWhen: 1844\n\nWhere: Virginia-Alabama-Mississippi\n\nWhat: In a Fluvanna County VA chancery suit, Benjamin J Flanagan brings a suit against his uncle Simpson B Flanagan to recover money from notes that he had given to Simpson to collect for him in Alabama. Apparently what money Simpson was able to recover, he ended up spending due to financial hardship. In the suit file (the complete chancery case file is at the Library of Virginia and available online), is a letter from Simpson to Benjamin dated 17 Mar 1844 at Limestone County AL. Simpson writes:\n\n\u201c\u2026I received a letter from Brother John about four weeks past the first time we have heard of him in near three years. He has as usual been unfortunate. Lost four of his children & has been sick him self since last June. he wrote me he wanted to come to my house and stay the Summer for his helth. I shall look for him in a month he lives on the yazoo river in missippi..I am very Willing to Summer him if by so doing I can get him to stop the cracks of his cabbin with clay I have no doubt but you will do so tell John H I hope he will do so\u2026\u201d\n\nSource: Fluvanna Co VA Chancery case 1851-010, Benjamin C Flanagan vs S B Flanagan etc, Library of Virginia, Richmond Call No. 065-1851-010 [https://www.lva.virginia.gov/chancery/case_detail.asp?CFN=065-1851-010]\n\nThis passage about John is tragic. He\u2019s lost 4 children in the past 3 years and, very telling, Simpson says John has been \u201cas usual unfortunate.\u201d We can only infer the unfortunate circumstances surrounding John based on what we know, but some items we can list from this letter and other sources are:\n\nFour of his children died between 1841 and 1844.\n\nHe lost his wife Ann Saunders in VA or TN between 1824 and 1827.\n\nSince I cannot locate record of further transactions regarding his 250 acres of Yancey land in Giles Co TN, he may have lost that property due to failure to pay the 3 notes to Thomas Martin.\n\nAccording to ELF\u2019s family group sheet for John Flanagan, his great-grandson Claiborne McDonald wrote to ELF in 1961 that, according to John\u2019s son William J, John had purchased a farm in Lynchburg VA on the James River, but when dams were built on the river, it flooded his land and he lost the farm and was never able to recover financial recompense for the loss. I have not been able to locate any evidence of this, but there is no reason to doubt it. When this incident occurred I cannot say, but probably sometime between 1824 and 1827\u2026between leaving Fluvanna Co VA and moving to Giles Co TN.\n\nHis health was in such a poor state that he felt the need to travel to his brother in Limestone Co AL to live in the Spring of 1844 in hopes of recovering.\n\nLastly, Simpson\u2019s last statement is a mystery, \u201cI have no doubt but you will do so tell John H I hope he will do so.\u201d Is he asking Benjamin to write John to encourage him to summer with Simpson? Who is John H? Did our John Flanagan have a middle initial \u201cH\u201d?\n\nAt the same time of the date of this letter, a chancery suit was being pursued in Louisa County VA over a land dispute among family members concerning property once owned by John Flanagan\u2019s grandfather (James Flanagan d. 1752 in Louisa Co VA). In the suit, John and Benjamin and Benjamin\u2019s siblings were suing John\u2019s other siblings over division of James\u2019s property. Benjamin and his siblings were not the same generation as John; they were the children of John\u2019s deceased brother, James W Flanagan (d. 1842). Because of this suit, Simpson probably felt certain that Benjamin would be in touch with John and would encourage him to spend the summer with Simpson.\n\nWhen: 1844 (circa)\n\nWhere: Mississippi\n\nWhat: Daniel W Flanagan is born in Mississippi\n\nSource: 1850 census, Limestone Co AL, p 36a [https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HY-6S2F-TV?i=73&cc=1401638&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AMH5S-FX2]\n\nWhen: 1845\n\nWhere: Rankin County MS\n\nWhat: John Flagin appears on the Mississippi State Census of 1845.

Where has he been since deserting the army in 1863? He does not appear on the Mill Creek Twp AR tax lists in 1870 or surrounding years, and if he was a resident he would have at least been taxed for a poll. Was he just passing through? Where did he go?\n\nNotes and Questions:\n\nRegarding Simpson\u2019s 1844 letter in which he states John is living on the Yazoo River in MS, there are 7 counties through which the Yazoo flows: Leflore, Holmes, Humphreys, Yazoo, Sharkey, Issaquena, Warren; these counties need to be searched.\n\nMary and John\u2019s daughter Mary and her husband Samuel Weeks named a son \u201cSimpson Brooks Weeks.\u201d Could this somehow tie in with her uncle, Simpson B Flanagan; he seems to have been quite kind to John and his family. And was Simpson B Flanagan\u2019s middle name Brooks?\n\nThe 28 Oct 1850 probate record: This heir mentioned in the singular must be the infant George Williams mentioned in the same court entry, whose guardian is Alexander McKinney, and who was probably not previously recorded in Mary\u2019s estate records. The suit brought by Robison implies multiple heirs (Mary A Williams admr vs. Heirs of Mary A Williams), so it is certain that other children have been recorded.\n\nNone of the deed indexes are available online, and almost none of the probate records for Limestone Co have been indexed, so page-by-page review is required. A probate book covering 1854-1856 that is key to this research is lost, per the Limestone Co AL Archives website. I have not finished paging through the probate records that still exist and hope to find additional information about Mary\u2019s estate.\n\nThe inventory and sales records for Mary\u2019s estate do not exist in the county court\u2019s collection of records. In fact, there are no record books at Limestone Co for inventories and sales of any kind, unless they are contained in an estate file \u2013 but estate files prior to 1865 do not exist, at least online. Limestone Co had a destructive courthouse fire in 1862, per familysearch.org wiki.\n\nWhat happened to George Williams, infant of Mary and her unknown husband Williams?\n\nStating the obvious, the probate records for Mary Williams in Limestone County AL are problematic in that we also find Daniel W Flanagan living with Mary Northum (remember Mary Williams married William Northum in Franklin Co AR in 1856) in Franklin Co AR in 1860 and 1870. Did she die, or just desert? The records of land sale by William Robinson (estate administrator) matches the land patented by Mary Williams in 1848. But is this deceased Mary Williams the same Mary who was the mother of John Y, Mary E, Thomas W and Daniel W? Because the probate files don\u2019t exist, it may be next to impossible to find out. I have always wondered how young Daniel would have ended up all the way out in Arkansas at such a young age, on his own. Finding the marriage record for William Northum and Mary Williams was an \u201caha\u201d moment, but it doesn\u2019t resolve the conflict with the probate records in Limestone County. Remember, none of the Limestone probate records name heirs except for one George Williams."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=William_J._Flanagan_Jr.", "page_content": "American admiral\n\nAdmiral William John Flanagan Jr. (born March 27, 1943) is a retired United States Navy four star admiral who served as Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet from 1994 to 1996.[1][2]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nFlanagan was born in 1943[3] in Jesup, Georgia.[4] In addition to his bachelor's degree in marine transportation, Flanagan received a Master of Arts degree in political science from the American University in 1974 and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1980.[3][5]\n\nNaval career [ edit ]\n\nFlanagan graduated from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in marine transportation and an ensign's commission in the Naval Reserve, joining the Merchant Marine and working for American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines out of New York, where he achieved the grade of second mate.

Flanagan\u2019s more than 60 years of leadership and educational research leave an invaluable legacy to behavioral scientists, especially to those who work in organized settings. He laid plans for and successfully carried out several projects of unprecedented magnitude, often employing newly developed methodology and always aimed directly at the improvement of human performance. His careful planning and continuing insistence on quality performance. His careful planning and continuing insistence on quality performance both of himself and his staff resulted in many usable products and provided excellent training for young researchers.\n\nJohn was born on January 7, 1906, into what became a family of six children. His mother was a teacher and his father a clergyman whose liberal views did not suit conservative congregations which he severed, so the family relocated often.\n\nAn early demonstration of John\u2019s powers of persuasion, fueled with his passion to play football, enabled him to get his parents\u2019 approval to stay out of school a year in the hops of growing enough during his senior year to make this high school team. During his freshman year in the School of Engineering at the University of Washington, he made his numerals on the freshman team. Because electrical engineering labs conflicted with football practice, John transferred to the School of Education, majoring in physics and minoring in math. His athletic ambition was finally realized as starting quarterback on the Washington varsity in his senior year.\n\nAfter receiving his BS degree in 1929, he coached a high school football team and taught math. Nourishing his growing interest in measurement, John attended a seminar at Yale during the summer of 1931, led by prominent figures such as E.L. Thorndike and Truman L. Kelley. On return to Seattle, his MA was awarded in 1932 followed by an offer of an assistantship at Harvard from Kelley, under whom he received his PhD in mental measurement in 1934. John got ajob at the Cooperative Test Service and also worked on a project for the Army Air Corps. As an interviewer on this project, John hired an Air Corps Captain on leave at the time. As OUr entry into the war seemed imminent, the Air Corps began to expand rapidly. John\u2019s former employee, Captain Griffiss, was promoted to major and made head of the research division in the Air Force\u2019s Medical Corps. He recommended Flanagan as the \u201cpractical psychologist\u201d the Air Corps needed to develop a new program of selection and classification that would identify trainees capable of learning to fly. John went on active duty on July 15, 1941, assembled a staff, and directed theAviation Psychology program throughout World War II. After the war, five members of his staff later became presidents of the American Psychological Association.\n\nThroughout the program, Colonel Flanagan insisted on careful and comprehensive validation of tests in the classification battery before introduction to the current battery. Most validation used the immediately available criterion: success in training. While such validation studies were routinely made, John himself sought measurable criteria of performance in combat as the ultimate criterion. For this purpose he was allowed to fly several missions over Europe with crews of the Eighth Air Force. Another critical validation effort was made when 1,000 trainees were given the full battery of tests, the scores of which were kept in confidence until the project was over. A clear relationship between \u201cstanine\u201d composite scores and subsequent performance emerged.\n\nThe research under Flanagan\u2019s direction spanned almost the full range of psychology. After the war, a total of 19 volumes documenting the program\u2019s work were printed and distributed by the Government Printing Office, providing a rich source of information on this, the largest psychological program undertaken up to that time.\n\nThe success of the Aviation Psychology Program led directly to Flanagan\u2019s founding of the American Institutes for Research (AJR) in 1946. He did so with the encouragement and assistance of the University of Pittsburgh, where he had accepted a professorship. He purposefully created AJR as a not-for-profit organization to assure that \u201c\u2026 its institutional objectives would not be complicated with the incentive for personal profits.\u201d His objectives were \u201c\u2026 to contribute to the science of human behavior and the fuller development and utilization of mankind\u2019s capacities and potential.\u201d The hallmark of his career was the ability to make ambitious plans and carry them out successfully.\n\nThe major expansion of air travel immediately following World War IT created a recruiting problem for the airlines. John responded by modifying the procedures used for the Army Air Force to reflect the requirements of the civilian sector and the new aircraft. For more than 20 years afterward, practically all of the major airlines relied on AIR to supply the data essential for the selection of pilots, copilots, and flight engineers.\n\nBeginning in 1915, the National Board of Medical Examiners in Philadelphia had administered, examined to be used in certifying doctors as being qualified to practice medicine. National Board tests were typically administered after the second and fourth years of the medical education program, and a third examination, Part III, was administered after the completion of the first year of residency. In 1959 the Part III examination was based on the observation of each candidate\u2019s performance in examining real patients in hospital settings from coast to coast. The National Board has become dismayed with this test\u2019s unreliability and turned to AIR for assistance. AIR quickly discovered that there was no precise definition of clinical competence and set out to create one by visiting hospitals and gathering from senior physicians several thousand reports of effective and ineffective medical practice, using Flanagan\u2019s critical incident technique. AIR developed specifications for a new test relating test situations to the definition of competence. The National Board has used this model for the development of new Part III examinations since 1960.\n\nIn the 1960s, colonialism ended throughout Africa. The new nations had only a few individuals with education sufficient to meet the needs of an independent nation. The United States Agency for International Development established a large number of technical training institutes, but unfortunately, the Agency found that the performance of those selected for training was unsatisfactory. AIR was awarded a contract to solve the problem. The task was to identify- among those individuals who had grown up in a bush environment and could not read or write in any language- those who had the potential to become skilled technicians and possibly climb the ladder to a variety of advanced degrees. AIR\u2019s program was successfully implemented in 19 developing countries.\n\nIn 1960 Flanagan initiated Project Talent, a massive survey of more than 400,000 high school students throughout the United States. To follow up on the needs revealed by project Talent, Flanagan developed Project PLAN-Program for Learning in Accordance with Needs, an entire curriculum from grades one through 12 designed to meet the individual needs of all students. This was one of the earliest and most comprehensive individualized computer-assisted learning programs.\n\nFollowing the PLAN project, Flanagan and his staff used his critical incident method to develop a \u201cQuality of Life\u201d scale that is still used in current research. In fact, the critical incident method has been used be researchers all over the world as a way of getting a sound start on new areas of research.\n\nAmong the honors Flanagan received were: Legion of Merit by the Army Air Corps, Raymond F. Longacre Award of the Aero-Medical Association, Edward Lee Thorndike Award of the APA Division of Educational Psychology, 1976 Distinguished Professional Contribution Award of APA, Phi Delta Kappa Award for Outstanding Contributions to Education, Development and Research, ETS Award for Distinguished Service to Measurement; Professional Practice Award of APA\u2019s Division of Industrial/Organizational Psychology.\n\nJohn Flanagan met the objectives he stated, not only in AIR but in his personal life. He made substantial contributions to the science of human behavior and together with the talented staff he attracted to AIR, he improved the functioning of social institutions so that they could better help individuals achieve their personal goals as well as contribute to society."}, {"url": "http://everything.explained.today/William_J._Flanagan%2c_Jr./", "page_content": "William J.
