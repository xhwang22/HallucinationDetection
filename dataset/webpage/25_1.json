It\u2019s a remarkably compelling genre that\u2019s sparked a renewal of interest in Nordic culture. Today, in Nordic countries like Iceland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, artists are tapping into the dark roots of the Nordic traditions that fueled this aesthetic, and melding that with the streamlined modernism of 21st century Scandinavia. The ancient ballads are coming to life again, infused with a contemporary sense of style and fashion. Here are seven artists whose Nordic noir music will bring a cold shiver to your spine.\n\n1. Steind\u00f3r Andersen & Hilmar \u00d6rn Hilmarsson\n\nThe tradition of r\u00edmur, or rhyming ballads, goes back many centuries, even millennia in Iceland, tapping into the deep Norse pagan roots of the country. Even when the church raged against these ancient ballads and their ties to the Norse gods and heroes, the Icelandic people held strong, and passed the r\u00edmur down in the oral tradition within their families and among friends. Steind\u00f3r Andersen is one of the great r\u00edmur singers today, and dipping in the pop world, has notably collaborated with Icelandic indie stars Sigur R\u00f3s. One of his most accessible albums was made in collaboration with musician and composer Hilmar \u00d6rn Hilmarsson, who\u2019s also the high priest of the \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 (the \u00c1satr\u00fa fellowship). The modern incarnation of the Norse pagan religion, the \u00c1satr\u00fa fellowship dates back to the \u201870s, but traces its roots to the furthest reaches of pagan history both in Scandinavia and abroad. On the album, Stafnb\u00fai, Andersen sings some of his favorite old poetry, accompanied by the atmospheric and evocative compositional beds of Hilmarsson. Here, they interpret the poem \u201cHaustid n\u00e1lgast,\u201d written by 19th century Icelandic poet Stef\u00e1n fr\u00e1 Hv\u00edtadal. Though not an ancient source, the poem speaks to our natural world and living in harmony with it, a pagan principle of living that has survived since the old days in Iceland. Here is a tanslated excerpt:\n\nSeek solace in the heavens you that cried,\n\nthe stars that shimmer are the rays of God\n\nin the wintery night.\n\n2. Torgeir Vassvik & Frikar\n\nOne of the most fascinating forms of Nordic music is the Sami joik. An improvised song akin to throat singing, it\u2019s the hallmark of the Sami people, an indigenous, often nomadic people that live in the northern reaches of the regions. In a land of extremes, the raw-throated sounds of the joik stand out as perhaps a tie to the windswept vistas of the Arctic. Born in the far North of Norway, Torgeir Vassvik is one of the most intriguing Sami singers, and an innovative collaborator. He\u2019s been touring recently with Norwegian hallingdans master and modern dancer Hallgrim Hanseg\u00e5rd as Frikar. With Frikar, Vassvik\u2019s innovative joik singing mixes with Hanseg\u00e5rd\u2019s athletic dance interpretations, much of which is based on the Norwegian hallingdans tradition in which dancers spin, twirl, and launch themselves to dizzying heights. Frikar\u2019s an interesting fusion project, and there\u2019s no denying the raw electricity of their performance together.\n\nIn this video Vassvik taps into the shamanism of Sami culture. The \u201cwolf joik,\u201d a song that was used in the olden days to frighten wolves away from the herds of reindeer that the Sami, was sung for survival and sustenance. Throat singing, whether done with overtones or without, is a common feature of the indigenous cultures of the Arctic, spreading all along the roof of the world.\n\n3. Eiv\u00f8r\n\nHailing from the desolately beautiful Faroe Islands, singer and songwriter Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir has become something of a pop phenomenon in Europe and Scandinavia. Soon she should be breaking into American households with her involvement in the upcoming God of War videogame (she sings the main theme and the new installment of the game is set amidst Norse mythology). But throughout her rise, she\u2019s stayed true to her roots in the Faroe Islands and to her love of Faroese culture. The Faroe Islands lie in the ocean between Norway and Iceland, but are a self-governed part of Denmark. A land of rugged beauty, the Faroe Islands also play host to cultural events like the seaside G! Festival. The traditions of the Faroe Islands focus on songs and ballads, often sung for dancers. Eiv\u00f8r grew up with ties to Faroese folk music, but also ties to classical singing. She often writes in English or Danish, but her 2015 album Sl\u00f8r was made up mostly of songs written by her in the Faroese language. The song featured here, \u201cSalt,\u201d was written by the renowned Faroese poet Marjun Syderb\u00f8 Kj\u00e6lnes. You can hear Eiv\u00f8r\u2019s signature blend of dark electronic beats with ethereal Scandinavian vocals here.\n\n4. Hamradun\n\nPortraying perhaps a darker image of the Faroe Islands, the new folk rock band Hamradun was founded by the lead singer of the Faroese heavy metal band T\u00fdr. Known for their own particular brand of Viking metal, T\u00fdr are influenced by Norse mythology and heavy metal, but also by Faroese folk song. Hamradun was founded by T\u00fdr\u2019s singer P\u00f3l Arni Holm to explore this heritage in a bit more depth, and without some of the more extreme trappings of his metal roots. Here, they\u2019re interpreting the poem of 18th century Norwegian poet Edvard Storm. \u201cSinklars V\u00edsa\u201d depicts the somewhat obscure Battle of Kringen from 1612, in which Scottish mercenaries conscripted by the Swedish military (and Scottish pirates) were waylaid and massacred by Norwegian/Danish forces. This song is typically sung to round dancing on the Faroe Islands, an ancient tradition of danced ballads (you can hear the traditional version that\u2019s often danced here).\n\n5. Jullie Hjetland & Basco\n\nThe subjects of the old Nordic ballads were often quite dark. Take the traditional Danish ballad \u201cLiden Karen.\u201d Influenced by the moralism of Nordic Christianity, \u201cLiden Karen\u201d (Little Karen) tells the story of a young woman so beautiful that the king comes to desire her. She tells him repeatedly to stay away, since he is already married. He offers her gold, but she doesn\u2019t want his love. He rapes her and throws her in jail, but she doesn\u2019t give in. She gives birth to her son in jail and finally the king takes her and her son to a bed with silk blankets and pillows, but she still refuses his love.\n\nI first heard this song from Danish singer Jullie Hjetland and the band Basco at the Folk Spot Denmark conference in T\u00f8nder. Hjetland has long been a shining light of the Danish Nordic roots scene, and has recently been recording folk-influenced electronic music as part of her project Lukkif. Born on the island of Funen in Denmark, she\u2019s recorded in eight different Nordic languages. High-energy Danish roots band Basco is the perfect foil to her huge vocal range here, as she channels the ancient fury of Liden Karen.\n\n6. Anne Hytte\n\nA key element to the Nordic noir sound comes from the long, droning swirls of the Norwegian hardanger fiddle. A four-string violin with an additional four strings underneath that resonate in sympathy with the main strings, the hardanger fiddle, or hardangfele, was immortalized in the opening bars of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg\u2019s Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, where the four notes that mark the dawn of day are the same four notes that the hardangfele\u2019s sympathetic strings are tuned to. Norwegian fiddler Anne Hytte is one of the best young hardangfele players, and her work has dived much deeper into the tradition than most. She\u2019s brought up the old tunings of the hardangfele which used to have names based on colors like \u201clight blue,\u201d \u201cgrey lightening,\u201d \u201chalf grey,\u201d etc, and ties to certain times of the day that were best for playing. With her new work Draumsyn, she touches on the minimalism of medieval monophony or modern classical chamber music, drawing the drones and timbres of the hardangfele into new territories. Here\u2019s her stark interpretation of \u201cA Rune Tune.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://popularbio.com/siri-stenberg/", "page_content": "Updated On April 30, 2023\n\nSiri\u00f0 Stenberg estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
