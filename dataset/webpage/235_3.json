{"Billy Burke won the PGA Championship in 1938 at the Pomonok Country Club in Flushing, New York.": [{"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2020/01/billy-burke-golfer.html", "page_content": "Billy Burke was a PGA Tour winner from the 1920s into the 1940s. He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/golfs-forgotten-major-winners-80671", "page_content": "Today\u2019s top golf professionals are among the most highly paid sportspeople in the world. They enjoy global fame and a worldwide following. Hundreds of millions of people watch each of the game\u2019s four Major men's tournaments and the winners of these most prestigious events become household names. Golf fans would recognise tens, if not hundreds, of current professional players and, even non-golfing sports fans would be able to recall a decent number.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the case and there are many great golfing champions who have been consigned to the dustbin of history.\n\nNow, winning a single Major championship is enough to set a player up for life, whereas in days gone by it might have earned them a few hundred pounds and a pat on the back at their local club.\n\nBelow we take a look at the fascinating stories of some of those Major champions whose achievements have been forgotten, or perhaps disregarded, by all but the most enthusiastic golf statisticians.\n\nRalph Guldahl (1911 \u2013 1987)\n\nRalph Guldahl (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBorn the year before Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, Ralph Guldahl\u2019s playing career peaked and troughed twice before either of those golfing legends reached their prime. The Texan turned pro in 1931 and quickly won the Santa Monica Open; he took the Arizona Open title the following season. In the 1933 US Open, the 6 foot 2 inch 21-year-old made up nine shots on Johnny Goodman in just 11 holes at the end of the final round. Guldahl faced a four-foot putt on the last green to force a playoff. He missed and effectively gave up competitive golf for three years, returning to his home in Dallas and becoming a used car salesman. But he took up the game again in 1936 and, between 1937 and 1939 Guldahl was arguably the best player in the world. He was second in the 1937 Masters before winning the US Open at Oakland Hills by two shots. He was second again in the 1938 Masters and successfully defended his US Open title, winning this time by six strokes at Cherry Hills. In 1939 he finally got his victory at Augusta and claimed three further titles that season.\n\nFor that brief spell, Guldahl was at the very pinnacle of the sport. But from 1940 onwards he lost his game and he quit tournament golf. He played his last US Open in 1949.\n\nMany believed his involvement in the writing of an instructional book was the reason for his golfing collapse \u2013 it caused him to over-analyse his game. Guldahl put it down to a lack of competitive drive and weariness because of the travelling.\n\nHe became a teaching professional at Braemar Country Club in California in 1959 where he worked until his death in 1987. Among many others, one of his students at Braemar was eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.\n\nJack Fleck (1921 \u2013 2014)\n\nJack Fleck - 1955 US Open champion\n\nWith Ben Hogan safely in the clubhouse two clear of little-fancied Jack Fleck, almost everyone had given \u201cThe Hawk,\u201d the 1955 US Open title. NBC television finished their coverage before Fleck had completed his round, ending with a shot of Gene Sarazen congratulating Hogan on another US Open title.\n\nBut Fleck still had four to play. He birdied the 15th and 18th holes to fire a 67 and tie Hogan at the top. The following day, Fleck beat the great champion in an 18-hole playoff.\n\nFor many years after Fleck\u2019s surprise victory at Olympic Club, his triumph was dismissed as a fluke. He was portrayed as a club pro or journeyman, a one-hit-wonder. It\u2019s true he didn\u2019t exactly become a world-beater, but he won twice more on the PGA Tour, recorded 41 top-10s on the circuit and made the cut in 261 of the 271 tournaments he entered.\n\nThe truth is Fleck was not the man the vast majority of golf fans wanted to win at Olympic Club. His triumph over Hogan could be compared to Stewart Cink\u2019s playoff victory over Tom Watson at Turnberry in 2009: The golfing public longed for a different result.\n\nAt the presentation ceremony in 1955, Hogan announced he was, \u201cthrough with competitive golf.\u201d Many of those watching began crying. Even Fleck\u2019s own son said to him, \u201cI rooted for you dad but I was sorry Hogan lost.\u201d\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t until recently, and particularly with the US Open returning to Olympic Club in 2012, that Fleck\u2019s achievement was more fully appreciated.\n\nFleck drove for 49 hours from his home in Iowa to San Francisco in June 1955. He opened his US Open campaign with a 76, nine shots worse than leader Tommy Bolt.\n\nBut he bounced back with a 69 to be in contention with two rounds to play. His closing 67 was one of the great Major rounds and his playoff win over the world\u2019s best player was a phenomenal display of ability and self-belief.\n\nDick Burton (1907 \u2013 1974)\n\nDick Burton (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nRichard \u201cDick\u201d Burton held the title of Open Champion longer than any man in the history of the tournament. He lifted the Claret Jug at St Andrews in 1939 and the competition was not held again until 1946, after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nWhen sending his application to the R&A in 1946, he included a short letter - \u201cDear Sirs, Please find enclosed my fee of five guineas for this year\u2019s Open. I will bring the trophy back when I come.\u201d\n\nBurton was no flash in the pan. Club professional at Ellesmere Port (then called Hooton) Golf Club and latterly Sale Golf Club, he won his first title at the 1934 Northern Professional Championship. He won seven professional tournaments and played three times in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBut his Open victory in the home of golf was his finest moment. Needing to shoot 72 in the final round to win, Burton birdied the 18th to beat Johnny Bulla by two strokes. Just a few weeks later war broke out and Burton enlisted in the RAF.\n\nIn later life, Burton was asked if he felt regret at not being able to take advantage of his Open triumph.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough,\u201d he replied. \u201cA lot of those who watched me at St Andrews also went off to war and they never came back. Some of my friends didn\u2019t make it either, I did.\u201d\n\nLionel Hebert (1928 \u2013 2000)\n\nLionel Hebert (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs a young adult, Lionel Hebert had to make a decision whether to be a golfer or a musician. He was an excellent trumpet player and had gone to Louisiana State University to study music.\n\nBut, following in his brother Jay\u2019s footsteps, Lionel decided to embark on a career as a pro golfer.\n\nThe Heberts (pronounced A-bear) were Cajuns \u2013 an ethnic group found mainly in Louisiana, descended from French speaking Acadians (now a part of Canada.)\n\nLionel and Jay are the only brothers to have won the USPGA Championship. Lionel was the last match-play winner in 1957, while Jay took the title in stroke-play format in 1960.\n\nLionel played an incredible 580 events on the PGA Tour and senior tour. He was twice chairman of the PGA tournament committee and a founding member of the senior tour. But he never travelled to play in the Open championship as he maintained the trip was, \u201ctoo pricey.\u201d\n\nHerman Keiser (1914 \u2013 2003)\n\nHerman Keiser (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe 1946 Masters marked the re-start of significant professional golf following the Second World War. The stars of the day had gathered and the Augusta patrons anticipated a great battle between Hogan, Snead and Nelson.\n\nBut, after three rounds it was a relatively unknown pro from Missouri \u2013 Herman Keiser \u2013 who held a five-shot lead.\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe Missouri Mortician\u201d for the somber expression he wore on the golf course, Keiser had served 31 months at sea during the war, aboard the U.S.S Cincinnati.\n\nHogan caught Keiser with one hole to play at Augusta but \u201dThe Hawk\u201d three-putted the final green and Keiser was the champion.\n\nKeiser played in the Ryder Cup of 1947 when the US won by 11-1. That one point for Britain came courtesy of Keiser\u2019s singles defeat by Sam King. \u201cThe Mortician\u201d quit competitive golf in the mid 1950s and bought a driving range in Ohio.\n\nAndy North (born 1950)\n\nAndy North - Twice US Open champion\n\nBest known to golf fans as a television commentator, Andy North won three events on the PGA Tour. There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about that, except two of those titles were the US Open.\n\nNorth had won the 1977 Westchester Classic, but coming into the 1978 US Open at Cherry Hills he could have been fairly described as a good journeyman. He wasn\u2019t considered a contender, but he outlasted Nicklaus, Watson, Miller and Player to win by a stroke.\n\nHe disappeared off the golfing radar again through the early 80s, recording just nine top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour between 1979 and 1984. But he reappeared in 1985 to win the US Open again, this time at Oakland Hills. After 1985, North recorded just three more top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.\n\nBilly Burke (1902 \u2013 1972)\n\nBilly Burke - 1931 US Open champion\n\nBilly Burke\u2019s victory in the 1931 US Open was notable for two reasons: He was the first Major champion to use steel-shafted clubs and his triumph came after the longest playoff in Major history.\n\nAfter four rounds at the Inverness Golf Club in Toledo, Burke was tied at the top of the leaderboard with George Von Elm. They returned for a 36-hole playoff the following day and were still tied after that. Another 36-hole playoff ensued and, this time Burke won by one \u2013 144 holes and 589 strokes, compared to Von Elm\u2019s 590.\n\nHaving lost a finger working in a foundry as a teenager, Burke used an unorthodox grip with considerable success. He recorded 80 top-10 finishes during his PGA Tour career. The son of Polish immigrants, Burke (born Burkowski) played in the Ryder Cups of 1931 and 33 and was undefeated.\n\nOther Forgotten Major Winners\n\nThe forgotten Major winners talked about above were just some of those considered in the research for this piece. There are numerous others, and too many to cover in detail.\n\nFor example, Walter Burkemo, the 1953 USPGA champion. He had only one other PGA Tour win during his career and quit the tour in 1954 to go back to life as a club pro.\n\nDick Mayer won the 1957 US Open, and was PGA Tour player of the year. But he battled with alcoholism and it\u2019s generally viewed this prevented him winning more. He died aged 64.\n\nDick Mayer - 1957 US Open champion\n\nAccording to Sam Snead and Ben Hogan, 1950 USPGA champion Chandler Harper was the best putter in the world. He was a great friend of Bobby Jones and, in later life, became a mentor to Curtis Strange.\n\nHow about back-to-back English winners of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1936 \u2013 Alf Perry and Alf Padgham? Perry\u2019s best Open finish was a tie for 17th prior to winning at Muirfield in 1935 while Padgham, having left his clubs in the Hoylake pro-shop overnight, had to break a window to retrieve them in time for his third round in 1936.\n\nAlf Perry - 1935 Open Champion\n\nAll these men earned some sort of fame from golf, no matter how briefly. But none were rewarded financially to anywhere near the extent of today\u2019s Major winners whose lives are changed for good by the endorsements and invitations that flow in. So when the green jacket is presented next April, spare a thought for Ralph Guldahl. When the Claret Jug is lofted at Royal Troon, consider Dick Burton and the two Alfs.\n\nThese great old warriors make up an important part of golf\u2019s rich tapestry, it\u2019s just the patch they occupy has become a touch faded."}, {"url": "https://www.pga.com/archive/events/pgachampionship/past-pga-championship-sites", "page_content": "The Black Course at Bethpage State Park will become the latest course to host the PGA Championship when the world's greatest players compete for the Wanamaker Trophy in May 2019.\n\nHere are the courses that have played host to the PGA Championship since its inception in 1916.\n\nPGA Championship sites from 1916 to 2019\n\n1916 -

This large public housing development in South Flushing was built in 1949 on the former site of Pomonok Country Club. Pomonok is considered to be in the South Flushing section of Queens. The name comes from a Native American word for eastern Long Island, and means either \u201cland of tribute\u201d or \u201cland where there is travelling by water\u201d.\n\nLater, there was the Pomonok Country Club, a golf course in Pomonok between 1886 and 1949. The golf course was located between Kissena Boulevard and 164th Street, just to the south of Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) and to the east of Queens College. The club was established in 1886 by members of the Flushing Athletic Club in Flushing and moved to the Kissena Boulevard location in 1921. Devereux Emmet designed the golf course. The members disbanded and sold the course in 1949. Part of the site today contains the Electchester cooperative housing development, Pomonok public housing and an extension of Parsons Boulevard. The golf course hosted the PGA Championship in 1939, which Henry Picard won. The tournament was held at the same time of the 1939 New York World\u2019s Fair, which was located at Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park, approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) miles northwest of Pomonok Country Club.\n\nToday, Pomonok is a part of Queens Community Board 8, which also includes Fresh Meadows, South Flushing, Cunningham Heights, Hilltop Village, Jamaica Estates, Holliswood, Utopia, Kew Gardens Hills, and Briarwood. Nearby are major facilities such as Queens College, St. John\u2019s University, Touro College, Rabbinical Seminary of America, Queens Hospital Center, New York Hospital Queens, Cunningham Park and many public and private schools. CUNY Law School, formerly in this area, moved to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens in May 2012. Queens Library has a branch in Pomonok. New York City Bus routes Q25, Q34, Q64, and Q65 serve Pomonok. The QM4 runs express from Pomonok to Midtown.The Whitestone Expressway connects Flushing north to the Bronx, south to the Van Wyck Expressway to John F. Kennedy International Airport, and to the Grand Central Parkway and LaGuardia Airport.

It remains as remarkable a tale today as it was 81 years ago.\n\nBurke -- born Burkowski -- was the son of a Polish immigrant blue-collar worker. He fell in love with golf when, as a frail 12-year-old, he caddied for the first time at Naugatuck Golf Club.\n\nHis teenage years were spent lugging bags for club members. When the rounds were finished, Burke would ask to borrow members' clubs so he could practice. At 16, playing in a driving rain, he won the club championship.\n\nUpon graduating Naugatuck High, he worked at a rubber factory and later the iron foundry, practicing his golf game when the 5 p.m. whistle blew. A foundry accident cost him two fingers on his left hand, leaving Burke with an awkward swing. Still, his golf game thrived. By 1923, he was the Connecticut amateur champion.\n\nIt all led to his historic victory at the '31 Open, held at the Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio. If a scorching heat wave wasn't enough -- temperatures exceeded 100 degrees that week -- Burke had to endure a marathon playoff with George Von Elm.\n\nThe two were tied after four rounds. Playoff rules at the time required another 36 holes. Still deadlocked, officials called for an additional 36 holes. Burke burned through 32 cigars over the grueling 144 holes, but wound up winning by a single stroke to earn the grand prize -- a whopping $1,000.\n\nRules were quickly changed to avoid a similar playoff marathon. Burke, hailed as the next Bobby Jones, returned to Naugatuck a conquering hero. He was a semifinalist at the PGA Championship later that year. But he never won another major, placing third at the Masters twice (1934 and '39) and had two more top 10 finishes at the U.S. Open. He retired with 17 tour victories and played on a pair of Ryder Cup teams.\n\nBurke died in Clearwater, Fla., at age 69 in 1972."}, {"url": "https://www.pga.com/archive/events/pgachampionship/pga-championships-51-most-historic-moments", "page_content": "1916-1957 \u2013 Match-Play Era\n\n1916 - A Grand Tradition unfolds\n\nSiwanoy Country Club \u2014 Bronxville, New York\n\nThe PGA Championship was christened at 9 a.m., October 10, 1916, at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York. Tom Kerrigan, Siwanoy\u2019s host professional, stepped to the tee and split the fairway with his drive. Kerrigan\u2019s opponent in the 36-hole match-play format event was Charles Adams of Santa Barbara, Calif. Even though Adams was skilled in his long game, he suffered on the greens. Kerrigan triumphed on familiar turf, winning 6 and 4. Kerrigan went on to fall to \u201cLong Jim\u201d Barnes, a native of Cornwall, England, and resident of Philadelphia, 3 and 1, in the quarterfinals. Barnes then met Jock Hutchison Sr., a native of St. Andrews, Scotland, in the finals. The match went the distance, coming down to a pair of five-foot putts on the par-4, 36th hole. After a measurement, it was decided Hutchison was away. He missed his putt, and Barnes coolly rapped his home for a 1-up victory, becoming the first to have his name engraved on the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy.\n\n1920 - From Alternate to Champion\n\nFlossmoor Country Club \u2014 Chicago, Illinois\n\nToday\u2019s golf fan remembers John Daly\u2019s improbable tale of being the ninth alternate for a PGA Championship berth, and going on to victory. Daly isn\u2019t the only late-hour addition to become PGA Champion. Jock Hutchison Sr. of Glenview, Illinois, got the honor after George Fotheringham \u2014 a PGA Charter Member and the first chair of the PGA Annual Meeting \u2014 and Arthur Clarkson were unable to attend. Hutchison, who failed initially in sectional qualifying, was a terror in the four matches he played before the finals. He defeated Eddie Loos and Laurie Ayton by identical 5 and 3 scores; Louis Tellier, 6 and 5; and downed Harry Hampton in the semifinals, 4 and 3. Hutchison then had a battle, escaping Douglas Edgar with a 1-up decision in the 36-hole finale.\n\n1923 - Hagen vs. Sarazen \u2014 Golf\u2019s greatest match?\n\nPelham Golf Club \u2014 Pelham Manor, New York\n\nGene Sarazen and Walter Hagen \u2014 believed by many the two finest golfers of their era \u2014 squared off in the finals of the PGA Championship. The match lived up to pre-Championship hype, with Sarazen defeating Hagen in the first extra-hole finale in Championship history. The match was even after 18 holes before Sarazen grabbed a three-hole lead in the afternoon. Hagen birdied the 29th hole to trim the deficit to two holes, and won the 34th and 35th to square the match. The two players halved the 36th hole with pars. Sarazen almost succumbed on the 37th hole, driving into deep rough, just a couple of feet from the out-of-bounds barrier. With a small crowd gathered around him, Sarazen was heard telling the audience, \u201cI\u2019ll put this one up so close to the hole that it will break Walter\u2019s heart.\u201d Sarazen followed with a brilliant recovery shot, with his ball coming to rest two feet from the flagstick. Hagen dumped his approach into a greenside bunker, but almost holed his bunker approach. Sarazen closed the drama by sinking his birdie putt. Sarazen and Hagen landed in the PGA record book, ranking 1-2 for most holes played in one Championship. Sarazen went 194 holes to Hagen\u2019s 188.\n\n1927 \u2013 \u2018Pick It Up\u2019\n\nCedar Crest Country Club \u2014 Dallas, Texas\n\nWalter Hagen not only played golf at its highest level, but he also mastered the art of gamesmanship. Perhaps the most vivid example of Hagen\u2019s ability to rattle an opponent was in a semifinal match against Chicagoan Al Espinosa. On the 36th hole, a 313-yard par-4 at Cedar Crest Country Club, Espinosa landed his approach 25 feet from the cup, while Hagen sailed his approach over the green. Hagen then chipped to within a foot of the cup and was conceded the par putt. Throughout the match, Hagen had conceded any putt by his opponent within three feet. Espinosa, who had taken a 1-up lead on the 35th hole, stroked his birdie attempt three feet short of the cup and looked to Hagen, who smiled and then turned his back to chat with the gallery. Espinosa then missed the match-winning putt. The match ended one hole later, when a shaken Espinosa three-putted. Hagen went on to defeat Joe Turnesa of Elmsford, New York, in the finals, 1-up. Again, Hagen followed his strategy of conceding all putts within three feet. He stopped conceding short putts at the 30th hole. Turnesa, who had no practice on the greens throughout the round, missed short putts the final six holes. Turnesa\u2019s short par putt on the 36th hole rolled up and hung on the lip of the cup. It was Hagen\u2019s fourth consecutive and fifth overall PGA Championship.\n\n1928 - The streak comes to an end\n\nFive Farms Country Club \u2014 Baltimore, Maryland\n\nLeo Diegel was determined not to go 0-3 against five-time champion Walter Hagen, who had built a 22-match victory streak in the PGA Championship. Diegel started strong against Hagen in the quarterfinals, building a five-hole advantage. Hagen battled back, trimming the deficit to two holes after the morning 18-hole round. In the afternoon, Hagen lost another hole on the outgoing nine and rallied coming home to be one down with two holes remaining. Both players hit the par-3 green, with Diegel putting first and making a 15-foot birdie putt. Hagen missed from 12 feet, thus ending the longest reign of any professional in PGA Championship history. The big victory was all Diegel needed to roll to the Championship. Diegel routed former champion Gene Sarazen, 9 and 8, in the semifinals. He then built a four-hole advantage on Al Espinosa in the finals after 18 holes and cruised to a 6 and 5 decision. Following Diegel\u2019s victory, PGA of America officials asked Hagen to produce the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy to present to the new Champion. Hagen, all smiles, apologized that the Trophy was lost. Hagen said he left it in the care of a taxi driver to return to a hotel following the 1926 Championship. However, in 1930, workmen were poring through old boxes in a Detroit warehouse and found a sealed leather case with the Wanamaker Trophy inside. The warehouse was owned by the Walter Hagen Golf Company.\n\n1930 - A match fit for Hollywood\n\nFresh Meadows County Club \u2014 Flushing, New York\n\nTommy Armour and Gene Sarazen, two great players battling for the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy, went down to their final putts to determine a Champion. Though Sarazen was playing on his home course, he could not grab a quick advantage. Neither player enjoyed a lead larger than two holes. Sarazen hooked his drive on the 18th hole, while Armour\u2019s drive found the fairway. Both players then dumped their approaches into a greenside bunker. Sarazen blasted his attempt 10 feet past the hole, and Armour exploded 12 feet from the flagstick. As Armour attempted to putt, he backed away after being disturbed by the whir of a photographer\u2019s camera. Armour positioned himself again and made the 12-footer. Sarazen, surprised by Armour\u2019s putt, hurriedly attempted his par attempt and missed. It was the final match between the two great players in Championship history. Armour became the third foreign-born player to win the PGA Championship.\n\n1931 - Praise for an unlikely Champion\n\nWannamoisett Country Club \u2014 Rumford, Rhode Island\n\nThe 14th PGA Championship had about everything. It had more than its share of upsets in the opening round, including Peter O\u2019Hara\u2019s 4 and 3 triumph over five-time champion Walter Hagen. The Championship was capped by 20-year-old Tom Creavy\u2019s gutsy victory over Denny Shute in the finals. Creavy, who defeated Gene Sarazen \u2014 the youngest PGA Champion of all time \u2014 in the semifinals, grabbed a 4-up lead over Shute with just six holes left. But Shute found new life when Creavy bogeyed the 31st hole. Though Shute hit his drive into a water hazard at the 32nd hole, the duo halved the hole. Shute then birdied the 33rd, and Creavy double-bogeyed the 34th. It appeared the resident of Albany, N.Y., was folding. But Shute bogeyed the following hole and Creavy\u2019s par closed the issue, 2 and 1. Creavy, the second youngest PGA Champion, would also be thrilled by some remarks after his round. The great Bobby Jones, a referee in the match, told the second-youngest PGA Champion, \u201cIt was one of the finest matches I think that was ever played.\u201d\n\n1936 - Hitting it right down the \u201cShute\u201d\n\nPinehurst (North Carolina) Resort - No. 2 Course\n\nThe only PGA Championship to be played in Pinehurst, North Carolina, resulted in the unveiling of a steady and soft-spoken champion \u2014 Denny Shute. Outdriven by as many as 60 yards on many holes, Shute relied upon his superb iron play and putting to defeat Jimmy Thomson 3 and 2. Both players had survived turnarounds in their semifinal matches to earn a finals berth. Thomson recovered from a poor start to beat Craig Wood 4 and 3. Shute edged Bill Mehlhorn, a member of the first U.S. Ryder Cup Team, 1-up. Mehlhorn birdied three holes in succession in the afternoon round and led 2-up with four holes to play. But the match was square after Mehlhorn missed four-foot par putts on the 33rd and 34th holes. Shute then missed a short par putt on the following hole and took advantage of another Mehlhorn bogey at the final hole to close the match. In the finals, Shute closed out Thomson with a spectacular second shot on the par-5 34th hole. Thomson missed his birdie attempt, and Shute knocked in the winning eagle putt.\n\n1937 \u2013 It\u2019s Shute Again\n\nPittsburgh Field Club \u2014 Aspinwall, Pennsylvania\n\nDefending PGA Champion Denny Shute, having outlasted U.S. Open Champion Tony Manero, 1-up, in the semifinals, faced Harold \u201cJug\u201d McSpaden in the finals. The duo battled 37 holes, the third extra-hole final match in PGA Championship history. Heading into the 36th hole, McSpaden got a break when his tee shot struck a spectator and bounced into the fairway instead of heavy rough. McSpaden took the cue and hit an approach four feet from the flagstick. Shute was 50 feet way with his second shot and putted about three feet short of the hole. As McSpaden took his stance, cameras grinded away. McSpaden stepped back and yelled, \u201cPlease give me the chance I\u2019ve been fighting for all week.\u201d Once quiet was restored, McSpaden missed his putt. On the first extra hole, which had been Shute\u2019s nemesis all week, McSpaden missed a 10-footer for par. Shute knocked home his winning four-footer, and became the fifth PGA Champion to win back-to-back Championships. It was a feat that would endure for 63 years before Tiger Woods\u2019 victory in 2000 in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n1938 - The most decisive victory\n\nShawnee Country Club \u2014 Shawnee-On-Delaware, Pennsylvania\n\nSam Snead had just come off one of the most impressive matches in PGA history in the semifinals, when he faced Paul Runyan for the Championship. Snead finished with four consecutive 3s on his scorecard in the semifinals to edge Jimmy Hines 1-up. Had the match been decided by stroke play, Hines would have defeated Snead by a stroke. Hines was eight under par. But Runyan was also in a zone of his own, walloping Snead, 8 and 7, to capture his second PGA Championship in five years. The decisive victory was a product of Runyan\u2019s prolific short game that produced a 67 in the morning 18-hole round and a 5-up lead. Runyan continued the momentum in the afternoon, making the turn in 1-under-par 35 and a seven-hole advantage. He won the 28th hole and halved with Snead at the 29th to close the match. Runyan finished 24-under-par for the 196 holes he played. He made only one bogey in his final 70 holes. Snead finished 147 holes of match-play 21-under-par.\n\n1942 - The \u2018Recruits\u2019 square off\n\nSeaview Country Club \u2014 Atlantic City, New Jersey\n\nArmy Corporal Jim Turnesa and U.S. Navy recruit Sam Snead, who was scheduled to report to duty a day later, met in the finals of the 25th PGA Championship. Turnesa, the underdog, had made a valiant march through the first four matches, defeating such impressive players as Harold \u201cJug\u201d McSpaden 1-up, Ben Hogan 2 and 1, and Byron Nelson 1-up in 37 holes. However, Turnesa went to lunch after the opening 18 holes, 3-up, but Snead fought back to square the match on the 27th hole. Turnesa appeared nervous, and Snead sensed this. \u201cI saw that he took more waggles than usual on his drive, and then he hooked it,\u201d Snead said. \u201cI knew he was getting tight, and then I had more confidence in myself.\u201d Turnesa bogeyed the 28th hole to fall one down, and was two behind with a bogey at the 30th hole. Snead closed the match by holing a 60-foot chip shot for a birdie, a 2 and 1 decision and his first major championship.\n\n1945 - Lord Byron\u2019s Streak Continues\n\nMoraine Country Club \u2013\u2013 Dayton, Ohio\n\nThe finals of the 1945 PGA Championship matched Byron Nelson against Sam Byrd, a former New York Yankees outfielder (1929-34). It was Nelson\u2019s fifth appearance in the finals, and during his historic 11-event victory streak. The evening before the Championship finals, Nelson confided to his wife, Louise, that the pressure of the entire season was affecting him. He had won seven consecutive tournaments before the Championship at Moraine Country Club. The pressure Nelson feared would set in was evident in the opening 18 holes of the 36-hole match. Byrd wrapped up the round with four straight birdies for a 2-up lead. When Byrd began the afternoon round with par, par, birdie, Nelson\u2019s chances looked dim. But Nelson recovered from the rugged start, winning the 22nd, 25th and 26th holes to square the match. He pulled ahead with a birdie on the 29th hole, and won the next three holes. Nelson sealed a 4 and 3 triumphs on the 33rd hole. Pressure may have been on Nelson\u2019s mind, but he registered impressive numbers, finishing 37-under-par for the 204 holes he played in the Championship. Byrd who had played in the 1931 World Series, finished 14-under-par in 197 holes. Neither player would ever again reach a PGA Championship match-play finals.\n\n1947 - A $100 insurance policy\n\nPlum Hollow Country Club \u2014 Detroit, Michigan\n\nFor the first time in a decade, the Championship finals didn\u2019t have a Hogan, Nelson or Snead on the roster. The lack of a legend didn\u2019t deter 7,000 spectators from the gate, which presented a problem for Jim Ferrier, a native of Sydney, Australia. He spent the evening planning his strategy in dealing with the crowd that would follow his opponent, Michigan\u2019s favorite son Chick Harbert. During this time, galleries weren\u2019t restrained by ropes, and Ferrier worried that the partisans would aid Harbert. Ferrier put his mind to rest by hiring two policemen for $100, putting one on each side of the fairway to guard against overzealous fans. In spite of his precautions, Ferrier didn\u2019t need the security. He defeated Harbert, 2 and 1. Afterward, Ferrier said, \u201cThat was the best $100 that I have ever spent.\u201d The key to Ferrier\u2019s victory was putting not security guards. He needed only 52 strokes on the greens in the 35-hole match, finishing 6-under-par. He was 27-under-par for the 243 holes he played that week. He became the fourth foreign-born PGA Champion.\n\n1948 - Hogan\u2019s Last Stand\n\nNorwood Hills Country Club \u2014 St. Louis, Missouri\n\nMike Turnesa was attempting to become the first from his family of outstanding golfers to win a major championship. In 1927, his brother Joe lost to Walter Hagen in the finals, and brother Jim was defeated by Sam Snead in 1942. The problem Mike had was with Ben Hogan, one of the all-time greatest pressure players. Hogan was attempting a first, too. With a victory, he could become the first player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 to win a PGA Championship and U.S. Open Championship in the same year. Despite being out driven by Turnesa on every hole, Hogan used his irons with deadly accuracy in a 7 and 6 rout. Hogan posted a 66 in the morning round to go 4-up, and won the 28th, 29th and 30th holes to close out Turnesa. Hogan was 35-under-par for the 213 holes he played. After the finale, the weary conqueror said he didn\u2019t think he would ever play in the PGA Championship again. The grind of 10 rounds in five days was too much. But Hogan reconsidered his decision after he won the U.S. Open the following month at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. In 1949, Hogan had little choice in skipping the Championship. A near-fatal automobile accident left his legs battered. He did return to play in the PGA Championship in 1960, the third year after the switch to a 72-hole stroke-play format.\n\n1952 - Settling a Family Score\n\nBig Spring Country Club \u2014 Louisville, Kentucky\n\nBy winning the 34th PGA Championship, Jim Turnesa settled a 26-year family jinx, defeating Chick Harbert 1-up with a par on the 36th hole. Turnesa, a resident of Blair Cliff, New York, at the time of the Championship, was a member of a family of seven golfing brothers. Turnesa\u2019s younger brother, Willie, the only brother to remain an amateur, won the U.S. Amateur (1938, \u201848) and British Amateur (1947). Four brothers in the talented clan had played bridesmaid in major professional championships. Joe finished runner-up to Bobby Jones in the 1926 U.S. Open and was second behind Walter Hagen in the 1927 PGA Championship. Brother Jim \u2014 then an army corporal \u2014 was ousted by Sam Snead, 2 and 1, in the 1942 PGA Championship finale. Brother Mike was humbled by Ben Hogan, 7 and 6, in the 1948 PGA Championship. Four years later, Jim bounced back to erase the family ledger of disappointment with a dramatic duel with Harbert. Turnesa trailed by three holes in the morning 18-hole round before squaring the match for the first time with a birdie at the 32nd hole. The match remained deadlocked until Harbert hooked his drive on the 36th hole underneath an evergreen tree. He settled for a bogey, while Turnesa made a routine par. It was the eighth and final contest in PGA match-play history to be decided on the 36th green.\n\n1955 - A Cinderella named Ford\n\nMeadowbrook Country Club \u2014 Northville, Michigan\n\nAll the stars were in place to make it a memorable week for Doug Ford. He qualified for his first PGA Championship, and won medalist honors. Ford defeated Cary Middlecoff, 4 and 3, in a finale that was tightly contested through the first 27 holes. Even though Ford had a 66 in the morning round, Middlecoff held a one-hole advantage. Ford rallied to square the match for the fourth time, knocking home a birdie putt on the 26th hole. He then added birdies on the 29th, 30th and 32nd holes, and sealed the decision with a par 4 at the 33rd hole. Ford became the fourth player in PGA match-play history to win the Championship after capturing medalist honors (135 for 36 holes). The other players to achieve the feat were Walter Hagen (1926), Olin Dutra (1932), and Byron Nelson (1945). In 1927, Hagen shared medalist honors with Jim Turnesa. Ford\u2019s victory was sweeter for another reason. The PGA of America eliminated the 36-hole qualifier in 1956, doubling the field to 128 players who advanced into match play.\n\n1956 - Burke triumphs in a crowd\n\nBlue Hill Golf & Country Club \u2014 Canton, Massachusetts\n\nIt was the second-to-last PGA Championship under the match-play format, and the first with a 128-player field. Jack Burke Jr. manufactured a series of outstanding matches to capture the Championship, 3 and 2, over Ted Kroll. In the semifinals, Burke overcame a five-hole deficit and edged Ed Furgol, 1-up in 37 holes. Kroll, meanwhile, walloped Bill Johnston, 10 and 8. Johnston posted an 81 in the morning round. It was a Championship that had a little of everything, including a controversial match involving defending champion Doug Ford. On the second day of play, Ford held a 1-up lead on Mike Dietz at the 15th hole. Ford drove into the woods and pitched out, and got his third shot on the green. Dietz called out to spectators near the putting surface before hitting his second shot, asking, \u201cHow far away is he?\u201d Ford then protested, calling on Rule 8-1: \u201cA player shall not give or ask for advice or take any action which may result in his receiving advice except from his caddie, his partner or his partner\u2019s caddie.\u201d After the hole, the match referee agreed with Ford and awarded the hole to Ford. The match continued to the fifth extra hole (the 23rd), where Ford sealed things by holing a 40-yard wedge approach for a birdie-3.\n\n1957 - The last match-play Champion\n\nMiami Valley Golf Club \u2014 Dayton, Ohio\n\nLionel Hebert became the last match play PGA Champion \u2014 and the 25th different name to be inscribed on the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy, defeating Dow Finsterwald, 3 and 1. To reach the finals, Hebert downed former champion Walter Burkemo, who had defeated Hebert\u2019s brother, Jay, in the fourth round. Burkemo had grabbed a 2-up advantage on Lionel after Hebert called a penalty stroke against himself. He reported the ball moved on the 19th green as he was about to make his address. In the next eight holes, Hebert out-putted Burkemo and took a 2-up lead at the 27th hole. Hebert closed out Burkemo by rifling a 5-iron to within a foot of the flagstick for a birdie at the 35th hole. In the finals, Hebert went up by a hole on Finsterwald with a birdie at the 32nd hole. Finsterwald saw his chances wilt after dumping his approach on the 34th hole into a creek in front of the green. Even though he was allowed a free drop due to a footbridge ruled as an \u201cartificial obstruction,\u201d Finsterwald couldn\u2019t manage a par. Hebert closed the match and the Championship with a routine par at the 35th hole.\n\nStroke-Play Era (1958-Present)\n\n1961 - Wee Jerry was simply marvelous\n\nOlympia Fields Country Club \u2014 Olympia Fields, Illinois\n\nThe final three holes diminutive (5-foot-3) Jerry Barber played in the 43rd PGA Championship may go down in history as the greatest exhibition of clutch putting in a major championship. At least, they are the longest known clutch putts in succession \u2014 and they earned the 45-year-old from Los Angeles a berth in an 18-hole playoff with Don January. The duo had tied at 3-under-par 277 for 72 holes, and Barber edged January by a stroke a day later, firing a 67. In the press tent following his fourth round, Barber prefaced his description by adding, \u201cGentlemen, the next three holes you will not believe.\u201d His improbable journey began on the par-4, 458-yard 16th. Barber hit a 4-wood approach 20 feet from the cup and knocked it in for a birdie. He followed that by topping a drive barely 100 yards on the par-4, 428-yard 17th. He hit a 4-wood 90 yards short of the green and his approach was 40 feet from the cup. He sank the putt for a par. Playing the par-4, 436-yard 18th in near darkness, he hit a 3-iron 60 feet to the left of the flagstick, but rapped that putt home for a birdie. Barber, who had nine one-putt greens during the memorable round, said he had learned to putt as a youngster while practicing under a street light. Barber\u2019s victory made him the oldest PGA Champion until Julius Boros won in 1968 at age 48.\n\n1963 - The Golden Bear steps forward\n\nDallas Athletic Club \u2014 Dallas, Texas\n\nJack Nicklaus said he began charting courses in 1961 at the U.S. Amateur at Pebble Beach, California. Nicklaus\u2019 charting a course, along with his distance off the tee and mental ability under pressure, aided his domination of the field in the 45th PGA Championship. \u201cUsing these cards removes all element of doubt for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know precisely how many steps I can hit every iron in my bag. If I have 181 steps to the green from a certain spot, all I do is pull out the club I can hit 181 steps.\u201d Nicklaus pulled out the right clubs to defeat Dave Ragan by two strokes. Nicklaus arrived at Dallas Athletic Club exhausted from his trip to the British Open, where he finished third and a stroke out of a playoff. But two things got him in the frame of mind to bid for his first PGA Championship \u2014 getting 10 hours of sleep each night and winning the long drive contest with a 341-yard, 17-inch effort. During the week, there was only one sign of a Nicklaus power outage. The scorching Texas heat had made the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy too hot even for the Golden Bear to handle. He needed a towel to grasp the top prize.\n\n1964 - From near-tragedy to triumph\n\nColumbus Country Club \u2014 Columbus, Ohio\n\nTwelve years before he would make history at Columbus (Ohio) Country Club, Bobby Nichols was a 16-year-old in a car loaded with four other teenagers on a joy ride. Their car went out of control at 100 miles per hour. Nichols was flung through the windshield and lay unconscious for 13 days with a broken pelvis, twisted back, collapsed lung and injured kidney. But he recovered; his spirits boosted by a letter from a player who had suffered a similar accident \u2014 Ben Hogan. Nichols watched Hogan during the 46th PGA Championship, and was inspired. Nichols said a bargain-basement $5 putter he picked up a week earlier in a friend\u2019s golf shop was his key to victory. The putter proved warmer than the 93-degree temperatures. Nichols set a blistering pace, opening with a 6-under-par 64 that featured 30- and 40-foot putts over elephant mounds. He never looked back while capturing the Championship with a 9-under-par 271, which was a Championship record until 1994. The first wire-to-wire winner in the Championship\u2019s brief medal-play history, Nichols defeated Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus by three strokes. It was a record-breaking Championship for Palmer, too. He recorded rounds of 68-68-69-69, becoming the first player to have four rounds in the 60s in a major championship. Nichols\u2019 opening round remained a record until Raymond Floyd posted a 63 in 1982. Nichols took only 119 putts in 72 holes (a 29.7 average).\n\n1968 - The oldest Champion\n\nPecan Valley Country Club \u2014 San Antonio, Texas\n\nJulius Boros survived sweltering Texas heat and a last-hole charge by Arnold Palmer to become the oldest PGA Champion and oldest major winner at age 48. Palmer, frustrated in never having won a PGA Championship in a glorious career, was a stroke behind Boros heading into the 18th hole, and hit a poor drive. Despite having 230 yards left through trees and over a creek, Palmer took out his 3-wood and hit a brilliant shot to within 12 feet of the flagstick. However, he failed to make his putt and Boros, who was just off the green in two, pitched to within two feet for the victory. Some golf fans wondered why Boros wasn\u2019t smiling for photographers after the tournament. Boros later revealed he chipped a tooth and didn\u2019t want his picture taken with a gap in his smile.\n\n1969 - Floyd wins, Player wins respect\n\nNational Cash Register Country Club (South Course) \u2014 Dayton, Ohio\n\nIt could easily be discarded as a regrettable weekend in golf, but the 51st PGA Championship will be remembered as a time when a great golfer \u2014 South African Gary Player \u2014 stood tall in the face of ugly demonstrators in the gallery; and a moment when another great player \u2014 26-year-old Raymond Floyd \u2014 played well enough to win while surrounded by a suffocating cordon of security guards. Player was the brunt of demonstrations throughout the week, including spectators rushing him on the 10th green in the third round; a cup of ice in the face, and a golf ball tossed on the green while he was preparing to play. Floyd built a five-stroke lead after three rounds, but Player fought back within a stroke. Floyd opened the door with bogeys on the 13th and 15th holes. Floyd stemmed Player\u2019s rally at the 16th hole, rolling in a 35-foot side hill putt for a birdie, while Player missed his par. \u201cHonest to God,\u201d said Floyd, \u201cI was just trying to two-putt.\u201d Player refused to concede, making a birdie at the 17th. Floyd bunkered his approach on the 18th, but Player missed a 40-foot birdie attempt. Floyd got down in two strokes for the one-stroke victory.\n\n1970 - Playing like Arnie\n\nSouthern Hills Country Club \u2014 Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nDave Stockton\u2019s ability to overcome intense pressure on the final round of a major championship \u2014 and fend off playing partner Arnold Palmer \u2014 stemmed from reading a book on cybernetics that his father, Gail, a former professional and his son\u2019s only instructor, had given him. Cybernetics is the comparative study of the automatic control system formed by the nervous system and the brain. Simplified by Stockton, cybernetics \u201cmeans your mind corrects your faults.\u201d Stockton compensated for many miscues during a wild final-round 73 that assured him a two-stroke victory over Palmer, who finished runner-up in the only major championship he\u2019s never won, and Bob Murphy. Stockton played like the Palmer of old, making an eagle on the seventh hole for a seven-stroke lead; double bogey on the next hole; and recording a miraculous bogey at the 13th after dumping a shot into a pond on the 13th hole and lofting a wedge approach within inches of the cup. Stockton canned a 10-foot par at the 17th after fighting sand and fringe rough, and played the 18th conservatively. \u201cI know Arnie\u2019s Army expected him to make a hole-in-one there,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cBut I just played it for a five. I felt sorry for Arnold about one-millionth of a second (big grin); because this is the only one he hasn\u2019t won.\u201d It was Palmer\u2019s third runner-up finish in the PGA Championship.\n\n1971 - A game of bridge lifts the Golden Bear\n\nPGA National Golf Club \u2014Palm Beach Gardens, Florida\n\nPlaying a game of bridge the Monday before the PGA Championship, Jack and Barbara Nicklaus invited Mr. and Mrs. Deane Beman to their new home in North Palm Beach, Florida. Beman mentioned during the game that Jack \u201cnever completed a backstroke\u201d while putting in a practice round they had played. After the Bemans had beaten the Nicklauses in bridge, Jack retired to the family pool deck where he putted on Astroturf. The new putting stroke, Nicklaus said, put him in a \u201cgood frame of mind\u201d to march to a 7-under-par 281 total for 72 holes, a wire-to-wire triumph and a two-stroke victory over fast-finishing Billy Casper. It was the only PGA Championship conducted in February, which was part of an agreement to boost winter tourism with Palm Beach Gardens developer John D. MacArthur, who had leased the PGA Headquarters site.\n\nThe victory was Nicklaus\u2019s second PGA Championship, making him the first professional to twice conquer the modern Grand Slam of winning the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship.\n\n1972 - The \u2018Miracle\u2019 at Oakland Hills\n\nOakland Hills Country Club \u2014 Bloomfield Township, Michigan\n\nGary Player appeared to be in deep slide in the final round of the 54th PGA Championship, making bogies on the 14th and 15th holes to slip into a tie with Jim Jamieson. When Player sliced his tee shot on the par-4 16th hole behind a weeping willow, he thought his Championship chances were gone. But Player had driven far enough to the right that the rough was beaten down by spectators. Despite his lie, Player still had trees in front and a lake guarding the front and right side of the green. Player couldn\u2019t see the flagstick, but found a chair from a member of the gallery and stood on it to line up his shot. Pulling out a nine-iron from his bag, Player then hit one of the most spectacular recovery shots in championship golf. The ball barely cleared the trees and the lake, caught the front portion of the green and rolled within four feet of the cup. Player sank the birdie putt, while Jamieson was missing a two-foot par putt on the 18th green. Player pocketed his second PGA Championship with pars on the final two holes. Jamieson and Tommy Aaron finished two strokes behind. Player joined Jim Barnes as the only foreign-born players to win two PGA Championships.\n\n1978 \u2013 Mahaffey doesn\u2019t Wither this Time\n\nOakmont Country Club \u2014 Oakmont, Pennsylvania\n\nOakmont Country Club, just outside of Pittsburgh, Pa., is one of only three courses to host the PGA Championship three times (1922, \u201851, and \u201878). The course also is the site where John Mahaffey set what was then the best comeback in PGA Championship history. Trailing Tom Watson seven strokes with 14 holes to play, Mahaffey knocked home birdie putts of 35 feet at the sixth and 12 feet at the eighth hole. Watson, meanwhile, bogeyed the sixth and seventh. Watson came back in a flourish by sinking a three-foot eagle putt on the ninth green to give himself a five-stroke edge over Mahaffey and four ahead of Jerry Pate. Watson\u2019s roller coaster round continued with a double bogey at the 10th hole. The trio was tied after a combination of Mahaffey birdies on the 10th and 11th holes, a Pate birdie and Watson bogey on the 13th hole. Mahaffey took the lead temporarily with a birdie on the 14th, lost it on the 16th, and Pate took turns at the top with a birdie at the 17th. Pate missed a four-foot winning par putt on the 18th green forcing the first three-player playoff in the Championship\u2019s history. All three players parred the first extra hole. Pate missed his birdie putt by inches. The drama finally ended on the second hole when Pate missed the green, Watson missed a 30-foot birdie attempt and Mahaffey made his 12-foot birdie putt for the Championship. Mahaffey\u2019s clutch play spoiled Watson\u2019s hopes of completing a modern Grand Slam of the four major championships. For Mahaffey, victory meant a comeback of his career and life. He bounced back from blowing the lead in two U.S. Open Championships and from injuries to his hands in the 1976 PGA Championship. He had won only $9,847 in 1978 prior to the PGA Championship before a plucky overtime performance erased some bad memories.\n\n1980 \u2013 Awakening of a Slumbering Bear\n\nOak Hill Country Club \u2014 Rochester, N.Y.\n\nAs Jack Nicklaus approached his third decade of professional golf, many believed the \u201cGolden Bear\u201d had long past his prime. Nicklaus struggled through the 1979 season, the least productive his worst year since turning professional in 1961. But Nicklaus answered the same critics with a victory in the U.S. Open in June of 1980, and capped his remarkable summer by winning the 62nd PGA Championship two months later. Nicklaus was the only player under par, and a third-round 66 vaulted him into command. His seven-stroke winning margin over Andy Bean was the widest victory margin since the PGA switched from match to stroke play in 1958. Nicklaus\u2019s fifth Championship victory (1963, \u201871, \u201873, \u201875, and \u201880) tied Walter Hagen\u2019s record. Nicklaus\u2019s double-major victory performance in 1980 wouldn\u2019t be duplicated again until Nick Faldo claimed the Masters and British Open in 1990.\n\n1983 - A sophomore steps to the head of the class\n\nRiviera Country Club \u2014 Pacific Palisades, California\n\nIn just his second year on the PGA Tour, Hal Sutton was trying to bounce back from a final-round collapse two weeks earlier in the Anheuser-Busch Classic, where he wasted a six-stroke lead with a 77. In an all-out effort to regroup, Sutton called his instructor, Jimmy Ballard of Birmingham, Ala., and had him flown to Sutton\u2019s home in Shreveport, La. for three days of assistance. Ballard gave Sutton the advice he needed to release his body on the forward part of the swing. Sutton took the advice to Riviera Country Club, and stood on the 12th tee five strokes ahead of Jack Nicklaus. Sutton said he let up at that point, and bogeyed three consecutive holes. When he reached the 15th tee, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let this happen to me again.\u201d He sealed his first major championship by hitting a superb 5-iron to within 14 feet of the pin on the uphill, side hill 18th green to close with an even-par 71. Sutton was able to hold off Nicklaus, whose final-round 66 left him with his fourth runner-up finish in the PGA Championship. Sutton closed out the year as the tour\u2019s leading money-winner and the PGA Player of the Year.\n\n1984 - Trevino\u2019s last regular Tour Surge\n\nShoal Creek Country Club \u2014 Birmingham, Alabama\n\nThree \u201crejuvenated\u201d warriors \u2014 Lee Trevino, Gary Player and Lanny Wadkins \u2014 waged one of the most exciting Championships in PGA history. Trevino emerged from the fray thanks to some advice from his wife, who told him, \u201cEven though you are 44, your clubs don\u2019t know your age.\u201d That, along with a new putter he purchased on a trip to Holland, carried Trevino to his second PGA Championship. His 15-under-par performance earned him a four-stroke victory over Player and Wadkins. Trevino capped his big week by making an 18-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole, becoming the first PGA Champion to win with four rounds in the 60s (69-68-67-69). Trevino accomplished the same feat in the 1968 U.S. Open. \u201cTo me, the 1984 PGA Championship was probably my favorite championship,\u201d Trevino said. For the 48-year-old Player, one year and nine weeks shy of qualifying for the Senior PGA Tour, it was the last regular tour event he was in contention to win. Though Trevino would be in contention again, the PGA Championship was his 27th and last victory before joining the Senior PGA Tour.\n\n1986 - Out of a bunker and into history\n\nInverness Club \u2014 Toledo, Ohio\n\nA one-day rain delay made this a Monday to remember for all time at a major championship. Bob Tway of Edmond, Okla., will forever be known for how tall he stood in a greenside bunker in the 68th PGA Championship. He stripped playing partner Greg Norman\u2019s four-stroke lead on the previous eight holes before driving into heavy rough on the par-4, 354-yard 18th hole. Tway\u2019s 9-iron approach from a downhill lie caught the right-front greenside bunker. Norman, meanwhile, lofted a 123-yard wedge approach to the fringe of the green, 25 feet from the cup. The green sloped away from Tway, who stepped into the bunker, swung and floated the ball about a foot on to the putting surface. The ball didn\u2019t stop rolling until it fell into the cup. Tway leaped up and down in the sand like a schoolboy, pumping his fists. Norman, trying to regain his composure, chipped 10 feet past the hole in his attempt at birdie and a tie. He finished two strokes behind after a round of 76. Tway became the first player in modern history to win the PGA Championship with a birdie on the 72nd hole. His 8-under-par 276 also made him the first to post a sub-par 72-hole total in a major championship at Inverness Club. Tway went on to be named the PGA Player of the Year, finishing the season with four victories. For Norman, the British Open Champion that year, it was a script too much for words. He was the only golfer in history to lead four modern Grand Slam events after three rounds in the same year.\n\n1991 \u2013 The Tale of Long John Daly\n\nCrooked Stick Golf Club \u2014 Carmel, Indiana\n\nJohn Daly\u2019s prodigious driving ability resulted in a larger-than-life birth of a legend in the 73rd PGA Championship. The ninth alternate in the field, Daly got a telephone call in Memphis, Tennessee, at 5 p.m. Wednesday from PGA Tournament Administrator Ken Anderson. Daly was informed he had moved up to first alternate. Daly packed his bags, drove 7 \u00bd hours to Indianapolis, and got the good news on a message light at his hotel: Nick Price, whose wife was expecting, had withdrawn. From there, Daly put on golf\u2019s most memorable exhibition by any rookie player in a major championship. He averaged 303 yards per drive on the 7,295-yard Crooked Stick layout, but proved his length wasn\u2019t the only weapon in his arsenal. He also played solidly on the speedy greens and, without the benefit of a practice round, posted an opening-round 69 to tie for eighth place. Daly seized the lead for good by stringing together rounds of 67 and 69 on the second and third day, attracting mammoth galleries to his side. His final-round 71 was almost like his late-night trip from Memphis \u2014 he was on cruise control. \u201cI can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve hit my driver this straight,\u201d Daly said. \u201cAll four days, I didn\u2019t think. I just hit it. Squeaky (Medlen, his caddie) just said, `Kill,\u2019 and I killed it. I just hit it so good this week; I had no fear out there.\u201d\n\n1993 - A-Zinger of a finish\n\nInverness Club, Toledo, Ohio\n\nHistoric Inverness Club housed a leaderboard that became a \u201cwho\u2019s who?\u201d of golf in the final two rounds of the 75th PGA Championship. While some players, particularly long-driving 1991 PGA Champion John Daly complained of tight fairways and tiny greens, Paul Azinger paid attention to former PGA Champion Byron Nelson\u2019s advice earlier in the week \u2014 play for the middle of the greens. Azinger strung together four birdies in a row in the final round and landed in a tie with Australian Greg Norman, a hard-luck runner-up at Inverness in 1986. Norman had a chance to break the 12-under-par 272 tie in the regulation 72 holes, but his 20-foot birdie attempt grazed the hole. The 12th playoff in Championship history began on Inverness\u2019s signature 357-yard par-4 18th hole, and again Norman missed a birdie attempt. This time, the ball spun around and off the cup. The players moved to the par-4 10th hole, with Norman firing a wedge 20 feet above the cup and Azinger pitching to within eight feet. Norman left his birdie attempt four feet above the cup and Azinger missed his grazed the cup with his putt before tapping in for par. Norman carefully studied his par putt, but again the ball grazed the cup and spun out. The Australian-born Norman became the second player in history to lose playoffs in all four major championships. For Azinger, it was his first major championship.\n\n1995 - Elkington's record run humbles Riviera\n\nRiviera Country Club, Pacific Palisades, California\n\nAustralian Steve Elkington etched his name in major championship golf history at legendary Riviera Country Club, rallying from a six-stroke deficit with what he called \"the round of his life\" to win the 77th PGA Championship. Elkington turned in a final-round Championship record 7-under-par 64 before making a 25-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole to win the 77th PGA Championship. Montgomerie's ensuing birdie putt attempt to tie rolled to the right of the cup. Elkington and Montgomerie shared the 72-hole PGA Championship record of 17-under-par 267, which shattered Nick Price's year-old mark by three strokes and were the lowest scores ever posted in a U.S. major championship. Elkington dominated a field, which featured a record 79 of the top 100 players, according to the World Golf Rankings. The field humbled Riviera Country Club, producing the lowest course average in PGA Championship history (71.09) and the second-most Championship sub-park rounds (194).\n\n1997 - Love finds Major Redemption\n\nWinged Foot Golf Club, Mamaroneck, New York\n\nDavis Love III looked his caddie, brother Mark, directly in the eye before walking up to the 18th green during the final round of the 79th PGA Championship at Winged Foot Golf Club. \u201cJust get me through about the last five or 10 minutes.\u201d Mark Love, sharing his brother\u2019s emotion but withholding his own feelings of the moment replied, \u201cYou hit a great shot. Just go enjoy it.\u201d Love then strode to the green, asking playing partner and reigning British Open champion Justin Leonard to walk beside him. Leonard pushed Love forward to accept the applause. Nobody in a PGA Championship record field of 83 of the world\u2019s top 100 ranked players could match Love\u2019s impressive weeklong performance at difficult Winged Foot. His final-round 66, capped by a 12-foot birdie putt, gave him a 72-hole total of 11-under-par 269. It was the lowest winning score of the five major championships conducted in 74 years on the famed layout. Leonard, the only other player under par all week, had a third-round competitive course-record 65. But Leonard couldn\u2019t keep pace with Love after three front-nine bogeys, and ended with a 71 for runner-up honors at 274. Love, one of the world\u2019s finest players for several years, ended a 38-major winless drought. As his putt rolled into the cup, he pulled off his visor and made a sweeping tip to an appreciative gallery. Only then did Love look up to the sky to see a brilliant rainbow. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look earlier,\u201d said Love, remembering his late father, Davis Love Jr., a PGA Professional who died in a plane crash in 1988. Love joined the late Dave Marr as the only sons of PGA Professionals to win a PGA Championship.\n\n1999 - A Tiger tale to remember\n\nMedinah (Illinois) Country Club\n\nJust 23, and with the game of a veteran, Tiger Woods captured the 81st PGA Championship at Medinah (Ill.) Country Club, and may have found his biggest rival as golf heads into the next century. Woods nearly squandered a five-stroke lead before salvaging an even-par 72 for a winning total of 11-under-par 277. His two-putt for par on the 72nd hole was one stroke better than 19-year-old Sergio Garcia of Spain. But, the real drama in the woods of Medinah evolved on the back nine of the final round. Garcia, who took the first-round lead, was the youngest player to compete in the PGA Championship since Gene Sarazen in 1921. Woods, who won the 1997 Masters title, was competing in his third PGA Championship. He became the fifth youngest PGA Champion and the youngest since Jack Nicklaus in 1963. Woods triumphed over the strongest field in the history of golf. A record 92 of the world\u2019s top 100 players, featuring 43 international players from 19 countries, competed for the Wanamaker Trophy. Garcia bogeyed the second hole after hitting his ball into the water, but later birdied the 13th hole from 18 feet and then looked back to the tee at Woods. Garcia nearly endangered himself and perhaps those in the gallery before hitting perhaps the greatest recovery shot in major championship golf. On the par-4, 452-yard 16th, Garcia pushed a 3-wood and the ball landed 189 yards from the green in the exposed roots behind a large tree. Garcia elected to hit the ball, not chip safely to the fairway. He opened the face of a 6-iron and as he swung, closed his eyes at impact. The ball rocketed into a high left-to-right trajectory, landing on the green some 60 feet from the hole. Garcia sprinted up the fairway and did a scissors kick leap to see the green. Once he settled down, he went on to two-putt for par. Woods bogeyed the 16th, trimming his lead to a stroke over Garcia. Woods then hit his tee shot on the par-3 17th to the left-hand rough to face his championship moment of truth. Woods chipped from a poor lie to within eight feet of the hole, but rolled in the putt. Garcia missed his birdie putt on the 18th hole and later watched as Woods rolled a downhill 15-footer to within tap-in range to clinch the title. Woods and Garcia met and embraced on the edge of the green.\n\n2000 - A Duel for the Ages\n\nValhalla Golf Club, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nThough they lived only 20 minutes apart as youths while competing in the California junior ranks, Tiger Woods and Bob May had never faced each other before on a golf course. They saved their first close encounter for a world stage in the 82nd PGA Championship. And, the twosome dueled for 21 pulsating holes in the final round in one of the most dramatic major championships. Woods salvaged his final round 67 by making a key 15-foot par putt on the 15th hole of regulation, before May missed a six-foot birdie attempt. They reached the 18th hole tied, with May sinking an 18-foot birdie putt and Woods rapping home a six-footer. Woods then birdied the first hole of the three-hole playoff, the par-4 16th, and finished by matching May with classic par saves on the final two holes. Woods and May finished with 31s on the back nine and tied for the lowest 72-hole score in relation to par (18-under-par 270) in PGA Championship history. In the process, Woods became the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three major championships in one year. He also erased a PGA \u201cjinx\u201d of capturing back-to-back Championships. Woods is the first to do so since Denny Shute (1936-\u201937), and is the first to repeat in the stroke (medal) play era of the championship that began in 1958. \"The fireworks started on the back nine,\" Woods said. \u201cI think it\u2019s got to go down as one of the best duels in the game, in major championships. Granted there have been some great ones, but I think this one goes up there. Both of us shoot 31 on the back nine on Sunday afternoon with no bogeys. I played the last 12 holes 7-under. That is not too bad. Hats off to Bob. He played his heart out.\"\n\n2001 \u2013 Major Toms\u2019 Lay-up to Remember\n\nAtlanta Athletic Club, Johns Creek, Georgia\n\nDavid Toms pulled a 5-wood from his bag and eyed the par-3 15th hole at Atlanta Athletic Club. In the waning stages of a humid Georgia afternoon and the third round of the83rd PGA Championship, the Shreveport, La., native appeared cooler than most. He struck his tee shot, sent it 243 yards, with the ball coming settling on the green and rolling like a putt into the hole. The roar of the gallery followed Toms all the way to the green; where he plucked the ball out of the hole and went on to hold the lead for his first major championship. Toms\u2019 hole-in-one was believed to be the longest ever recorded by a major champion, and it proved to be the margin needed for victory. A day later, Toms watched as playing partner Phil Mickelson chipped in from 35 feet for a birdie on the 15th hole to forge a tie. Toms collected himself, while Mickelson unraveled with a three-putt bogey on the 16th green, swinging the lead back to Toms. As both players approached the treacherous, par-4, 490-yard 18th tee, Toms used a driver and slightly pushed his drive into the first cut of rough, 209 yards from the green and on a side hill lie. Mickelson was in the fairway with his drive and hit a 6-iron 25 feet above the hole. Toms elected to lay up to within 88 yards and short of the water. From there, he hit a lob wedge to 12 feet. Mickelson\u2019s birdie putt two rolls short of the hole. Toms then lined up his par putt, stroked it home. With a steady, closing 1-under-par 69, Toms shattered the PGA and major championship 72-hole scoring records. His 15-under-par 265 broke the 1993 British Open aggregate total of 267 by Greg Norman and the PGA Championship standards set in 1995 by Steve Elkington and Colin Montgomerie. \u201cI said all week that I wouldn\u2019t be afraid to lay up at 18 if I didn\u2019t have what I thought was a good shot,\u201d said Toms. \u201cA side hill, downhill lie \u2014 that translates into a low hook with no spin on it, and that\u2019s not what I needed. There was nothing good that could happen. It was all I had. There was no possible way I could stop that ball on the green.\u201d Toms played the percentages like a veteran gambler and walked off with the top prize.\n\n2002 \u2013 Rich was on high Beem at Hazeltine\n\nHazeltine National Golf Club, Chaska, Minnesota\n\nRich Beem, the son of a PGA Professional, answered every challenge on his way to winning the 84th PGA Championship, withstanding a furious charge by Tiger Woods to cart off the Wanamaker Trophy at Hazeltine National Golf Club. Beem accomplished his feat in a Championship that set a record for having the most world-ranked players (98 of top 100) begin play. Beem\u2019s final-round 4-under-par 68 included an eagle on the 11th hole to build a three-stroke lead, and then capped his day with a birdie on the 16th to hold off Woods, who came home in 67, a stroke off the pace. Beem became the 12th champion of the past 15 PGA Championships to claim his first major title. He is the fourth son of a PGA Professional to capture the Season\u2019s Final Major, joining a group that includes Jack Burke Jr. (1956), Dave Marr (1965) and Davis Love III (1997). Beem\u2019s father, Larry, a PGA Life Member and former New Mexico State University golf coach, was a standout player at New Mexico State in the 1960s. Larry was not at Hazeltine National Golf Club to witness his son\u2019s victory, but later said that he \u201cwore out the carpet\u201d in front of his television from his home in Las Cruces, N.M., and \u201csmoked enough cigarettes to last a lifetime.\u201d\n\n2003 \u2013 Micheel hits \u2018Glory\u2019s Last Shot\u2019\n\nOak Hill Country Club, Rochester, New York\n\nThe year\u2019s strongest field, 96 of the top 100 world-ranked players, were befuddled by the hefty rough of the East Course at Oak Hill Country Club. When the dust had settled on Sunday, only two unlikely, but talented warriors \u2013 Chad Campbell and Shaun Micheel - were left dueling for the Wanamaker Trophy. On a layout where legends Hagen, Hogan, Nelson, Trevino and Nicklaus have roamed, Campbell and Micheel each had their chance to write history and win their first major championship. It was Micheel\u2019s hour. Leading by a stroke, Micheel hit second off the tee and watched as his drive headed to the left fairway rough, but then bounced right and came to rest into a lie in the first cut 175 yards from the hole. Micheel then reached for a 7-iron and launched his approach. As the ball flew, Micheel\u2019s caddie yelled, \u201cBe right!\u201d The ball hit on the front portion of the green, bounced once and then tracked toward the flagstick. It stopped two inches from rolling in the cup as the gallery roared its approval. Campbell gathered himself and hit his approach some 10 feet beyond the hole. Micheel walked triumphantly to the elevated green, still unsure of how far he had for his birdie putt. When he saw the ball, he let out a smile, doffed his cap and then patted his heart before marking his ball. Micheel\u2019s shot will be remembered as \u201cGlory\u2019s Last Shot at Oak Hill,\u201d and one of the great final-hole performances in major championship history. They don\u2019t plant oak trees at Oak Hill Country Club unless a player does something exceptional. Perhaps Micheel\u2019s shot will earn an oak, if not a plaque somewhere near the rough on the 18th hole. \u201cI would like to thank the Oak Hill members for being so hospitable to me and my wife this week,\u201d said Micheel with a big grin. \u201cI would like to take you up on the invitation to return. But, I\u2019ll come back only if you promise to cut the rough.\u201d\n\n2004 \u2013 Vijay goes the Distance at The Straits\n\nWhistling Straits (Straits Course), Sheboygan, Wisconsin\n\nOn Championship Sunday, with the golf world tuned in and some 44,000 fans charged to a new level, hard-working Vijay Singh earned a PGA Championship on a course that was then the longest (7,514 yards) in major championship history. Singh won his third major championship and first PGA Championship since 1998, the hard way. His closing 4-over-par 76 was the third highest final round by a major championship winner, and good for a 72-hole total of 8-under-par 280. He made his lone birdie of the final round, but a timely one, sinking a five-foot putt on the first hole of a three-hole cumulative score playoff. He added two additional pars to defeat Chris DiMarco and Justin Leonard. \u201cIt was sad to see someone win it the way I did,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThe putter kind of fell asleep. I got new life when (Leonard) missed the putt on the last hole. I knew the line I had on 10, and I was happy to see I had the same line in the playoff. The wind came from a different direction and the holes played longer today.\u201d Singh became the fourth oldest to win a PGA Championship at 41 years, five months and 23 days. His closing 76 was the highest score by a major championship winner since Reg Whitcombe\u2019s 78 at Royal St. George\u2019s in the 1938 British Open.\n\n2005 \u2013 Phil taps on Jack for luck, Delivers a Winning \u2018flop\u2019\n\nBaltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nPhil Mickelson made superlative use of two weeks of preparations for the 87th PGA Championship, making a pilgrimage to Baltusrol Golf Club and later executing his game plan to perfection. Forced to return for a fifth day of competition due to a late Sunday thunderstorm, Mickelson was one of 12 players who provided 56 minutes of excitement to close out the round. Tied for the lead stepping to the tee on the par-5 18th hole, Mickelson hit a drive into the fairway, and then tapped a stone plaque dedicated to Jack Nicklaus\u2019s 1967 closing 1-iron approach in the U.S. Open. Mickelson, using a 3-wood, hit his approach just right of the hole into rough ringing the green. From there, he hit a shop that he had practiced in his backyard as a youngster \u2013 a flop wedge from some 50 feet from the hole for a two-foot tap-in birdie. He finished with a 2-over-par-72, a 4-under-par 276 total and a one-stroke victory over 1995 PGA Champion Steve Elkington and Denmark\u2019s Thomas Bjorn. \u201cI tried to remember some of the shots I hit as a kid in my backyard,\u201d said Mickelson. \u201cI hit it aggressively, and the ball popped up nicely, and it rolled smoothly.\u201d Mickelson\u2019s second major championship came on a Monday after 12 players were unable to finish a day earlier due to a passing thunderstorm.\n\n2006 \u2013 Tiger cruises, with \u2018Pops\u2019 in his ear\n\nMedinah Country Club, Medinah, Illinois\n\nTiger Woods has learned much about what it takes to close a major championship. He credited his late father, who died in May due to cancer, with much of his fundamental preparation. Woods recalled Pops\u2019 first putting lesson. \"I kept saying all day, 'Just putt to the picture.' That's how I first learned how to putt,\" Woods said. \"He actually knew what he was talking about.\u201d During his first visit to Medinah Country Club in 1999, Woods needed a par save on the 71st hole to hold off Sergio Garcia for his first PGA Championship. Returning to Medinah and now seeking a 12th career major, Woods shared the 54-hole lead with England\u2019s Luke Donald. This time, Woods didn\u2019t wait to strike. He birdied the first hole from 10 feet, on his way to a 4-under-par 68, and never looked back while cruising on the longest course in major championship history (7,561 yards). Woods\u2019 five-stroke triumph made him the first player in history to go consecutive years winning at least two majors. He added 40-foot \u201cbombs\u201d for birdies on the sixth and eighth holes punctuate his round. Shaun Micheel, the 2003 PGA Champion, finished runner-up after a 69. Donald, bidding to become the first European-born PGA Champion since Tommy Armour in 1930, slumped to a 74 and tied for third with Australian Adam Scott and Garcia. \u201cI wish my Dad was here, to be honest with you,\u201d said Woods. \u201cIt\u2019s another chapter in my life but I think about Pops all the time. Today, I definitely think Pops was in my ear.\u201d\n\n2007 \u2013 King of the Hills\n\nSouthern Hills Country Club, Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nFaced with the fact that he had let two other major championships slip his grasp on the final round earlier in the year and playing under the most brutal heat in major championship history, Tiger Woods did the next best thing. He put his game into high-octane gear, nearly carded a 62 in the second round and punched a steady, no slip 1-under-par 69 in the final round to earn his 13th major title and fourth PGA Championship. It was the fourth PGA Championship to be contested at Southern Hills, with temperatures averaging above 100 degrees throughout the week. Woods\u2019 fitness regimen paid dividends as he withstood back-nine charges by unheralded Woody Austin and three-time major champion Ernie Els to win by two strokes. After a three-putt bogey at the 14th holes, Woods bounced back with a birdie at the 15th and closed with three pars for the victory. The Champion continued his remarkable streak of never losing a major after either sharing or holding the 54-hole lead alone.\n\n2008 \u2013 It was Paddy\u2019s Day at Oakland Hills\n\nOakland Hills Country Club, Bloomfield Township, Michigan\n\nOn a \u201cmonster\u201d of a golf course that bared a new set of teeth, Padraig Harrington flashed his own pearly whites while carving his way into history at the 90th PGA Championship. Ireland\u2019s favorite son rallied at Oakland Hills Country Club on a Sunday where few have been able to rally before, capturing his third major championship and second in a span of three weeks. In the process, he snatched the Championship from Sergio Garcia\u2019s grasp in the final few holes. Harrington, 36, also wrote a unique chapter in major championship golf. He became the first European in the modern era to win the British Open and PGA Championship in succession, and the first to win the PGA Championship since Scotland\u2019s Tommy Armour in 1930. Harrington, the winner of three of the past six majors, prevailed by back-to-back rounds of 4-under-par 66, and completing 27 holes on the final day after a third round was suspended by rain in mid-afternoon. Harrington\u2019s winning 72-hole total of 3-under-par 277 was good for a two-stroke margin over Spain\u2019s Garcia and America\u2019s Ben Curtis, the 2003 British Open champion whose chances faded with bogeys on two of his final four holes.\n\n2009 \u2013 Yes, it\u2019s Yang!\n\nHazeltine National Golf Club, Chaska, Minnesota\n\nHazeltine National Golf Club\u2019s tradition for producing some of the most unexpected champions in major championship history held in the 91st PGA Championship, and also became the scene for a landmark moment in global golf. South Korea\u2019s 37-year-old Yong-Eun (Y.E.) Yang became the first male Asian player to win one of golf\u2019s four major championships and the first to defeat Tiger Woods when he had shared or owned a lead in the final round. Trailing Woods by nine strokes after the fifth hole of his second round, Yang\u2019s record PGA comeback wasn\u2019t complete until he drilled a 210-yard 3-hybrid approach at 18 that soared up and over a tree, cleared a greenside bunker and came to rest 10 feet from the flagstick. Yang made that birdie putt for a 2-under-par 70, added a fist pump amidst the roar of a massive gallery, and posted an 8-under-par 280 total. That was good for a three-stroke triumph over Woods, whose closing 75 bore no resemblance to the same player who had taken a perfect 14-for-14 slate after sharing or holding alone the lead into the final round of a major. Hazeltine National hosted its fourth major and second PGA Championship, serving up the longest course in major championship history at 7,674 yards. The field featured a PGA Championship-record 69 internationals representing 21 countries, and 97 of the top 100 world-ranked players \u2013 just one ranked player shy of the mark set in the 2002 Championship at Hazeltine. \"This may be my last win,\u201d said Yang before a packed clubhouse of well-wishers poised for a champagne toast, \u201cbut this is by far the best day of my life.\u201d\n\n2010 \u2013 Drama Rules at The Straits\n\nWhistling Straits (Straits Course), Sheboygan, Wisconsin\n\nStraits, so many that not even the maintenance staff has officially counted them all. Perhaps it was fitting that only one \u2013 a wispy patch of sand trampled by spectators through a tumultuous Sunday \u2013 played a pivotal role in determining a bittersweet and historic chapter in the 92nd PGA Championship. Germany\u2019s Martin Kaymer (pronounced \u201cKY-mer\u201d) emerged victorious from a three-hole playoff with Bubba Watson, posting a winning even-par total in the overtime drama to become his country\u2019s first PGA Champion and second ever to win one of golf\u2019s four majors. The drama, however, was more compelling prior to the playoff when Dustin Johnson \u2013 clinging to a one-stroke on the 18th tee \u2013 saw his chances for glory erased due to a penalty. Johnson had placed his 4-iron behind the ball, unaware that it was part of a bunker. He went on to make a brilliant pitch shot to seven feet of the hole, just missing a par putt that was to have been a Championship-winning stroke. Kaymer, 25, won the ensuring three-hole playoff over Watson with a par-birdie-bogey finish. They each finished regulation play at 11-under-par 277. Watson birdied the first playoff hole and Kaymer the second. The moment of truth came when Watson went for the green out of thick rough from 206 yards at the 18th, the third playoff hole, and put his ball into Seven Mile Creek, 40 yards short of the green. Kaymer chipped back to the fairway before hitting a 7-iron third shot 15 feet from the hole and two-putting for victory. He earned his first major triumph came amidst a field featuring 97 of the top 100 world-ranked player and a PGA Championship-record 73 players representing 22 countries.\n\n2011 \u2013 Keegan Bradley completes \u201cGlory\u2019s First Shot\u201d\n\nAtlanta Athletic Club, Johns Creek, Georgia\n\nKeegan Bradley watched his chip from the rough speed across the 15th green at Atlanta Athletic Club and into the water. Before he left the green and posted a triple bogey-6, Bradley gave himself a mental scolding, \u201cDon\u2019t let that hole define this whole tournament.\u201d It proved to be just the right motivation while trailing Jason Dufner by five strokes with three holes to play. Bradley went on to birdie the 16th and 17th holes, including a 35-footer at 17, to spark his rally and force a three-hole playoff. He finished regulation play with a 68 to Dufner\u2019s 69, forcing a deadlock at 8-under-par 272. Opening the playoff at the 16th hole, Bradley knocked home a five-foot birdie putt and Dufner missed his birdie attempt. Bradley added two closing pars to claim the Wanamaker Trophy, joining Francis Ouimet (1913) and Ben Curtis (2003) as the third player in nearly a century to win a major championship in his first try. Bradley, the nephew of World Golf Hall of Famer Pat Bradley, became the sixth son of a PGA Professional to capture the Championship. \u201cIt seems like a dream, and I hope it\u2019s real,\u201d said Bradley at the champagne toast in the clubhouse. \u201cThis was the best conditioned golf course that I\u2019ve seen in my life. If I could make one suggestion, you might cut the rough down back of the 15th hole!\u201d\n\n2012 \u2013 All Glory for Rory\n\nThe Ocean Course, Kiawah Island, South Carolina\n\nRory McIlroy had all the tools at his command in the 94th PGA Championship, registering a performance that will rank among legends who marched generations ahead. McIlroy validated his record-setting U.S. Open Championship over a year earlier by blowing away the field at The Ocean Course on Kiawah Island. He closed in the style befitting golf's royalty by sinking a birdie putt from 25 feet on the 18th hole for a 6-under-par 66, a 13-under-par 275 total. His eight-stroke victory broke the PGA Championship record for victory margin that Jack Nicklaus set in 1980. The 23-year-old from Northern Ireland, who jumped back to No. 1 in the world rankings, is the first from his homeland to win a PGA Championship and a U.S. Open. McIlroy also won the U.S. Open by eight strokes. He said that he had a premonition of positives upon his arrival on Kiawah Island. \"I turned up here on Monday afternoon, I went up to my locker,\" said McIlroy. \"My locker was right by the window overlooking the putting green, the beach and the ocean. I was thinking to myself, \u2018I just have a good feeling about this week.' And I said it to JP (Fitzgerald, his caddie), and I said it to my Dad and I said it to my whole team; something about this just feels right.\" McIlroy became the youngest player since Seve Ballesteros to win two majors. Tiger Woods was about four months older than McIlroy when he won his second major. McIlroy became the fourth youngest PGA Champion.\n\n2014 \u2013 Rory edges Phil at dusk in a Bluegrass Thriller\n\nValhalla Golf Club, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nRory McIlroy emerged from a four-man race to outlast Phil Mickelson and the darkness at Valhalla Golf Club to capture his second straight major. McIlroy closed with a 3-under 68, two-putting from 35 feet, to become only the fifth player to win four majors at 25 or younger. The others were Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Bobby Jones, and Tom Morris Jr. One of the greatest shows on soggy turf came with a most peculiar ending. Three shots behind going to the back nine, McIlroy rallied to take the lead and then hit a 9-iron from the fairway bunker to 10 feet for birdie on the 17th hole for a two-shot lead going to the par-5 18th. Because of a two-hour rain delay earlier, darkness was falling quickly and it wasn't certain McIlroy would be able to finish. McIlroy got the invitation from Rickie Fowler at the No. 18 tee to hit his tee shot before Fowler and his playing partner, Mickelson, had reached their drives. Both were only two shots behind, still in the game. McIlroy came within a yard of hitting in a hazard right of the fairway. Then, McIlroy, getting permission from a PGA of America Rules official, hit his second shot. Mickelson and Fowler had to stand to the side of the green. Fowler had a 50-foot eagle attempt to tie for the lead. He was well off the mark, and missed the short birdie putt attempt that cost him his third straight runner-up finish in a major. Mickelson was short of the green, and his chip came within inches of dropping for an eagle that would have tied him for the lead. Mickelson closed with a 66 and was runner-up for the ninth time in a major. Fowler became the first player in history to finish in the top five at all four majors without winning one.\n\n2015 \u2013 Whistling Straits becomes Jason\u2019s \u201cDay-break\u201d Major\n\nWhistling Straits (Straits Course), Sheboygan, Wisconsin"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Billy_Burke_(golfer)", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Billy Burke (golfer)?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2019/12/glens-falls-open-golf-tournament.html", "page_content": "The Glens Falls Open was a pro golf tournament, now classified as a PGA Tour event, played in New York eleven times, mostly in the 1930s.\n\nFirst played: 1929\n\nLast played: 1939\n\nThe Glens Falls Open was typically played in August or September.

Only six months spanned Shute\u2019s victories \u2013 his 1936 triumph over Jimmy Thompson coming in November at Pinehurst and his 1937 victory in May over Jug McSpaden at Pittsburgh Field Club.\n\nBorn Densmore Shute in 1904, the Cleveland native also collected the 1933 British Open at St. Andrews, played in the first Masters in \u201934 and notched 16 PGA Tour victories from 1929 to \u201939. He will be inducted into the veterans category at the World Golf Hall of Fame, 34 years after his death.\n\n\u201cHe was just so low-key and so quiet, Denny would have been easy to overlook,\u201d said Larry Shute, 77, his half-brother. \u201cHe never wore flashy clothes. He wasn\u2019t a Walter Hagen. He was modest, quiet, reserved \u2013 a professional gentleman.\u201d\n\nShute\u2019s father, Hermon, a clubmaker and professional, moved to America from England in 1902, settling in Huntington, W.Va., where he helped found Spring Valley Country Club. Denny honed his game there, and won the 1923 and \u201925 West Virginia Amateurs. He returned to Ohio a year later and won the 1927 Ohio Amateur, then claimed three consecutive Ohio Open titles, from 1929 to \u201931.\n\nHis silky swing, featured on the cover of The American Golfer magazine twice in 1932, was aided by powerful wrists and forearms, and produced a piercing ball flight. But it was his reserved manner on and off the course that those close to him remember most vividly.\n\n\u201cHe more or less wanted to be by himself,\u201d said Errie Ball, 97, who played in the first Masters with Shute. \u201cHe didn\u2019t open up too much on the golf course. He was just concentrating on his game. He wasn\u2019t paying much attention to you.\n\n\u201cIt was a good trait to have. He didn\u2019t play around much. He\u2019d get on the golf course, and you knew you had someone tough to beat.\u201d\n\nAt age 27, Shute finished runner-up to Tom Creavy at the 1931 PGA. Shute also played in his first of three Ryder Cups that year, helping the U.S. to victory. Two years later, Shute was center stage for one of the most exciting Ryder Cup finishes in history. In the final singles match, Shute and Great Britain\u2019s Syd Easterbrook were all square on the final green and faced 30-foot par putts. After Easterbrook lagged to tap-in range, Shute ran his putt 4 feet by the hole and missed the comeback putt, handing Great Britain the Cup.\n\nTwo weeks later, Shute posted four consecutive rounds of 73 at St. Andrews, then defeated Craig Wood in a 36-hole playoff to win the British Open. Shute also finished runner-up at the 1941 U.S. Open (to Wood) at Colonial.\n\nLike many professional golfers at the time who didn\u2019t earn much money playing tournament golf, Shute worked as a club pro. He held positions in Cleveland, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, before settling at Portage Country Club in Akron, Ohio, in 1945. He stayed at Portage until retiring in 1972. Members recall Shute spending more time practicing and playing, rather than teaching the game.\n\n\u201cThe only time you could get Denny to give a lesson was if you were his partner and you were 2 down,\u201d joked Tom LaRose, 80, a Portage member since 1953.\n\nShute and his wife, Hedy, led a modest life in Akron, where they had a daughter, Nancy. According to LaRose, Hedy not only was a beautiful woman, but \u201cthe only gal that could handle Sam Snead.\u201d\n\n\u201cDown at the grill room at Augusta, Sam would come in and see Denny and Hedy, my wife and I sitting there,\u201d LaRose said. \u201cHe\u2019d start telling dirty stories. Hedy would say, \u2018Mr. Sam?\u2019 And he\u2019d look at her and say, \u201cYes, Ms. Hedy.\u2019 And it would stop.\u201d\n\nPortage Country Club has held a pro-am in Shute\u2019s name for 34 years. This year\u2019s event gave away more than $20,000 in scholarship money to the club\u2019s caddies.\n\nDespite being a quiet man, Shute is remembered for his subtle humor.\n\nAt the 1951 Masters, Shute was paired in the first round with a then 21-year-old Dow Finsterwald. Finsterwald recalls hitting \u201cthree or four\u201d balls into Rae\u2019s Creek on the par-3 12th hole and making an 11. Meanwhile, Shute made birdie.\n\n\u201cAs we were walking to the 13th tee,\u201d Finsterwald said, \u201cDenny said to me, \u2018Well kid,\n\nwe had a good best ball.\u2019\n\n\u201cLooking back, it was an intent to encourage me to keep playing.\n\n\u201cHe was highly respected as a golfer and as a person. Everything I ever saw from him was exemplified by the term \u2018gentleman.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nDan Mirocha is a Golfweek assistant editor.

And I think the better the golf courses you play, the better you develop your game,\u201d Nicklaus said. \u201cI think you develop \u2013 the terrain develops you, more side hill lies, downhill lies, hills and such. I happen to like it.\u201d\n\nNicklaus isn\u2019t the only prominent Ohio golfer. Start with Denny Shute, a Cleveland native, who won an Open Championship and two PGA Championships. Then there\u2019s a collection of other major winners: Herman Keiser and Gay Brewer (Masters); Dow Finsterwald and Jason Dufner (PGA Championship); and Ben Curtis and Tom Weiskopf (Open Championship).\n\nJohn Cook, a Toledo native, won the 1978 U.S. Amateur before amassing 11 PGA Tour victories. Stacy Lewis, also from Toledo, has two major titles among 14 wins on the LPGA Tour and went 5-0-0 in the 2008 Curtis Cup Match, the first to achieve such a feat.\n\nWorld Golf Hall of Fame course designer Pete Dye, from Urbana, was a fine amateur player who won an Ohio high school state title (as did Nicklaus). The late Peggy Kirk Bell, noted golf instructor, course owner and touring professional from Findlay, recently was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Career amateur Bob Lewis captained two USA Walker Cup Teams and played on four others.\n\n\u201cWell, it's odd, but you wouldn't think that Ohio was a hotbed for growing golfers,\u201d Nicklaus said, \u201cand in Western Pennsylvania there was a guy that came from there that was pretty decent.\u201d\n\nAnd that guy had some Ohio ties.\n\nArnold Palmer, stationed in Cleveland during his stint in the Coast Guard, won two Ohio Amateur titles before capturing the 1954 U.S. Amateur, which launched his professional career. In a strange twist, Nicklaus never won the Ohio Amateur. But he did win the Ohio Open \u2013 at age 16, against a field largely comprised of professionals. That was in 1956, just after playing in an exhibition with Snead at Urbana Country Club, where one of the spectators was Dye, whose family owned the course.\n\nFrom the age of six until well after he turned professional in 1961, Nicklaus figures he missed only one Ohio State University football game \u2013 and he remains an avid fan to this day. There was no doubt that he eventually would attend the school, where he won an NCAA individual title. He even played freshman basketball for the Buckeyes, but never entertained thoughts of a two-sport career. \u201cThey had a couple of guys named (Jerry) Lucas and (John) Havlicek, so they didn\u2019t need me,\u201d he once joked.\n\nNicklaus firmly believes that because he was an athlete who segued from one sport to another as the seasons changed, he became a better golfer.\n\n\u201cI like seasons. To me you create so much more variety up in the northern part of the United States with your golf courses. And I think for a young guy to develop his game or her game, I think you have more interesting things to do than \u2013 even [players from] the South [like] Florida and Texas. They develop probably more golfers. It's only because I think it's pure numbers that [they] get to play year-round.\n\n\u201cI loved growing up playing here [in Ohio] because I was not a 12-month-a-year golfer,\u201d he added. \u201cI thought that you burn yourself out by doing that. And I was a kid, I think kids should play more sports. And you grow up here, you have a tendency to play more sports.\u201d\n\nNicklaus said that had he not become a golfer, he probably would have pursued baseball. He was a switch-hitter and an excellent catcher, and he had some foot speed. In eighth grade, he ran the 100-yard dash in 11 seconds flat \u2013 thanks to his father goading him into learning how to run.\n\nLike Palmer, he also excelled at football. But he gave up the sport. Legendary Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes, who had become a family friend, recommended that he quit and not jeopardize what already was appearing to be a promising future in golf.\n\nJust one more benefit of an Ohio upbringing.\n\nDave Shedloski is an Ohio-based freelance writer whose work regularly appears on USGA digital channels."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/15/archives/denny-shute-golfer-dies-at-69-won-pga-title-in-36-and-37-taught-by.html", "page_content": "Starting as an amateur, Shute first attracted attention nation ally when he turned up at the United States amateur championship\u2010at the Flossmoor Club in Chicago in 1923. With victories over Eddie Held and Ned Allis, both prominent in the amateur ranks. Shiite was scheduled to play the former champion, Robert A. Gardiner, in the third round, and a search of his previous record up to that time showed a lack of anything except a purely local reputation among West Virginia golfers.\n\nBadly beaten by. Gardiner, Shute passed out of the golf picture for a few years and did nothing, of note until after he turned pro. His first notable success came in his winning the Ohio open in 1.929, during which year his golf talents earned him $2,000. in prize money. He repeated that triumph in 1930 and the same year won both the Los Angeles open and the Texas open. His winnings that\u2010 year amounted to $7,000, making him one of the big money winners among the pros that season.\n\nThe following year he won the Ohio open title the third time in a row and attained national renown by going: to the final round of the P. G. A. championship at Providence, where he was defeated, 2 and 1, by Tom Creavy.\n\nHis earnings amounted to $5,000 in 1932 and the next year he won the British Open title in a playoff against Craig Wood.\n\nHe was a two\u2010time winner of the P.G.A., generally regarded as the most difficult title in the world to win, defeating Jimmy Thomson at Pinehurst in 1936 and Harold (Jug) McSpaden at Pittsburgh in 1937.

The Oak Hill Country Club's East Course in Pittsford, New York, will host the 72-hole stroke play competition from May 18 to 21.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt used to be the fourth and final men's major of the golf season, taking place in mid-August on the third weekend before Labor Day weekend. The tournament, which follows the Masters Tournament in April as the second major of the season, will start to be played in May on the weekend before Memorial Day in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning the PGA awards privileges that increase career security, just like the other majors. The Players Championship for the following five years, the U.S. Open, and the Open Championship, as well as the PGA Championship, are all automatically open to PGA champions. They are also eligible for the PGA Championship for the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are given memberships to the PGA Tour and the European Tour, respectively, for the subsequent five and seven seasons. Only one of the four major championships, the PGA Championship, is open only to professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGA Championship 2023 History\n\nTwo unofficial amateur national championships for golfers were organized in 1894 when there were 41 golf courses open in the United States. The Newport Country Club in Rhode Island hosted one, while St. Andrew's Golf Club in New York hosted the other. In addition, St. Andrew's hosted the Open Championship for professional golfers concurrently with the amateur competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early years of American golf history, the amateur national championships held at St. Andrew's Golf Club in New York and Newport Country Club in Rhode Island were significant occasions. Future amateur competitions were made possible by these tournaments, which gave amateur golfers a stage on which to compete and display their abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese events gained additional prestige and allure due to the fact that they were planned concurrently with the Open Championship for professional golfers at St. Andrew's. Golf fans had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see both amateur and professional golfers compete at the same time. These competitions played a significant role in the growth of golf as a national pastime in America by encouraging more people to take up the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince none of the championships had official backing from the American golf industry's governing body, there was a great deal of disagreement among competitors and event planners. As a result, the United States Golf Association (USGA), the nation's first official golf association, was established later in 1894. Golf quickly rose to prominence and became a national sport after the USGA was established.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Professional Golfers Association of America (PGA) was founded in New York City in February 1916. A month earlier, a luncheon with the top golfers of the day was hosted by wealthy department store owner Rodman Wanamaker at the nearby Wykagyl Country Club in New Rochelle.\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf historians refer to Wykagyl as \"The Cradle of the PGA\" because the attendees set the agenda for the PGA's official formation. One of Wykagyl's best-known golf pros, Robert White, served as the new organization's inaugural president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first PGA Championship was held at Bronxville, New York's Siwanoy Country Club, in October 1916. Rodman Wanamaker gave a gold medal with diamonds and $500 to the winner, Jim Barnes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGA Championship 2023 Schedule\n\nAccording to the official website of the PGA Championship, the details below are based on Eastern Time (ET).\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Rounds\n\nThe practice rounds are optional for players, though they are encouraged to take part.

Everyone, even the holder of the title, Gene Sarazen, had to pass a 36-hole prequalifying test. Once the tournament got under way, Shute never led until the 72nd hole. He started out with even par rounds of 73 and 73 to trail by six strokes. On the final day of 36 holes Shute began with another 73 and trailed by three as five were tied for the lead. On a windy afternoon, the scores ballooned. Craig Wood managed a 75 to take the lead in the clubhouse at 292. Later in the day Shute posted a fourth 73 to tie Wood at 292. In a 36-hole playoff the next day Shute was around in 75-74 to win by five strokes. It was nearly a home victory for the Scots. Denny\u2019s father, now a golf professional in Ohio, had done his apprenticeship at St. Andrews, and his grandmother still lived in Scotland.\n\nJust 10 days before that, Shute had been with the US PGA team competing against the British PGA team in the Ryder Cup at the Southport & Ainsdale Golf Club in Southport, England. With victories in 1927 and 1931 against a loss in 1929, the United States held the Cup and a slim lead. The British PGA was determined to retake the Cup with a win on their home soil. The great John Henry Taylor was the captain, and he took his appointment seriously. Taylor had his team members out running on the beach at daybreak each day.\n\nThe match was played over two days. The first day there were four 36-hole foursome matches (alternate strokes), and the second day there were eight singles matches, which were also scheduled for 36 holes.\n\nTaylor\u2019s training may have helped. At the end of day one the British led by 2-1/2 points against 1-1/2 for the visitors. The second day\u2019s singles matches were tightly contested. Late in the day the final score came down to the last match still on the course. The two combatants were Denny Shute and Britain\u2019s Syd Easterbrook. They came to the 36th hole, and after some indifferent golf, both reached the par four green in three. Both were putting from about 25 feet. Easterbrook putted first and was left with a three-foot putt. The Ryder Cup result was now all on Shute. If he two putted, the match would most likely end in a tie and his team would retain possession of the Cup. If he holed his putt they would win.\n\nThe playing captain, Walter Hagen, should have been on the green to remind Shute that two putts would be alright, but Hagen was not there. He was up on a knoll behind the green talking to Prince Edward (who later as the King of England abdicated the throne). Shute, who was putting downhill, went past the hole by four feet and missed coming back. Easterbrook holed his putt and the British were victorious. When Hagen was asked why as captain, he was not there to advise Shute that a tie would keep the cup; he said that he felt it would be rude to interrupt a conversation with a future king.\n\nOne might say that Prince Edward won the 1933 Ryder Cup for Great Britain. Walter Hagen always called him Eddie."}, {"url": "https://pgatourmediaguide.com/records/all-time/132", "page_content": "Major Championships\n\nWins All-Time Wins (Majors) Wins Player 18 Jack Nicklaus 15 Tiger Woods 11 Walter Hagen 9 Ben Hogan Gary Player 8 Tom Watson 7 Bobby Jones Arnold Palmer Gene Sarazen Sam Snead Harry Vardon 6 Nick Faldo Phil Mickelson Lee Trevino 5 Seve Ballesteros James Braid Brooks Koepka Byron Nelson J.
