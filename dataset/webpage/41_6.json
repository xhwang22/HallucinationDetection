{"Mark Fite is known for The Big Lebowski (1998).": [{"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-big-lebowski-1998", "page_content": "Everybody knows somebody like the Dude--and so, rumor has it, do the Coen brothers. They based the character on a movie producer and distributor named Jeff Dowd, a familiar figure at film festivals, who is tall, large, shaggy and aboil with enthusiasm. Dowd is much more successful than Lebowski (he has played an important role in the Coens' careers as indie filmmakers), but no less a creature of the moment. Both dudes depend on improvisation and inspiration much more than organization.\n\nIn spirit, \"The Big Lebowski'' resembles the Coens' \"Raising Arizona,'' with its large cast of peculiar characters and its strangely wonderful dialogue. Here, in a film set at the time of the Gulf War, are characters whose speech was shaped by earlier times: Vietnam (Walter), the flower power era (the Dude) and \"Twilight Zone'' (Donny). Their very notion of reality may be shaped by the limited ways they have to describe it. One of the pleasures of \"Fargo'' was the way the Coens listened carefully to how their characters spoke. Here, too, note that when the In & Out Burger shop is suggested for a rendezvous, the Dude supplies its address: That's the sort of precise information he would possess.\n\nAs the film opens, the Dude is visited by two enforcers for a porn king (Ben Gazzara) who is owed a lot of money by the Big Lebowski's wife. The goons of course have the wrong Lebowski, but before they figure that out, one already has urinated on the Dude's rug, causing deep enmity: \"That rug really tied the room together,'' the Dude mourns. Walter, the Viet vet, leads the charge for revenge. Borrowing lines directly from President George Bush on TV, he vows that \"this aggression will not stand'' and urges the Dude to \"draw a line in the sand.'' The Dude visits the other Lebowski (David Huddleston), leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself enlisted in the millionaire's schemes. The rich Lebowski, in a wheelchair and gazing into a fireplace like Maj. Amberson in \"The Magnificent Ambersons,'' tells the Dude that his wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), has been kidnapped. He wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. This plan is opposed by Maude (Julianne Moore), the Big Lebowski's daughter from an earlier marriage. Moore, who played a porno actress in \"Boogie Nights,'' here plays an altogether different kind of erotic artist; she covers her body with paint and hurls herself through the air in a leather harness.\n\nLos Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he's socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.) Some may complain \"The Big Lebowski'' rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style. The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings. The spirit is established right at the outset, when the narrator (Sam Elliott) starts out well enough, but eventually confesses he's lost his train of thought."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/reviews", "page_content": "8 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nSounds like a Three Stooges short no? But wait and see: \"The Big Lebowski\" is an American 2-hour film from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is of course by the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers and even without gigantic awards attention, this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years. This is also thanks to the cast, not just to the script. There are three performers in here who won acting Oscars later in their careers, namely the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and of course Jeff Bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it, even if I might give the edge to John Goodman (Argo, Roseanne) here in terms of who I'd pick as the film's MVP. But there's also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like Tara Reid or RHCP's Flea. And then there's Coen regulars like Stormare, Buscemi (both Fargo) and Turturro (Barton Fink). A lot of fun for sure. The Coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavioral patterns. Very well done and this tendency has elevated many Coen films. And as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem, there is still something authentic to them. You never get the impression that you are actually watching actors in roles here, but they feel like actual people. Of course, on the other hand, not everything is perfect with this movie. The scenes with Julianne Moore didn't do too much for me, especially her early scenes. Sam Elliott I also could have done without. I like his narration voice, that would have been enough although his conversation with Bridges' character was also fine in the middle of the film and how they talk about cowboy looks, profanity etc. But with him saying the final words, the film did not exactly close at its best I suppose. Also kinda feel he has a tendency to always play the same character and it seems that back then he looked exactly the way he looks today. But for every negative criticism I have, there are at least five positive things for me to say about this film. The best example is really everything involving John Goodman. His scene with the gun was a riot, only the Coens can depict an actually dangerous situation in a manner as hilarious and entertaining as they did here. His scene in the car when they are about to give the money to the abductors is even better and how he keeps talking about beating the crap out of them. And it's no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into the three German nihilists. Poor Buscemi's character. Or, again about Goodman, his recurring words directed at Buscemi's character. Or how he keeps mentioning Vietnam to show how tough he is. And if we are talking about recurring references already, Bridges' character has his own too of course, such as how he keeps ordering the same drink, even if they may not be as good as Goodman's. The dialogue writing is top-notch here for sure and even if this is always the case with the Coens and their films, we should not take it for granted. Too many examples. One that stayed in the mind for me is the \"let me take another look\" (or something like that) when the bad guys keep pushing his head inside the toilet early on. What a cool dude. No pun intended.\n\n\n\nAs a result, we get many hilarious scenes like at the bowling alley early on (e.g. the gun scene) or also all the scenes with the Dude and Lebowski. I had to laugh so hard at some of these. Yes the film maybe got a bit worse in the second half and maybe the story took two or three plot twists and roads that may have been too absurd, but at this point it doesn't really matter anymore as you are truly sucked in by the entertainment. It's also not a film where you really wonder what will happen to the protagonists or care about them deeply. Instead, you just enjoy the moment and what is happening to them this very instant. Good acting, strong writing, hilarious scenes that turn the eventual outcome into one of the very best of 1998, especially in the first 60 minutes. So of course I give it four stars out of five. I (highly) recommend checking it out if you are one of the very few who have not yet seen it. Also a must-see for bowling lovers. And as for the Coens' quality, just pick Tara Reid, whose career has gone down the drain considerably, but so talented people like the duo of writers and directors here effortlessly install her in a movie that has turned into a classic without any bad impact at all. Admittedly, this is also because of her looks of course because really she does not have a lot to put on display in terms of range and versatility. She has that conversation with the Dude early on at the mansion and finally we see her in the car and that's it, but maybe this lack of a challenge was why they picked her. I immediately had to think of another character in an early Tarantino movie. I am sure you know who I am talking about. Anyway, let's not drift away from this one as there is a lot more to say here. For example, I mentioned the scene in the car. This was one example of how effortless good the Coens are when it comes to storytelling. We find out that indeed she was never kidnapped. We also see she still has all her toes and we see where the actually severed toe came from in another scene in a bar (poor girl!) and this is also pretty unique how the Coens are so strong in depicting somewhat violent moments in comedic light, which always feels pretty unique with them. The only one who does it at least almost as good is again the aforementioned Tarantino. But while he was my favorite earlier and I still like him a lot, I am 100% Team Coen Bros now because honestly, it feels as if I love each and every single film they made. This one here is no exception. It took me until 2017 to watch it for the first time and it was already really good there, but now in 2020 I got the chance to watch it again, for the first time on the big screen of an open air cinema and this was when I really fell in love with this movie. Okay, that is maybe a bit too much to say, but I liked it really a lot and finally see why so many others do too. It has so many funny moments from beginning to end that stem from the great writing, but also equally good acting for sure. These cast members pulled it off perfectly. And with that, I am not just talking about those at the center of the story (also the rich Lebowski for example, sadly not too many know the actor, may he rest in peace), but also those that have very little screen time such as Turturro's character, who is still hilarious though and also the crass difference between his scenes as a colorful bowling starlet and the exact opposite how he has to ring at everybody's door and tell them about his past. Or the German nihilists. And just people who only have one scene. That is always the Coen's strength. They make every character so damn entertaining. And this film is also a success from the time/political perspective. Could they get away with the Saddam jokes today? And pay attention to how the Dude is considered the ultimate Cannabis consumer in popular media nowadays, but you never see him roll a joint. Times were different back then when it came to depicting drug (ab)use in the movies. But it also shows how progressive and ahead of its time the film and filmmakers were/are. So no matter what perspective you take, this is a movie you may not want to miss out on under any circumstance and I am glad hardly anybody did looking at how many have seen it. The story may not be perfect, but it never really is 100% about the story anyway. You forget quickly how the Dude and Goodman's character realize it was all a scam maybe a little too quickly because you are so in awe about all the wonderfully delightful and entertaining moments like the silent boy whose paper they find in the car etc. Like I said, mentioning everything that is funny in this movie is virtually impossible because I would run into the character limit soon and still not have listed half of it all. That is why you need to experience this wonderful film yourself. Actually it made me consider buying a rug again, one that really works the place. Nuff said. Highly, highly recommended. Also some wonderful use of music here I have to put on my player immediately, such as the Eagles song (sorry Dude, it's good), \"what condition my condition was in\" or a not too famous version of \"Viva las Vegas\". All gems. The Coens are really this good with music too in their works. And you also get the usual Jew reference (special occasion here) showing us they do not take themselves seriously at all, a tradition that mounted with full speed into the even better \"A Serious Man\" later on. A gem that movie as well. This one here too.

It came from the inventive, cultish and anarchic Coen Brothers. The obscenity-filled, R-rated classic independent film, one of the most revered cult films of all time (especially in the new millennium), was a buddy film about an abduction and pay-off scheme (involving an elusive ransom sum), and was intentionally designed as a film-noirish shaggy dog tale set in 1990s Los Angeles. The complex abduction plot included an unfaithful trophy wife (and porn actress), sinister blackmailing German nihilists, a second set of hired thugs working for an adult film producer, a crippled and devious philanthropist, a feminist femme fatale who only wanted a sperm donor, a shell-shocked Vietnam War veteran, and a Venice Beach ex-hippie and ex-protest era radical (now a dope-smoking slacker). Added to these elements was a conglomeration of mismatching, absurdist pop cultural objects (in episodic vignettes), including a pissed-on rug, a gun drawn in a bowling alley, strange pop art performances, a severed toe, a case of missing (stolen) ransom money, homework interrogation, numerous White Russians (\"Caucasians\") and doobies, Saddam's invasion of Iraq, a ferret on a leash, a crowbar-smashed new Corvette, and much more - all peppered with memorable lines of oft-quoted dialogue (with some parroting of key phrases) and memorable but unusual characters. By the end of the wickedly absurdist noirish tale centering around a bewildered and oft-stoned Messianic archetype known as the \"Dude\" (not the \"Big Lebowski\" of the film's title), everyone seemed untrustworthy and deceptive - in actual fact, everything went horribly awry due to multiple misunderstandings. There was no kidnapping, and most of the characters were revealed to either be acting hypocritically, misrepresenting themselves, lying, or pursuing their own self-interested objectives. Its taglines were somewhat intriguing - about the central character named Lebowski: \"They figured he was a lazy, time-wasting slacker. They were right.\"\n\n\"Times like these call for a Big Lebowski.\"\n\n\"Her life was in their hands. Now her toe is in the mail.\" In its tale of LA sleaze (with approximately 260 F-bombs) in a post-Vietnam era, there were echoes of writer Raymond Chandler's writings and detective hero Philip Marlowe behind the classic film noir The Big Sleep (1946). [Note: The title of the film, The Big Lebowski, was intentionally derived from the 1946 film.] Both films had a completely undecipherable and ultimately unimportant plot, consisting of a series of unusual sequences as a parade of characters appeared during attempts by a hard-boiled detective (and a wasted LA stoner-deadbeat) to unravel a mystery during a film-long quest that involved mostly red herrings and dead-ends. Other references included director Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) (an update of Raymond Chandler's mystery set in mid-70s Los Angeles), and writer/director Stephen Anderson's independent science-fiction film and dark comedy The Big Empty (2003) that paid homage and closely resembled the film. Czech-born director Ivan Passer's R-rated neo-noir crime thriller Cutter's Way (1981) (also starring Jeff Bridges) was a precursor to the Coen Brothers' film. After reaching cult status, a quasi-religious movement arose from the film's slacker philosophy - known as Dudeism (or The Church of the Latter-Day Dude). On the organization's website, it described its ancient philosophy that \"preaches non-preachiness, practices as little as possible, and above all, uh\u2026lost my train of thought there...\", and attributed its popularity to Jeffrey Lebowski - the original 'Uber-Dude': \"Helped to bring Dudeism to the forefront of modern consciousness. If not for him, we\u2019d still be stuck in the dude dark-ages. He\u2019s Dude Vinci, Isaac Dudeton, and Charles Dudewin all rolled into one. Or just, His Dudeness, if you\u2019re into that whole brevity thing.\" Also, tours of various public and private locales of all the Los Angeles-area film sites (indicated in the text below) have become very popular for Lebowski-philes, although some locations have been torn down or renovated beyond recognition. With a budget of $15 million, the film was initially a box-office bust, but eventually became a commercial and critical success, with almost $18 million (in domestic revenue) and $46.7 million (worldwide). It was the 96th highest-grossing (domestic) film of 1998. Previous to this film (and for some others following), the Coen Brothers auteurs had already created a string of highly-unique, non-standard, and offbeat films (often with dark humor). Their signature trademarks included unusual characters, cinematic homages, period settings, eye-candy cinematography, witty dialogue, historical and pop-cultural references, and imaginative, labyrinthine off-kilter plots. They also covered a wide range of styles and genres that were often parodied: Coen Brothers' Film Titles Description Blood Simple (1984) Violent and sleazy neo-noir crime-gone-wrong film involving a love-triangle, a hired killer, deadly plot twists, lies, and misunderstandings in the heart of Texas Raising Arizona (1987) Fast paced, slapstick, mad-cap screwball crime comedy about child abduction (by an ex-con and ex-cop), with a wild chase sequence and other fantastical elements Miller's Crossing (1990) Neo-noir gangster film and dense yet evocative period piece, in the style of Dashiell Hammett, about prohibition-era mobsters Barton Fink (1991) A surrealistic arthouse flick and semi-horror film about the travails of a NY movie scripter with writer's cramp brought to hellish California to compose a B-grade wrestling picture - a perfect satire of the golden-age of Hollywood The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) A zany fairy-tale about the American dream and corporate greed, and a period Capra-esque comedy (similar to Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)) Fargo (1996) A straight-forward crime thriller about a failed kidnap scheme, a crooked and inept car dealer, and a heroic, pregnant investigating Minnesota police chief The Big Lebowski (1998) One of the greatest cult films of all time - the first of a so-called \"Knucklehead\" Trilogy The Coens' \"Knucklehead\" Trilogy The Big Lebowski (1998)\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou (2000) (a fantasy comedy, epic 1930s adventure-journey in the Deep South, and symbolic exploration of Homer's classic story \"The Odyssey\" with bluegrass music, a title derived from Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels (1941) )\n\nBurn After Reading (2008) (a bizarre ensemble piece, political black comedy-drama and absurdist farce with a MacGuffin!, similar to Advise and Consent (1962)) Plot Synopsis Opening Prologue: A smooth-talking, laconic, drawling cowboy Stranger (Sam Elliott) [Note: the name was a reference to Albert Camus' existential philosophy] delivered a mocking, off-screen, long-winded voice-over description about bearded, long-haired Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) in the film's opening lines. [Note: The Stranger also book-ended the film, a framing device, with further statements about the Dude whom he considered to be a hero \"for his time and place\" in America.] During the narration, a broken-off tumbleweed plant traveled from the high-desert north of Los Angeles [Note: The area was Pearblossom near Palmdale] to a view of the grid-pattern of an LA cityscape [from a vantage point in Simi Valley], where it tumbled down. It then rolled along in the middle of the night - crossing a freeway overpass, passing by a Hand Car Wash and a Benitos Taco Shop stand, turning over and over in the center of an LA street, and onward toward the ocean - to the tune of \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds,\" sung by Sons of the Pioneers - on a store's Muzak system. [Note: The original song was released in 1934, and first appeared in the Gene Autry western film Tumbling Tumbleweeds (1935). The tumbleweed plant was an apt metaphoric symbol for the Dude himself - it was dead, although spreading seeds as it drifted along in the windswept western landscape of the modern day.] \"A way out west, there was this fella that I wanna tell ya about. Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle that his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself 'The Dude.' Now, 'Dude' - that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the 'Dude' that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so dern interestin'.\n\n\n\nThey call Los Angeles the 'City Of Angels.' I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I seen London, and I've never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, as the fella says. But I'll tell ya what - after seein' Los Angeles, and this a-here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in any of those other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.\n\n\n\nNow this a-here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man - I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man - and I'm talkin' about the 'Dude' here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the 'Dude' in Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the 'Dude' was most certainly that, quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Wow, lost my train of thought here. But, aw, hell. I've done introduced him enough.\" The rumpled-looking Dude was first viewed with sunglasses as he shuffled along in the fluorescently-lit dairy section of an almost-empty Ralph's Supermarket. [Note: The actual Ralph's Supermarket where the opening scene was filmed was located at 1745 N. Garfield Rd., in South Pasadena, CA (or Alhambra, CA), near Huntington Drive (and just to the west of San Marino).] He was opening and smelling the contents of a quart container of Half-and-Half (and drinking it off-screen), while wearing a long open gray bathrobe, dirty white T-shirt, shorts, and slippers. It was one of his most-frequently purchased grocery items - for his White Russian drinks (composed of vodka, Mexican Kahlua-coffee liqueur, and cream (or half-and-half, or milk)). [Note: Throughout the course of the film, the Dude drank nine White Russians, although he dropped one after being drugged.] [Note: A similar night-time scene in an LA supermarket played during the opening credits of Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973).] At the counter with his Ralph's value club card and checkbook where the blonde Checker (Robin Johnson) watched warily (noting his white-frothy mustache), he wrote out an imprinted check (Jeffrey Lebowski from Venice, CA) for $0.69 cents - post-dated for September 11, 1991. [Note: The personalized check had a water-color painted background of a blue whale. Later, the Dude listened to a cassette tape of blue whales singing while taking a bath. The check's date was exactly ten years before 9/11 - fueling 'conspiracy theories' amongst some viewers since the film was released only 3 years before 9/11.] [Note: On a small Panasonic TV screen, the Dude noticed President George H. W. Bush during a live TV press interview on the White House South lawn, delivering the words: \"This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait,\" identifying a speech given on Sunday, August 5, 1990 at 3:05 pm (East Coast time), three days after Saddam Hussein's Iraqi Army invaded Kuwait. The actual date and time, acc. to the broadcast, would have been August 5, 1990 at 12:05 pm (Pacific time) in Los Angeles, although in the movie, it appeared to be in the middle of the night in LA.] Assault on The Dude in His Venice Bungalow - Mistaken Identity: Unemployed, bearded, unmarried and laid-back, long-haired LA slacker Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Bridges), an often-stoned bowling-lover in the year 1990, returned in the dark to his Venice Beach (California) bungalow - one unit of a six-unit complex of bungalows with a courtyard. He had his black bowling bag in his right hand, and a small grocery bag in his left, and juggled them together as he used his key at the front door. [Note: The bungalow was located at 609 Venezia Avenue, two blocks northwest of Venice Blvd. and slightly east from a popular section of the coastal town of Venice known as Abbot Kinney.] Inside his home, the easy-going, slovenly Dude stood for a second. Behind him was Thug # 2 awaiting his arrival. The Dude was assaulted and grabbed from behind by Thug # 1 - they were two inept debt-collector hoods: Treehorn Thug # 1 (Mark Pellegrino), a long-haired, muscle-bound blonde (wearing a gray tank-top T-shirt)\n\nTreehorn Thug # 2 (Philip Moon), an Asian-American named Woo (wearing a light tan-colored shirt with cut-off sleeves) In the film's very significant first line of dialogue (the most important question raised in the entire film - the elusive money!), Woo alleged that the Dude owed them money: \"Where's the money, Lebowski? We want that money, Lebowski. Bunny said you were good for it....WHERE'S THE F--KING MONEY, S--T-HEAD!\" As the blonde man roughed him up and plunged his head down into the toilet bowl, the Dude kept his sense of humor, telling the thug with a snarky comment: \"It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.\" He was continually threatened: \"Don't f--k with us! Your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn. That means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn.\" And then to top it off, Woo peed on the Dude's favorite carpet (prefaced by \"Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski!\"). [Note: Woo's statement referred to the Latin phrase: \"Sic Semper Tyrannis\" (translated) \"Thus always to tyrants.\" The phrase was allegedly shouted by Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth. The statement also commonly referred to the assassination of Caesar.] Distressed, th e Dude complained: \"No, no, don't do that! Not on the rug, man,\" and kept asserting that he was the wrong man (an unmarried individual): \"Nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man... My my Wi-- my wife? Bunny? Do you see a wedding ring on my finger? [He held up his right hand, not his left!] Does this place look like I'm f--kin' married? The toilet seat's up, man!\" The blonde thug zipped open the Dude's bowling ball bag and removed his black, shiny ball, pondering: \"What the f--k is this?\" - the Dude again quipped: \"Obviously, you're not a golfer!\" He dropped the heavy ball onto the tile floor, causing more damage. Eventually, the Dude was able to convince them that they had the wrong guy. The blonde asked his buddy Woo: \"Isn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?\" The hoods took off after assessing the situation: (Woo: \"He looks like a f--kin' loser...F--king time wasted.\" Blonde guy: \"Thanks a lot, asshole\"). The Dude retorted as they stormed off: \"At least I'm housebroken.\" [Note: The assailants had been hired by porn king Jackie Treehorn, to retrieve funds that they thought Lebowski's wife had taken - although they had the wrong Lebowski.] The Opening Credits, and The Dude's Bowling Buddies: The title and opening credits were presented with close-ups of bowling-related objects at the Dude's favorite local bowling alley, Hollywood Star Lanes, with trademark neon starburst decorations and fixtures. [Note: No longer standing, the original bowling alley complex built in 1962 was demolished in 2003. It was located on the 5,200 block of Santa Monica Blvd. in East Hollywood, cross-street at North Kingsley Drive.] A montage of ten bowling pins, an overhead scoring sheet with a built-in ashtray, the ball return, fingers in a bowling ball, a ball rolling down the wooden slats of an alley and scoring a perfect strike, large starburst decorations on the walls, a Saddam Hussein look-alike spraying disinfectant into rental bowling shoes, and more, were mixed to the tune of Bob Dylan's \"The Man in Me\" on the soundtrack. The Dude commiserated with his two bowling buddies on Lane 22 about his ruined, highly-valued rug: Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) - an uptight, angry, aggressive, militant-minded, hot-headed, heavy-set, gun-worshipping nutcase, former Vietnam war veteran and PTSD-sufferer; with Polish-American lineage; he was the Dude's complete polar-opposite, but completely loyal; with a flat-top haircut and chin-strap goatee, and tinted sunglasses; a convert to Judaism due to his ex-marriage to wife Cynthia\n\nTheodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) - a moronic, passive, meek and obtuse ex-surfer, with Greek lineage; often innocently out-of-sync in conversations with his buddies; often bullied and criticized, and told to \"shut-up\" by Walter He told them how it had been peeded upon by a Chinaman - the rug served as a metaphoric symbol of his latent desire for structure and order in his laissez-faire life that had now been irretrievably soiled: \"Yeah, man, it really tied the room together.\" Walter chastised 'Donny' for not listening and for constantly interrupting: \"Were you listening to the Dude's story, Donny?...So you have no frame of reference here, Donny. You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to...Forget it, Donny, you're out of your element!\" Becoming exasperated with Donny and the Dude, Walter tried to make his point about the destroyed rug and \"unchecked aggression\" against the Dude. He also denounced the Dude for the use of a racial slur on Asian-Americans: Dude: \"Walter, the Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill, so what the f--k are you talkin' about?\"\n\nWalter: \"What the f--k are you talking about?! The Chinaman is not the issue here, Dude! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not -- also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature, uh, Asian-American, please.\"\n\nDude: \"Walter, this isn't a guy who built the railroads, here, this is a guy...Walter, he peed on my rug.\"\n\nDonny: \"He peed on the Dude's rug.\"\n\nWalter: \"DONNY, YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT! Dude, the Chinaman is not the issue here.\"\n\nDude: \"So who, who -- \" [Note: Hypocritically, Walter often used slurs of his own. Here are a few examples of Walter's racist name-calling: the bowling league officer in charge of scheduling was a \"kraut,\" Bunny was a \"poor slut,\" the Iraqi Arabs were \"fig-eaters wearin' towels on their heads,\" and the nihilists were \"F--king Germans...\"F--king Nazis.\"] Walter concluded by stating who was really responsible: \"Jeff Lebowski. The other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire....Plus, he has the wealth, obviously, and the resources, uh, so that there's no reason, there's no F--KING reason why his wife should go out and owe money all over town, and then they come and they pee on your f--kin' rug! Am I wrong?\" The Dude finally realized he had been mistaken for a local Pasadena area millionaire Jeff Lebowski, the \"Big Lebowski\" with his same name - and he deduced what he should do: \"I could find this f--kin' Lebowski guy....This is the guy who should compensate me for the f--kin' rug. His wife goes out and owes money all over town, and they pee on my rug?\" Walter had to have the last word: \"They peed on your f--kin' rug.\" \"The Big\" Lebowski - and Bunny: The Dude, wearing shorts and a sloppy T-shirt, was ushered inside Mr. Lebowski's Pasadena mansion by the tycoon's fastidious personal assistant and sychphantic yes-man Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman). [Note: The impressive manor, the Greystone Mansion (and Gardens) (aka the Doheny Mansion) in Beverly Hills and built in 1928, had been a film setting in a number of movies, including Dead Ringer (1964) with Bette Davis, There Will Be Blood (2007) with Daniel Day-Lewis, and David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977). In 1971, the estate was declared a public city park and no longer a residence. Its location: 905 Loma Vista Dr. in Beverly Hills.] The Dude was first escorted into a study to show off Lebowski's \"impressive\" collection of commendations, awards, citations, and honorary degrees hanging on a wall, including a key to the city of Pasadena and an LA County Business Achiever award. In the trophy room, the Dude inspected a picture of a wheelchair-bound Lebowski with Nancy Reagan (when she was First Lady) and noticed that he was a \"crip\" - or \"handicapped guy.\" Lackey Brandt corrected him with the proper PC label: \"Disabled.\" In an inner city community service picture of \"Little Lebowski Urban Achievers\" (arranged like a set of 10 bowling pins), Mr. Lebowski was prominently sitting front and center in the group of \"inner city children of promise\" (he had donated to send all of them to college). Brandt tried to make it clear that they weren't his biological kids: \"They're not literally his children.\" The Dude described his own wasted \"college days\" as an ex-radical and political extremist - comprised not of a formal education, but mostly of protest sit-ins, smoking Thai-sticks, breaking into the ROTC, and bowling - in the 60s and 70s (the heyday of hippie culture). During the tour of Lebowski's achievements, Brandt was tortured by the Dude's stroking of the mementoes that he was prohibited from touching. The Dude's face was mirrored onto a framed 'Man of the Year' Time Magazine cover labeled \"ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER?\" The Dude then watched as his namesake rode in on a motorized wheelchair to a place behind his office desk: it was his first encounter with the chubby 60-ish Pasadena (CA) philanthropist and activist millionaire Jeffrey 'The Big' Lebowski (David Huddleston - an exact double look-alike of Republican President George W. Bush's VP Dick Cheney, who served from 2001-2009). [Note: There were many similarities in the early scenes of The Big Lebowski to Raymond Chandler's script in Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946). Mr. Lebowski's character was based on General Sternwood - an exotic orchid-lover, millionaire, and wheelchair-bound, disabled elderly man, who lived in a mansion, but spent most of his time in a hot greenhouse waited upon by a butler. During a mansion visit by protagonist Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), a hard-boiled detective, Sternwood hired the \"dick\" to investigate a missing chauffeur, while being threatened with blackmail from a group of extortionists in Los Angeles. They had targeted his profligate, corrupted nympho daughter who owed gambling debts to a dealer of rare books (actually a porn dealer with nude photos).] Haltingly, the Dude explained the reason for his visit - reimbursement for his soiled and defiled rug: Dude: \"Uh, well sir, it's, uh, this rug I have, it really tied the room together...Well, uh, they were -- they were lookin' for you, these two guys.... Like I said, Woo, peed on my rug.\"\n\nMr. Lebowski: \"I just want to understand this, sir, every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the person?\"\n\nDude: \"Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, uh, you know...\" The Dude continued to complain and demand compensation for his vandalized rug following the mistaken attack by two hoods (due to a mix-up of addresses and similar \"Lebowski\" names) who were really targeting Mr. Lebowski's indebted wife. When accused of being an unemployed scammer who was only seeking a handout, the Dude felt compelled to formally introduce himself to \"The Big\" Lebowski: \"Uh, I am not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, uh, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or uh, you know, El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.\" When the Dude was demeaned for being unemployed (\"The Dude minds\"), he repeated President George H.W. Bush's warning on TV against Saddam Hussein - to emphasize how he didn't like being ripped off: \"This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man. I mean, your wife owes money....\" Mr. Lebowski (claiming that he was a prime example of the work ethic) offered employment advice to the Dude - and brutally accused him of being a laid-back bum without self-reliance: (\"Every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility, regardless of who he chooses to blame\"). \"My wife is not the issue here! I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she does not, that is her problem, not mine, just as the rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility, regardless of who he chooses to blame. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs. Some Chinaman took them from me in Korea. But I went out and achieved anyway. I cannot solve your problems, sir, only you can.\" [Note: In hindsight, Mr. Lebowski was no different class-wise from the Dude - he was also a 'bum.' By film's end, he was revealed to be a complete phony and hypocrite, a deceitful individual, a faker who was living off other's wealth, and was subsisting only on an allowance from his adult daughter.] Mr. Lebowski insisted that he was not responsible for compensating anyone - prompting the Dude to briefly spurt out: \"Oh, F--k it!\" The philanthropist had no patience with the Dude: \"Yes, that's your answer. That's your answer to everything. Tattoo it on your forehead. Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! My advice to you is to do what your parents did! Get a job, sir! The bums will always lose! Do you hear me, Lebowski?! The bums will always lose!\" In the hallway (with a black-and-white checkboard tile pattern!) on his way out of the Lebowski estate, the Dude facetiously told Brandt that he had been permitted to \"take any rug in the house.\" One of the mansion's workmen helped to carry out a beautiful, rolled-up Persian rug on his shoulder behind the Dude, as they exited onto the outer balcony of the home. [Note: The exteriors of the Lebowski mansion were not shot in the same location, but at a Holmby Hills residence at 10231 Charing Cross Road, directly across the street from Hugh Hefner's famed Playboy Mansion.] The Introduction of Bunny, Lebowski's Wife: The Dude immediately noticed the millionaire's sexy, very young, free-spirited, sunbathing nymphomaniac trophy wife 'Bunny' Lebowski (Tara Reid). [Note: She was one of the porn stars of sleazy king mobster, porn czar Jackie Treehorn, referred to by the thugs, who owed Treehorn money.] She was painting her toenails with dark emerald green nail polish, and proposed a very sexualized question - she asked the Dude to \"blow\" on her feet to dry them: \"I can't blow that far.\" [Note: This scene of the painting of toenails of a young temptress resembled a similar scene in the opening of Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962). Bunny's request also echoed young Lauren Bacall's double-entendre question to co-star Humphrey Bogart in To Have and Have Not (1944): \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together - and blow.\"] She mentioned that her nihilist boyfriend nearby wouldn't care, Uli Kunkel (Peter Stormare), who was drunkenly passed out in the outdoor swimming pool on a float: \"Uli doesn't care about anything. He's a nihilist.\" She then propositioned him: \"I'll suck your cock for $1,000 dollars....Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred.\" The Dude answered: \"Uhhhh...I'm just gonna go find a cash machine.\""}, {"url": "https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/the-big-lebowski-1117436792/#!", "page_content": "Hot directors coming off major successes often follow up with quirky, more idiosyncratic pictures and so it is with the Coen brothers\u2019 follow-up to \u201cFargo.\u201d Spiked with wonderfully funny sequences and some brilliantly original notions, \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d a pseudo-mystery thriller with a keen eye and ear for societal mores and modern figures of speech, nonetheless adds up to considerably less than the sum of its often scintillating parts, simply because the film doesn\u2019t seem to be about anything other than its own cleverness. World premiered at Sundance as a special screening, this Gramercy release looks headed for a mixed critical and luke-warm B.O. reception upon its release in March.\n\nNot really a detective story, but taking the form of one with its v.o. narration and plot loaded with kidnapping, missing money, violent thugs, sultry women, wealthy society figures with shadowy motives, colorful fringe characters, convoluted twists and turns, and evocative L.A. settings, pic throws several marginal middle-aged men still mentally stuck in the \u201960s into a more mercenary \u201990s context.\n\nDisjuncture supplies plenty of amusing cultural frissons, but nothing carrying any meaningful insights or commentary, resulting in a work whose many momentary pleasures almost immediately afterward seem hollow and without resonance.\n\nA good example of this is the wonderful title sequence, in which, to the accompaniment of the Sons of the Pioneers\u2019 \u201cTumbling Tumbleweeds,\u201d some beautifully choreographed camera moves follow an actual tumbleweed as it travels across L.A., ending up on the beach. Very funny in a classically absurdist way, yes, but it has nothing to do with anything else in the picture and therefore just stands on its own to take and then leave.\n\nStory clicks in immediately thereafter, when the Dude (Jeff Bridges), whose real name is Jeff Lebowski and is described as probably the laziest man in Los Angeles County, is beaten up by two goons looking for a multi-millionaire known as the Big Lebowski, whose wife owes their boss money. The fact that the Dude lives in a ramshackle Venice bungalow doesn\u2019t seem to have tipped the thugs off to the fact they have the wrong guy; and what pisses the Dude off the most is that, gratuitously, one of them urinates on his living room rug.\n\nSporting long hair, goatee and trademark baggy shorts, the Dude, goaded on by his Vietnam vet bowling buddy Walter (John Goodman), tracks down the other Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), a Pasadena philanthropist, and walks away with what he came for, a replacement for his damaged rug. While at the mansion, the Dude meets the old man\u2019s young sexpot wife Bunny (Tara Reid), and it isn\u2019t long before, to his astonishment, the Dude is paged by Lebowski to deliver a $1 million ransom for the return of his wife, who has been kidnapped.\n\nIn the interim, snappily paced film bowls a few frames with the Dude, Walter and their clueless pal Donny (Steve Buscemi), three low-lifes who spend every minute possible at the lanes. Donny is so slow he barely gets a word in edgewise, while the Dude and Walter, the latter an amusingly belligerent big bully who can scarcely engage in a discussion without dragging \u2018Nam into it, constantly argue and berate one another.\n\nUtterly sure of himself in the silliest military manner, Walter insinuates himself into his friend\u2019s ransom return, then royally screws it up; everything he undertakes, in fact, is done with unquestioned assurance, and is completely wrong.\n\nNot that the Dude has any better idea what\u2019s really going on around him. The kind of guy who spends his free time smoking weed and listening to tapes of his own past bowling triumphs on his Walkman, the Dude\u2019s laid-back, pacifistic stance toward life is fully expressed by his two favorite phrases, \u201cTake it easy, man,\u201d and \u201cWhen something goes wrong, fuck it.\u201d In fact, the way the many characters from different strata of life talk is perhaps the film\u2019s most subtle yet outstanding attribute, as their speech patterns \u2014 be they \u201960s hippie-ese, Reagan-Bush era pronouncements or up-to-the-minute street talk \u2014 represent a study in the avoidance of precise and direct verbal communication.\n\nIn the wake of the botched ransom drop, the Dude is pulled into the multiple schemes of Lebowski\u2019s smart-tongued daughter, Maude (Julianne Moore), a provocative erotic artist; the clutches of a big-time porno publisher (Ben Gazzara); and has sordid run-ins with cops and more tough guys, as the fates of Bunny and the three bowling buddies play themselves out.\n\nAlong the way, there are some amazing \u2014 and literal \u2014 flights of fancy, as the Dude is seen soaring like a freaky Superman over Los Angeles and, later, in an imaginary erotic film, called \u201cGutterballs.\u201d There is the torrent of verbal humor; any number of great and absurd gags, such as the soldier of fortune-like Walter turning out to be an observant (converted) Jew, and a soaking Dude being tortured by having an angry marmot tossed into his bath water. There are some brilliant cameos, most of all an astonishing turn by John Turturro as a flamboyant Latin sex offender who suddenly turns up at the bowling alley to threaten the boys with his prowess \u2014 at bowling and as a criminal.\n\nBridges throws himself into the leading role with glee, but the Dude is a character who produces an equivocal reaction; on the one hand, he is a classic ordinary man thrown into an extraordinary situation, while on the other he is a loser with no backbone who provides no motivation for the viewer to get behind him.\n\nAs the blustery Walter, Goodman is vastly entertaining, Moore is bracingly assertive in a nice change of pace role, and Philip Seymour Hoffman milks surplus laughs out of his part as Lebowski\u2019s officious assistant.\n\nWith everyone clearly plugged into the Coens\u2019 wavelength, entire cast shines.\n\nPic is technically immaculate, as usual with the brothers, with Roger Deakins contributing a standout job behind the camera and the numerous bowling scenes being ingeniously covered from every imaginable perspective. One of the film\u2019s indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack, which mixes Carter Burwell\u2019s original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers."}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/mark_fite", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 25% Off the Lip (2004)\n\nLowest Rated: 25% Off the Lip (2004)\n\nBirthday: Not Available\n\nBirthplace: Not Available\n\nMark Fite was a vibrant source of comedy on the big screen, bringing laughter and joy to many audiences over the course of his Hollywood career.

They based the character on a movie producer and distributor named Jeff Dowd, a familiar figure at film festivals, who is tall, large, shaggy and aboil with enthusiasm. Dowd is much more successful than Lebowski (he has played an important role in the Coens' careers as indie filmmakers), but no less a creature of the moment. Both dudes depend on improvisation and inspiration much more than organization.\n\nIn spirit, \"The Big Lebowski'' resembles the Coens' \"Raising Arizona,'' with its large cast of peculiar characters and its strangely wonderful dialogue. Here, in a film set at the time of the Gulf War, are characters whose speech was shaped by earlier times: Vietnam (Walter), the flower power era (the Dude) and \"Twilight Zone'' (Donny). Their very notion of reality may be shaped by the limited ways they have to describe it. One of the pleasures of \"Fargo'' was the way the Coens listened carefully to how their characters spoke. Here, too, note that when the In & Out Burger shop is suggested for a rendezvous, the Dude supplies its address: That's the sort of precise information he would possess.\n\nAs the film opens, the Dude is visited by two enforcers for a porn king (Ben Gazzara) who is owed a lot of money by the Big Lebowski's wife. The goons of course have the wrong Lebowski, but before they figure that out, one already has urinated on the Dude's rug, causing deep enmity: \"That rug really tied the room together,'' the Dude mourns. Walter, the Viet vet, leads the charge for revenge. Borrowing lines directly from President George Bush on TV, he vows that \"this aggression will not stand'' and urges the Dude to \"draw a line in the sand.'' The Dude visits the other Lebowski (David Huddleston), leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself enlisted in the millionaire's schemes. The rich Lebowski, in a wheelchair and gazing into a fireplace like Maj. Amberson in \"The Magnificent Ambersons,'' tells the Dude that his wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), has been kidnapped. He wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. This plan is opposed by Maude (Julianne Moore), the Big Lebowski's daughter from an earlier marriage. Moore, who played a porno actress in \"Boogie Nights,'' here plays an altogether different kind of erotic artist; she covers her body with paint and hurls herself through the air in a leather harness.\n\nLos Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he's socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.) Some may complain \"The Big Lebowski'' rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style. The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings. The spirit is established right at the outset, when the narrator (Sam Elliott) starts out well enough, but eventually confesses he's lost his train of thought."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/reviews", "page_content": "8 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nSounds like a Three Stooges short no? But wait and see: \"The Big Lebowski\" is an American 2-hour film from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is of course by the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers and even without gigantic awards attention, this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years. This is also thanks to the cast, not just to the script. There are three performers in here who won acting Oscars later in their careers, namely the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and of course Jeff Bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it, even if I might give the edge to John Goodman (Argo, Roseanne) here in terms of who I'd pick as the film's MVP. But there's also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like Tara Reid or RHCP's Flea. And then there's Coen regulars like Stormare, Buscemi (both Fargo) and Turturro (Barton Fink). A lot of fun for sure. The Coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavioral patterns. Very well done and this tendency has elevated many Coen films. And as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem, there is still something authentic to them. You never get the impression that you are actually watching actors in roles here, but they feel like actual people. Of course, on the other hand, not everything is perfect with this movie. The scenes with Julianne Moore didn't do too much for me, especially her early scenes. Sam Elliott I also could have done without. I like his narration voice, that would have been enough although his conversation with Bridges' character was also fine in the middle of the film and how they talk about cowboy looks, profanity etc. But with him saying the final words, the film did not exactly close at its best I suppose. Also kinda feel he has a tendency to always play the same character and it seems that back then he looked exactly the way he looks today. But for every negative criticism I have, there are at least five positive things for me to say about this film. The best example is really everything involving John Goodman. His scene with the gun was a riot, only the Coens can depict an actually dangerous situation in a manner as hilarious and entertaining as they did here. His scene in the car when they are about to give the money to the abductors is even better and how he keeps talking about beating the crap out of them. And it's no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into the three German nihilists. Poor Buscemi's character. Or, again about Goodman, his recurring words directed at Buscemi's character. Or how he keeps mentioning Vietnam to show how tough he is. And if we are talking about recurring references already, Bridges' character has his own too of course, such as how he keeps ordering the same drink, even if they may not be as good as Goodman's. The dialogue writing is top-notch here for sure and even if this is always the case with the Coens and their films, we should not take it for granted. Too many examples. One that stayed in the mind for me is the \"let me take another look\" (or something like that) when the bad guys keep pushing his head inside the toilet early on. What a cool dude. No pun intended.\n\n\n\nAs a result, we get many hilarious scenes like at the bowling alley early on (e.g. the gun scene) or also all the scenes with the Dude and Lebowski. I had to laugh so hard at some of these. Yes the film maybe got a bit worse in the second half and maybe the story took two or three plot twists and roads that may have been too absurd, but at this point it doesn't really matter anymore as you are truly sucked in by the entertainment. It's also not a film where you really wonder what will happen to the protagonists or care about them deeply. Instead, you just enjoy the moment and what is happening to them this very instant. Good acting, strong writing, hilarious scenes that turn the eventual outcome into one of the very best of 1998, especially in the first 60 minutes. So of course I give it four stars out of five. I (highly) recommend checking it out if you are one of the very few who have not yet seen it. Also a must-see for bowling lovers. And as for the Coens' quality, just pick Tara Reid, whose career has gone down the drain considerably, but so talented people like the duo of writers and directors here effortlessly install her in a movie that has turned into a classic without any bad impact at all. Admittedly, this is also because of her looks of course because really she does not have a lot to put on display in terms of range and versatility. She has that conversation with the Dude early on at the mansion and finally we see her in the car and that's it, but maybe this lack of a challenge was why they picked her. I immediately had to think of another character in an early Tarantino movie. I am sure you know who I am talking about. Anyway, let's not drift away from this one as there is a lot more to say here. For example, I mentioned the scene in the car. This was one example of how effortless good the Coens are when it comes to storytelling. We find out that indeed she was never kidnapped. We also see she still has all her toes and we see where the actually severed toe came from in another scene in a bar (poor girl!) and this is also pretty unique how the Coens are so strong in depicting somewhat violent moments in comedic light, which always feels pretty unique with them. The only one who does it at least almost as good is again the aforementioned Tarantino. But while he was my favorite earlier and I still like him a lot, I am 100% Team Coen Bros now because honestly, it feels as if I love each and every single film they made. This one here is no exception. It took me until 2017 to watch it for the first time and it was already really good there, but now in 2020 I got the chance to watch it again, for the first time on the big screen of an open air cinema and this was when I really fell in love with this movie. Okay, that is maybe a bit too much to say, but I liked it really a lot and finally see why so many others do too. It has so many funny moments from beginning to end that stem from the great writing, but also equally good acting for sure. These cast members pulled it off perfectly. And with that, I am not just talking about those at the center of the story (also the rich Lebowski for example, sadly not too many know the actor, may he rest in peace), but also those that have very little screen time such as Turturro's character, who is still hilarious though and also the crass difference between his scenes as a colorful bowling starlet and the exact opposite how he has to ring at everybody's door and tell them about his past. Or the German nihilists. And just people who only have one scene. That is always the Coen's strength. They make every character so damn entertaining. And this film is also a success from the time/political perspective. Could they get away with the Saddam jokes today? And pay attention to how the Dude is considered the ultimate Cannabis consumer in popular media nowadays, but you never see him roll a joint. Times were different back then when it came to depicting drug (ab)use in the movies. But it also shows how progressive and ahead of its time the film and filmmakers were/are. So no matter what perspective you take, this is a movie you may not want to miss out on under any circumstance and I am glad hardly anybody did looking at how many have seen it. The story may not be perfect, but it never really is 100% about the story anyway. You forget quickly how the Dude and Goodman's character realize it was all a scam maybe a little too quickly because you are so in awe about all the wonderfully delightful and entertaining moments like the silent boy whose paper they find in the car etc. Like I said, mentioning everything that is funny in this movie is virtually impossible because I would run into the character limit soon and still not have listed half of it all. That is why you need to experience this wonderful film yourself. Actually it made me consider buying a rug again, one that really works the place. Nuff said. Highly, highly recommended. Also some wonderful use of music here I have to put on my player immediately, such as the Eagles song (sorry Dude, it's good), \"what condition my condition was in\" or a not too famous version of \"Viva las Vegas\". All gems. The Coens are really this good with music too in their works. And you also get the usual Jew reference (special occasion here) showing us they do not take themselves seriously at all, a tradition that mounted with full speed into the even better \"A Serious Man\" later on. A gem that movie as well. This one here too.

There were echoes of writer Raymond Chandler's writings behind the film noir The Big Sleep (1946) in its tale of LA neo-noir sleaze: the opening scene narrated by the off-screen, drawling cowboy Stranger (Sam Elliott) as the Sons of the Pioneers sang about \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\", introduced bearded hippie, disheveled, long-haired pot-smoking, laid-back slacker, unemployed slob Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), wandering in the aisles of a Los Angeles Ralph's grocery store late at night in the year 1990, and smelling a carton of Half & Half before writing a check for $.69 cents\n\nupon the often-stoned Lebowski's return home to his Venice Beach (California) bungalow, he was assaulted by two debt-collecting thugs (Mark Pellegrino) and Woo (Philip Moon), who alleged that The Dude owed them money: (\"Don't f--k with us! Your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn. That means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn\") - they roughed him up and then Woo peed on the Dude's favorite carpet; apparently, he had been mistaken for fat, wheelchair-bound, philanthropic Pasadena tycoon-millionaire Jeff Lebowski, the real \"Big Lebowski\"; the Dude complained to the thugs: (\"No, no, don't do that! Not on the rug, man\"), but then after realizing that the Dude was the wrong individual, the goons took off: (\"He looks like a f--kin' loser...F--king time wasted. Thanks a lot, asshole\")\n\nthe bowling-loving Dude commiserated with his bowling buddies: uptight nutcase Vietnam war veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi), about his ruined, valued rug that was peeded upon by the Chinaman Woo (\"Yeah, man, it really tied the room together\")\n\nthe Dude, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, visited the Pasadena, CA home of wheel-chair bound philanthropist millionaire Jeffrey 'The Big' Lebowski (David Huddleston) - his namesake; he was there to complain about and demand compensation from Lebowski for the mistaken attack by two hoods (due to a mix-up of addresses for \"Lebowski\"); the thugs were really targeting Mr. Lebowski's indebted, promiscuous trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid), a porn actress\n\nthe Dude introduced himself to \"The Big\" Lebowski: (\"You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, uh, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or uh, you know, El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing\")\n\nMr. Lebowski offered employment advice to the laid-back Dude - (\"My wife is not the issue here! I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she does not, that is her problem, not mine, just as the rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility, regardless of who he chooses to blame. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs. Some Chinaman took them from me in Korea. But I went out and achieved anyway. I cannot solve your problems, sir, only you can....Yes, that's your answer. That's your answer to everything. Tattoo it on your forehead. Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! My advice to you is to do what your parents did! Get a job, sir! The bums will always lose! Do you hear me, Lebowski?! The bums will always lose!\"); in response, the Dude briefly answered: \"Oh, F--k it!\" and left\n\non his way out of the Lebowski estate, the Dude met up with the millionaire's sexy young trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid), a free-spirited nymphomaniac, and one of the porn stars of sleaze king mobster Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara); while painting her toenails, she offered the Dude: (\"I'll suck your cock for $1,000 dollars\")\n\nafterwards, the Dude was hired (for a promised $20K) by his namesake to serve as a courier to deliver ransom money of $1 million to free the allegedly-kidnapped Bunny, although it was suspected that Bunny had kidnapped herself\n\nalong the way, he also met up with Lebowski's idiosyncratic, eccentric and estranged daughter - an erotic, super-stoic, avante garde feminist artist named Maude (Julianne Moore in a small, comic caricaturized role) - who exhibited living art by soaring nude over her canvas in a flying trapeze harness; she also delivered a \"vagina monologue\": (\"Does the female form make you uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?...My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal, which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina....Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say, whereas without batting an eye, a man will refer to his dick or his rod or his Johnson\")\n\nin one of the film's most unique sequences (\"Gutterballs\"), the Dude experienced a fanciful Busby-Berkeley inspired musical dream about bowling and pron after being slipped a mickey in his White Russian cocktail by Jackie Treehorn; the Dude's dream was filled with images including the Viking Queen, Saddam Hussein, and bowling\n\nat the Dude's bowling alley, competitive, flamboyant, lavender-jump-suited Latino bowler Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) (with a long painted pinky fingernail on one of his ring-laden fingers, who seductively licked his bowling ball) rolled a strike, then did a strange victory dance to the Spanish-tinged tune of Hotel California; then he threatened the Dude: \"Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy s--t with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, and stick it up your ass and pull the f--kin' trigger 'til it goes click....Nobody f--ks with the Jesus...\"\n\nBowler Jesus Quintana Seductively Licking His Bowling Ball\n\nBowler Jesus Quintana: \"Nobody f--ks with the Jesus...\" at the bowling alley during competition, the Dude's bowling buddy Walter told rival bowler Smokey (Jimmie Dale Gilmore) that he had committed a minor infraction of bowling league rules by fouling over the line - accompanied by scary, gun-wielding threats: \"You're entering a world of pain\" and \"Mark it zero\"\n\nWalter: \"You're entering a world of pain\"\n\n'The Dude' Scattering Donny's Ashes in the Wind later in the confusing plot, the Dude theorized that Mr. Lebowski had chosen him as a courier (with a briefcase empty of cash) for the $1 million to pay off Bunny's kidnappers, assuming that the \"deadbeat\" would screw things up and could be used as a scapegoat; Lebowski was a fraud and phony who was actually poorer than he claimed; his intention was never to get Bunny back. Instead, he wanted her dead while he embezzled the 'ransom money' derived from his charity program/foundation - the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers. The ransom demands came not from pornographer Treehorn, to whom Bunny owed money, but from three opportunistic German nihilists (one of whom was Bunny's boyfriend) who thought they could con Bunny's rich husband Mr. Lebowski with ransom demands\n\nafter Donny's death following a fatal heart attack, Walter and the 'Dude' prepared to scatter Donny's cremated ashes from a Folger's coffee can on a windy cliff-side; first, Walter delivered a rambling eulogy: (\"Donny was a good bowler and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors and bowling. And as a surfer, he explored the beaches of Southern California, from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo and up to Pismo. He died, he died, as so many men of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright, flowering young men at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc, and Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. So did Donny. Donny who loved bowling. And so, Theodore Donald Karabatsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Good night, sweet prince\"); however, the breeze blew the ashes back - and all over the Dude's face\n\nin the concluding scene set at a bar in the bowling alley, the Stranger discovered how the Dude was doing: \"Oh, you know, strikes and gutters, ups and downs.\" As the Dude wandered off, he bid goodbye: \"The Dude abides.\" The Stranger expressed his hope that the Dude and Walter would win their upcoming bowling tournament, and stated that Maude was pregnant with a \"little Lebowski\" - not with Maude's surname but with the Dude's surname!\n\n\n\nIntroduction of 'The Dude' in a Grocery Store\n\n\n\n\n\nWoo Peeing on the Dude's Rug: \"No, no, don't do that!

How did critics feel about a certain movie at the time, and do we see it differently now? In this entry, Chris Coffel explores the original critical reception of the 1996 Jim Carrey black comedy The Cable Guy.\n\nIn the mid-\u201990s, Jim Carrey was arguably the biggest movie star in the world. In 1994 alone, he had three films that racked up more than $100 million each at the box office. The following year Carrey would add two more to his resume that each eclipsed $200 million. Carrey\u2019s success was primarily due to the schtick he had mastered. With the unique ability to contort his face in a million different ways, and a manic energy unmatched, Carrey blossomed into a slapstick specialist with the golden touch. Audiences flocked to see the actor talk from his ass or make the most annoying sounds possible. It was dumb, brainless fun, but it worked.\n\nIn 1996, at the peak of his powers, Carrey signed on to star in The Cable Guy, bagging a then-record $20 million payday. Ben Stiller was hired to direct, Matthew Broderick joined as the co-lead, and the movie was shaping up to be another hit in Carrey\u2019s run of good fortune. But rather than be another light-hearted 90 minutes relying on Carrey\u2019s charisma, The Cable Guy is something much different. It still features Carrey\u2019s signature slapstick comedy and its fair share of iconic moments. Still, it\u2019s a much darker story about an intrusive, lonely man raised by television, desperately seeking some form of human connection.\n\nThe Cable Guy was still a box office hit, but the critical response was much more mixed. Critics and audiences of the day had a preconceived idea of what a Jim Carrey movie should be, and this wasn\u2019t it. The film was criticized for missing the mark, misusing Carrey\u2019s talents, and being flat-out mean. While many noted that the film was going for a more thought-provoking approach than Carrey\u2019s earlier works, the consensus was that Carrey was doing the same thing, but it felt out of place in this darker film.\n\nThe Cable Guy didn\u2019t derail Carrey\u2019s career. The rest of the decade was very kind to the actor, with more hits to follow, but The Cable Guy was viewed as the black sheep, often becoming the butt of jokes. Time has been much kinder to the film. In the twenty-five years since its release, it\u2019s developed a growing cult following. Today the film is much more appreciated, with Carrey\u2019s performance earning praise and the film\u2019s themes on obsession and the influence of media becoming more relevant.\n\nWhat Critics Said About The Cable Guy in 1996\n\n\u201cThe Cable Guy is a hateful, bloodless monster,\u201d Joe Morgenstern wrote in his scathing review for the Wall Street Journal. Morgenstern felt the film leaned way too hard into the lead \u201ccharacter\u2019s hatefulness,\u201d referencing the film\u2019s basketball scene in which Carrey ruins the fun by being too aggressive and shattering the backboard. Morgenstern wondered out loud if perhaps Carrey\u2019s large payday gave him too much freedom. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence at all of anyone having taken the star or his handlers aside to say, at some critical juncture, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s no script here,\u2019 or \u2018Stop, what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t funny.'\u201d\n\nChris Kaltenbach of the Baltimore Sun echoed similar sentiments regarding Carrey. \u201cHe\u2019s over the top, acting on such a huge adrenalin high that his face seems constantly ready to explode,\u201d Kaltenbach wrote. \u201cHe mugs, he twitches, he screams. His eyes pop out, the veins in his neck bulge, his voice takes on the timbre of an air-raid siren.\u201d Kaltenbach\u2019s main issue was that Carrey gives his typical performance, but he\u2019s the bad guy this time. And Carrey, as the bad guy, is off-putting and \u201csimply uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nIn his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote that the film struggled by \u201ctaking itself too seriously.\u201d According to Turan, the film tried too hard to sell us on this backstory about a character with a dark past instead of just allowing funny people to be funny. Turan points to Carrey having an \u201cunnerving edge\u201d but is still too funny to resist breaking into laughter.\n\nJane Horwitz had a pretty mixed take on The Cable Guy in her review for South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Horwitz wrote that \u201cCarrey\u2019s wild-eyed performance as a lonely and disturbed cable TV installer occasionally verges on brilliance\u201d but lacks any \u201cemotional truth.\u201d For Horwitz, the movie gets stuck in the middle. It\u2019s not funny, and it\u2019s not scary, so what is it?\n\nRoger Ebert awarded the film two out of four stars. Like Horwitz, Ebert was left confused by what the movie wanted us to feel. \u201cWe want to like Jim Carrey,\u201d Ebert wrote. \u201cA movie that makes us dislike him is a strategic mistake.\u201d In Ebert\u2019s eyes, The Cable Guy landed in this weird spot by mistake. It was supposed to be just another Jim Carrey comedy, but the darker elements of the story took over, and no one knew what to do at that point.\n\nOf course, The Cable Guy wasn\u2019t completely shunned. In his review for the New York Daily News, David Kehr praised Carrey for making a \u201cgutsy move\u201d by taking on a risk that would cause most commercial projects to shy away. Kehr praised Carrey for his ability to keep \u201csomething sadly human alive in his character.\u201d He felt Broderick was the perfect counter, calling him \u201clikable enough to preserve the audience\u2019s sympathy but with a streak of selfishness that makes his fate seem slightly deserved.\u201d\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel\u2018s Jay Boyar called the film an \u201coddly intelligent comedy\u201d and questioned whether or not it would be too smart for his fans. Boyar gave Stiller credit for providing \u201cCarrey a reliable structure to play around in.\u201d From there, Carrey used his trademark \u201csilliness and slapstick\u201d but did so in a way not previously done. Instead of playing it for over-the-top laughs, it\u2019s a hard, edgy satire.\n\nWhat Critics Say About The Cable Guy Today\n\nEverything that felt so strange and out of place when The Cable Guy was first released seems to make a lot more sense now. And people are starting to take notice. While revisiting the film for its twentieth anniversary for the AV Club, A.A. Dowd had a pretty simple explanation for why people didn\u2019t like it: \u201cAudiences were freaked out by it.\u201d And they should have been freaked out. Carrey threw a fastball when everyone was expecting his whacky screwball. It was a risky move, but as Dowd points out, it \u201cwas also the first sign that there was more to its in-demand leading man than rubbery features and a brave, almost pathological willingness to look foolish.\u201d\n\nDylan Gray praised The Cable Guy in a column for The Daily Illini, calling it an \u201cincredibly cynical, poignant and succinct indictment of the modern media environment.\u201d Gray writes that the film isn\u2019t perfect and maybe doesn\u2019t even succeed if viewed as a comedy. \u201cBut when read as a critique of the modern media world 20 years before its time, the beauty of the film is much more pronounced. Media saturation is dangerous, and living outside of the fabricated world is important to our psychological adjustment.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Chris Cabin of Slant called the film Stiller\u2019s best work as a director, noting his use of Dutch angles and his ability to handle a dream sequence. \u201cThe times had to catch up with The Cable Guy,\u201d Cabins writes, \u201cand now seen in hindsight, the film seems as bold an American comedic statement as was available in the mid-to-late \u201990s.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s easy to see how The Cable Guy caught so many people off guard back in 1996. It\u2019s not uncommon for A-list stars to veer off course and try something different than what their reputation suggests. But they usually step over to the arthouse world and do something low-key that only reaches audiences that are guaranteed to like it. Carrey decided to get weird out in the open with other big stars while taking a record-setting paycheck. The audience didn\u2019t have the chance to prepare properly. These days we\u2019re better prepared. Not only are we more accustomed to the range Carrey has as a performer, but the film\u2019s subject matter is more relevant than ever. The Cable Guy may focus on its titular character, but it\u2019s really a snapshot of America\u2019s obsession with tabloid news and the influence of what we choose to consume and how we consume it. In the social media, TMZ-crazed society we currently live in, The Cable Guy hits harder than ever.\n\nRelated Topics: Jim Carrey, The Cable Guy, They Said What"}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fite", "page_content": "Fite in 2012\n\nMark Elliott Fite is an American actor and comedian.\n\nFite is a founding member of comedy troupe 2 Headed Dog with comedians Jim Turner, Dave Allen and Craig Anton.

And Sandler\u2019s sweet but sometimes volcanic man-child performance in the movie is so indelibly linked to the story that he left big shoes for anyone else to fill.\n\nSet in 1980s New Jersey, the musical is about 20something pro wedding singer Robbie Hart, who gets dumped at the altar by his fianc\u00e9e, then falls for catering waitress Julia, who is newly engaged to someone else.\n\nDirector Larry Raben honors the script but he also finds many fresh moments of visual humor, particularly in the finale, which is different from the movie and quite funny. Choreographer Luke H. Jacobs has impressively created some truly eye-popping dance scenes, including a splashy homage to the 1983 film \u201cFlashdance\u201d and a sexy nightclub dance scene.\n\nLiliana Rodriguez, as Holly, in a dance scene from Moonlight Stage Productions\u2019 \u201cThe Wedding Singer\u201d at Moonlight Amphitheatre.\n\n(Courtesy of Karli Cadel)\n\nBrett Benowitz, who leads the cast as Robbie, has a gentle everyman quality, and good singing and guitar skills, but he isn\u2019t the explosive and expressive physical comedian that the role demands. Megan Carmitchel is a perfect fit for the role of Julia. She\u2019s sweet, sincere and a very strong singer and dancer.\n\nAlthough \u201cWedding Singer\u201d is Robbie\u2019s story, it\u2019s the women like Carmitchel in this production who steal the show. They include Liliana Rodriguez as Julia\u2019s bestie Holly; Janaya Mahealani Jones as Robbie\u2019s ex, Linda; and Melinda Gilb as Robbie\u2019s rapping granny Rosie. Evan White is also very good as Julia\u2019s sleazy fianc\u00e9 Glen. The principal cast is rounded out with Eduardo Enrikez, Jacob Hoff and Tracey Freeman-Shaw, and there\u2019s a multitalented 13-member ensemble who dance, sing and alternate in dozens of roles in the 2-1/2-hour show.\n\nMusic director-conductor Tamara Paige leads a 12-piece rock \u2018n\u2019 roll orchestra in the pit; Jennifer Edwards designed lighting, Brandon Boomizad designed sound and Peter Herman designed a multitude of wigs that amusingly re-create some of the worst hairstyles of the \u201880s, including mullets, frizzy perms and Boy George\u2019s ribbon-bedecked braids.\n\n\u201cThe Wedding Singer\u201d drew big laughs from the opening night crowd, with some audience members reciting some of the movie\u2019s most famous lines along with the actors onstage. Has \u201cThe Wedding Singer\u201d improved in its transition from film to stage? Maybe not. But it\u2019s still fun and lively with some terrific performances at Moonlight.\n\n\u2018The Wedding Singer\u2019\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Through June 24\n\nWhere: Moonlight Amphitheatre, Brengle Terrace Park, 1250 Vale Terrace Drive, Vista\n\nTickets: $14 to $58\n\nPhone: (760) 724-2110\n\nOnline: moonlightstage.com\n\npam.kragen@sduniontribune.com"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Mark_Fite", "page_content": "What we do.
