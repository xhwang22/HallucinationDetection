In recent years, we have seen campaigns to rewrite the history of several democratic nations in a way that undermines their solidarity as communities, their sense of achievement, even their very legitimacy.\n\nThese \u2018culture wars\u2019, pursued in the media, in public spaces, in museums, universities, schools, civil services, local government, business corporations and even churches, are particularly virulent in North America, Australasia and the United Kingdom. Activists assert that \u2018facing up\u2019 to a past presented as overwhelmingly and permanently shameful and guilt-laden is the way to a better and fairer future. We see no evidence that this is true. On the contrary, tendentious and even blatantly false readings of history are creating or aggravating divisions, resentments, and even violence. We do not take the view that our histories are uniformly praiseworthy\u2014that would be absurd. But we reject as equally absurd the claim that they are essentially shameful.\n\nWe agree that history consists of many opinions and many voices. But this does not mean that all opinions are valid, and certainly none should be imposed as a new orthodoxy. We intend to challenge distortions of history, and to provide context, explanation and balance in a debate in which dogmatism is too often preferred to analysis, and condemnation to understanding.\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe are an independent group of scholars with a wide range of opinions on many subjects, but with the shared conviction that history requires careful interpretation of complex evidence, and should not be a vehicle for facile propaganda. We have established the History Reclaimed group as a non-profit making company limited by guarantee.\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\nBella d\u2019Abrera\n\nis Director of the Foundations of Western Civilization Program at the Institute of Public Affairs, Australia.

This status will enable the student to attend the ten guest seminars and dinners, and to meet the guest lecturers, but does not require the submission of written work. Associate Students are not registered for and do not receive, the MA degree.\n\nGraduate Study in Military History\n\nWhat our students say\n\n\u201cI found Buckingham\u2019s MA in Military History by Research a very rewarding experience. After a business career in the technology sector I was able to finally devote some time to my passion for Military History. The task seemed daunting at first as it had been a long time since I was last in education and I had no knowledge of how to conduct historical research. However, the introductory course of lectures provided a solid study framework and detailed follow up discussions with my tutor enabled me to focus in on a specific historical area of interest and, more importantly, identify a particular question that needed answering.\n\nThe research-based nature of the course means at this point you embark on a solo process of discovery. Reading the existing literature and sifting the archives, both online and in person, you follow leads and gradually piece together the parts of your chosen puzzle. The course is demanding and academically rigorous with a high standard of work expected. However, the tutors are excellent and always there to support and guide your progress and check your work is of the required standard. Writing the dissertation is challenging but once completed it is a very satisfying feeling to know you have contributed to the historiography and understanding of your chosen area.\n\nWhilst most students in my intake took the one-year full-time course I undertook the two-year part-time route and found it allowed me the time and space to investigate my chosen specialist area and really enjoy the whole process without pressure. If you have the time, it may be an option to consider.\n\nIf undertaking a masters currently seems too much of a commitment I would highly recommend becoming an associate just to attend the MA course\u2019s accompanying series of illuminating evening events hosted by Professor Saul David. Each evening involves a standalone lecture given by an eminent historian followed by a dinner and conversation. It is highly enjoyable to spend time in the company of a diverse group of people with a common passion and to be able to talk to some of the biggest names in Military History. Even though I have completed my Masters I intend to be an associate for many years to come!\n\nAndrew Thompson, Master\u2019s (distinction), 2021\n\n\u201cThe MA by Research in Military History at The University of Buckingham offers students the opportunity to channel their passion and intellectual curiosity into an academic endeavour full of reward.\n\nThe research seminars delivered by Professor Saul David equip the student early on with a solid foundation to build on, along with a road map to begin drawing out one\u2019s chosen topic. Accompanying these are lectures from speakers at the apex of their field, which are both informative and inspiring, set within a comfortable environment conducive to open debate.\n\nMoreover, the student support at Buckingham is second to none, with administrators on hand to answer any questions and avoid any pitfalls emerging, along with librarians available to assist in seeking out rare books. Taken together, the MA by Research in Military History guarantees a unique experience and provides the necessary tools to succeed.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the course and found the whole experience both character building and rewarding. It provided an excellent platform to develop a keen interest into an extensive academic project, under the watchful eyes of expert supervision. I look forward to my next project within this space.\u201d\n\nScott Sherriff, Master\u2019s (distinction), 2020\n\n\u201cI completed the one-year Research MA in Military History in 2012 and subsequently went on to complete a PhD also at The University of Buckingham.\n\nLike most students, I embarked on the MA course with a longstanding interest in military history but little understanding of the skills and disciplines involved in academic research. The unique and exciting quality of the Buckingham programme is that it enables an interested amateur as I certainly was then to tackle a historical question that is entirely new and to produce a work that can withstand rigorous professional scrutiny within an incredibly short timescale.\n\nIf the opportunity provided by the Buckingham course is exciting, its strength lies in the way it combines three elements which support and guide the student. The first is a well-crafted introduction to research techniques backed by exercises to develop research and writing skills. This element is relevant and practical and it is adjusted to the needs of the individual. The second is the series of general interest lectures over the first half of the year all provided by first rank historians. These expose students to new historical problems and the latest research and the format over dinner allows genuinely stimulating debate. They provide invaluable context for the student\u2019s individual work. However, the critical element that stands out at Buckingham is the quality of the individual guidance and supervision in selecting a research topic and then executing successive stages. I cannot rate too highly the individual supervision that I and my fellow students received. I think PhD students at the best universities would count themselves fortunate to receive the tailored support of this quality and care and not least time from some of the best historians in the United Kingdom.\n\nI would also like to commend the general administration of the Buckingham MA programme. It is a complex programme with diverse students with different requirements, a complex lecture programme and no dedicated Buckingham owned site in London. Yet the execution from logistics around successive lectures through to the examination of the final thesis and the monitoring of academic standards was close to perfect.\u201d\n\nDr Andy Boyd, PhD, 2015\n\nFor further details contact:\n\nHumanities Research Admissions on +44 (0)1280 827514\n\nEmail: humanitiespg-admissions@buckingham.ac.uk"}, {"url": "https://www.enlightenmentevents.com/uncategorized/webinar-military-history-in-fact-and-fiction-professor-saul-david/", "page_content": "Webinar \u2013 Military History in Fact and Fiction \u2013 Professor Saul David\n\n\n\nSaul David joins us for the first in a series of webinars on August 15th.

On 6 June 1944, the largest armada the world had ever seen appeared on the shores of northern France to open the \u201csecond front\u201d and defeat the Wehrmacht. The fighting was hard and bloody for both sides, and it was not until August that the German defensive line could be broken. Allied material superiority was facing a numerically weaker German force which, however, often showed a fanatical will to fight \u2013 and die. In contrast to most tours, which concentrate very much on the Allied experience of the campaign, we will be looking at \u201cboth sides of the hill\u201d and analyse both the Allied and German armies, their strategies and operational plans, and we will see how these played out on the (tactical) ground for the GI, the Tommy, and the Landser in Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nThe tour will be led by Prof Matthias Strohn, Visiting Professor of Military Studies at the Humanities Research Institute at the University of Buckingham, and, as Senior Associate Fellow, Head of Historical Analysis at the British Army\u2019s think tank, CHACR. Matthias holds a commission in the German Army and has, among other deployments, served on the defence attach\u00e9 staffs at the German embassies in Paris, London and Madrid. He has led over 100 battlefield tours and staff rides. In a previous deployment at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was responsible for Normandy Scholar, a joint academic-military exercise, which takes about 750 Army cadets to Normandy.\n\nDay One:\n\nMeet at Ashford International station, travel on Coach via Eurotunnel to Bayeux. Walking tour of Bayeux and introduction to the Normandy campaign\n\nDay Two:\n\nThe British Sector:\n\nWe explore the airborne attacks on Merville Battery and Pegasus Bridge. We then move on to Gold Beach to analyse the British landings and German counter-measures, and hear about the only VC won on D-Day. We finish the day at the new British D-Day memorial\n\nDay Three:\n\nThe British Sector:\n\nWe visit the German radar station at Douvres, which held out against British attacks until 17 June. We explore the German battery at Longues sur Mer and the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches before moving inland and analysing the battles at Hill 122, the \u2018Verdun of Normandy\u2019. Visit the Bayeux Tapestry Museum\n\nDay Four:\n\nThe American Sector:\n\nTravel to Omaha beach where we learn about the difficult landings and \u201cthe beast of Omaha\u201d. Visit the US cemetery before moving on to Pointe du Hoc to learn about the US Ranger attack on the formidable German defensive position. We visit the German military cemetery at La Cambe and finish the day at the Bayeux Battle of Normandy Museum\n\nDay Five:\n\nReturn to England\n\nThroughout the tour we will be staying in the Hotel Churchill in Bayeux (http://www.hotel-churchill.fr/en/). We considered booking a chateau hotel in the countryside. But the Churchill has the advantage of being situated in the centre of Bayeux, which makes it easy to explore the city on foot. All meals (including non-alcoholic drinks and one alcoholic drink per meal) and entrance fees are included in the tour price of \u00a31,550 for single occupant, and \u00a31,400pp for two sharing a room.\n\nPraise for Saul David and Matthias Str\u00f6hn\u2019s previous tours\n\nMadrid and The Battlefields of the Spanish Civil War, 20-24 October 2021:\n\nJeremy Archer: \u2018Rack my brain as I might, I cannot think of a single thing that I would have done differently. Our trip was a truly excellent balance between warfare, culture and rest and recuperation. Matthias, I really don\u2019t know how you manage to remain completely unflustered, \u201ckeeping your head when all about you are losing theirs \u2026\u201d Thank you particularly for making, re-making and then re-re-making the arrangements under such challenging circumstances. I am already looking forward to Northern Italy next year.\u2019\n\nJim Ferguson: \u2018Thank you again for another excellent tour. Battlefield tours just would not be the same without your knowledge, perspective and unerring instinct for an excellent restaurant! Already looking forward to 2022.\u2019\n\nJonathan Skan: \u2018Seeing the places where actual events took place really brought everything to life and I shall always remember standing on the Republican start-line overlooking Brunetta and viewing the countryside where all-arms warfare was put into practice for the first time. I can only imagine how many hours you had to spend organising our four days in Madrid, but I enjoyed it hugely and look forward to next year\u2019s adventure.\u2019"}], "Saul David is a Senior Fellow.": [{"url": "https://petersfraserdunlop.com/clients/saul-david/", "page_content": "Saul David was born in Monmouth in 1966 and educated at Ampleforth College and Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities (History MA and PhD).\n\nHe began writing his first history book when he was twenty-five and has now completed fifteen (one edited).

Crucible of Hell: Okinawa - The Last Great Battle of the Second World War, was published in the spring of 2020 to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the campaign, and was shortlisted for the 2021 British Army's Military Book of the Year. It was described by Antony Beevor as 'Excellent...gripping narrative' and named as an Amazon.com History Book of the Month and Daily Telegraph and Times/Sunday Times History Book of the Year. In a 5-star review in the Daily Telegraph, Simon Heffer described Saul as 'peerless now among our military historians'.\n\nSBS: Silent Warriors \u2013 The Authorized Wartime History was published on 2 September 2021 to universal praise. 'A terrific book,' wrote James Holland in the Daily Telegraph, 'written with all the gusto, thrills and head excitement these SBS operations richly deserve. It really is one of the most enjoyable histories I've read in many a year.' It was an instant Sunday Times Top 10 bestseller, entering the list at No. 9 and climbing to No. 4. It was also shortlisted for the Maritime Foundation's Mountbatten Award for Best Book of 2022.\n\nSaul's latest book, Devil Dogs: First In, Last Out - King Company from Guadalcanal to the Shores of Japan, about a company of marines fighting its way through the Pacific, was published on 15 September 2022 in the UK and US.

We lived near Monmouth in lots of different buildings on my grandparents' big farm. At school there were more Davids than any other name: more than 20 of us cousins out of 40 pupils. When my older cousins moved on, the school had to close.\n\nIt was very old-fashioned. My brother was dyslexic and the headmaster was pretty tough on him: \"He's not really trying.\" When I was six or seven, we went to the nearest English primary school, St Weonards, about seven miles away. The teaching was good and this was the start of my beginning to shine as a student. I can trace my love of history to that school thanks to the fascinating classes of Mrs Tabor \u2013 history was her favourite subject. I think I also got the telly bug at that time when two series of The Survivors [a cult TV sci-fi] were filmed at my house and we all appeared as extras. I felt I was a star!\n\nI passed the 11-plus but it was decided that I should take the Common Entrance exam to Monmouth School, the nearest independent. I was never entirely comfortable there as they didn't have girls and they played rugby instead of football. After two years, I made a deal with my dad that if I went to the local comprehensive for three years, I would then go to his old boarding school, Ampleforth, for my sixth form.\n\nMy aunt was deputy head of John Kyrle High School, and she has always been slightly miffed that I don't mention it in my CV. I had a great time but it was the early days of it going comprehensive and, in retrospect, I realise that the education was pretty poor. It has improved hugely, I gather. I left with only seven O-levels, yet had the second- best results. I got an A in English language, but failed literature: a D. I asked for it to be re-marked and the report said: \"We think we marked you too highly.\"\n\nI died my hair blond in the summer, and at Ampleforth they said, \"You look like the guy in Bucks Fizz\", so that became my nickname. Once I'd adapted to being away from home, I loved Ampleforth. I thought then that the best history master was the one who spoon-fed us, but in fact the other master was the clever one: he made us think for ourselves. I got ABC in my A-levels and distinction in my history S-level.\n\nI got in to Trinity College, Dublin, but my LEA changed its policy of paying fees at \"foreign\" universities, so I chose Edinburgh instead, another Celtic capital. I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the teaching, although it had some fabulous historians. I worked hard at my four-year MA, but got a 2.1. That was a big disappointment as I wanted to write about history and thought I needed a First.\n\nBut I did it anyway, and at 31 I got fantastic reviews for my fourth book, The Homicidal Earl: I was a \"rising star\". On the same day I was offered a scholarship for a doctorate at Glasgow University. My best book came out of the research I did there, The Indian Mutiny. Now that I'm Visiting Professor in Military History at Hull University, I'll be telling my PhD students, \"Choose an original subject \u2013 but one that you can also sell as a book.\""}, {"url": "https://whitehorseinn.org/", "page_content": "From disciple to betrayer, Judas Iscariot is a figure with whom not many would choose to associate.

On 6 June 1944, the largest armada the world had ever seen appeared on the shores of northern France to open the \u201csecond front\u201d and defeat the Wehrmacht. The fighting was hard and bloody for both sides, and it was not until August that the German defensive line could be broken. Allied material superiority was facing a numerically weaker German force which, however, often showed a fanatical will to fight \u2013 and die. In contrast to most tours, which concentrate very much on the Allied experience of the campaign, we will be looking at \u201cboth sides of the hill\u201d and analyse both the Allied and German armies, their strategies and operational plans, and we will see how these played out on the (tactical) ground for the GI, the Tommy, and the Landser in Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nThe tour will be led by Prof Matthias Strohn, Visiting Professor of Military Studies at the Humanities Research Institute at the University of Buckingham, and, as Senior Associate Fellow, Head of Historical Analysis at the British Army\u2019s think tank, CHACR. Matthias holds a commission in the German Army and has, among other deployments, served on the defence attach\u00e9 staffs at the German embassies in Paris, London and Madrid. He has led over 100 battlefield tours and staff rides. In a previous deployment at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was responsible for Normandy Scholar, a joint academic-military exercise, which takes about 750 Army cadets to Normandy.\n\nDay One:\n\nMeet at Ashford International station, travel on Coach via Eurotunnel to Bayeux. Walking tour of Bayeux and introduction to the Normandy campaign\n\nDay Two:\n\nThe British Sector:\n\nWe explore the airborne attacks on Merville Battery and Pegasus Bridge. We then move on to Gold Beach to analyse the British landings and German counter-measures, and hear about the only VC won on D-Day. We finish the day at the new British D-Day memorial\n\nDay Three:\n\nThe British Sector:\n\nWe visit the German radar station at Douvres, which held out against British attacks until 17 June. We explore the German battery at Longues sur Mer and the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches before moving inland and analysing the battles at Hill 122, the \u2018Verdun of Normandy\u2019. Visit the Bayeux Tapestry Museum\n\nDay Four:\n\nThe American Sector:\n\nTravel to Omaha beach where we learn about the difficult landings and \u201cthe beast of Omaha\u201d. Visit the US cemetery before moving on to Pointe du Hoc to learn about the US Ranger attack on the formidable German defensive position. We visit the German military cemetery at La Cambe and finish the day at the Bayeux Battle of Normandy Museum\n\nDay Five:\n\nReturn to England\n\nThroughout the tour we will be staying in the Hotel Churchill in Bayeux (http://www.hotel-churchill.fr/en/). We considered booking a chateau hotel in the countryside. But the Churchill has the advantage of being situated in the centre of Bayeux, which makes it easy to explore the city on foot. All meals (including non-alcoholic drinks and one alcoholic drink per meal) and entrance fees are included in the tour price of \u00a31,550 for single occupant, and \u00a31,400pp for two sharing a room.\n\nPraise for Saul David and Matthias Str\u00f6hn\u2019s previous tours\n\nMadrid and The Battlefields of the Spanish Civil War, 20-24 October 2021:\n\nJeremy Archer: \u2018Rack my brain as I might, I cannot think of a single thing that I would have done differently.

Many have attempted to to assign filthy homosexual intentions in their relationship but such was not the case. God knit these two men\u2019s hearts together in a covenant friendship where the love one had for the other was the type of love God commanded in His law should exist between all His covenant children. To love others AS you love yourself. That is the exact way these two friends loved each other.\n\nWhen these passages say that they kissed it has the same meaning as it would say in an Italian home. They would kiss the cheek.\n\nContrary to the way it is most often used today, the word kiss in the ancient world was rarely used in a romantic way.\n\nIn the overwhelming number of cases it was an exchange between family or friends who were dear to heart and was on the checks.\n\n\u201c(1) David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and asked, \u201cWhat have I done? What did I do wrong? How have I sinned against your father so that he wants to take my life?\u201d \u201c(2) Jonathan said to him, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t die. Listen, my father doesn\u2019t do anything, great or small, without telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This can\u2019t be true.\u201d \u201c(3) But David said, \u201cYour father certainly knows that you have come to look favorably on me. He has said, \u2018Jonathan must not know of this, or else he will be grieved.'\u201d David also swore, \u201cAs surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.\u201d \u201c(4) Jonathan said to David, \u201cWhatever you say, I will do for you.\u201d \u201c(5) So David told him, \u201cLook, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I\u2019m supposed to sit down and eat with the king. Instead, let me go, and I\u2019ll hide in the field until the third night. (6) If your father misses me at all, say, \u2018David urgently requested my permission to quickly go to his town Bethlehem for an annual sacrifice there involving the whole clan.\u2019 (7) If he says, \u2018Good,\u2019 then your servant is safe, but if he becomes angry, you will know he has evil intentions. (8) Deal faithfully with your servant, for you have brought me into a covenant before the LORD with you. If I have done anything wrong, then kill me yourself; why take me to your father?\u201d \u201c(9) \u201cNo!\u201d Jonathan responded. \u201cIf I ever find out my father has evil intentions against you, wouldn\u2019t I tell you about it?\u201d (10) So David asked Jonathan, \u201cWho will tell me if your father answers you harshly?\u201d (11) He answered David, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d So both of them went out to the field. (12) \u201cBy the LORD, the God of Israel, if I sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day and I find out that he is favorable toward you, and if I do not send for you and tell you, (13) then may God punish Jonathan and do so severely. If my father intends to bring evil on you, then I will tell you, and I will send you away, and you will go in peace. May the LORD be with you, just as He was with my father. (14) If I continue to live, treat me with the LORD\u2019s faithful love, but if I die, (15) don\u2019t ever withdraw your faithful love from my household\u2013not even when the LORD cuts off every one of David\u2019s enemies from the face of the earth.\u201d (16) Then Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \u201cMay the LORD hold David\u2019s enemies accountable.\u201d (17) Jonathan once again swore to David in his love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.\u201d \u201c(18) Then Jonathan said to him, \u201cTomorrow is the New Moon; you\u2019ll be missed because your seat will be empty. (19) The following day hurry down and go to the place where you hid on the day this incident began and stay beside the rock Ezel. (20) I will shoot three arrows beside it as if I\u2019m aiming at a target. (21) Then I will send the young man and say, \u2018Go and find the arrows!\u2019 Now, if I expressly say to the young man, \u2018Look, the arrows are on this side of you\u2013get them,\u2019 then come, because as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no problem. (22) But if I say this to the youth: \u2018Look, the arrows are beyond you!\u2019 then go, for the LORD is sending you away. (23) As for the matter you and I have spoken about, the LORD will be a witness between you and me forever.\u201d (24) So David hid in the field. At the New Moon, the king sat down to eat the meal. (25) He sat at his usual place on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat facing him and Abner took his place beside Saul, but David\u2019s place was empty. (26) Saul did not say anything that day because he thought, \u201cSomething unexpected has happened; he must be ceremonially unclean\u2013yes, that\u2019s it, he is unclean.\u201d (27) However, the day after the New Moon, the second day, David\u2019s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Jesse\u2019s son come to the meal either yesterday or today?\u201d \u201c(28) Jonathan answered, \u201cDavid asked for my permission to go to Bethlehem. (29) He said, \u2018Please let me go because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the town, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if you are pleased with me, let me go so I can see my brothers.\u2019 That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t come to the king\u2019s table.\u201d \u201c(30) Then Saul became angry with Jonathan and shouted, \u201cYou son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don\u2019t I know that you are siding with Jesse\u2019s son to your own shame and to the disgrace of your mother? (31) Every day Jesse\u2019s son lives on earth you and your kingship are not secure. Now send for him and bring him to me\u2013he deserves to die.\u201d \u201c(32) Jonathan answered his father back: \u201cWhy is he to be killed? What has he done?\u201d (33) Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him, so he knew that his father was determined to kill David. (34) He got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat any food that second day of the New Moon, for he was grieved because of his father\u2019s shameful behavior toward David.\u201d \u201c(35) In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointed meeting with David. A small young man was with him. (36) He said to the young man, \u201cRun and find the arrows I\u2019m shooting.\u201d As the young man ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. (37) He came to the location of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, but Jonathan called to him and said, \u201cThe arrow is beyond you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (38) Then Jonathan called to him, \u201cHurry up and don\u2019t stop!\u201d Jonathan\u2019s young man picked up the arrow and returned to his master. (39) He did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. (40) Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the young man who was with him and said, \u201cGo, take it back to the city.\u201d (41) When the young man had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone Ezel, fell with his face to the ground, and bowed three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept with each other, though David wept more.\u201d \u201c(42) Jonathan then said to David, \u201cGo in the assurance the two of us pledged in the name of the LORD when we said: The LORD will be a witness between you and me and between my offspring and your offspring forever.\u201d Then David left, and Jonathan went into the city.\u201d\n\nTheirs was a relationship based upon covenant and trust. It is a fitting example of the type of relationship we are to experience with God.\n\n1 Samuel 21:1-15,\n\n\u201c(1) David went to Ahimelech the priest at Nob. Ahimelech was afraid to meet David, so he said to him, \u201cWhy are you alone and no one is with you?\u201d \u201c(2) David answered Ahimelech the priest, \u201cThe king gave me a mission, but he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t let anyone know anything about the mission I\u2019m sending you on or what I have ordered you to do.\u2019 I have stationed my young men at a certain place. (3) Now what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever can be found.\u201d \u201c(4) The priest told him, \u201cThere is no ordinary bread on hand. However, there is consecrated bread, but the young men may eat it only if they have kept themselves from women.\u201d \u201c(5) David answered him, \u201cI swear that women are being kept from us, as always when I go out to battle. The young men\u2019s bodies are consecrated even on an ordinary mission, so of course their bodies are consecrated today.\u201d \u201c(6) So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD. When the bread was removed, it had been replaced with warm bread.\u201d \u201c(7) One of Saul\u2019s servants, detained before the LORD, was there that day. His name was Doeg the Edomite, chief of Saul\u2019s shepherds. (8) David said to Ahimelech, \u201cDo you have a spear or sword on hand? I didn\u2019t even bring my sword or my weapons since the king\u2019s mission was urgent.\u201d \u201c(9) The priest replied, \u201cThe sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, then take it, for there isn\u2019t another one here.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s none like it!\u201d \u201cDavid said. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d \u201c(10) David fled that day from Saul\u2019s presence and went to King Achish of Gath. (11) But Achish\u2019s servants said to him, \u201cIsn\u2019t this David, the king of the land? Don\u2019t they sing about him during their dances: Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands?\u201d \u201c(12) David took this to heart and became very afraid of King Achish of Gath, (13) so he pretended to be insane in their presence. He acted like a madman around them, scribbling on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard. (14) \u201cLook! You can see the man is crazy,\u201d Achish said to his servants. \u201cWhy did you bring him to me? (15) Do I have such a shortage of crazy people that you brought this one to act crazy around me? Is this one going to come into my house?\u201d\n\nLying and deception is in these people\u2019s blood \u2013 dating back to Abraham. I am not sure why these are not repented of or at least spoken against in scripture but here they are, casually mentioned in passing and David even placed this last example as the prelude to one of his Psalms.\n\nPsalms 34:1-22, \u201c(1) I will praise the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips. (2) I will boast in the LORD; the humble will hear and be glad. (3) Proclaim with me the LORD\u2019s greatness; let us exalt His name together. (4) I sought the LORD, and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears. (5) Those who look to Him are radiant with joy; their faces will never be ashamed. (6) This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him from all his troubles. (7) The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them. (8) Taste and see that the LORD is good. How happy is the man who takes refuge in Him! (9) Fear the LORD, you His saints, for those who fear Him lack nothing. (10) Young lions lack food and go hungry, but those who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing. (11) Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. (12) Who is the man who delights in life, loving a long life to enjoy what is good? (13) Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech. (14) Turn away from evil and do what is good; seek peace and pursue it. (15) The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry for help. (16) The face of the LORD is set against those who do what is evil, to erase all memory of them from the earth. (17) The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears, and delivers them from all their troubles. (18) The LORD is near the brokenhearted; He saves those crushed in spirit. (19) Many adversities come to the one who is righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all. (20) He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken. (21) Evil brings death to the sinner, and those who hate the righteous will be punished. (22) The LORD redeems the life of His servants, and all who take refuge in Him will not be punished.\u201d\n\n1 Samuel 22:1-23,\n\nThis chapter gives testament to just how darkened a mind can become. Saul orders the execution of the Lord\u2019s Priests and later (in the next chapter) believes God is with him and was handing David over to him.\n\n\u201c(1) So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When David\u2019s brothers and his father\u2019s whole family heard, they went down and joined him there. (2) In addition, every man who was desperate, in debt, or discontented rallied around him, and he became their leader. About 400 men were with him. (3) From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab where he said to the king of Moab, \u201cPlease let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.\u201d (4) So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold.\u201d \u201c(5) Then the prophet Gad said to David, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in the stronghold. Leave and return to the land of Judah.\u201d So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.\u201d \u201c(6) Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree at the high place. His spear was in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him. (7) Saul said to his servants, \u201cListen, men of Benjamin: Is Jesse\u2019s son going to give all of you fields and vineyards? Do you think he\u2019ll make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? (8) That\u2019s why all of you have conspired against me! Nobody tells me when my own son makes a covenant with Jesse\u2019s son. None of you cares about me or tells me that my son has stirred up my own servant to wait in ambush for me, as is the case today.\u201d \u201c(9) Then Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul\u2019s servants, answered: \u201cI saw Jesse\u2019s son come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob. (10) Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\u201d (11) The king sent messengers to summon Ahimelech the priest, son of Ahitub, and his father\u2019s whole family, who were priests in Nob. All of them came to the king. \u201c(12) Then Saul said, \u201cListen, son of Ahitub!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m at your service, my lord,\u201d he said. (13) Saul asked him, \u201cWhy did you and Jesse\u2019s son conspire against me? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him, so he could rise up against me and wait in ambush, as is the case today.\u201d \u201c(14) Ahimelech replied to the king: \u201cWho among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the king\u2019s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, and honored in your house. (15) Was today the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Please don\u2019t let the king make an accusation against your servant or any of my father\u2019s household, for your servant didn\u2019t have any idea about all this.\u201d \u201c(16) But the king said, \u201cYou will die, Ahimelech\u2013you and your father\u2019s whole family!\u201d (17) Then the king ordered the guards standing by him, \u201cTurn and kill the priests of the LORD because they sided with David. For they knew he was fleeing, but they didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d But the king\u2019s servants would not lift a hand to execute the priests of the LORD. (18) So the king said to Doeg, \u201cGo and execute the priests!\u201d So Doeg the Edomite went and executed the priests himself. On that day, he killed 85 men who wore linen ephods. (19) He also struck down Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword\u2013both men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep.\u201d \u201c(20) However, one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David. (21) Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. (22) Then David said to Abiathar, \u201cI knew that Doeg the Edomite was there that day and that he was sure to report to Saul. I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father\u2019s family. (23) Stay with me. Don\u2019t be afraid, for the one who wants to take my life wants to take your life. You will be safe with me.\u201d\n\n1 Samuel 23:1-29,\n\n\u201c(1) It was reported to David: \u201cLook, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and raiding the threshing floors.\u201d (2) So David inquired of the LORD: \u201cShould I launch an attack against these Philistines?\u201d The LORD answered David, \u201cLaunch an attack against the Philistines and rescue Keilah.\u201d (3) But David\u2019s men said to him, \u201cLook, we\u2019re afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!\u201d (4) Once again, David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him: \u201cGo at once to Keilah, for I will hand the Philistines over to you.\u201d (5) Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, drove their livestock away, and inflicted heavy losses on them. So David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah. (6) Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, and he brought an ephod with him.\u201d \u201c(7) When it was reported to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, he said, \u201cGod has handed him over to me, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with barred gates.\u201d (8) Then Saul summoned all the troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men.\u201d \u201c (9) When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, \u201cBring the ephod.\u201d (10) Then David said, \u201cLORD God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the town because of me. (11) Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down as Your servant has heard? LORD God of Israel, please tell Your servant.\u201d The LORD answered, \u201cHe will come down.\u201d (12) Then David asked, \u201cWill the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?\u201d \u201cThey will,\u201d the LORD responded. (13) So David and his men, numbering about 600, left Keilah at once and moved from place to place. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he called off the expedition. (14) David then stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand David over to him. (15) David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesh when he saw that Saul had come out to take his life.\u201d \u201c(16) Then Saul\u2019s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and encouraged him in his faith in God, (17) saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. You yourself will be king over Israel, and I\u2019ll be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows it is true.\u201d (18) Then the two of them made a covenant in the LORD\u2019s presence. Afterwards, David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home.\u201d \u201c(19) Some Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, \u201cDavid is hiding among us in the strongholds in Horesh on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon. (20) Now, whenever the king wants to come down, let him come down. Our part will be to hand him over to the king.\u201d (21) \u201cMay you be blessed by the LORD,\u201d replied Saul, \u201cfor you have taken pity on me. (22) Go and check again. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there; they tell me he is extremely cunning. (23) Look and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with accurate information, and I\u2019ll go with you. If it turns out he really is in the region, I\u2019ll search for him among all the clans of Judah.\u201d (24) So they went to Ziph ahead of Saul.\u201d \u201cNow David and his men were in the wilderness near Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon, (25) and Saul and his men went to look for him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. Saul heard of this and pursued David there. (26) Saul went along one side of the mountain and David and his men went along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away from Saul, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. (27) Then a messenger came to Saul saying, \u201cCome quickly, because the Philistines have raided the land!\u201d (28) So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to engage the Philistines. Therefore, that place was named the Rock of Separation. (29) From there David went up and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.\u201d\n\n1 Samuel 24:1-22,\n\nDavid spares Saul\u2019s life because he believes Saul to still be God\u2019s anointed and God honors David\u2019s conscience concerning this. Yet, later David intended to kill a man\u2019s servants just for snubbing him. The morality seems more than just a little off, but we are dealing with a time of relative light \u2013 where men who loved God did so as best as they understood, but their understanding and follow through was often poor.\n\nOne thing seems for certain, David was a man of passion \u2013 like Peter and God seems to like passion!\n\n\u201c(1) When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, \u201cDavid is in the wilderness near En-gedi.\u201d (2) So Saul took 3,000 of Israel\u2019s choice men and went to look for David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. (3) When Saul came to the sheep pens along the road, a cave was there, and he went in to relieve himself. David and his men were staying in the back of the cave, (4) so they said to him, \u201cLook, this is the day the LORD told you about: \u2018I will hand your enemy over to you so you can do to him whatever you desire.'\u201d Then David got up and secretly cut off the corner of Saul\u2019s robe. (5) Afterwards, David\u2019s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the corner of Saul\u2019s robe. (6) He said to his men, \u201cI swear before the LORD: I would never do such a thing to my lord, the LORD\u2019s anointed. I will never lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD\u2019s anointed.\u201d (7) With these words David persuaded his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way.\u201d \u201c(8) After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called to Saul, \u201cMy lord the king!\u201d When Saul looked behind him, David bowed to the ground in homage. (9) David said to Saul, \u201cWhy do you listen to the words of people who say, \u2018Look, David intends to harm you\u2019? (10) You can see with your own eyes that the LORD handed you over to me today in the cave. Someone advised me to kill you, but I took pity on you and said: I won\u2019t lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD\u2019s anointed. (11) See, my father! Look at the corner of your robe in my hand, for I cut it off, but I didn\u2019t kill you. Look and recognize that there is no evil or rebellion in me. I haven\u2019t sinned against you even though you are hunting me down to take my life. (12) \u201cMay the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will never be against you. (13) As the old proverb says, \u2018Wickedness comes from wicked people.\u2019 My hand will never be against you. (14) Who has the king of Israel come after? What are you chasing after? A dead dog? A flea? (15) May the LORD be judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from you.\u201d \u201c(16) When David finished saying these things to him, Saul replied, \u201cIs that your voice, David my son?\u201d Then Saul wept aloud (17) and said to David, \u201cYou are more righteous than I, for you have done what is good to me though I have done what is evil to you. (18) You yourself have told me today what good you did for me: when the LORD handed me over to you, you didn\u2019t kill me. (19) When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go unharmed? May the LORD repay you with good for what you\u2019ve done for me today. (20) \u201cNow I know for certain you will be king, and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. (21) Therefore swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father\u2019s family.\u201d (22) So David swore to Saul. Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.\u201d\n\n1 Samuel 25:1-44,\n\nFor all his quickness to passion, David was also quick to listen and judge his own heart. This too is a reason for God calling David a man after His Own Heart.\n\n\u201c(1) Samuel died, and all Israel assembled to mourn for him, and they buried him by his home in Ramah. David then went down to the Wilderness of Paran. (2) A man in Maon had a business in Carmel; he was a very rich man with 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats and was shearing his sheep in Carmel. (3) The man\u2019s name was Nabal, and his wife\u2019s name, Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful, but the man, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings. (4) While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep, (5) so David sent 10 young men instructing them, \u201cGo up to Carmel, and when you come to Nabal, greet him in my name. (6) Then say this: \u2018Long life to you, and peace to you, to your family, and to all that is yours. (7) I hear that you are shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harass them, and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time they were in Carmel. (8) Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let my young men find favor with you, for we have come on a feast day. Please give whatever you can afford to your servants and to your son David.'\u201d \u201c(9) David\u2019s young men went and said all these things to Nabal on David\u2019s behalf, and they waited. (10) Nabal asked them, \u201cWho is David? Who is Jesse\u2019s son? Many slaves these days are running away from their masters. (11) Am I supposed to take my bread, my water, and my meat that I butchered for my shearers and give them to men who are from I don\u2019t know where?\u201d \u201c(12) David\u2019s men retraced their steps. When they returned to him, they reported all these words. (13) He said to his men, \u201cAll of you, put on your swords!\u201d So David and all his men put on their swords. About 400 men followed David while 200 stayed with the supplies. (14) One of Nabal\u2019s young men informed Abigail, Nabal\u2019s wife: \u201cLook, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he yelled at them. (15) The men treated us well. When we were in the field, we weren\u2019t harassed and nothing of ours was missing the whole time we were living among them. (16) They were a wall around us, both day and night, the entire time we were herding the sheep. (17) Now consider carefully what you must do, because there is certain to be trouble for our master and his entire family. He is such a worthless fool nobody can talk to him!\u201d \u201c(18) Abigail hurried, taking 200 loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. (19) Then she said to her male servants, \u201cGo ahead of me. I will be right behind you.\u201d But she did not tell her husband Nabal. (20) As she rode the donkey down a mountain pass hidden from view, she saw David and his men coming toward her and met them. (21) David had just said, \u201cI guarded everything that belonged to this man in the wilderness for nothing. He was not missing anything, yet he paid me back evil for good. (22) May God punish me, and even more if I let any of his men survive until morning.\u201d (23) When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey and fell with her face to the ground in front of David. (24) She fell at his feet and said, \u201cThe guilt is mine, my lord, but please let your servant speak to you directly. Listen to the words of your servant. (25) My lord should pay no attention to this worthless man Nabal, for he lives up to his name: His name is Nabal, and stupidity is all he knows. I, your servant, didn\u2019t see my lord\u2019s young men whom you sent. (26) Now my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, it is the LORD who kept you from participating in bloodshed and avenging yourself by your own hand. May your enemies and those who want trouble for my lord be like Nabal. (27) Accept this gift your servant has brought to my lord, and let it be given to the young men who follow my lord. (28) Please forgive your servant\u2019s offense, for the LORD is certain to make a lasting dynasty for my lord because he fights the LORD\u2019s battles. Throughout your life, may evil not be found in you. (29) \u201cWhen someone pursues you and attempts to take your life, my lord\u2019s life will be tucked safely in the place where the LORD your God protects the living. However, He will fling away your enemies\u2019 lives like stones from a sling. (30) When the LORD does for my lord all the good He promised and appoints you ruler over Israel, (31) there will not be remorse or a troubled conscience for my lord because of needless bloodshed or my lord\u2019s revenge. And when the LORD does good things for my lord, may you remember me your servant.\u201d \u201c(32) Then David said to Abigail, \u201cPraise to the LORD God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today! (33) Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you. Today you kept me from participating in bloodshed and avenging myself by my own hand. (34) Otherwise, as surely as the LORD God of Israel lives, who prevented me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, Nabal wouldn\u2019t have had any men left by morning light.\u201d (35) Then David accepted what she had brought him and said, \u201cGo home in peace. See, I have heard what you said and have granted your request.\u201d \u201c(36) Then Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was in his house, feasting like a king. Nabal was in a good mood and very drunk, so she didn\u2019t say anything to him until morning light. (37) In the morning when Nabal sobered up, his wife told him about these events. Then he had a seizure and became paralyzed. (38) About 10 days later, the LORD struck Nabal dead.\u201d \u201c(39) When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \u201cPraise the LORD who championed my cause against Nabal\u2019s insults and restrained His servant from doing evil. The LORD brought Nabal\u2019s evil deeds back on his own head.\u201d Then David sent messengers to speak to Abigail about marrying him. (40) When David\u2019s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, \u201cDavid sent us to bring you to him as a wife.\u201d (41) She bowed her face to the ground and said, \u201cHere I am, your servant, to wash the feet of my lord\u2019s servants.\u201d (42) Then Abigail got up quickly, and with her five female servants accompanying her, rode on the donkey following David\u2019s messengers. And so she became his wife. (43) David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and the two of them became his wives. (44) But Saul gave his daughter Michal, David\u2019s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.\u201d\n\nBlessings!\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this teaching will challenge you and encourage you to place your trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.\n\nYou have a special place in God\u2019s family & kingdom.

The reader can see a definite shift in the narrative between 1 Samuel 15 and 16. Saul is rejected by the LORD in one chapter and the boy David is anointed by the Lord as the king to take his place. The readers of 1 Samuel are given clues to the rejection of Saul and the rise of David, but as the story played out in real-time it would have likely been far more jolting to David.\n\nOT scholar, Robert Bergen, has argued pretty definitively that the narrator of 1 Samuel portrays David as the most loyal and devoted of Saul\u2019s citizens. When Saul was tormented by an evil spirit, it was David who stepped in. When Saul\u2019s army was on the brink of humiliation it was the young David who rose to Goliath\u2019s challenge. He did everything that Saul asked of him. But in 1 Samuel 18 we read that Saul became jealous of the accolades given to David. Everything goes south in the relationship from this point forward.\n\nFrom David\u2019s perspective, there is no indication that he knew anything was going on until Jonathan (Saul\u2019s son and David\u2019s best friend) warned David of Saul\u2019s murderous intentions. At this point, David was also Saul\u2019s son-in-law. Saul had given his daughter, Michal, to David as an attempt to ensnare him. But to David, this would have been further evidence of his favor with the king. How confusing it must have been for David to realize that even his marriage was an attempt by Saul to keep power.\n\nJonathan was able to keep Saul\u2019s jealousy at bay for a season, but eventually, Saul was overcome and obsessed with removing this threat, David, from his kingdom. David had to flee. The rest of 1 Samuel is David running from Saul until it ends with Saul\u2019s death. It is during this time that many Psalms were written by David (Psalm 18, 57, 59, 63, 70, and 142). At one climactic point in the narrative, Saul is relieving himself in the very cave in which David was hiding. Saul has no idea that David is present. Saul\u2019s life was in David\u2019s hands, but David responded with integrity and preserved Saul but cut off a piece of his robe. Later when the two meet and Saul realizes that David could have killed him exclaims thusly:\n\n\u201cYou are more righteous than I,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father\u2019s family.\u201d (1 Samuel 24:17-21)\n\nThis is an apt summary of their relationship. David was the man with integrity (at least at this stage of his life) and Saul was the one who was rejected by the LORD. Saul was the one who held power but through his grasping of that power, he eventually forfeited it. David was the one with real power as exemplified in his self-control in that cave where he could have taken Saul\u2019s life. David was, in a sense, loyal to Saul even after Saul\u2019s death. David kept this vow and honored Saul\u2019s family line."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B001JS8PNQ?pageSize=12&page=2&langFilter=default", "page_content": "'David is extremely good at interweaving the different stands of his narrative.

Amanda Foreman, Sunday Times\n\n\n\n\n\nA wonderful portrait of George IV and his time - the first in 25 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribed by the Duke of Wellington as 'the most extraordinary compound of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy and good feeling that I ever saw in one character in my life', George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales, later George IV, was a highly controversial figure. He courted both Whigs and Tories in his attempts to establish the Regency during the 'madness' of his father, George III. Scandalous liaisons with prostitutes and duchesses, and his 'secret' marriage to the Catholic Mrs Fitzherbert, tested his duty - to nation and to family. Yet his support for overseas campaigns against Napoleon, culminating in such historic victories as Trafalgar and Waterloo, consolidated Britain's status as the pre-eminent world power amid the great social and economic upheavals of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing on a wealth of original accounts of life in Georgian Britain, Saul David has created a masterly portrait - of a flamboyant, opportunistic and influential figure, and of a nation in a time of great change.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaul David is Professor of War Studies at the University of Buckingham and the author of several critically-acclaimed history books, including The Indian Mutiny: 1857 (shortlisted for the Westminster Medal for Military Literature), Zulu: The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879 (a Waterstone's Military History Book of the Year) and Victoria's Wars: The Rise of Empire.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaul David also writes acclaimed historical fiction.

This status will enable the student to attend the ten guest seminars and dinners, and to meet the guest lecturers, but does not require the submission of written work. Associate Students are not registered for and do not receive, the MA degree.\n\nGraduate Study in Military History\n\nWhat our students say\n\n\u201cI found Buckingham\u2019s MA in Military History by Research a very rewarding experience. After a business career in the technology sector I was able to finally devote some time to my passion for Military History. The task seemed daunting at first as it had been a long time since I was last in education and I had no knowledge of how to conduct historical research. However, the introductory course of lectures provided a solid study framework and detailed follow up discussions with my tutor enabled me to focus in on a specific historical area of interest and, more importantly, identify a particular question that needed answering.\n\nThe research-based nature of the course means at this point you embark on a solo process of discovery. Reading the existing literature and sifting the archives, both online and in person, you follow leads and gradually piece together the parts of your chosen puzzle. The course is demanding and academically rigorous with a high standard of work expected. However, the tutors are excellent and always there to support and guide your progress and check your work is of the required standard. Writing the dissertation is challenging but once completed it is a very satisfying feeling to know you have contributed to the historiography and understanding of your chosen area.\n\nWhilst most students in my intake took the one-year full-time course I undertook the two-year part-time route and found it allowed me the time and space to investigate my chosen specialist area and really enjoy the whole process without pressure. If you have the time, it may be an option to consider.\n\nIf undertaking a masters currently seems too much of a commitment I would highly recommend becoming an associate just to attend the MA course\u2019s accompanying series of illuminating evening events hosted by Professor Saul David. Each evening involves a standalone lecture given by an eminent historian followed by a dinner and conversation. It is highly enjoyable to spend time in the company of a diverse group of people with a common passion and to be able to talk to some of the biggest names in Military History. Even though I have completed my Masters I intend to be an associate for many years to come!\n\nAndrew Thompson, Master\u2019s (distinction), 2021\n\n\u201cThe MA by Research in Military History at The University of Buckingham offers students the opportunity to channel their passion and intellectual curiosity into an academic endeavour full of reward.\n\nThe research seminars delivered by Professor Saul David equip the student early on with a solid foundation to build on, along with a road map to begin drawing out one\u2019s chosen topic. Accompanying these are lectures from speakers at the apex of their field, which are both informative and inspiring, set within a comfortable environment conducive to open debate.\n\nMoreover, the student support at Buckingham is second to none, with administrators on hand to answer any questions and avoid any pitfalls emerging, along with librarians available to assist in seeking out rare books. Taken together, the MA by Research in Military History guarantees a unique experience and provides the necessary tools to succeed.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the course and found the whole experience both character building and rewarding. It provided an excellent platform to develop a keen interest into an extensive academic project, under the watchful eyes of expert supervision. I look forward to my next project within this space.\u201d\n\nScott Sherriff, Master\u2019s (distinction), 2020\n\n\u201cI completed the one-year Research MA in Military History in 2012 and subsequently went on to complete a PhD also at The University of Buckingham.\n\nLike most students, I embarked on the MA course with a longstanding interest in military history but little understanding of the skills and disciplines involved in academic research. The unique and exciting quality of the Buckingham programme is that it enables an interested amateur as I certainly was then to tackle a historical question that is entirely new and to produce a work that can withstand rigorous professional scrutiny within an incredibly short timescale.\n\nIf the opportunity provided by the Buckingham course is exciting, its strength lies in the way it combines three elements which support and guide the student. The first is a well-crafted introduction to research techniques backed by exercises to develop research and writing skills. This element is relevant and practical and it is adjusted to the needs of the individual. The second is the series of general interest lectures over the first half of the year all provided by first rank historians. These expose students to new historical problems and the latest research and the format over dinner allows genuinely stimulating debate. They provide invaluable context for the student\u2019s individual work. However, the critical element that stands out at Buckingham is the quality of the individual guidance and supervision in selecting a research topic and then executing successive stages. I cannot rate too highly the individual supervision that I and my fellow students received. I think PhD students at the best universities would count themselves fortunate to receive the tailored support of this quality and care and not least time from some of the best historians in the United Kingdom.\n\nI would also like to commend the general administration of the Buckingham MA programme. It is a complex programme with diverse students with different requirements, a complex lecture programme and no dedicated Buckingham owned site in London. Yet the execution from logistics around successive lectures through to the examination of the final thesis and the monitoring of academic standards was close to perfect.\u201d\n\nDr Andy Boyd, PhD, 2015\n\nFor further details contact:\n\nHumanities Research Admissions on +44 (0)1280 827514\n\nEmail: humanitiespg-admissions@buckingham.ac.uk"}, {"url": "https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/22126/saul-david.html", "page_content": "Saul David's All The King's Men is a thrilling history of the British Redcoat from the English Civil War to Waterloo.\n\n\n\nBetween 1660 and 1815 British supremacy on foreign soil was near total.

The Duke of Wellington and a number of other senior military commanders established the Institute in 1831, and some of the most influential thinkers in the 19th and 20th centuries worked or spoke at RUSI.\n\nRUSI has been at the centre of policymaking and thinking on defence and security from the rise of the British Empire to its transformation and dissolution, through both World Wars and the Cold War. The Institute is now documenting the \u2018new disorder\u2019 of the contemporary world, and it remains an intrinsic part of the research and debate that surrounds military and security thinking.\n\nFoundations\n\nThe Duke of Wellington's support was instrumental in the Institute\u2019s creation, beginning in 1831 when the Naval and Military Museum was founded. It was renamed as the United Services Institution in 1839, and although royal patronage was assured from the start, this was formally granted though an Act of Parliament in 1860 as a mark of the Institute\u2019s growing importance.\n\nRUSI's influence continued to grow as a result of developments in the latter half of the 19th century.

The armed forces of the Crown have never stood higher in the public regard than they did fourteen years after the Battle of Waterloo. The Royal Navy and the Army were conscious of duty well done. Nelson, the dead hero, was already part of the national myth. Our living hero, Wellington, enjoyed a pre-eminence as a soldier and later as a statesman among his countrymen, never surpassed by anyone except Winston Churchill.\n\nSuccessful armed forces can all too easily sink into authoritarianism, brooking no criticism, rejecting any analysis of the lessons of the immediate past, having become the mental prisoners of a successful but obsolescent technique of warfare. The great Duke himself, whose carefully contrived victories in the Peninsula had laid the foundations of the Army's traditions, was in some respects the most obdurate authoritarian ever to command British troops, the persistent opponent of every innovation except, strangely, what was to become RUSI.\n\nThe old campaigner\n\nIt would not have been remarkable if a small coterie of professionally-minded officers had formed an association to study the lessons of the late war. A core already existed in the subscribers to Colbourn's United Service Journal (no connection with the future RUSI Journal), and the process was started in February 1829 by a letter to that periodical signed by \u2018An old Egyptian Campaigner\u2019. Paraphrasing his florid style, he argued that \u2018a United Service Museum\u2019 should be formed, managed entirely by naval and military officers, and under patronage of the monarch, then King George IV, and the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces. Such an institution would prove that the two professions have entered the lists of science, and are ready to contend for honours \u2018tam Artibus quam Armis\u2019. The enthusiastic response may well have exceeded the worthy \u2018Old Campaigner\u2019s' expectations. It encouraged a Commander Henry Downes Royal Navy to assemble a group with a view to forming a committee for action, to which King George\u2019s First ADC was commanded to convey \u2018His Majesty\u2019s gracious and high approbation of the undertaking and of the principles on which it is proposed to conduct it', which were stated to be suitable for 'a strictly scientific and professional society, and not a club'. The death of the King delayed matters, but the Duke of Clarence expressed his readiness to become a patron so, encouraged by the powerful support of the Duke of Wellington, the First ADC, Sir Herbert Taylor, re-submitted the project to King William IV, and was able to assure the committee that \u2018it could proceed under his Majesty's gracious auspices.\u2019\n\nOn 25 June 1831 the committee met in the Thatched House Tavern in St James Street, then a popular resort of officers in London, long since vanished. The chair was taken by Major General Sir Howard Douglas, in his person a symbol of the \u2018United Service\u2019: a soldier who was the leading expert on naval gunnery. The resolution that the institution be established was put by the future Viscount Hardinge of Lahore, Field Marshal, Secretary of State for War and Governor General of India, seconded by the future Admiral Francis Beaufort, the famous hydrographer. The first title adopted was \u2018the Naval and Military Museum\u2019, altered in 1839 to \u2018the United Service Institution\u2019, and to \u2018the Royal United Service Institution\u2019 by Royal Charter of Incorporation in 1860, retained until the present day when our longer but more explicit title was adopted to make our role clear to the general public.\n\nThe RUSI needs YOU\n\nThere seems to have been no doubt in the mind of the founding committee about of the role of the Institute. The museum and library were the vehicles, but intellectual drive would depend on the imagination and liberty to freely express their ideas of the ordinary members. To this end the founders were politically astute enough to invite thirty of the most distinguished officers of the day to become vice-presidents, but they also perceived that the future of the Institution would depend on attracting as many of the youngest and most junior officers as possible, fixing the subscription for them as low as 10s. per annum. They hoped for 100 per cent recruitment, but though they were disappointed in this, a healthy number joined. (The best young officers are by no means all of a studious or analytic turn of mind. In the 1970s a discreet piece of \u2018market research\u2019 revealed that the junior membership was largely from those officers who aspired to staff training and the Joint Services Staff College).\n\nExactly to define the mission of an institution whose studies include the whole spectrum of defence is virtually impossible. The version adopted for inclusion in the Royal Charter was \u2018The promotion and advancement of Naval and Military science and Literature\u2019. If \u2018military\u2019 in its wider sense is taken to embrace air power, that serves for today. Though lacking the precision necessary for terms of reference, it is concise, indicates the aim and permits flexibility at times of violent change. Progress was rapid and fruitful. Gifts to the Museum flowed in, the library was established, and a regular series of lectures and meetings inaugurated. In 1843 nineteen lectures were delivered and seven papers read. In 1841 the membership had risen to 4243. In 1857 the Journal began publication. A gold medal for essays submitted in alternate years on naval and military subjects was inaugurated in 1878, but superseded in 1900 by the Chesney award, and the Trench Gascoigne Prize for submissions by officers under thirty years of age was instituted.\n\nWhere the Chairmen and Councils equally command our admiration is in the hard work of financial management and administration. In those early years the Whitehall area was quite undeveloped. By careful investment the Council was able to accumulate funds to buy land and premises to accommodate the new Institute, complete with show rooms and a lecture theatre at a cost of \u00a310,000. Then, in 1871, regardless of the previous expressions of goodwill and promises on the part of the Government, the Treasury gave the Institute four months notice to quit, without compensation, as the land was required for development. Vigorous protests secured a stay of execution, but positive help came from Queen Victoria herself, who allotted the Banqueting Hall to accommodate the contents of the Museum. An appeal for funds by Council was generously met, with the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Dukes of Edinburgh, Connaught and Cambridge heading the list, raising the \u00a323,000 required to lease a plot of land adjacent to the Banqueting Hall and build new offices, a library and a lecture theatre. The new building was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1895. The Institute was thus administratively secure for the foreseeable future, but in 1962 the Government reclaimed the Banqueting Hall, and the exhibits, by then, it must be admitted of purely antiquarian value, were dispersed. In 1970 the lease expired, and the terms for renewal were more than the Institute could afford, but long, tough and patient negotiations enabled the Institute to continue as a tenant.\n\nNew Direction\n\nThe 1960s saw the beginning of a fundamental change in the mission, or at least the way the mission was interpreted, and the way the Institute managed the intellectual side of its affairs. So far the more active members had done most of the work, providing the flow of papers and ideas, while the in-house staff was run with the utmost economy. For instance, Captain E Altham (1931) combined the roles of Secretary, Editor of the journal and Higher Executive Officer. In 1961 Brigadier Stephenson as Director had only a part-time editor as assistant. As in 1829, the spur of action was applied by relatively junior officers, although unlike the anonymous \u2018Old Campaigner\u2019 and Commander Downes, they were greatly to distinguish themselves later in their careers. In 1963 the future Marshal of the RAF and Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Cameron, Admiral Sir Louis le Bailly and Brigadier Kenneth Hunt, then students at the Imperial Defence College, wrote a letter published in The Times, arguing that the country lacked an independent `think tank' for the academic study of national defence, and that the need could be met by developing and widening the activities of the RUSI. This caught the attention of Lord Mountbatten, who gave it his support, although it was to be twenty year before sufficient staff of the right calibre could be afforded and assembled to carry out the essential in-house research and compose and edit an adequate range of publications. A beginning was made in 1968, when Air Vice-Marshal S W B Menaul was appointed Director General, and extended the publications to monographs on defence subjects, the reports of the seminars h introduced and the union with Brassey's Publications t produce the Defence Year book, assisted only by an Editor, a Librarian and a Secretary who doubled as treasury and house administrator. The road to the present satisfactory state of our affairs, as set out in the Chairman Council's report to the AGM of 1991, has been a tough one, the achievement, we must all gratefully recognise of the imaginative and energetic staff of the Institute under the Director, and the constant watchfulness, tact and voluntary labour of successive distinguished Chairmen of Council; as in the 1870s and 1970s, so now.\n\nBrigadier R G S Bidwell was a Vice President of the RUSI. He was Editor of the RUSI Journal from 1971-1975 and Deputy Director from 1973. He is the author of several twentieth century military history titles, the most recent being Tug of War: The Battle for Italy 1943-1945, with Dominic Graham, published in 1986."}, {"url": "https://rusi.org/about/our-purpose/our-history/", "page_content": "The Royal United Services Institute has been at the heart of military and security thinking for over 190 years.

Just last week, a senior MI5 officer, known only as Director K, also spoke to The Telegraph on hostile state activity and the need for an overhaul of the Official Secrets Act to challenge \u2018increasingly damaging activity\u2019.\n\nThat the UK\u2019s intelligence community now has a voice is welcome. Traditionally, the UK\u2019s agencies took a neither seen nor heard approach, with fictional depictions often filling the void. Previously, it was also up to ministers to praise the work of MI5, GCHQ and SIS \u2013 a mode of communication that would be risky now. In 2019, research by the Hansard Society found that the public had little trust in ministers and even MPs, with just 33% saying they had confidence in government. The same polling found that Britons had more faith in the military (74%) and judiciary (62%). New work by the Institute for Public Policy Research found the picture remained the same.\n\nRecent polling by YouGov suggests that on the issue of \u2018trust\u2019, the UK public have relatively high levels of it for the UK\u2019s agencies. 58% of those surveyed said they had a \u2018great deal\u2019 or \u2018some\u2019 trust, as opposed to 16% who had \u2018not much\u2019 and 7% no trust at all. The message is clear that, if public trust in politicians is low, the agencies themselves need to be increasingly prominent in their messaging. The issue \u2013 as it always has been \u2013 is how do they get that message across?\n\nPolling suggests that, despite trusting the agencies, Britons have \u2013 as I previously wrote \u2013 little understanding about what they do. Nor do they go and read statements on websites or the reports of the Intelligence and Security Committee to find out more. It is not good enough having a website; the people the agencies want to recruit often do not visit. The message is that if the agencies want to contribute to discussions, and reach out to new audiences, they should do it themselves in imaginative ways. The coverage of C\u2019s speech is a good example: agencies need to be more prominent in the headlines, not just be heard about when things go wrong.\n\nEngagement may not always be a success, and can often be cringeworthy when it goes wrong. TikToker Elise Lamsdale\u2019s video criticising an SIS recruitment site featuring Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons and geeks recently went viral. \u2018Which boomer signed off on this?\u2019 she complained. The site, \u2018GeeksLikeYou\u2019 \u2013 an attempt to build on the earlier #SecretlyWereJustLikeYou campaign \u2013 also referenced Bond and gaming culture. \u2018Our ideal candidate isn\u2019t Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye. (Sorry, Pierce.) It\u2019s you: the geek who knows that GoldenEye was the best game on the N64\u2019, it says on the frontpage, while helpfully pointing out that SIS is in no way linked to Daniel Craig or Brosnan."}]}
