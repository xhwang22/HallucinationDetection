She was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons from 1984 to 2005. She became a member of the House of Lords in 2005.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nVirginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Garnett was born in Dunoon, Scotland, to Barbara Rutherford-Smith, Jarrow hunger marcher, a teacher and elected Conservative member of the Inner London Education Authority and W. John Garnett CBE, former director of what was then called The Industrial Society, grandson of Cambridge physicist and educational adviser William Garnett and of Sir Edward Poulton, Hope professor of zoology at Oxford. Her paternal aunt was Labour Greater London Council member Peggy Jay. She first met Peter Bottomley, her future husband, when she was 12 years old; they wed in 1967.\n\nBottomley was educated at Putney High School, an independent school for girls in Putney in southwest London, before going up to the University of Essex to study sociology (BA). She later graduated from the London School of Economics with the degree of Master of Arts (MA).\n\nShe began her working life as a social scientist and was a researcher for the Child Poverty Action Group. She has also been a social worker, magistrate (Justice of the Peace), and Chairman of the Inner London Juvenile Court.\n\nMember of Parliament and in government\n\nAfter unsuccessfully contesting the Isle of Wight in the 1983 general election (34,904 votes), she was elected to Parliament with 21,545 votes in a by-election in 1984 (filling the seat left vacant by the death of Maurice Macmillan, son of former prime minister Harold Macmillan), as the Member for South West Surrey, was PPS to Chris Patten and then to Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, received her first ministerial position in 1988 as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment and was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1989. She was appointed a member of the Privy Council (PC) upon joining John Major's Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in 1992, becoming the ninth woman to serve in the British cabinet. She served as Health Secretary until 1995.\n\nBottomley and Ann Widdecombe have been listed as co-founders of Lady Olga Maitland\u2019s pro-nuclear Women and Families for Defence group.\n\nShe served as Secretary of State for National Heritage from 1995 to 1997. During this period, she appeared in the Eurovision Song Contest 1996, wishing luck to the United Kingdom's entrant, Gina G.\n\nAfter the 1997 general election, she returned to the backbenches, and become a headhunter at Odgers, where she headed and now chairs the company's Board & CEO Practice.\n\nRetirement\n\nShe stepped down from the House of Commons when the 2005 general election was called. On 24 June 2005 she was created a life peer with the *le Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, of St Helens in the County of Isle of Wight, the parish where she was baptised and celebrated her marriage.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBottomley is involved with charitable and academic bodies in addition to business. She was on the founding Council of the University of the Arts, London. She was a Council Member of the Ditchley Foundation and was President of Farnham Castle, Centre for International Briefing. From 2000 until May 2012 she sat on the Supervisory Board of Akzo Nobel, taking over Courtaulds and then ICI. She was a non-executive director of Bupa, a healthcare company. She was on the Advisory Council of the International Chamber of Commerce UK (ICC UK) and the Judge School of Management, Cambridge. Bottomley has been a trustee and is a fellow of the Industry and Parliament Trust. She was National President of the Abbeyfield Society and a Vice-Patron of Carers and of Cruse Bereavement Care. She was a lay canon of Guildford Cathedral, and a Freeman of the City of London.\n\nIn 2006, she was elected and installed as Chancellor of the University of Hull, succeeding Lord Armstrong of Ilminster in April 2006. She was also appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Surrey in March of that year and Sheriff of Hull since 2013. She is the longest serving trustee of The Economist newspaper.\n\nVirginia Garnett married Peter Bottomley in 1967, after the birth of their eldest child; since 1975 he has been an MP.\n\nDuring her time in Prime Minister John Major's cabinet, the satirical puppet show Spitting Image often portrayed Major as having an unrequited crush on Bottomley; years later, it was revealed that Major was having an affair with Edwina Currie at the time.\n\nBottomley's family includes many figures in politics and public life. Her brother, Christopher Garnett, was the chief executive of train operating company GNER. Her aunt Pauline married Roland Hunt who is not connected to Sir Nicholas Hunt, father of Jeremy Hunt who succeeded her as MP.\n\nHer cousins include Peter Jay (the former British Amb*ador to the United States and son-in-law to James Callaghan), and Lord Hunt of Chesterton (father of historian and former Labour MP Tristram Hunt).\n\nMore distant relatives include Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay and Baron Jay of Ewelme (former FCO PUSS and British Amb*ador to France).\n\nJulia Cleverdon married Bottomley's late father, John.

The conclusions are an indictment of the First Past the Post system used to elect the House of Commons. The national and local outcomes amply justify our description of 2005 as the \u2018Worst Election Ever\u2019, and the indictment is spelt out in detail in what follows. However, we also hope that the research that has gone into this report is of interest regardless of the reader\u2019s views on the issue of electoral reform. I would like to thank all my colleagues, particularly Christine McCartney and Khadijah Elshayyal (Chapter 5), Stuart Stoner (Chapter 6), Alex Folkes (Chapter 7) and Ken Ritchie (Conclusion). The team who entered election data overnight on 5-6 May (Stuart Stoner, Ryan O\u2019Donnell, Aly Verjee and James Osmond) and on that weary Friday (Christine McCartney, Mark Hayward and Khadijah Elshayyal) also deserve heartfelt recognition. Thanks also to Tom Carpenter of texture for the design work.\n\nThe National Result\n\nGovernment by a small minority \u2013 the worst election ever Labour won an overall majority of 66 seats, or 55.1 per cent of seats, with 35.2 per cent of the vote. No majority government in British history has ever rested on a flimsier base of public support \u2013 or, more accurately, none has since the extension of the franchise in 1918. In terms of active public consent for government, Britain is almost back in the pre-reform era of rotten boroughs. The table below gives the votes and seats for each of the majority governments in the last century which had less than 45 per cent of the vote at the outset. General Election Winning Party % votes (UK) % seats 1964 Labour 44.1 50.3 1979 Conservative 43.9 53.4 1997 Labour 43.2 63.4 1983 Conservative 42.4 61.1 1987 Conservative 42.3 57.8 1992 Conservative 41.9 51.6 2001 Labour 40.7 62.5 1974 October Labour 39.2 50.2 1922 Conservative 38.2 56.1 2005 Labour 35.2 55.1 The only remotely comparable election is 1922, although Labour in 2005 still polled 3 percentage points worse than the Conservatives did in 1922.1 It is notable that no election since 1970 has produced a government with 45 per cent of the vote, and that the trend in the most recent elections has been to produce significant majorities with ever lower shares of the popular vote. A Commons majority has enormous power, and this power has now been awarded on the basis of only 35.2 per cent of the vote. The case for electoral reform has become stronger with each successive election. Labour\u2019s share of the vote in 2005 can also be compared unfavourably to the support enjoyed in past elections by losing parties. Attlee\u2019s share of the vote in 1955 when Eden\u2019s Conservatives won a majority of 58, comparable to Blair\u2019s majority in 2005, was an amazing 46.4 per cent. Blair\u2019s winning 35.2 per cent is scarcely higher than Neil Kinnock\u2019s share of the vote in 1992 (34.4 per cent) and less than Jim Callaghan scored in 1979 in his unsuccessful bid for a third Labour term (36.9 per cent). The government\u2019s level of support among voters is therefore small. But taking the electorate as a whole, the proportion of eligible people who cast a vote to return the government is extremely small \u2013 only 21.6 per cent, or 9.6 million out of an electorate of 44.4 million. In terms of votes actually cast for Labour, this is the lowest total of any post-1945 election with the single exception of 1983. The table shows the cases in the last century when a majority government has been returned with the votes of less than a third of the electorate. Again, the 1922 election (although note that this might be a misleading comparison) and the string of recent elections since October 1974 have seen record low shares of the electorate giving support to a government. Even among this company, 2005 stands out as producing a government with exceptionally few votes. The present electoral system may allow the government to carry on regardless for a 4-5 year term, despite its low poll in 2001 and the withdrawal of enthusiasm signified by the drop in the Labour Party share of the vote of 5.5 percentage points from 2001 to 2005. General Election Winning Party % of electorate 1979 Conservative 33.3 1992 Conservative 32.6 1987 Conservative 31.8 1997 Labour 30.9 1983 Conservative 30.8 1974 October Labour 28.6 1922 Conservative 26 2001 Labour 24.2 2005 Labour 21.6 The electoral basis of British government also emerges looking shakier than in most other democratic countries. Only Turkey has a majority government with a lower share of the vote. In the table, \u2018government share of vote\u2019 is in the most recent principal legislative election, for the body most resembling the UK House of Commons. Note that some countries have a different model of government from others. Systems with an executive presidency (e.g. France, Chile, USA) may not require majority support in the legislature for government to be carried out. In Switzerland it is customary for the largest parties to form a consensus government. In Estonia and Lithuania a relatively small party may be in government but rely on support from shifting parliamentary allies to get its business through. In other situations, as in Sweden, a minority government may have the regular external support of a party which while it does not have ministers in the government is still generally supportive and is given rights of consultation etc. In Sweden the total support for Left and Green parties that regularly vote with the government takes the government bloc comfortably over 50%. In the 1970s the \u2018Lib Lab pact\u2019 was a UK parallel to this form of external support. Other than the rather anomalous three Baltic states, Britain is clearly, after Turkey, bottom of the charts for the electoral legitimacy of the government. The nearest competitors are Canada, Croatia, South Korea and France \u2013 but in Canada the government has no overall majority and in Croatia, South Korea and France there is a separate presidential election in which the President has received majority support. In Turkey, there is a proportional system with a 10% threshold for election, which excluded all but two parties in the election.

But there is small consolation in this being the second worst since 1918. Turnout should have increased even more under the circumstances. The polls and the dynamic of the campaign suggested more of a contest than 2001, when opinion surveys found that a foregone conclusion turned many electors away from voting. There was a large increase in postal voting, which in theory should have helped turnout.The political temperature, in the new circumstances after the 2003 Iraq war, seemed higher than in sleepy June 2001, several months before the attack on the World Trade Center. And yet there was only an improvement of 2 percentage points. In historical terms, 2005 is clearly in the relegation zone of the turnout league table of elections in the last century.The table below gives the turnout in all the elections in the last century in which turnout has fallen below 75 per cent. 1918 was affected by the war (the armistice came only a month before the poll) and disorganisation and the official turnout probably underestimates participation. Even in relatively recent elections turnout has been much higher \u2013 77.7 per cent in 1992 for instance. 2005\u2019s turnout, like 2001, was about 60 per cent, in contrast to previous elections such as 1970 when a turnout of just over 70 per cent was regarded as poor. The problem of public disengagement from politics has clearly not been solved. Britain\u2019s turnout also compares unfavourably with most other countries. It is the lowest for a national parliament among the original 15 EU states, although in most postcommunist states in eastern and central Europe there seems to be a low rate of this form of democratic participation. Britain, Canada and the USA are all notable in being English speaking (or in Canada\u2019s case bilingual) democracies with FPTP and particularly low rates of turnout.

But parliament is still a grossly distorted version of what Britain\u2019s voters chose in 2005.

Once again, the principal victims of the system were smaller parties with evenly spread support, namely the Liberal Democrats, UKIP and Ulster Unionists. The Conservatives were slightly under-represented, in that if they had won seats exactly in proportion to their vote they would have won 208.The Liberal Democrats had many fewer seats than their share of the vote among the electorate justified \u2013 an exactly proportional distribution would have given them 142. Labour were massively overrepresented: a proportional allocation would have given them 227 seats rather than 355. Small parties with relatively evenly spread support are penalised under FPTP. UKIP was clearly the fourth party in terms of votes, but it failed to win or even come close in a single seat. Seven parties with fewer votes than UKIP, and two Independents, elected members of parliament. The Green Party stood many fewer candidates, conscious that the system was unfair to them, and many voters were deprived of the chance of choosing them. Small parties with concentrated support, like the SNP and Plaid Cymru, did better. The failure to represent small but significant points of view contrasts the Westminster Parliament with the more proportional bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland where minorities have a voice. BNP support, as in the European election, was probably too small to elect a candidate under all but the most proportional list forms of PR, with very large regional seats, had another system been used in the general election. In no single area would they have gained enough votes to elect a candidate under the Single Transferable Vote, nor under the Jenkins Report\u2019s system of AV+, in 2005. The Conservatives improved their position somewhat compared to 2001, when there were 50,347 votes per Conservative MP (and 26,000 per Labour MP). This was because their share of the vote did not increase much, while they won more seats thanks to a more favourable distribution of the vote and Labour votes going to the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems were a little less well rewarded for their vote than in 2001, when they had 92,583 votes per MP \u2013 their vote rose across the country but did not tip over many extra marginal seats.\n\nWasted votes FPTP means that a huge number of votes end up being wasted, in that they do not affect who is elected to Parliament either because they are cast for losing candidates or serve simply to swell the majority of the winning candidate. A majority of the votes in 2005 went to losing candidates, while a narrow majority went to the winners in 2001. The 2005 election saw a slight increase in wasted votes compared to 2001. Over 70% of votes were either for a losing candidate or were surplus to the winner\u2019s requirements. This accounts for over 19 million votes.

The reasons for the bias are explored below in chapter 9, but the basic statistics are given here. The extent of bias in the 2005 result is apparent from above, but the full scale of bias is exposed when one tries to estimate the effect of changes in the share of vote. If the Conservatives had drawn level with Labour, with each party polling the same share of the vote (33.8%), they would have gained an additional 19 seats from Labour and 3 from the Liberal Democrats, and one would flip from Labour to the Lib Dems.2 This would have meant 336 Labour seats to 220 Conservatives (assuming, for all the calculations that follow, that Staffordshire South counts as Conservative), an advantage of 116 seats despite equal numbers of votes.The Labour majority would have been 26 \u2013 not very comfortable, but more than the majority of 21 John Major achieved with a lead in share of the vote of 7.5%. For Labour to lose their overall majority it would require a uniform 2.2% swing to the Conservatives (taking account of \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in terms of Labour losses to the Lib Dems), i.e. a Conservative lead of 1.4%. For the Conservatives to draw level with Labour in terms of seats, overcoming the deficit of 158 seats, they would need a swing of 5.2%, i.e. a lead of 7.5% in share of the vote, if it took place entirely from Conservative gains from Labour. However, they would be helped by collateral effects which would reduce the required swing to only 4.6%, i.e. a vote share lead of 6.3%. For the Conservatives to win outright with a majority of 2, with 324 seats, they would need 126 gains. If these were all to come from Labour this would require a swing of 8.3%, i.e. a national lead of 13.7%. Taking account of collateral Conservative gains from other parties, the target is a scarcely less daunting 7.3% swing, implying a national lead of 11.7%. The next election will of course not be fought on the same boundaries, except in Scotland. A further detailed analysis of the boundary changes follows in Chapter 8, but in summary the changes will not amount to a substantial correction to bias \u2013 a reduction in the Labour majority from 66 to around 52. The swing required for Labour to lose their overall majority would therefore drop a little, maybe by enough to make it unlikely that Labour could poll fewer votes than the Conservatives and still have a majority. But the prospect of a Conservative majority government is pretty much as remote on the new boundaries as on the old \u2013 the swing required for them to accomplish this would be something like 7%, implying a national lead of 11%. The Conservatives may be suffering from the bias in the electoral system, but the Liberal Democrats are still more gravely disadvantaged. This can be illustrated simply by imagining a uniform change in votes across the whole country that gave the three main parties an equal share of the vote. The table illustrates this outcome. Vote share % Seats Share of seats % Conservative 29.8 202 31.3 Labour 29.8 317 49 LiberalDemocrat 29.8 94 14.6 Others 10.6 33 1.5\n\nThe Constituencies\n\nMinority mandates Only 34% of MPs were elected with over half the vote in their own constituencies, the lowest proportion in British history.

It is actually the lowest proportion of MPs with majority support ever, exceeding the previous record set in February 1974 (408 MPs out of 635, or 64.3%). At 55, the number of MPs elected with less than 40% of the vote was also substantially up on 2001 (21 MPs). 30 were in England, 13 in Scotland, 7 in Wales and 5 in Northern Ireland; 8 were Conservative, 29 Labour and 7 Lib Dem.

Turnout in 2005 was strongly influenced by the degree to which there was a genuine contest in the seat. This table compares the turnout in the 10 seats in England and Wales with the smallest percentage majorities in 2001 and the 10 with the largest percentage majorities in 2001.3 Turnout (%) 2001 turnout 2005 turnout Change Most marginal seats 66.0 68.8 +2.8 Safest seats 50.0 51.4 +1.4 Not only was there an enormous gap between turnout in the safe and marginal seats in 2001, but it actually became wider in 2005. Turnout in the 10 most marginal seats was 17.4 percentage points higher than in the 10 safest seats. Further, nearly a third of the entire rise among the 10 safest seats was because one of them, Blaenau Gwent, suddenly became competitive with the decision of the sitting Assembly Member Peter Law to challenge the new Labour candidate. In some inner city seats turnout remained very low, although it generally lifted a little after the nadir of 2001. The constituency with the lowest turnout was once again Liverpool Riverside (41.5%, compared to only 34.1% in 2001), followed by Manchester Central (42.0%, up from 39.1% in 2001). In 32 constituencies, turnout in 2005 fell below 50 per cent, compared to 67 in the 2001 election \u2013 but none at all in 1997.\n\nSplit votes and tactical votes FPTP can make constituency contests a guessing game. During the 2005 election campaign various journalists and websites attempted to advise on how voters might accomplish what they considered a desirable overall result. The results were mixed. For some voters, the choice threw up a dilemma of whether to vote for the party they really preferred, or to cast a vote for the party with the best chance of keeping out the candidate they most disliked. In the now highly marginal Harlow constituency, the result was: Party Vote share 2001 (%) Vote share 2005 (%) Change in vote share 2001-05 Labour 47.8 41.4 -6.4 Conservative 34.8 41.2 +6.4 Lib Dem 13.4 12.6 -0.8 UKIP 3.0 2.5 -0.5 Veritas \u2013 2.4 +2.4 Socialist Alliance 1.0 \u2013 -1.0 Labour held Harlow, albeit by only 97 votes, even though there was a sharp swing to the Conservatives in particular and the right in general. The right wing vote increased from 37.8% in 2001 to 46.1% in 2005, while the left wing vote fell from 48.8% (or 62.2% including the Lib Dems) in 2001 to 41.4% (54.0% including Lib Dems) in 2005. A large part of the reason was the change in the minor parties standing \u2013 if a left-wing minor candidate had stood in 2005, or if one fewer right wing candidate had stood, it is likely that the Conservatives would have won. But the Harlow situation was relatively unusual. More common was the situation in seats such as in Shrewsbury and Atcham where the Conservatives gained scarcely any more of the vote than they did in 2001 but still elected an MP because the Labour vote fragmented. Vote share 2001 (%) Vote share 2005 (%) Change in vote share 2001-05 Labour 44.6 34.1 -10.5 Conservative 37.4 37.7 +0.3 Lib Dem 12.4 22.8 +10.4 UKIP 3.2 2.7 -0.5 Green 1.9 2.3 +0.4 Others 0.5 0.4 -0.1 There was a small movement to Conservative, perhaps from UKIP, but the Conservative was elected thanks to a large swing from Labour to Lib Dem. Another extreme case was the result that unseated Chris Leslie in Shipley: Vote share 2001 (%) Vote share 2005 (%) Change in vote share 2001-05 Labour 44.0 38.2 -5.8 Conservative 40.9 39.0 -1.9 Lib Dem 10.9 14.7 +3.8 BNP \u2013 4.0 +4.0 Green 3.0 3.5 +0.5 UKIP 1.3 \u2013 -1.3 Anti Iraq war \u2013 0.4 +0.4 The Conservatives polled rather under what they managed in 2001, but still gained the seat by default. The fact that Shrewsbury & Atcham and Shipley are written up as Conservative gains (despite no real increase in Conservative support) while Harlow is a Labour hold despite the Conservatives achieving a real swing in their favour is a telling indication of how little FPTP results can have to do with movements of opinion. The pattern of 1997 and 2001 was that of tactical votes coalescing about the candidate most able to defeat the Conservatives. The partial unwinding of this effect has led to an increase in minority winners and smaller majorities. Seats such as Shrewsbury (and others like St Albans) end up changing hands less because of changes in opinion than because of the shifting pattern of tactical voting. The Labour Party spent a large part of the last week of the campaign trying to persuade voters that if they deserted the party for the Lib Dems, they could end up with a Tory government. While the arithmetic employed may have been shaky and there was little chance of such a movement leading to an outright Conservative victory, it did happen in some constituencies such as the ones indicated above. Of the 31 Conservative gains from Labour, only 12 were won under the Conservatives\u2019 own steam (i.e. that the gain in the Conservative share of the vote accompanied by an equivalent fall in the Labour vote) and 19 by default because of Labour losses to the other parties.\n\nMarginals and ultra-marginals During the election campaign it was prominently reported in the Times (6 April) that the main parties were concentrating their efforts on the 800,000 voters who would make a difference to the result. These were people living in the marginal seats who were judged on the basis of public opinion research to be likely to vote and also open to persuasion as to whom they might support. These 800,000 lucky people amounted to fewer than 2 per cent of the entire electorate. The premium that the FPTP electoral system puts on marginal seats means that votes most definitely do not have the same value. The agenda of these swing voters in marginal seats has a disproportionate impact on election campaigns and on British politics in general, and has encouraged a simplistic and sloganising emphasis on issues such as crime, immigration and interest rates from the parties. Concentration on floating voters in marginal seats, who are not necessarily representative of Britain as a whole, has distorted the entire national debate. The number of voters who matter is likely to be even smaller at the next election, because the overall result was closer, there are a larger number of highly marginal seats, and campaign techniques will no doubt have become even more sophisticated and able to target more precisely. After the election it was noted that there was a larger number of what the press quickly dubbed \u2018ultra-marginal\u2019 Labour seats than before. In the 2001-05 parliament 20 Labour MPs (4.9% of the Parliamentary Party) had majorities of less than 5 per cent of the vote. After the 2005 election there were 41 whose seats hung by such a narrow thread (11.5%). The importance of the ultra-marginal MPs is much greater now than before, because Labour could afford to lose all 20 ultra-marginal MPs and still have a three-figure majority while the loss of 41 MPs would see Labour\u2019s overall majority disappear. These 41 MPs will have a particular sensitivity to their constituents\u2019 opinions and an incentive to offer the highest standards of service. That is as it should be, and an electoral system which encouraged these standards to be universal would be a definite improvement. However, the government itself has a great incentive to focus its efforts on these constituencies as opposed to other less marginal seats. The aggregate of the majorities in the most marginal 34 Labour constituencies is only 28,789; if 14,367 voters in these constituencies switched from Labour to the nearest competitor, Labour would be in a minority position in the House of Commons. While it is not quite that simple, because boundary changes will complicate the picture, the focus in the next general election may be so restricted that one will look back to the good old days of 2005 when as many as 800,000 voters mattered to the national debate.

Conservative share of seats 36.7% if they win in Staffordshire South. Labour have a majority of 43 (assuming that there is not a spectacular upset in Staffordshire) among the English seats, and 92 seats more than the Conservatives, despite polling slightly over 50,000 fewer votes than the Conservatives. The reason for Labour\u2019s artificial majority is not so much that the Conservatives are under-represented; more that Labour have vastly more seats than their proportional entitlement while the Lib Dems are under-represented. The result in England does pose some problems for the future. The Conservatives have something of a claim to \u2018Speak for England\u2019, but this must be heavily qualified. That claim rests on only 35.7% of those voting, and unless a Conservative making that claim concedes the case for electoral reform it is nothing more than a debating point. Nevertheless, the reduced English majority for Labour (43 rather than the 117 English majority the party enjoyed in 2001) could mean more occasions when Scottish and Welsh Labour MPs are called upon to vote down English rebels on English legislation.\n\nNorthern Ireland: Helping the extremes to victory The main story of the election in Northern Ireland was the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) landslide against the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). The UUP was reduced to a single seat, while the DUP ended up with nine, half Northern Ireland\u2019s Westminster MPs. The electoral system magnified the victory of the DUP and the fall of the UUP. The DUP was the luckiest party in UK politics, in that it has the fewest votes per MP of any of them, while the UUP was treated worst by the system of any party that won seats. First Past the Post also, to a much lesser extent, helped Sinn Fein in its contest against the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Party Number of seats Percentage of seats Change since 2001 (% point) Percentage of votes Change since 2001 (% point) DUP 9 50.0 +22.2 33.7 +11.2 UUP 1 5.6 -27.8 17.8 -9.0 Alliance 0 0.0 0 3.9 +0.3 SDLP 3 16.7 0 17.5 -3.5 Sinn Fein 5 27.8 +5.6 24.3 +2.6 The DUP\u2019s victory in half the Northern Ireland seats rests on only a little over a third of the votes. While the result ended up roughly proportional on the nationalist side, it gravely distorted the voice with which the unionist electorate of Northern Ireland spoke. For every 2 DUP voters, there was one UUP voter, but this 2:1 ratio of votes became a 9:1 ratio of seats. First Past the Post, not for the first time, has flattened the middle ground of Northern Ireland politics \u2013 a distorted election result in February 1974 killed off the Sunningdale agreement. We shall see whether the consequences of this election are as far-reaching. The result in individual seats was sometimes peculiar. The SDLP\u2019s victory in Belfast South was caused by a split in the Unionist vote between the UUP and DUP (who stood for the first time here in a recent Westminster election); a nationalist now represents a majority unionist constituency. This is the reverse of what happened in West Tyrone in the 1997 parliament, when a UUP MP represented a constituency with a heavy nationalist majority split between SDLP and Sinn Fein. There was some evidence in this election of tactical voting among unionists to support threatened SDLP candidates against Sinn Fein in Foyle and South Down. The Northern Ireland local council elections were held on the same day as the Westminster election but under a different electoral system. Local authority elections, and the other non-Westminster elections in Northern Ireland, use the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. Although there are strong similarities in share of the vote, the results in terms of seats look very different from the Westminster result. Party Number of Seats Percentage of Seats Percentage of votes Change since 2001 DUP 182 31.3 29.6 +8.2 UUP 115 19.8 18.0 -5.2 Alliance 30 5.2 5.0 -0.2 SDLP 101 17.4 17.4 -1.9 Sinn Fein 126 21.6 23.2 +2.7 Other 8 1.4 2.9 -1.7 While the trend towards polarisation is still present, it is clearly less pronounced under Single Transferable Vote. The STV results do not magnify the DUP victory over the UUP, the 3:2 share of seats reflecting the share of the votes between the two unionist parties much more accurately. Sinn Fein was the only party to win a smaller share of seats than votes, probably due to hostility from supporters of other parties, making them less likely to transfer their vote to Sinn Fein. What is also clear is that the public used their vote differently in the Single Transferable Vote election. Voters were more inclined to support Alliance and other smaller parties, receiving between them 7.9% of first preference votes and winning 6.6% of seats, knowing that their votes would not be wasted. Indeed, turnout in the local election was 1% higher than the Westminster poll, despite being held on the same day and for what is perceived as a less important public office. Westminster elections are now the only elections in Northern Ireland for which STV is not used \u2013 local and Assembly elections since 1973 (with the exception of the 1996 Forum election) and European elections since 1979 have all used STV. The outcome, particularly given the suspension of devolved government and the limited powers of Northern Ireland local authorities, means that a system that does not reflect the votes cast, encourages tactical voting and discourages moderation, gives Northern Ireland its principal political voice. If STV had been used for the Westminster election, Northern Ireland would have sent a more balanced delegation to the Commons, with probably something like 6 seats for the DUP and 4 each for the UUP, Sinn Fein and the SDLP (see Chapter 9 below). The plural views that exist within Unionism would have representation. Even in the absence of electoral reform for the whole of the UK there is a case for harmonising the system for electing Northern Ireland MPs with that used for electing every other representative body in Northern Ireland.\n\nScotland Share of vote % Number of seats Votes per MP Share of seats % Labour 39.5 42* 21,962 71.2* Lib Dem 22.6 11 48,007 18.6 SNP 17.7 6 68,711 10.2 Conservative 15.8 1 369,388 1.7 SSP 1.9 0 N/A 0 *Including Speaker The Conservatives suffered even worse treatment by the electoral system in Scotland than they did in England.They polled nearly a sixth of the vote but had only one MP out of 59 to show for their pains. With a very similar share of the vote in the 2003 Scottish Parliament elections (16.6% in the constituency section), Scottish Conservatives gained an appropriate amount of representation (18 seats out of 129). This was because of the proportional system employed for elections to the Parliament. The Scottish Conservatives suffer because their vote is thinly spread across the country. There are only 10 constituencies where the party was in second place in 2005 and within 20% of the winner, and only three of those are currently Labour-held seats. The electoral system is likely to continue to under-represent the Conservatives in Scotland and consign them to a minor role in Scottish politics at Westminster. There have now been, following the wipe-out in 1997, two elections in which over a third of a million Scottish Conservatives have had to make do with one MP. Labour\u2019s domination of Scottish representation at Westminster relies on a little under 40 per cent of the vote. Interestingly, the Liberal Democrats as the second party, with support now quite unevenly distributed across Scotland as a whole, are now doing quite well out of FPTP, getting only just under their proportional entitlement.\n\nWales Share of vote % Number of seats Votes per MP Share of seats % Labour 42.7 29 20,511 72.5 Conservative 21.4 3 99,277 7.5 Lib Dem 18.4 4 64,062 10.0 Plaid Cymru 12.6 3 58,279 7.5 Others 1 Like Scotland, Wales\u2019s representation in Westminster is dominated by the Labour Party, to a much greater extent than merited by the party\u2019s lead in share of the vote. The Conservatives were once again severely under-represented, although they managed to gain 3 seats in contrast to being wiped out in 1997 and 2001. Two particularly narrow gains (in Clwyd West and Preseli Pembrokeshire, by majorities of 133 and 607 respectively) were important in getting the meagre level of representation they won in 2005. It was not that Conservatives were wiped out in Wales for eight years, it was just that their voters (over a quarter of a million of them in 2001) were not represented by anyone of their choice. The Welsh Conservatives, like their Scottish counterparts, suffered from having their vote thinly spread across the country. While they were clearly second in terms of votes, with a three-point lead over the Lib Dems, they were joint third in seats, behind the Lib Dems. In the Welsh Assembly elections, for a comparable share of the vote (19.9% in the constituency section, 19.2% for the list) the Conservatives secured 11 representatives in the Assembly of 60, enough to be an effective opposition. This was despite winning only one constituency seat; 10 of their 11 AMs are there because of the proportional top-up seats.\n\nUnfair local Representation\n\nUnfair local Representation There are many examples of areas within Britain where the outcome in terms of seats bears little relation to the votes that were cast. In East Sussex (including Brighton and Hove) the Labour Party astonishingly managed to win 4 out of the 8 seats in the county despite being third with just over a quarter of the vote (25.4%).The Conservatives were well ahead in votes, with 39.8%, but won only three seats, while the Lib Dems had one seat for 26.2% of the vote. In Cumbria, the result was extremely unrepresentative. The Conservatives were the most popular party in the county, with 38.2 per cent of the vote, but they have only one MP out of six to show for it. Labour came second, with 34.6%, and won four seats, a majority of the county\u2019s representation.The Lib Dems had 23.1% and one seat. At least in these areas all parties have at least one local voice in parliament. In some places FPTP can exclude parties with substantial but evenly spread local support\n\nfrom getting a voice at all, and award monopolies to parties in places where there are significant opposing votes.This makes it difficulty for opposing parties to secure enough local media coverage and maintain adequate organisation to maintain a challenge; the perception that a minority party does not matter in the area is self-reinforcing. Each main party enjoyed areas where it had a monopoly in seats but far from a monopoly in votes. In Cornwall, the Liberal Democrats won all five parliamentary seats with 44.4 per cent of the vote.The Conservatives with 31.8% and Labour with 15.9% won nothing. In Surrey the Conservatives picked up 11 out of 11 with 50.5%; the Lib Dems with 28.4% and Labour with 16.7% had nothing. In Tyne and Wear Labour won 13 out of 13 with 55.8%, compared to nothing for the Lib Dems and Conservatives on 23.2% and 17.4% respectively. There are examples of large minorities in several areas with no representation for their parties. There are other areas in which parties have only won token numbers of seats despite polling large numbers of votes.The Conservatives once again won extremely few seats in the metropolitan counties outside London, a total of 5 out of 124 of these urban seats, unchanged since 2001 and one fewer than in 1997. These 5 MPs were all that the\n\n1.1 million Conservative voters in the metropolitan counties managed to elect. If the number of MPs reflected the proportion of votes cast, there would have been 30 Conservatives representing these regions. FPTP has not only weakened the voice of the Conservatives in the big cities, it has also weakened the voice of the big cities within the Conservative Party. Its task in reconnecting with these areas is made even more difficult. Labour have not been penalised to the same extent in any broad category of seat such as the Conservative under- representation in the metropolitan areas. Even in counties where Labour\u2019s share of the vote is low there are often urban seats capable of voting Labour. However, Labour\u2019s rural support is under-represented in the House of Commons despite Labour\u2019s victories in seats such as Stroud and Ynys Mon. In the Eastern region all the Labour seats are predominantly urban, despite well over 100,000 people voting Labour in the rural East Anglian seats.

The point has been raised in a surprising context. Iain Duncan Smith has argued that to give the final say over the Conservative leadership to the party\u2019s MPs is to deny Scotland, Wales and the cities much of a voice in the process. This is true under FPTP, but under a reformed electoral system Conservative voters in these areas would have some MPs and not risk being completely ignored when the party takes important decisions.

At just under 20%, Britain remains behind most Western European parliaments, which tend to have proportional electoral systems. With three quarters of all female MPs representing the Labour party, even the current insufficient level of women\u2019s representation in the Commons is potentially dependent only on Labour\u2019s majority. Should another party come to dominate at a future election, unless the proportion of women becomes more uniform across the parties, we could witness a decline in the representation of women. Of the 119 women in the previous parliament, 83 were successful in seeking re-election, 10 lost their seats and 15 retired. 36 of the female MPs elected on 5th May are therefore new MPs. At the next general election, twenty women will be defending majorities of less than 2,000. The Liberal Democrats and Labour each increased their number of women by four, while the Conservatives added three female MPs to their ranks. However, the impact of these gains on the composition of the party groups is not uniform. Party Number of women MPs Increase/ Decrease Proportion of parliamentary party % Labour 98 +4 27.5 Conservative 17 +3 8.6 Liberal Democrat 10 +4 16.1 Other 3 \u2013 While the total number of Labour MPs fell from 412 to 355, the number of Labour women rose from 94 to 98. At 27.5%, Labour remains far ahead of the other parties. The Liberal Democrats increased their female representation by 5%, proportionally a greater increase than Labour, though from a lower starting point. Despite not using quotas to increase the number of women selected, the Fawcett Society calculated that 32% of candidates in key target seats were women. One sitting female MP lost her seat, Sue Doughty losing out to Conservative Anne Milton in Guildford.The five seats in which a woman candidate won the seat for the Lib Dems saw large swings and gains in Falmouth and Camborne and Solihull were particularly unexpected.The number of Liberal Democrat women in the Commons has doubled since 2001.The party needs to build on this positive trend by ensuring it brings forward more women to contest winnable seats. When Justine Greening took the Putney seat early in the evening, it seemed that victory had a female face for the Conservatives.Yet despite increasing their number of women MPs by three, the proportion of women in their Commons team was virtually unchanged.The three women who gained seats for the Conservatives all have slim majorities, including a wafer thin 347 for Anne Milton in Guildford. Like the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives can not afford to leave it to chance if they want to see an increase in their proportion of women in parliament. The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 cleared the way for political parties to use positive discrimination in the selection of election candidates, should they wish to do so. Labour is the only party to use this provision and the impact of the policy of using all- women shortlists in a significant number of safe seats with retiring incumbents has had on the number of women returned to parliament is shown in the table: Year All Women Shortlists Increase /Decrease in No. of women returned 1997 Yes +64 2001 No -5 2005 Yes +4 In 2005, all of the new Labour women elected in England were selected by all-women shortlists. Positive action became a heated and divisive issue in the Welsh constituency of Blaenau Gwent. Welsh Assembly Member for the constituency Peter Law resigned from the party over its imposition of an all women shortlist on the local Labour party, blocking his candidacy. He took on the official candidate, Maggie Jones and won with 58 per cent of the vote. His victory was probably as much a backlash against central control over local constituency associations as a vote of no confidence in all-women shortlists. Nationally though, the policy helped the party achieve its goal of addressing the gender imbalance in the Parliamentary Labour Party. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats witnessed small rises in their number of women elected without using all women shortlists.The Liberal Democrats debated the use of shortlists in 2001 and voted against using them. Instead, a Gender Balance Task Force was formed to provide mentoring, training and financial support to candidates and advice to the party on removing barriers to women\u2019s participation. The Conservatives supported the right for parties to use quotas by backing the bill, but remain ideologically opposed to using them to select Tory candidates. Changes to candidate selection under the chairmanship of Theresa May were designed to remove all forms of discrimination and professionalise the process.The election results do not suggest that women have so far made significant gains under this new regime.\n\nWomen: regional variations With the boundary changes in Scotland, both the number and the proportion of women returned fell. In the last parliament, 12 out of 72 constituencies (16.7%) were represented by a woman MP. Only 9 of the 59 new Scottish constituencies returned a woman MP in the new Commons, a rate of 15.3%. With fewer seats to go around, women candidates perhaps suffered in tighter competition for selections because retiring MPs were often replaced by incumbents displaced from nearby seats.The proportion of women representing Scotland was already behind England and now slips behind Northern Ireland and Wales. The number of women returned by Scottish voters to Westminster is in stark contrast to the 40 per cent representation of women in the Scottish Parliament, achieved through proactive measures by the parties and the opportunities provided by a new institution with the absence of incumbents (and incidentally a more proportional electoral system).The SNP did not return any women in their six seats and lost Annabelle Ewing, MP for Perth in the previous parliament but displaced to a less winnable seat (Ochil and South Perthshire) in the boundary changes. Wales, on the other hand, more than doubled the number of women, from 3 in the last Parliament to 7 out of 40 seats. However, this still only represents 17.5% of Welsh MPs, and again is far behind the 50% rate in the Welsh Assembly. Northern Ireland again returned three women, with the Ulster Unionist Sylvia Hermon being the only candidate from that party to hold her seat.Though the re-election of three women out of 18 MPs (16.6%) marks a step forward for Northern Ireland (the region did not return a single woman for 30 years prior to that), there was little prospect of more women being elected; in no other constituency did a woman candidate come close. While the proportion of women returned to the Northern Ireland Assembly (elected under the Single Transferable Vote) is only slightly higher, due to multi-member constituencies, 13 of the 18 constituencies are represented by at least one female MLA.\n\nEthnic minority representation The 2005 election saw a small increase in the number of Black and Minority Ethnic MPs from 13 to 15. If the make up of MPs was to reflect the population in the country (7.9% BME), there should be 51 MPs from minority ethnic backgrounds, demonstrating that the current level of representation is still seriously inequitable. Ten sitting candidates successfully defended their seats, one retired and was replaced by another black MP and two sitting MPs were unsuccessful in seeking re-election. Party Number of BME MPs Increase/Decrease Proportion of party Labour 13 +1 3.7% Conservatives 2 +2 1% Liberal Democrats 0 -1 0% Other 0 The Conservatives elected their first black MP (Adam Afriyie in Windsor) and an Asian MP (Shailesh Vara in Cambridgeshire North West). Both were selected as candidates in safe seats where the incumbent was retiring, without using positive discrimination. The Liberal Democrats have lost their only ethnic minority MP. Parmijt Singh Gill, who won the Leicester South by-election in 2004, saw the seat pass back to the Labour Party after just ten months in parliament. The Labour Party has increased its total number of ethnic minority MPs by one to 13.\n\nThree new candidates were elected: Sadiq Khan, Shahid Malik and Dawn Butler, who replaced retiring MP Paul Boateng. Oona King was unsuccessful in her bid to hold her Bethnal Green and Bow seat. Labour still has the only two black women MPs \u2013 Diane Abbot and Dawn Butler.The party will also be justifiably disappointed at the failure of Yasmin Qureshi to re-take Brent East, lost to the Liberal Democrats in a 2003 by- election. Had she been returned, she would have been Britain\u2019s first Muslim woman MP. The policy of all-women shortlists has come under fire from some ethnic minority activists who argue that it does not help ethnic minority MPs to get elected, although there is nothing inherent in the process to disadvantage ethnic minority women. One third of ethnic minority MPs represent London constituencies. Most others are in large towns and cities, all with minority ethnic populations above the UK average.\n\nThe two Conservative ethnic minority MPs, and Labour\u2019s Parmjit Dhanda (Gloucester) and Ashok Kumar (Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East) are exceptions. Scotland has only one Asian MP while Wales has none. It is also worth noting that with two exceptions, each of the 15 BME MPs were elected in safe seats where they were either defending a comfortable majority or replacing a retiring incumbent.The exceptions were Gloucester, where first-time incumbent Parmjit Dhanda achieved a small swing in his favour, and the idiosyncratic Bradford West. Many other BME candidates were put forward in seats where the party had little chance of winning. Whilst both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives put forward more BME candidates, fielding 40 and 41 BME candidates respectively, several were contesting seats with a sitting ethnic minority candidate. For example, Brent South saw Dawn Butler, James Allie and Rishi Saha contesting for the same seat. As some of the BME candidates were competing against each other, this placed limits on the number which could be elected.\n\nThe Electoral Reform Debate\n\nThe Electoral Reform Debate In this section we examine the role that the issue of electoral reform played during the 2005 election campaign \u2013 the positions of the main political parties on electoral and some other constitution reform proposals, and the results of the Electoral Reform Society\u2019s candidate questionnaire which was distributed during the campaign. We also look at the efforts of the electoral reform campaign during the election, particularly the Make My Vote Count campaign, before considering the reactions to the election result and how the campaign might proceed during the 2005 parliament.\n\nParty manifesto commitments The Conservative Party promised to cut the number of MPs by 20%, and to make the House of Commons \u2018more capable of standing up to the executive\u2019 by strengthening select committees and ensuring there was time for \u2018proper scrutiny of all legislation\u2019.The party also promised to ensure that exclusively English matters would be decided without the votes of MPs sitting for Scottish constituencies, as well as promising to seek cross-party consensus for a substantially elected House of Lords.The party made no mention of electoral reform \u2013 a subsequent statement said: \u2018The Conservative Party believes that proportional representation undermines democratic accountability, weakens the link between electors and their representatives, and gives a disproportionate influence to minority parties.\u2019 By contrast, other opposition parties all continued to back calls for electoral reform. The Liberal Democrats reiterated their backing for the Single Transferable Vote system, promising to \u2018extend this fair voting system to all local elections in Britain, and to the House of Commons, Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales\u2019. The party also promised to review the European electoral system \u2018so people can choose their MEPs personally, rather than just vote by party list\u2019, and to institute a predominantly elected second chamber.The Liberal Democrats additionally argued that \u2018at the age people can marry, leave school and start work, they will have the right to vote\u2019. Likewise, the Green Party reiterated their support for proportional representation in all elections, and for an elected Upper House. The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru also supported fairer voting systems at all levels \u2013 locally, nationally, and at Westminster. Meanwhile, considerable interest surrounded the Labour Party\u2019s proposals, after media speculation that the proposed review of electoral systems, as promised in the 2001 manifesto, had been dropped. The 2005 manifesto, however, contained this statement: Labour remains committed to reviewing the experience of the new electoral systems \u2013 introduced for the devolved administrations, the European Parliament and the London Assembly. A referendum remains the right way to agree any change for Westminster. The manifesto also set out the party\u2019s policy on House of Lords reform, that \u2018Labour believes that a reformed Upper Chamber must be effective, legitimate and more representative without challenging the primacy of the House of Commons\u2019. Labour promised that, following a review conducted by a committee of both houses, they would seek to codify the powers of the Lords, and place \u2018reasonable limits\u2019 on the time Bills spend in the chamber. Moreover, the Party promised to remove the remaining hereditary peers \u2018and allow a free vote on the composition of the House\u2019. No mention was made of reducing the voting age.\n\nViews of candidates Having noted the platforms on which the parties would be standing, the Electoral Reform Society decided to ascertain the views of individual candidates. During April and May, the ERS sent a questionnaire to over 2000 candidates in all constituencies across the UK. The questionnaire asked: Would you support a review of the system of election for the House of Commons (as promised in the Labour manifesto in 2001)?\n\nIf there were to be a referendum on changing the electoral system for the House of Commons, would you personally support a change?\n\nWhat is your preferred system for electing the House of Commons?\n\na) First Past the Post \u2018FPTP\u2019 (as now)\n\nb) Alternative Vote plus \u2018AV+\u2019 (as recommended by Jenkins)\n\nc) Additional Member System \u2018AMS\u2019 (as used in Scotland and Wales)\n\nd) Single Transferable Vote \u2018STV\u2019 (as used in Northern Ireland)\n\ne) Alternative Vote \u2018AV\u2019\n\na) First Past the Post \u2018FPTP\u2019 (as now) b) Alternative Vote plus \u2018AV+\u2019 (as recommended by Jenkins) c) Additional Member System \u2018AMS\u2019 (as used in Scotland and Wales) d) Single Transferable Vote \u2018STV\u2019 (as used in Northern Ireland) e) Alternative Vote \u2018AV\u2019 Would you support a predominantly elected replacement for the House of Lords, if the alternative were to be a mainly or wholly appointed House?\n\nDo you support a reduction in the voting age to 16? Around 500 questionnaires were returned, a healthy return given the amount of paperwork that an average candidate is required to deal with during the General Election campaign. Encouragingly, over 100 replies were received from candidates who were eventually returned as MPs. Although by no means comprehensive, this survey does provide a snapshot into the views of current MPs on electoral reform. The questionnaire was completed by MPs roughly in proportion to the party strengths in the House of Commons, although one cannot claim that it is more broadly representative of opinion within each party or the Commons as a whole. It may well have been strongly influenced by self-selection, in that MPs who were most interested in (or having the strongest views for or against) electoral reform would have been most inclined to complete it. Party Percentage of total questionnaires returned Percentage of seats in the House of Commons Labour 50 55 Conservatives 28 30 Liberal Democrat 22 10 Other 1 5 From the questionnaires completed by successful candidates, it was found that: 55% were in favour of a review of the system of election for the House of Commons\n\n32% were certain to support a change in the voting system, with a further 21% willing to consider their position depending on the system proposed. 30% said they would oppose any change\n\nWhen asked to indicate their preferred voting system, 36% said they favoured First Past the Post.\n\n44% preferred another system. The most popular alternative was STV, which was favoured by 20% of respondents. 13% chose AV+, as proposed by the Jenkins Commission, as their first preference, and 7% AV.The AMS system, as used in Scotland and Wales, was the least popular of the options, with just 4%.\n\n62% were in favour of a predominantly elected House of Lords. Only 17% were definitely opposed.\n\nOpinion was split on lowering the voting age. 39% favoured a change, whilst 40% were opposed. The views of Conservative and Liberal Democrat respondents largely reflected their own party\u2019s policies as regards electoral reform. In line with their manifesto commitment, all Liberal Democrats were in favour of a review of the electoral system, and were personally in favour of a change.The vast majority were also in favour of a predominantly elected Lords, and supportive of lowering the voting age. Amongst the Conservatives, the vast majority were opposed to a review of electoral systems, and by extension favoured First Past the Post as the best system. However, a small number of Conservatives did back the call for a review of electoral systems, admitting that \u2018the process of selecting Members of Parliament needs review\u2019. Conservative opinion was more divided on Lords reform. Half the respondents backed the party line seeking a consensus around a predominantly elected House, yet as many as a quarter voiced their opposition to current Party policy. On lowering the voting age there was far more of a consensus, with the majority opposing any change. The debate therefore appears to be at its keenest amongst Labour MPs, where the dichotomy of views reflects the ambiguity of the Party\u2019s manifesto commitment.The following trends were identified: 60% of Labour respondents explicitly favoured a review of electoral systems, whilst just 16% were actively opposed to any such review.\n\n30% of respondents were certain to favour a change, with a further 26% willing to consider their position depending on the options put forward. Only 16% were certain to oppose any change.\n\nOn the other hand there is no clear picture which system Labour MPs favour. Of all the options put forward, First Past the Post has marginally the most backing (22% indicated it as their first preference). However, as many as 46% actively favour another system. The most popular alternative is AV+, which is favoured by 20% of MPs. Meanwhile, there is a strong movement for Lords reform amongst Labour\u2019s representatives. 56% favour an elected House, with only 18% opposed. Opinion on lowering the voting age is split down the middle, with 34% for and 34% against, with the remainder not expressing a settled view either way.\n\nThe electoral reform campaign before the election The candidate questionnaire campaign was just one element of a wider campaign by reformers to draw attention to the flaws in the electoral system. During the election campaign, the Make Votes Count coalition, including the Electoral Reform Society, set up the Make My Vote Count interactive website, www.makemyvotecount.org.uk, to campaign for a referendum on the voting system. Users had the option to sign an online petition, email constituency candidates to ask their views on electoral reform, download campaign materials, access on-line briefings, and follow the campaign in a daily blog.The site attracted thousands of users over the four weeks of the campaign, and proved a most useful resource for all those following the debate. The campaign itself highlighted the need for electoral reform. On 6 April, The Times published an article entitled \u2018The Hidden Election\u2019, which reported that Labour and the Conservatives were spending millions of pounds on a high- tech campaigning targeting just 800,000 voters in marginal seats who would settle the General Election result.This story created a swarm of publicity in the broadcast and print media, and the Make Votes Count coalition ran a publicity campaign in a number of \u2018safe seats\u2019 in Greater London, which served to emphasise that the vast majority of votes in these constituencies were taken for granted. Make Votes Count also facilitated a series of successful street stall campaigns, where in towns and cities across the UK, campaigners ran street ballots, asking passers-by whether they thought their vote would count. Much of the pre-election media focus was on the concerns over turnout and the security of the voting system, not least with regard to the increased prevalence of postal votes.The electoral reform campaign was at pains to point out that an electoral system where thousands of votes were taken for granted was just as great a cause for concern, and indeed was a major contributory factor to the problems of democratic engagement that have been encountered.\n\nThe electoral reform debate in Parliament and the media since 5 May The General Election itself was one of mixed emotions for the electoral reform movement. A number of active members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Electoral Reform lost their seats, and other active supporters, such as Paul Tyler (LD, North Cornwall) retired. However, the disappointment at losing some valued colleagues was tempered by the knowledge that, in all but one of the above cases, the victorious candidates were themselves electoral reformers. Indeed, with both the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party increasing their representatives, there was a net gain of 11 for the parties backing proportional representation as official policy. Amongst the questionnaire responses, nearly 20% were received from new MPs, of which nearly three in four were either explicitly in support of a review of electoral systems, or at least open to persuasion. A number of other new MPs have also expressed support for the All- Party Parliamentary Group on Electoral Reform, just weeks into the new Parliament. This high proportion of engagement amongst the new intake raises the hope that the pressure for electoral reform will be maintained through the new Parliament. A big impetus to this came from the General Election result itself. As our analysis has shown, the 2005 General Election has highlighted the iniquities of the First Past the Post system more than ever before. During the Queen\u2019s Speech debate, many MPs have pointed out the disparities in the system. A number of Conservative MPs echoed the statistic, uncovered first by the Electoral Reform Society on 6 May, that the Conservatives won more votes than Labour, and yet won 93 fewer seats. Likewise, parliamentarians in both Houses have pointed out with regularity that Labour won the lowest vote share of any majority government in history. Witness Charles Kennedy in the debate on 17 May: There is another wider reflection that is not just for Liberal Democrats. It has already been a matter of some discussion within both the Labour party and the Conservative party, and quite rightly in the latter case as the party that out-polled the Government in England at this general election. The Government secured only 36 per cent. of the votes cast and a little over a quarter [sic.] of those able to vote. Surely there is a lesson for us all here, because each and every party now must reflect on the fact that to greater or lesser extents we are competing minorities across the country. The related issue is, of course, the voting system itself. I mentioned the experience in England of the Conservatives, but despite out-polling Labour in England they have no representation in any of the major English cities outside London. Is that healthy for the geographical representation of the body politic? The result of this election yet again underlines that first-past-the-post voting in this day and age is a redundant system that belongs to a redundant age of British politics. British society is more fluid and party allegiances are much less fixed, and our society as a whole is more aspirational as a result. Therefore, the time has surely come to revisit\u2014as the Prime Minister promised but reneged on when first elected Prime Minister\u2014the whole issue of voting reform in this country. It is no longer a question, as in days gone by, of just those in the Liberal tradition feeling particularly hard done by; there are now losers in every party and in every part of the country. That is why the duty is surely on us all to look at this issue afresh. Conservative John Redwood echoed the point: Labour must feel worried that it is only by a quirk of the distribution of constituency boundaries in the electoral system that it is in such a strong position in the House of Commons, with an overall majority and possible support from some of the leftward-inclined parties on a number of crucial issues\u2026 It is extraordinary that a Government with a good majority could have achieved that on only 36 per cent. of the vote, and that that in turn was based on a low turnout of around only 60 per cent. Yet (see Chapter 9 below), the fundamental problem lies not with the distribution of constituency boundaries, but rather with the electoral system itself \u2013 a system not equipped to deal with the pluralist politics that is reflected in the way the UK voted in 2005. This much was recognised by The Independent when it launched its \u2018Campaign for Democracy\u2019 on 10 May, stating that \u2018thoroughgoing reform of the electoral system needs to be embarked upon now, before faith in the system is lost entirely. It is urgent that the discussion of a proportional representation system for British general elections be revived.\u2019 Over the past month, The Independent, as well as other newspapers and media sources, have continued the debate. The Independent launched a petition, inviting the Prime Minister \u2018to institute urgent reform of our voting system so that the British people are encouraged to believe that their votes count and that the result of a general election is more representative of their wishes.\u2019 So far over 30,000 have signed up. For more information on the campaign please see http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=637 826. In addition, columnists such as Polly Toynbee and Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian, and Peter Riddell of the Times made the case for reform, or at least a serious review of the electoral system.The letters pages of all quality newspapers in the UK engaged with the debate, as did numerous radio and television programmes, most notably BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. Meanwhile, a Make Votes Count meeting held in the House of Commons after the General Election, when a panel comprising Labour MP Martin Linton, Liberal Democrat peer and chief election strategist Chris Rennard, Polly Toynbee and singer/ political activist Billy Bragg debated the case for reform, attracted nearly 300 attendees. As Toynbee herself observed in The Guardian on 13 May: But in one vast Commons committee room, shortly after the prime minister had addressed his troops on Wednesday night, a great surge of hundreds packed in to protest at such tyrannical abuse of democracy. How did the prime minister gain such power with a mandate of just 22% of the electorate, the lowest since the Great Reform Act of 1832? They were hanging from window ledges, jam-packed against the walls, squatting in rows behind the platform: \u2018Never seen a public meeting like it in the house!\u2019 declared Lord Lipsey, chairing the make-votes- count meeting. Peter Tatchell called for a new Chartist-style uprising. An orotund Tory in pinstripes boomed out that he never expected to see the day when he would stand shoulder to shoulder with Tatchell and cry revolution. No taxation without representation! The democratic shortcomings that the General Election so clearly revealed have generated a wealth of publicity that has been impossible to ignore. The Prime Minister, when questioned about electoral reform at his monthly press conference on 12 May, stated: I know the Independent is getting very interested in this debate, but the trouble with any electoral system is that it can lead to different types of results in which people claim are unfair for different types of reasons. But the problem with PR systems is that you can often have a result where a small party actually holds the balance of power, and that is unfair as well. I have also got to give you my frank view, that if this was a straight Labour/Tory fight, if people said right the only way is Labour or Tory, I don\u2019t think there is any doubt what the outcome of the election would have been, and I think if it had been Labour versus Lib Dem it would have been the same, and it might even have been, if it had been Tory versus Lib Dem, they would have gone Tory. I don\u2019t think you can tell, in other words, that the existence of the third party with this amount of vote means that people were actually undecided about the government. Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer backed up the Prime Minister\u2019s judgment when he told the House of Lords on 23 May that the government \u2018have no plans to introduce legislation on changing the current electoral system\u2019. Yet electoral reform remains on the agenda. On 26 May, Labour peer and Chairman of Make Votes Count, Lord Lipsey, tabled a debate examining \u2018the workings of the British electoral system in the 2005 General Election\u2019. In the debate, Lipsey condemned the first past the post system that so allowed the Government\u2019s democratic legitimacy to be called into question, given that barely over a third of votes were actually cast for Labour. In responding to the debate, the Department for Constitutional Affairs Minister, Baroness Ashton, referred to the review of electoral systems, as promised in the Labour manifesto: We have an internal piece of work under way which will feed into a new ministerial committee on constitutional affairs, the composition and terms of reference of which we have ensured were made available on the website this morning\u2026 On how people will become involved in and consulted on this exercise. I do not yet have an answer because the new ministerial sub-committee has not yet met. I am not able to pre-empt its deliberations. We have indicated that a referendum would be the way forward and we remain absolutely 100 per cent committed to that. The issue has remained on the agenda. In a written answer on 7th June, Department for Constitutional Affairs Minister Harriet Harman asserted that: The Government remain committed to their manifesto commitment to reviewing the experience of the new electoral systems \u2013 introduced in the devolved administrations, the European Parliament and the London Assembly. The Government have no plans to change the voting system. In answer to an oral question tabled by Labour MP John Grogan the same day, Harman added: We have embarked on a considerable programme of voting system reform, as well as constitutional reform, and it is right that we look at the experience of the new proportional voting system and understand the effect of the electoral reform that we have already achieved. We are undertaking a review, and\u2026 there is a balance to be struck between proportionality and simplicity. We want a fair system where there is a strong connection between the elected representative and their constituents, but in the new voting systems that we have introduced in the devolved Assemblies, and for the Mayor and the European system, there is an element of proportionality and we are reviewing those experiences. On 14th June, Liberal Democrat MP John Barrett tabled a debate on electoral reform. In responding to the debate, Harman acknowledged that the subject \u2018is hugely important\u2019, and that \u2018there are many deeply held views, not only in the House but outside\u2026 we are not the only ones who feel passionately about the subject and who want to engage in the debate\u2019: Many people are concerned to be involved in the debate more widely, and you ask whether we are prepared to listen and to respect the views of those who participate in it. The answer must be yes, not least because, as he said, we must take a principled approach to a debate about improving democracy\u2026 If there is one thing that the voting public would run a mile from, it is the idea that, having got into power, we would rig the system in our favour and that party political interest would somehow override the principled interests. We must always be vigilant about that. She also agreed that the central point is to identify \u2018the best system that commands support, has legitimacy, is seen to be fair and simple, and yields what we want, which is a representative Parliament that can hold to account effective Government\u2019, and that \u2018it is only right, having introduced such a large range of new electoral systems, that we should take stock of the effect of those systems and how they have worked\u2019: That is why we are doing what we are said in our manifesto that we would do: reviewing the experience of the new electoral systems that were introduced for the devolved Administrations. We also said that if we were to recommend a change in the system of election to the House, there would have to be a referendum to agree the right way forward. At the very least, we need to review the effect of the current systems while we discuss issues such as public confidence in politicians, availability of information to citizens and accessibility to the vote.\n\nThe government\u2019s review of electoral systems Initial details of the review of electoral systems have indeed been announced, as part of the remit of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Electoral Policy (CA(EP)), and the Ministerial Committee on Constitutional Affairs. The terms of reference of the review are, as Baroness Ashton stated, \u2018to co-ordinate the Government\u2019s policy on electoral issues and the democratic process; and report\n\nas necessary to the Ministerial Committee on Constitutional Affairs\u2019. The Sub-Committee will be chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, and its other members are: Alistair Darling, Secretary of State for Scotland\n\nGeoff Hoon, Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons\n\nHilary Armstrong, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip\n\nCharles Clarke, Home Secretary\n\nPeter Hain, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Secretary of State for Wales\n\nIan McCartney, Minister without Portfolio\n\nLord Falconer, Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor\n\nJohn Hutton, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Minister for the Cabinet Office)\n\nDes Browne, Chief Secretary to the Treasury\n\nDouglas Alexander, Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Europe)\n\nPhil Woolas, Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister The terms of reference of the Ministerial Committee itself, to which the Sub-Committee will report, are \u2018to consider strategic issues relating to the Government\u2019s constitutional reform policies including House of Lords reform and issues arising from devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\u2019. The Ministerial Committee includes many of the above members as well as: Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\nJack Straw, Foreign Secretary\n\nDavid Blunkett, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions\n\nMargaret Beckett, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\nJohn Reid, Secretary of State for Defence\n\nBaroness Amos, Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council\n\nDavid Miliband, Minister for Communities and local Government\n\nLord Grocott, Chief Whip, Lords\n\nLord Goldsmith, Attorney General\n\nLynda Clark, Advocate General The Sub-Committee Chair, John Prescott, has admitted in the past that he has no interest in reform, and the Sub- Committee as a whole is conspicuously lacking in reformers. It therefore does not reflect the plurality of views that exists within the Labour Party. Although some members of the group have expressed interest in other systems such AV from time to time, supporters of change in the Cabinet such as Patricia Hewitt and Alan Johnson have been excluded. We await the first meeting of the Sub- Committee \u2013 meanwhile the debate will go on in Parliament and beyond. The announcement of the members of the Sub- Committee follows the announcement of the new Cabinet. There has been a reshuffle of Ministers in the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), the Government department responsible for electoral law. Lord Falconer remains in post as Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor. His team now includes Harriet Harman as Minister of State, with responsibilities including House of Lords reform and reform of electoral practice. Bridget Prentice has been appointed Under-Secretary of State, whilst Baroness Ashton remains as Under-Secretary in the House of Lords. In addition, the Government announced on 23 May that the DCA was to assume further responsibilities. Policy on the conduct of local elections was transferred from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with immediate effect, and the DCA will also take on the sponsorship of the Parliamentary Boundary Commissions for England and Wales. In other reshuffle news, former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon has been appointed as Leader of the House of Commons, with Nigel Griffiths as his deputy. Baroness Amos remains Leader of the House of Lords. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have also reshuffled their teams. Oliver Heald remains as Shadow Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, whilst Chris Grayling will face Geoff Hoon as Shadow Leader of the Commons. David Heath is the Liberal Democrat Constitutional Affairs Shadow.\n\nHouse of Lords reform The prospects for House of Lords reform in the immediate future seem brighter. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats maintain their manifesto commitment to a predominantly elected second chamber. Meanwhile, Labour had committed itself to setting up a Joint Committee to conduct a review on the powers and composition of the Lords. Statements by the Lord Chancellor and other Government representatives have made clear that there will be no developments on composition until the powers of the Upper House are codified. This commitment, set out in the manifesto, has since been repeated in a Parliamentary Written Statement on 23 May. The proposals suggested \u2013 namely \u2018developing alternative forms of scrutiny that complement rather than replicate those of the Commons\u2019, and to \u2018explore how the upper chamber might offer a better route for public engagement in scrutiny and policy-making\u2019 \u2013 have raised concerns amongst opposition politicians. In particular, the manifesto commitment to \u2018legislate to place reasonable time limits on the time bills spend in the second chamber \u2013 no longer than 60 sitting days for most bills\u2019 has been interpreted by some as an attempt to emasculate the Upper House\u2019s power. In reality, such a sanction would rarely have needed to be applied in recent times as the vast majority of Bills complete their passage through the House in under 60 days. Nonetheless, a number of peers have resented the attempts to place limits on their powers of scrutiny. A number of these points were raised in the Queen\u2019s Speech debates. In addition, a number of peers raised objections to the Government\u2019s proposals to remove the hereditary peers.There were concerns that any move to do so without clear agreement on who would replace them would constitute a breach of the \u2018Weatherill agreement\u2019, whereby the last 92 hereditary peers were retained in the House of Lords as a longstop until the final composition of the House was agreed. The debate has also served to demonstrate the wide range of opinions on the best way to achieve progress on composition. Whilst some peers continued to call for a directly elected House, others defended the system of appointments as delivering a level of expertise amongst the House\u2019s members that could not otherwise be achieved.\n\nStill others defended the hereditary concept. The ongoing debates show that consensus has yet to be achieved on what the future House should look like. On the other hand the prospects for a \u2018yes\u2019 vote in the Commons for an all-elected House look brighter. With both of the Opposition parties committed to such an outcome, and a large number of Labour MPs favouring this option, it would seem likely to be the most popular option. Certainly the results of the Electoral Reform Society\u2019s\n\nsurvey, indicating 62% backing for a predominantly elected House, would back this up.Yet as the responses of Conservative MPs in particular show, there is not necessarily a consensus even amongst parties with a manifesto commitment to elections. When the Commons last voted on Lords reform in 2003, the majority of MPs\n\nvoted for one of the \u2018majority elected\u2019 options, and yet they could not agree on any of the options. A consensus seems to be slowly building that a predominantly elected House is the only way to proceed \u2013 reformers will need to avoid the mistakes of the past to ensure that this happens.\n\nScotland \u2013 The Arbuthnott Commission Labour\u2019s manifesto made little mention of the Scottish constitutional situation: In our first term, we devolved power to Scotland and Wales and restored city-wide government to London. Britain is stronger as a result. In the next Parliament, we will decentralise power further. However the main point of interest over the coming months concerns the findings of the Arbuthnott Commission on Boundary Differences and Voting Systems, which was set up by Alistair Darling, Secretary of State for Scotland, in July 2004. The Commission was set up after the decision to adopt STV for local elections in Scotland from 2007, which meant that there will be four electoral systems in operation: First Past the Post for House of Commons elections, the Additional Member System for the Scottish Parliament, a closed list PR system for European elections, and STV at local level. The Commission is chaired by Professor Sir John Arbuthnott, former Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Strathclyde University, and currently Chairman of Greater Glasgow NHS Board.The Commission\u2019s remit is to examine the consequences of having four different systems of voting in Scotland, and different boundaries for Westminster and Scottish Parliament constituencies, for: voter participation;\n\nthe relationship between public bodies and authorities in Scotland and MPs and MSPs;\n\nrepresentation of constituents by different tiers of elected members. The Commission has been asked to make recommendations on whether these consequences require action to be taken in respect of: arrangements between elected representatives, to ensure that constituents and organisations receive the best possible service;\n\nthe pattern of electoral boundaries in Scotland;\n\nthe relationship with other public bodies and authorities in Scotland;\n\nthe method of voting in Scottish Parliament elections. The Commission launched a consultation document on 18 January, and has received evidence from all the major\n\nparties. Labour has reiterated its \u2018fundamental support for First Past the Post as an electoral system\u2019 while at the same time recognising \u2018the strong desire stated in the Commission\u2019s consultation to respect the devolution settlement and the need for any alternatives to the current system to retain significant proportionality\u2019. Labour has stressed the importance of the constituency link, but at the same time has pointed to some confusion amongst voters with regard to their two votes under the current AMS system for the Scottish Parliament. They have suggested that the second vote could be abolished. Labour is also concerned about the different roles and responsibilities of \u2018constituency\u2019 and \u2018list\u2019 MSPs. The Liberal Democrats continue to back STV as the best system, and have called for its adoption for Scottish Parliamentary elections. The Scottish National Party agreed, stating: The Party\u2019s backing for STV arises from the fact that it is a system that aims for a broad degree of proportionality, while also maintaining a link between constituents and elected representatives. STV allows, in larger multi-member wards, the opportunity for representation for a range of parties and individuals. Unlike the closed list system used currently, it allows voters to select their favoured candidate from within parties. Additionally, preference voting allows voters to order the favourability they feel towards candidates and parties, in a way that AMS, with its single \u2018X\u2019 does not. The Conservatives set out their fundamental support for First Past the Post, but, like Labour, recognised the importance of proportional representation in the post-devolution settlement. Given this, the party favours retaining the AMS system for Scottish Parliamentary elections. The consultation period closed on 10 June, and the Arbuthnott Commission hopes to report by the end of the year.\n\nWales The Labour manifesto was more specific with regard to Wales: In Wales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger Assembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure and electoral system, to make the exercise of Assembly responsibilities clearer and more accountable to the public. On 15 May, the Government released its \u2018Better Governance for Wales\u2019 White Paper. The White Paper has proposed legislation over three key issues: Enhanced legislative powers for the Assembly through a streamlining of procedures so that its legislative priorities are secured more quickly and easily.\n\nThe way forward for a formal separation between the assembly and the Welsh Assembly Government to avoid confusion and to improve effective scrutiny.\n\nA proposal to change the provisions in the Government of Wales Act so that losing candidates in Assembly constituency elections are unable to become Assembly members through the regional list under the Additional Member Voting System. The Government claims that \u2018the White Paper proposes gradual, staged moves which could lead to full legislative powers for the Assembly. Where last year\u2019s report of the Richard Commission envisaged greater powers for the Assembly from 2011, under the White Paper proposals Labour will legislate for streamlined powers by 2007.\u2019 Any change to full law-making powers for the Assembly would only follow a referendum. Plaid Cymru expressed disappointment that the proposals fell short of granting full law-making powers to the Assembly as the Richard Commission had proposed. The White Paper has also failed to adopt Lord Richard\u2019s recommendation that STV be adopted for Assembly elections, as \u2018The Government does not agree that this would be the right way forward\u2019. Instead, Labour have proposed legislation to deal with the so-called \u2018Clwyd West question\u2019, whereby losing candidates in constituency contests have gained election as a list member.The Government proposes that candidates be barred from standing both for a constituency and a list seat. In responding to the White Paper, the Electoral Reform Society expressed disappointment that the Government had proposed to change just a single aspect of the voting system, whilst ignoring Lord Richard\u2019s recommendation for a complete overhaul of the system by adopting STV. The White Paper is open for consultation until 16 September.\n\nBallot Integrity and Security\n\nIntegrity and Security The UK entered the 2005 general election with a big cloud hanging over the safety and security of the voting system, particularly the ability of all voters to cast their ballot postally. Just a couple of days before the election was called, a High Court judge, sitting as an Election Commissioner, concluded his judgement in the Birmingham fraud case by saying that the system of postal voting and the administration of it \u2018would disgrace a banana republic\u2019. Judge Richard Mawrey had heard evidence which, he said, showed that the system of postal voting was \u2018wide open to massive and systematic fraud\u2019. In the event, the election did not throw up as many cases of abuse as had been feared, but the general tumult over the potential has led to a significant shift in the Government\u2019s thinking in this area and proposals for legislation which will go a long way to cutting down on electoral fraud in UK elections. Electoral fraud is viewed by most as being a problem confined largely to times past. Bribery and personation were seen as issues of the 19th century rather than Britain in the 21st century. But the issues that have hit the headlines in recent times involved postal votes being changed using liquid paper, fictitious electors being added to the register and voters\u2019 signatures being forged. But such cases have almost always been written off as being one-offs which deserved punishment but showed no fundamental weakness in the system as a whole. Indeed, the Government dismissed claims that the system was open to abuse and that some people were taking advantage of such possibilities as scare-mongering. Until 2000, the ability to cast a vote by post was limited to those who had good reason for needing one.This changed in 2000 with the passing of the Representation of the People Act which introduced postal voting on demand, which meant that any elector could ask for a postal vote either for a specified election or permanently with no reason given and with no attestation as to need. At the same time, a programme of alternative voting trials was begun with small scale all-postal ballots in some council areas.This programme continued in 2002, 2003 and culminated in 2004 with all-postal ballots in four entire regions of England for the European Parliamentary and council elections of that year.This expansion of postal voting brought benefits in turnout that were significant but modest. The increased use of postal voting has, however, been accompanied by a number of warnings about the dangers of loss of secrecy and of fraud from organisations including the Electoral Reform Society. In particular, the Electoral Commission in 2003 called on the Government to strengthen the security around postal voting by changing from household to individual voter registration which would allow electoral registration offices to hold information on individual electors which could be used to reduce the risk of personation.This recommendation was made by the Commission again following the experiences of the elections in June 2004, and was also made by the Select Committee on the ODPM.The Government, however, was not convinced, arguing that a change in the system of registration might cause a decrease in the numbers registered. A further recommendation of the Commission was that applications for postal votes should be returned directly to electoral registration offices rather than through party offices (then a common practice by all major parties) or other third parties, but this was also rejected. Pressure for change, however, was dramatically increased by the hearing from February to March of electoral petitions in two wards in Birmingham following the 2004 local elections. In both wards, the Judge found that massive and varied fraud had occurred. A vote rigging \u2018factory\u2019 was discovered where ballot packs were ripped open and the votes altered if not for the Labour Party; false witness signatures were found; some ballots had been taken by those not entitled to them; and pressure had been brought to bear on electors by community leaders. With 2500 ballots found to have been cast improperly in each ward, the Judge had no hesitation in overturning the result and ordering a re-run in each case. Although condemned by all political leaders, the scope for making postal voting more secure before the general election was limited. An emergency meeting of the Government, Electoral Commission and electoral administrators held at the start of the election campaign agreed that letters should be sent to all who held postal votes reminding them of the fact and that extra warnings should be given on ballot packs reminding voters of the need for secrecy and security. Councils which had experienced the problems of fraud in the past, including Birmingham and Hackney, were among those who took the strongest measures to ensure that it did not happen again. And so the 2005 general election took place against a backdrop of concern about the safety and security of the voting system. Some observers called for a postponement of the election in order to allow emergency changes to the system to be introduced. One Birmingham councillor \u2013 who later went on to be elected as the MP for the Yardley constituency \u2013 even launched a High Court bid to have the poll delayed. Overall, the number of electors signed up to receive postal votes rose by a factor of five or six between the 2001 and 2005 general elections and more than 15% of all votes cast in the election were by post. In constituencies such as Stevenage, more than a third of all electors were registered to vote by post. In Wakefield, the rise was more than 1300%. In some areas, the rises led to concerns that campaigners, in their efforts to boost their favoured party\u2019s chances, would go beyond the permissible in seeking postal votes. Newspapers such as the Times, which had highlighted the potential failings for more than a year, as well as the Guardian and the Evening Standard, all ran significant stories over the course of the campaign. Journalists from both the BBC Six o\u2019clock news and the Evening Standard were reported to the Police for stories they ran in which they had applied for a postal vote in the name of someone else \u2013 albeit with their permission and for journalistic purposes only. A running total of the number of postal ballots which were due to be sent out was also carried in a number of publications. In the event, few challenges have been lodged with the courts and the number of allegations of fraud are quite small. However, one of the challenges is in a Birmingham seat and history has proved that many allegations only come to light some time after the deadline for challenges (just 21 days from the result) has passed. But perhaps concern over the potential for certain categories of fraud might be nearing the end of its lifespan. Despite the limited number of instances reported during the General Election, the widespread publicity and continued lobbying by the Electoral Commission, Electoral Reform Society and others has ensured that the Government has broadened its plans for legislation. The proposed Electoral Administration Bill will include proposals for the collection of personal identifiers to help check on fraud as well as a longer period for the checking of postal vote applications \u2013 measures that will make personation much more difficult, even if it will give little protection against intimidation and other forms of interference in elections. Some, including the Electoral Reform Society, have suggested that the Bill could be amended to go further, but it is a significant step in making postal voting more secure. However, the question we cannot answer, at least a"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/oct/10/houseofcommons.uk", "page_content": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday October 31 2005\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost half a century later, in 2003, a young woman of strong Labour convictions called Kitty Ussher decided to try for parliament. Since university, she had worked for a thinktank and a political lobbying group; she had been a local councillor and a ministerial adviser; but becoming an MP felt like a necessary step further: \"For half a lifetime I had had the idea hanging in the back of my mind.\" She found a potential constituency, Burnley in Lancashire, and started visiting it. From London, where she lived and worked, there were (and are) no direct trains and the journey, even by Virgin's optimistic timetables, was about four hours long. But every weekend, Ussher bought a \u00a360 return ticket and went to see the Burnley party members who would have the final say over the Labour candidate.\n\n\"I saw 10 members a weekend, every weekend, for a year,\" she says. \"I had spies everywhere.\" Despite all this, a union leader with great influence in Burnley endorsed her main rival. A few days later, at the 2003 Labour party conference, \"People kept coming up to me and saying, 'Oh, I'm so sorry Kitty. Are you trying another seat?'\" Ussher left the conference early and went straight back to Burnley. Five months later she was chosen as the candidate. At this year's general election, she won the seat. The Liberal Democrats were not a great distance behind.\n\nIn recent decades, the business of becoming and remaining an MP has changed. \"Being an MP is harder now,\" says Austin Mitchell, who has represented Grimsby for Labour since 1977 and is the author of one of the classic works about MPs, Westminster Man. \"Getting in is a more organised operation. The work is harder when you get here. There's more of it.\"\n\nBeing an MP, notoriously, is not an occupation revered by the modern public. Even choosing an MP has a decreasing appeal, to judge by the low turnouts of the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. Among political commentators and chroniclers, the declining significance of the House of Commons has been a favoured theme - arguably the favourite theme - since New Labour took office. Power and interest, the argument persuasively runs, reside elsewhere: with an increasingly presidential prime minister, with unelected confidants and spinners, with policy wonks, businessmen and Britain's other parliaments, with the European Union and the Washington neocons. And all the while, the lifespan of most MPs has remained as limited as ever. Of the 180 Labour members elected for the first time in 1997, notes the political scientist Byron Criddle in a forthcoming study of the 2005 election, almost a third have already disappeared from the House of Commons.\n\nYet one fact of recent British political life does not fit these gloomy patterns. A striking number of significant figures, their careers and influence apparently established without being elected to parliament, have become MPs after all. In 1992, Peter Mandelson, until then Labour's supposedly all-powerful director of communications, gave up his job for the Commons; so, at this year's general election alone, did the chancellor's well-connected lieutenants Ed Balls and Ed Miliband; the prime minister's longstanding political fixer Pat McFadden; Michael Howard's speechwriter Ed Vaizey; the Conservative vice-chairman Shailesh Vara; the rising Liberal Democrat MEP Nick Clegg; and the high-profile Tory thinktank director Nick Herbert. In fact, Alastair Campbell stands out as one of the few modern political celebrities not to have tried for parliament (and he may be young enough, and sufficiently understimulated these days, to change his mind).\n\nUnlike in most democracies, with their decentralised structures and nationally known mayors and governors, political life in Britain still revolves to a large extent around a single group. \"Becoming an MP is still the only route to the top,\" says Philip Cowley of Nottingham University, an authority on the psychology of the Commons. \"If you're some backroom boy for Brown, however brilliant, you are always the supporting cast. You have a brilliant idea, but he says it on Newsnight. You want some of that attention.\"\n\nThere are also nobler motivations. \"Your constituency is the frontline where you see how policies are actually implemented,\" says Pat McFadden. He reaches for an example: \"Did you know that 40% of pregnant mothers in Wolverhampton South East smoke?\"\n\nAt this year's general election, 3,555 people (four-fifths of them men) tried to become MPs, compared with 3,318 in 2001. Of the 646 winning candidates, 119 were new arrivals in the House of Commons: 51 Conservatives, 40 Labour, 20 Liberal Democrats and eight from the minor parties. Initially the new MPs were greeted with notable enthusiasm. \"I am absolutely convinced that this splendid new intake, brimming with talent, is going to set the scene for the next Conservative victory,\" said Michael Howard. \"They could be brilliant,\" said the leader of the Commons, Geoff Hoon. Comparisons were made to past intakes said to have transformed parliament and British politics, such as 1950, which included Edward Heath, Tony Benn and Tony Crosland, and with 1997 itself.\n\nFive months after the general election, however, feelings about the new MPs are more ambiguous. \"The compliments paid to the 2005 intake are a reflection of the quality of the 2001 intake,\" says an experienced political analyst, who asks not to be named. \"That was shocking. Some real idiots were chosen by the Tory associations. I remember meeting some and thinking, 'How did you get selected?'\" Even Vara admits, \"The best brains are not all here in the Commons. The occupation is very lowly regarded. It is not conducive to family life.\"\n\nA contrasting school of thought holds that modern MPs are not too amateurish but too professional. \"There are more and more people coming from the same set,\" says Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat party president, \"people who go from politics at A-level to politics at university, from political researcher to political adviser to becoming an MP.\" Inspecting the Liberal Democrat campaign in the constituencies during the general election, he found, \"We did not have enough good candidates ... people who will come in and challenge our assumptions.\" He has been proposing since that his party seek potential MPs by advertising in newspapers and on television, rather than simply drawing on the usual pool of activists and party members. Otherwise, he says, British politics will degenerate into \"a sort of gamesmanship ... all very nuanced and technocratic. And that is not a healthy world.\"\n\nIn the glass house\n\nMany of the Westminster class of 2005 have their offices in Portcullis House, across the road from the Houses of Parliament. Portcullis House was completed five years ago and, compared with the mazy Victorian spaces of its neighbour, inside it feels contemporary and rational. Instead of dim bars and tearooms, it has an open-plan atrium with a glass roof and cafe tables. The new MPs sit at them and chat and read documents and greet passers-by as unguardedly, it seems, as students in Starbucks (although the coffee at Portcullis House is much better). But this easy democratic openness is to some extent an illusion: elaborate glass walls and visitor protocols, most of them predating the current security clampdown, separate the MPs from the outside world. If you spend enough time in Portcullis House, which cost around \u00a31m to build for each of the 213 MPs it houses, you realise what it reminds you of - the offices of a firm of elite young management consultants.\n\nNick Clegg, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Sheffield Hallam, who has degrees from three universities and has worked for the Financial Times and the European Commission, already seems quite at home. It is teatime, but his blue shirt is still uncreased and he speaks with mid-morning crispness. \"Any new MP will be conscious of being branded a young man or woman in a hurry,\" he begins. \"But I can't understand the point of being in politics unless you want to advocate change.\" He leans back, folds his arms, and offers an example: \"If you speak to almost any new MP they will tell you tales of woe about the arcane, ritualised, high-church feel of the House of Commons. We live in a society that is less deferential towards history and custom. The new intake are less ... impressed.\"\n\nClegg, who is 38, was an MEP for five years before becoming the candidate for one of the Liberal Democrats' few safe Commons seats. He is seen as one of the party's modernisers - nudging it closer to the free-market policies of New Labour and the Conservatives - and a possible future leader. Already there is something self-consciously statesmanlike in the way he taps the table with the side of his hand for emphasis, and looks into the distance, his strong jaw raised a little, when he is expressing a big thought. \"British politics has been in a holding pattern for some time,\" he says, with a tone that suggests he may not tolerate this state of affairs for long.\n\nJohn Leech set out to become a Liberal Democrat MP with different expectations. \"I had made no plans for winning,\" he says, disarmingly, of his challenge to the Labour majority of 11,524 in Manchester Withington at the general election. In the biggest swing of the contest, he won by 667 votes.\n\nLeading the way, with hesitations, through the long corridors of the Palace of Westminster and under the road - MPs have a private tunnel - to Portcullis House, Leech still looks faintly dazed. \"When I was elected,\" he says, \"I didn't know any of the other new Liberal Democrat MPs, except for a couple with the closest seats to mine.\" Several of the eight new MPs I interviewed for this article still had not heard of him five months after the election. Clegg's name, by contrast, got immediate and respectful nods of recognition. All new MPs do not arrive equal.\n\nBut Leech's shock result does give him a currency in a volatile electoral era. \"Northern region rang me up and asked me to speak at their conference on how to win from almost nowhere.\" There are plans to circulate examples of his election literature. Leech is 34 and as matter of fact as you might expect of a former manager at McDonald's. He could be just the sort of ordinary citizen-turned-politician Simon Hughes is looking for.\n\nThe relationship between the makeup of British society and the makeup of the House of Commons has always been strikingly imperfect. In Twentieth Century British Political Facts, by David and Gareth Butler, the list of every MP \"of ethnic minority origin\" to have sat in parliament takes up a small paragraph. It is followed by a solid page and a half of the names of \"the most outstanding examples of parliamentary families\".\n\nBut for all the distortions introduced by tradition, prejudice and selection procedures primarily designed for party advantage rather than representativeness, changing social realities do affect who makes it into parliament. In 1945, according to the Butlers, 41% of Labour MPs were \"workers\" by occupation and almost two-thirds of Conservatives were \"professionals\". By 1997, the proportion of working-class Labour MPs had fallen to 13%, and businessmen had overtaken professionals in the parliamentary Conservative party. Of the new intake of MPs from this year's general election, almost a third are women (in the Labour intake it is almost two-thirds). Of the new Conservatives, for the first time there is more than one ethnic minority MP (there are two of them).\n\nUntil the early 80s, Commons observers usually thought about MPs in terms of interest groups and ideologies. And many MPs identified themselves the same way: \"When you were faced with an issue,\" says Mitchell, \"you often put yourself on automatic pilot. You had the guideposts of ideology, and you had groups like the [leftwing] Tribune Group to align with.\"\n\nThe contrary idea - that politicians were an interest group of their own, with more things in common than dividing them - had occurred to the Italian social scientist Gaetano Mosca decades earlier, in 1939, when he coined the phrase \"the political class\". In 1958, the German sociologist Max Weber drew a famous distinction between the age-old activity of living \"for politics\" - being driven by political ideas and ambition - and a new, 20th-century kind of politician who lived \"off politics\", treating it as a career. Yet the notion of the professional politician took a long time to be accepted in Britain. Until well into the 70s, MPs were not generously paid; until the 60s they did not even receive a secretarial allowance or a pension. Meanwhile, the composition and atmosphere of the House of Commons, with its open class tensions between benches of former trade union officials and Tory landowners, made the idea of a single political class seem a little far-fetched.\n\nBut by the mid 80s, the House of Commons had changed. The retreat of the unions, the movement of Labour towards the political centre, and the seemingly unshakeable alterations to Britain carried out by Margaret Thatcher had all created a degree of parliamentary consensus. And that consensus has substantially endured ever since. \"There are no really big issues now,\" says Vaizey. \"The future of the country is not at stake. What's left is managerial politics. I think the job politicians have to do now is more difficult, more technical.\"\n\nMPs have changed accordingly. Increasingly, their backgrounds are in what Pippa Norris and Joni Lovenduski, in their book Political Recruitment, call \"the talking professions\": teaching, the media, the civil service and politics itself. Such jobs give potential MPs communication and paperwork skills, and the \"flexibility over time, generous vacations, interrupted career paths, public networks [and] social status\" needed to compete for a candidacy and then a Commons seat. A middle-class salary is also useful if you are going to buy lots of expensive train tickets to a distant constituency.\n\nUnlike Hughes and other critics of the professionalisation of politics, Cowley argues that it has led to a better, more streetwise sort of new MP. \"They don't arrive at the Commons fully formed. But they're more formed than they used to be. They don't just sit there for 10 years. They're all immediately scheming and positioning.\"\n\nThink locally, not nationally\n\nSince the general election Jenny Willott, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Cardiff Central, has already become a member of the work and pensions select committee and the British delegation to the Council of Europe. She is 31. How did she get the latter job? \"Charles asked me,\" she says, a certain status and confidence contained in those three words. Before the general election, she had worked in the Commons as a lobbyist for Unicef and ran the Westminster office of another Liberal Democrat MP with a Welsh seat, Lembit Opik. \"It meant that when I was elected I knew a lot of people. I knew how the system worked, who to speak to.\" Yet the Commons was not a completely open book. \"It's very different coming back as an MP, more different than I thought it would be, compared with being here as staff. There are doors that say 'members only'. When I use them I keep ending up in bits of the palace I didn't know existed. And all the business in the chamber - you don't know that as staff.\" She pauses. \"That's the scary stuff.\"\n\nLike all the new MPs I interviewed, Willott is more at ease talking about her constituency. \"In surveys the public say the number one thing they want from an MP is someone who looks after the constituency,\" says Cowley, \"and that's what they get.\" The evidence that such conscientiousness keeps MPs in their seats is actually limited - \"during their first term, constituency work helps them dig in, but after that it doesn't have much electoral effect\" - yet it serves other useful purposes. With the decline in party memberships, MPs act as increasingly important local ambassadors for their parties. And in a time of low turnouts and hostility to politicians, the local good-news stories that any competent MP generates are reassuring to both voters and parliamentarians. When Lovenduski surveyed MPs about the low status of their profession, they gave one consistent response: \"We may be unpopular nationally, but we are popular in our constituencies.\"\n\nBecoming an MP involves a certain suspension of disbelief. Currently in the Commons, this impulse may be most evident among the new Conservative intake. The week after this year's general election, at which the Conservatives had won the sort of total number of seats associated in the past with crushing defeats, the party arranged a group photograph of its new MPs. Its six new women MPs were clustered at the front and in the centre, and the men rose in ranks behind them; but the photograph still looked too studied and underpopulated - like an attempt to create the impression of an electoral breakthrough, rather than an actual depiction of one. Not many newspapers printed the picture.\n\nVara, who is the new Conservative member for North West Cambridgeshire, remains optimistic. \"The Conservative intake is a lot more attuned to the real world than before,\" he says, sitting on the riverside terrace of the Houses of Parliament as a freakishly warm autumn sun catches the sides of the tourist boats passing behind him. Vara came to Britain as a four-year-old Ugandan Asian, got into grammar school, became a City solicitor and Conservative activist, and by the late 90s was making admired speeches to the party conference and being tipped as a possible first British Asian prime minister. \"I hadn't even stood for parliament yet!\" he says.\n\nVara is fastidious in his politeness but unafraid to advertise his talents. In the latter he thinks he is not alone. \"There is a hunger in the new intake in all the main parties ... We are all of the opinion that we are in with a chance of government.\"\n\nThere is an argument that the relative fortunes of the parties, after a static period, are now in flux, and that 2005 is therefore a good time to arrive in parliament. New Conservative MPs are particularly keen on this analysis. \"One of the reasons I stood this time,\" says Nick Herbert, now the new MP for Arundel and South Downs, \"is that I think it's going to be a much more interesting time to come in.\" Vaizey, an equally worldly Conservative figure and now the new MP for Wantage and Didcot, even talks about the advantages of \"coming in at the bottom\": after successive general-election defeats, political parties can be more receptive than usual to ambitious young people with fresh ideas. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown famously became MPs at the 1983 general election and rose rapidly in a Labour party shaken by that disaster. In part, such careers simply benefit from parliamentary arithmetic. It is easier to make a mark as a new MP in a party with a shrunken Commons presence. \"You are constantly reminded by Labour MPs how lucky you are,\" says Vaizey. \"They say they get to speak in the chamber twice a year, when you get to speak twice a month.\"\n\nPossibly unwisely, Vaizey and Herbert do little to hide the fact that their extensive political experience has left them impatient with Westminster's more cautious and traditional aspects. \"There's the odd bit of ribbing. People say, 'Why are you always on telly?'\" says Vaizey. \"I'm completely honest. I say, 'It's good experience. I enjoy it. I've worked hard to build my profile.'\" Herbert says, \"Having been running a thinktank whose idea was to provoke ... to change the terms of the debate, there was no way I wanted to do this job unless I could continue doing those things.\"\n\nHerbert very publicly replaced Howard Flight as the Conservative candidate for Arundel only weeks before the general election, after the latter had suggested in a speech that the party was concealing plans to dramatically cut public spending. Yet Herbert's own views on the appropriate size of the state are radical and expressed with a risky frequency and directness. \"We need to ask, 'What should government do?'\" he says. \"Then get the state out of areas where it's not competent to act.\"\n\nHerbert is gay, and describes being an MP as \"a bit like being on Big Brother: I'm with a group of people I don't necessarily want to be with, I've placed myself in view of the public, and I'm just trying to get through.\" Vaizey is a more conventional Tory, but not completely so. He has written columns for this newspaper. He wears scuffed Camper shoes with his checked farmer's shirt. And he openly admires aspects of New Labour: \"You learn just as much from Blair as from Thatcher. Blair's changed the tone of politics. There's much more common ground ... broad acceptance of the market economy, NHS reforms. Each party has a modernising cadre that doesn't want to be held back.\"\n\nSpeaking out\n\nIt is unlikely to be a coincidence that there is so much cross-party agreement at a time when MPs' backgrounds have become so similar. \"We're much more alike,\" says Mitchell. \"The Dennis Skinners aren't making it any more.\" With this homogenisation of the Commons has come, he thinks, a rise in overall quality: \"The new Labour intake are an impressive lot ... much more intelligent, much more plugged into central power and its ways.\" But there has also been a cost: \"There's a vast class - the poor, the underprivileged, the people least likely to vote - who are not represented any more.\"\n\nMitchell does not think any of this is reversible. \"Society is becoming more professionalised,\" he says. Being an MP, he and others suggest, is becoming just another modern white-collar occupation, with a long training, tricky specialist skills, and the range of suitable recruits narrowing accordingly. The lack of true drama or division in recent British politics, compared with the 70s and 80s, risks making parliament an even drier calling. In the bright, spotless atrium of Portcullis House, in his creaseless blue shirt, Clegg contrasts \"the almost ecumenical quality to debates\" in the Commons nowadays - \"the younger generation of MPs is much, much keener to accept that listening to your opponents is as important as slagging them off\" - with \"the swashbuckling battles of yesteryear\". He sounds like he prefers the former, but perhaps not all politicians should.\n\nYet the mildness and predictability of the new generation of MPs can be overstated. On paper, Ussher has a family background that seems a perfect confirmation of the existence of a single British \"political class\": she is a Labour MP whose uncle and aunt are Peter and Virginia Bottomley, the former Conservative ministers. Ussher admits they influenced her choice of career. \"Politicians weren't those strange things over there. I knew them. I knew it could be done.\" When she was seeking the Labour candidacy in Burnley, and was challenged about all this, Ussher's stock response - \"Virginia Bottomley was my aunt because she married my uncle before I was born\" - was defiant but did not, in retrospect at least, cover all the issues.\n\nUssher is 34. When I ask about her formative political influences she immediately mentions Margaret Thatcher. But the qualified praise for the Iron Lady that Labour modernisers usually express never came. Instead, Ussher raises her voice: \"Thatcherism was so ... unfair. She made society go in precisely the opposite direction to the right one. She changed Britain, but her changes were wrong.\"\n\nTo people who were politically conscious sixth-formers or students in the 80s, as most of the new intake of MPs were, Thatcherism may be less of an object of reverence than it is for the Blair generation, who were already in adult politics then and experienced all the Conservative victories at first hand. Even Herbert, who is older (42) and more rightwing than many of the new MPs, says: \"The 80s still dominate current political debate. I would like to see us break away from a lot of that. There isn't anything to be gained from trying to reheat Thatcherism.\"\n\nFor all the surface frenzy of parliament, the way MPs think can also change in slower, generational cycles. And sometimes the cycles are very slow indeed. \"My great-great-grandfather was an MP,\" says Katy Clark, the new Labour MP for North Ayrshire and Arran. \"He was a miner. He was blinded down the pit in one eye aged 15.\" In her maiden speech in the Commons, Clark described Sanny Sloan as \"very much a rebel, a pacifist and a socialist\". So far, she has done little to disappoint him. \"I was against the [Iraq] war,\" she says. She has already voted against the government on ID cards. She is quick to call herself a socialist: \"I am very keen to remain true to the values I think are important.\"\n\nCowley, who is publishing a book this month about Labour dissenters in the Commons since 1997, already has his eye on her. \"Katy Clark is very rebellious,\" he says with a note of admiration. But perhaps the most awkward sort of dissident is the one who does not see herself or himself as remotely unorthodox. \"I don't consider myself to be a rebel at all,\" says Clark. \"I joined the Labour party in 1984. My views are consistent with Labour's traditions.\"\n\nHowever the party leadership interpret that, she may be in parliament for a while. She is only 38, and at the general election got more than twice as many votes as her nearest challenger. Does she worry about being marginalised? \"There are many ways to have influence.\"\n\nIn the end, MPs' trajectories are no more predictable than the fates of governments. Plenty of favoured names are swallowed by the Commons and rarely seen again. And plenty of unfancied, even accidental MPs thrive in its strange atmospheres. After being spotted on his tractor in 1955, Prior was elected to parliament in 1959, stayed there for 28 years, was a minister in the two very different governments led by Heath and Thatcher, and became a Lord when he retired. If any of the class of 2005 last that long - and the average political lifespan of an MP since 1945 is 15 years - they will live to see Thatcher and Blair become ancient history.\n\nThe eight to watch\n\nKitty Ussher, 34\n\nLabour, Burnley\n\nEducated at Oxford, she went straight into parliament as a researcher for Paul Boateng, Martin O'Neill, Kim Howells and Adam Ingram.

He was boy when queen began her reign.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nWe're going to bring in another perspective now, that of Sir Peter Bottomley. He's a senior member of Parliament and holds the title Father of the House. He has held the longest uninterrupted service in the House of Commons, serving since 1975. Sir Peter was just a little boy when Queen Elizabeth began her reign, and he still remembers her coronation.\n\nPETER BOTTOMLEY: I was 8. My mother brought my sister and myself out the way that the procession was going to come from Buckingham Palace to go down to Westminster Abbey. We got ourselves periscopes - little sort of cardboard tubes with a mirror at one end and a mirror at the other so you could look over the heads of grown-up people. And when they passed, I walked 2 1/2 miles back across London by myself to the local vicar, the minister of religion, who had just bought or had a black-and-white television set. And I was able to watch the rest of the coronation on that.\n\nMARTIN: Seventy years. I mean, she was the only monarch that most Britons ever knew. It leaves an indelible mark on the British psyche, her passing, as evidenced by the miles of people who are waiting all weekend to pay their respects.\n\nBOTTOMLEY: It's true that enormous numbers of people have come for paying their respects to her lying in state in the Great Hall of Westminster, from which she's moved to Westminster Abbey before going on to Windsor. Some of it is curiosity. Most of it is love. And so many people - it's a memory.\n\nMARTIN: If I may ask a personal question, what does the loss feel like to you?\n\nBOTTOMLEY: It's a transition rather than a loss. I think I felt the way I did when my father died. It was a life well lived. It may be a matter for tears, but not sadness. And also, there's a dedication to try to go on with King Charles, making it possible for our country to go on improving. And I explain to people that we have a monarchy because it's a democratic choice. If we didn't want a monarchy, we would have had a revolution. If we didn't want a monarchy, the Parliament would vote to abolish its rule. We haven't. So she was there by choice. King Charles is there by choice. And we can presume that William and George will follow on.\n\nMARTIN: For a lot of people from former colonies, the queen didn't just represent values that were considered aspirational. She represented an exploitative, brutal, imperial rule. What do you say to them?\n\nBOTTOMLEY: I can see that people can say the British Empire was not perfect. That's true. I can also see the consequences that other people experienced. So, for example, 50 years ago, Idi Amin threw tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians out of Uganda, one of the most racist attacks on innocent people the world has known in peacetime. I'm not sure they'd necessarily think that the British rule was worse than what Idi Amin and Milton Obote gave them. But on the day of the queen's funeral, we can recognize that most decisions about decolonization are ones for Parliament and politics, not for the head of state.\n\nMARTIN: The nation of Antigua and Barbuda recently called on a referendum to decide on removing the British monarch as head of state. Do you believe the Commonwealth of Nations will endure in this new era without Queen Elizabeth?\n\nBOTTOMLEY: The Commonwealth will certainly endure. The answer in endurance is clearly yes. If you take places like Australia, which I'd expected to become a republic years and years ago - didn't when they had a referendum because what they chose to replace it was less popular than going on with the Commonwealth queen, now king. So I think there isn't really a problem. One can have a good argument for all of these things in good time.\n\nMARTIN: You were the second MP, after the Speaker of the House, who swore an oath of loyalty to King Charles. You've watched him prepare for this role his entire adult life. Who do you believe he will be as monarch?\n\nBOTTOMLEY: By chance, he and I were at the same college, at the same university, two or three years apart. I think he'll help guide future prime ministers into making decisions which are more likely to be successful and less likely to be failures without becoming controversial.\n\nMARTIN: But the public knows far more about him than they did his mother, right? I mean, of course there were all the scandals related to his marriage to Princess Diana. But the public knows also what issues he cares about because he was allowed to advocate in a way his mother never did. Does knowing more about him make him more vulnerable to criticism?\n\nBOTTOMLEY: I don't think knowing something about somebody makes them vulnerable. The fact is things happen. And I think that you need to be able to march forward, as well as being aware that you could have done things better in the past. That certainly applies to me as a member of Parliament. Can I be more of the good person I could be in the future? I think he will be, and I think he'll help us to do the same ourselves to make the country better.\n\nMARTIN: When you think of her legacy, how did she make a difference? What did she accomplish? What did she, Elizabeth, bring to the monarchy?\n\nBOTTOMLEY: The simplest answer is the dedication to service. It's not like being head of a university for five or 10 years. It's not like being chief executive of a company for two years or 18 years. It's a lifelong dedication, and she showed it could be done. You have to have endurance. You have to have fortitude, and you have to know that there's a higher cause you're working for rather than just personal popularity.\n\nMARTIN: But it sounds like you're saying what she achieved was survival.\n\nBOTTOMLEY: Well, that's certainly true that she achieved survival as - the same way that King Charles, as heir, did the same thing. But if you start saying, is it because of her that we're far more tolerant on race or sexual orientation? No, but she's gone along with that. And I don't think anyone can say she disrespects the difficulties other people go through. In fact, there are plenty of examples where her personal kindnesses to people have made a difference in people's lives. So I think I'd look to the small things as well as the big things and just say that we were to ask God to bless the queen, but now God save the king.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TAKENOBU'S \"REVERSING\")\n\nMARTIN: Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest serving member of the House of Commons.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TAKENOBU'S \"REVERSING\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Although it is technically the lower house, the House of Commons is predominant over the House of Lords , and the name \u201cParliament\u201d is often used to refer to the House of Commons alone.\n\nappeals to political theorists, enables every individual or group to move round the centre, adopting various shades of pink according as the weather changes.\u2026A chamber formed on the lines of the House of Commons should not be big enough to contain all its members at once without overcrowding, and there should be no question of every member having a separate seat reserved for him. If the House is big enough for all its members, nine-tenths of its debates will be conducted in the depressing atmosphere of an almost empty or half-empty Chamber.\u2026[T]here should be on great occasions a sense of crowd and urgency.\n\nDespite its large membership, the chamber of the House of Commons seats only 427 persons. After it was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II , there was considerable discussion about enlarging the chamber and replacing its traditional rectangular structure with a semicircular design. Among those who argued against this proposal was Winston Churchill , who maintained that a semicircular chamber\n\nThe membership of the House of Commons stood at 658 from 1801\u2014when Great Britain and Ireland were united by the Act of Union to form the United Kingdom\u2014until 1885, when it was increased to 670. In 1918 it was increased to 707. It was also changed under subsequent acts. At the general election in May 2010, 650 members were returned\u2014533 from England, 59 from Scotland, 40 from Wales, and 18 from Northern Ireland . Each constituency returns a single member.\n\nThe House of Lords was initially the more powerful of the two houses, but over the centuries its powers gradually diminished . By the late 17th century, the House of Commons had gained the sole right to initiate taxation measures. The House of Lords retained its veto power over bills passed by the Commons, however, and in 1832 the only recourse of the Liberal Party government was to threaten to flood the House of Lords with new Liberal peers in order to prevent it from rejecting that government\u2019s Reform Bill . Eighty years later the same threat was used, again by a Liberal government, to compel the Lords to approve the Parliament Act of 1911 , which enabled a majority of the House of Commons to override the Lords\u2019 rejection of a bill. Under this act, the House of Lords lost the power to delay legislation passed by the Commons for the raising and spending of revenue; it also lost the power to delay other legislation for a period beyond two years (reduced in 1949 to one year). The act also reduced the maximum duration of a parliamentary session to five years.\n\nThe origins of the House of Commons date from the second half of the 13th century, when landholders and other property owners in the counties and towns began sending representatives to Parliament to present grievances and petitions to the king and to accept commitments to the payment of taxes. In the 14th century the knights and burgesses chosen as representatives (i.e., the commons) began sitting in a separate chamber, or \u201chouse,\u201d from that used by the nobles and high clergy (i.e., the lords).\n\nFunctions and operation\n\nLearn about the history and traditions of the House of Commons Chamber, also the functions of its members See all videos for this article\n\nThe House of Commons is the effective legislative authority in Great Britain. It alone has the right to impose taxes and to vote money to, or withhold it from, the various public departments and services. The House of Lords has only infrequently held up major legislation passed by the Commons, and the British sovereign almost automatically provides the Royal Assent to any bill passed. Indeed, the last bill to be rejected by a monarch was the Scottish Militia Bill of 1707, which was vetoed by Queen Anne. Acts of Parliament are not subject to judicial review.\n\nThe passage of legislation is the House of Commons\u2019 primary function. Almost all legislation proceeds from the majority party in the Commons, which forms the government and the cabinet; the latter is composed of senior ministers chosen by, and belonging to the party of, the prime minister, nearly all of whom serve in the House of Commons. The government\u2019s main work in the Commons is to implement the legislative program on which it fought and won the last general election.\n\nAt the beginning of each new session of Parliament, the House elects from its members the speaker, who presides over and regulates debates and rules on points of order and members\u2019 conduct. The speaker does not participate in debates and votes only in order to break a tie, a case that compels the speaker to vote in favour of the status quo. The calling of members to speak in debate is entirely in the speaker\u2019s hands, the main concern being to ensure that a variety of points of view is heard. By a convention of the constitution not established until the 20th century, the prime minister is always a member of the House of Commons, instead of a member of either house. The government party appoints the leader of the House of Commons, who manages the party\u2019s legislative program. Except for occasional independents, members of both the government and opposition parties are under the control of party management within the Commons, whose discipline\u2014particularly over voting\u2014is exercised by members called \u201cwhips.\u201d\n\nThe tradition that a bill must be read three times in the Commons (and also in the Lords) before it can be voted on is based on the need to allow members adequate time to investigate the principles on which the bill is based and the details of its provisions. The first reading is purely formal, but the second reading provides the occasion for debate on the principles involved. The bill then goes into committee, where it is examined clause by clause. Most bills are sent to standing committees, each of which deals with bills belonging to a particular range of topics, with the committees reflecting in their makeup the respective strength of parties in the House. Having examined the bill, the committee then reports back to the House, and after further amendments may have been proposed in the course of more debate, the bill is read a third time and is then voted on. In addition to bills proposed by the government, a limited number of bills sponsored by individual members are considered by the House each session.\n\nBeginning in 1999, power over a number of matters\u2014including health, education, housing, transportation, the environment, and agriculture\u2014was devolved from the British Parliament to the newly established Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales, and (somewhat later) Northern Ireland Assembly. That reallocation of legislative responsibilities raised the issue of whether MPs from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should continue to vote on measures directed at England only. This so-called West Lothian question (so named because it was first posed in 1977 by the anti-devolutionist MP from West Lothian, Tam Dalyell) was addressed in 2015 by controversial legislation that established a new set of procedures known as English Votes for English Laws (EVEL). New stages were introduced into the standard lawmaking procedure during which legislation that was determined to affect England only was to be considered and voted upon by MPs from English constituencies (who were effectively granted veto power) before moving on to consideration by the House of Commons as a whole. (Similarly, legislation aimed at England and Wales only was to be addressed first by English and Welsh MPs only.) When it was not clear whether a measure was an England-only matter, the speaker of the House of Commons was tasked with making that determination.\n\nAside from passing legislation, the most important business of the full House is the question period, which is held on a regular basis. During this period, members can require government ministers to answer questions regarding their departments; it thus provides the opposition with an opportunity to attack government policy and to raise issues on which the government may be thought to have been negligent. It also generates regular policy debates between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. These exchanges have been made more important by their public broadcast, first by radio in 1978, and then by television in 1989.\n\nMembers of the House of Commons must be 18 years of age or older. Peers of England, Scotland, or the United Kingdom may not be elected to the House of Commons, though Irish peers may be. Certain clergy, judicial officers, members of the armed forces, police officers, and civil servants are also ineligible for election. Women became eligible under an act of 1918. Members were paid beginning in 1911."}]}
