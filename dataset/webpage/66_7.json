Ananda Bose, who assumes the challenging position of governor of the politically sensitive state of West Bengal, is no ordinary politician but carries the reputation of being an innovator in his distinguished civil services career. The 71-year-old former bureaucrat is a retired Union secretary who has made a mark wherever he worked. Bose joined the IAS in 1977 in the Kerala cadre and has held the offices of university vice-chancellor, additional chief secretary and district collector in Kerala.\n\nA prolific writer and columnist, Bose has published 40 books in English, Malayalam and Hindi, including novels, short stories, poems and essays. He is a recipient of 29 international and national awards for his outstanding contribution in various fields. He served as chairman of the working group that prepared the national development agenda for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBorn on January 2, 1951, in Mannanam village in Kottayam district of Kerala, Ananda Bose\u2019s father P.K. Vasudevan Nair was a freedom fighter and follower of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It was Nair who added \u2018Bose\u2019 to his son\u2019s name.\n\nIn his early career, Ananda Bose was an English lecturer. He subsequently joined the State Bank group of banks as a probationary officer in Bengal and worked in the remote areas. He joined the IAS at the age of 26.\n\nDuring his tenure as the sub-collector of Kasargod, Bose, in 1978, initiated Gramotsav, a festival celebrating the culture and art forms of villages. The idea got replicated across Kerala and even today, the event forms an important part of the state\u2019s tourism calendar.\n\nAs the district collector of Kollam, Bose, in 1985, founded the Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra to provide cost-effective and environment-friendly housing solutions to the people. The initiative later became a part of the national housing policy. \u201cHis greatest contribution has been to introduce low-cost housing technology to Kerala. He did it brilliantly with the support of Sarala Gopalan, then revenue secretary of Kerala,\u201d says S.M. Vijayanand, former chief secretary of Kerala and former Kollam district collector.\n\nDuring his first meeting with Narendra Modi in 2014, while the latter was Gujarat chief minister, Bose introduced the idea and submitted a proposal. His ideas had also impressed former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who called him an \u2018inspired\u2019 civil servant.\n\nBose joined the BJP in 2019 but staying away from the local politics of Kerala, he networked with national leaders. After the 2021 Kerala assembly poll, PM Modi had sought his suggestions to revive the BJP in the state. His report did not go down well with the current BJP leadership in Kerala. But Bose has survived their annoyance and now got governorship of a critical state like Bengal, where former governor and current vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar had several confrontations with the Trinamool Congress government. \u201cAnanda Bose\u2019s appointment as Bengal governor will make Kerala BJP leaders more uncomfortable,\u201d says a senior BJP leader from Kerala.\n\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine"}, {"url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/cv-ananda-bose-west-bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankar-mamata-banerjee/2838733/", "page_content": "Former bureaucrat CV Ananda Bose has been appointed as the new governor of West Bengal.
