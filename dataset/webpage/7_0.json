{"Wilhelm Windelband was a philosopher.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/windelband-wilhelm-1848-1915", "page_content": "WINDELBAND, WILHELM\n\n(1848 \u2013 1915)\n\nThe German philosopher and historian of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband was born in Potsdam and educated at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value. Windelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general.

His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system.\n\nWindelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze.

Dilthey is best known for the way he distinguished between the natural and human sciences. He defined the human sciences broadly to include both the humanities and the social sciences. Whereas the main task of the natural sciences as Dilthey found them was to arrive at law-based causal explanations, he projected the core task of the human sciences to be that of providing an understanding of the organizational structures and dynamic forces of human and historical life. It will be shown that this distinction is not so sharp as to rule out causal explanations in particular human sciences such as psychology, political theory, and economics; it mostly delimits the scope of explanations in these fields. Dilthey\u2019s aim was to expand Kant\u2019s primarily nature-oriented Critique of Pure Reason into a Critique of Historical Reason that can also do justice to the social and cultural dimensions of human experience. Understanding the meaning of human historical events requires being able to organize them in their proper contexts and to articulate the structural uniformities that can be found in this way. Dilthey\u2019s reflections on the human sciences, historical contextualization, and hermeneutics influenced many subsequent thinkers such as Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer, Gadamer and Ricoeur. Recently, there has been some attention given to the ways in which Dilthey\u2019s empirical approach to experience influenced Carnap in his early attempts to overcome metaphysics in favor of more analytical methods.\n\n1. Dilthey\u2019s Life and Thought\n\n1.1 Brief Overview of Dilthey\u2019s Philosophical Development\n\nWilhelm Dilthey was born in Biebrich on the Rhine in 1833, two years after Hegel had died. Dilthey\u2019s ambivalent attitude towards Hegel can provide some initial clues about his own philosophical approach. He admired Hegel\u2019s recognition of the historical dimension of philosophical thought, but rejected the speculative and metaphysical ways he developed this relation. Like the Neo-Kantians, Dilthey proposed a return to the more focused viewpoint of Kant, but not without also taking account of the higher emancipatory aspirations and broader perspectives of later thinkers such as Fichte, Herder, and Hegel.\n\nDilthey characterized his own expansive view of philosophy as one of establishing integral relations to all the theoretical disciplines and historical practices that attempt to make sense of the world. Instead of demarcating the boundaries that set philosophy apart from other ways of engaging life, Dilthey conceives its critical task as articulating the overall structures that define the human spirit in general. Relatively early in his career, philosophy is defined as \u201can experiential science of spiritual phenomena\u201d that seeks to \u201ccognize the laws governing social, intellectual and moral phenomena\u201d (1867/GS.V, 27). Philosophy should aim to preserve the scope that idealists such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel had given it, but it must do so by recapturing the Kantian rigor that had been lost and by proceeding empirically.\n\nThese goals, as formulated in the inaugural lecture that Dilthey gave in 1867 on assuming his first professorship in Basel, were already prefigured in his early journals. Thus in 1859 Dilthey wrote that a new Critique of Reason must proceed on the basis of the psychological laws and impulses from which art, religion and science all derive. All intellectual systems are mere crystallizations of more generic schemata rooted in life (JD, 80).\n\nThe early Dilthey conceived his goal as a broadening of the critical project that would ground the human sciences as Kant had grounded the natural sciences. His hope then was that the human sciences would be able to arrive at lawful explanations just like the natural sciences. Up until at least 1887, when he published his Poetics, Dilthey was confident that inner explanations of human creativity could be arrived at. He himself formulated three laws of the imaginative metamorphosis to account for the uplifting effect that poets can have on us. Dilthey summarizes them as the laws of exclusion, intensification, and completion. Even in ordinary experience images are transformed by excluding what is no longer of interest and intensifying what remains based on our present interests. But what distinguishes poetic imagery is that it is also completed by the overall life-concerns of a powerful psyche.\n\nThrough his efforts to work out a kind of gestaltist psychology that could frame this third law of imaginative completion, Dilthey came to modify some of his basic assumptions. He came to realize that the overall psychic nexus of an individual was not a sufficient contextual frame to explain human experience. Our experience can only be understood by describing it as it as a continuum that is gradually acquired over time. What he calls the \u201cacquired psychic nexus\u201d is itself historically embedded in a social world. This means that our access to history is much more direct than our access to nature. We feel ourselves as part of history whereas nature has come to increasingly stand apart from us. Although Dilthey is still willing to accept that objects of outer experience are phenomenal, he no longer accepts the Kantian thesis that the contents of inner experience are phenomenal as well. Inner experience is reconceived as lived experience (Erlebnis) that is real and the time that relates us to history is not merely the ideal form that Kant had exposited for nature.\n\nThis second phase of Dilthey\u2019s thought is characterized by a stress on the reality of lived experience and on the immediate understanding of human life that this makes possible. It is in the \u201cIdeas for a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology\u201d of 1894 that Dilthey works out his explanation-understanding distinction. \u201cWe explain through purely intellectual processes, but we understand through the cooperation of all the powers of the mind activated by apprehension\u201d (1894/SW.II, 147). The human sciences will henceforth be conceived as primarily concerned with understanding the meaning of human action and interaction. Also central to this second phase of Dilthey\u2019s thought is the essay \u201cThe Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its Justification\u201d of 1890. Our initial access to the external world is not inferential, but is felt as resistance to the will. The world of lived experience is not merely a theoretical representation, but is directly present to us as embodying values that are relevant to our purposes. The stress on feeling and immediacy in this second phase amounts to a rejection of Hegel\u2019s dialectical approach.\n\nIf the first phase was characterized by a search for inner explanations and the second phase by direct understanding, the third phase can be characterized by the need for interpretation. This final phase can be said to span the last decade of Dilthey\u2019s life until his death in 1911. It begins with the realization in the essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d of 1900 that the inner intelligibility of lived experience does not yet constitute full understanding. Self-understanding must also be mediated from without. The way we express ourselves, whether in communication or in action, is a crucial intermediary in defining ourselves. Understanding can only be reliable if it proceeds through the interpretation of human objectifications. Thus we properly understand ourselves not through introspection but through historical contextualization. It is in this last phase of his thought that Dilthey, who now occupied the chair that Hegel had once held in Berlin, revives his predecessor\u2019s theory of objective spirit as the medium relating us to the past. In 1906 Dilthey published a seminal work on the young Hegel \u2013 Die Jugendgeschichte Hegels \u2013 that made use of recently discovered theological and political fragments. These unknown early fragments disclosed Hegel\u2019s historical geniality before it became constrained by the dialectical systematization that Dilthey had always objected to. Dilthey\u2019s student Herman Nohl was helpful in deciphering some of these fragments and went on to publish them. Nohl also edited a volume of Dilthey\u2019s writings on the history of German Idealism going back to Kant, Beck and Fichte and leading up to such contemporaries of Hegel as Schelling, Schleiermacher, Schopenhauer and Fries.\n\n1.2 The Religious Background of Dilthey\u2019s Philosophy\n\nDilthey followed family tradition by starting his university studies at Heidelberg in theology. There he was also introduced to the philosophical systems of the idealists by Kuno Fischer. Because Fischer was accused of being a pantheist, his right to teach was withdrawn in 1853. Dilthey then moved to the University of Berlin, where he came under the influence of two of Friedrich Schleiermacher\u2019s students, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg and August Boeckh. Increasingly, Schleiermacher became the focus of Dilthey\u2019s interests. In 1859 he was asked to complete the editing of Schleiermacher\u2019s letters. That year the Schleiermacher Society also organized an essay competition. Dilthey\u2019s submission entitled \u201cSchleiermacher\u2019s Hermeneutical System in Relation to Earlier Protestant Hermeneutics\u201d (1860, SW.IV, 33\u2013227), was awarded the first prize and led to a second commission, namely, to write Schleiermacher\u2019s biography. The first volume of this biography was published in 1870. It places Schleiermacher not only in his theological setting but also in the context of the literary and philosophical movements astir in Berlin from 1796 to 1807. The work displays Dilthey\u2019s own expanding interests in aesthetical and philosophical issues. He also wrote his dissertation on Schleiermacher\u2019s ethics.\n\nAs a theology student, Dilthey had begun a study of many early formulations of the Christian worldview, which though never completed, continued to influence his subsequent writings. In 1860 Dilthey writes that\n\nit is my calling to apprehend the innermost nature of religious life in history and to bring this to the attention of our times which are moved exclusively by matters of state and science. (JD, 140)\n\nThis means looking for religiosity not so much in its institutional practices and its theological doctrines as in the recesses of human experience. In a similar vein, he asserts that it is necessary to recover the \u201creligious-philosophical worldview that is buried under the ruins of our theology and philosophy\u201d (JD, 140).\n\nDilthey conceives religious experience as an extension of Schleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute dependence. It is a total experience that interweaves a feeling of dependence with an awareness of a capacity to uplift ourselves. Religious experience is regarded as an enduring background and accompaniment of human intellectual life. Religion has manifested itself in many forms such as mythical representations, mystical ideas of revelation and human redemption, theological doctrines, and metaphysical theories. Because of its emphasis on meteorological events (1883/ SW I, 450), Dilthey saw myth as a primitive scientific theory that compromised the genuine religiosity of mystical feelings.\n\nLater as he reflected on the nature of worldviews, Dilthey would occasionally return to the problem of religion. What distinguishes the religious worldview from artistic and philosophical worldviews is that it relates the visible to what is invisible, life to our awareness of death. In a striking late passage, Dilthey writes that when life is experienced religiously and\n\naccording to its true nature\u2014full of hardships and a singular blend of suffering and happiness throughout\u2014<we are> pointed to something strange and unfamiliar, as if it were coming from invisible sources, something <pressing in> on life from outside, yet coming from its own depths. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 285)\n\nThe same non-transcendent perspective on religion is to be found in Dilthey\u2019s last essay, written during the final days of his life in 1911 while he was on vacation in the Dolomites. This essay on \u201cThe Problem of Religion\u201d points to the fact that the Enlightenment has made it increasingly difficult to acknowledge the mystical aspects of religious experience. Enlightenment thinkers regarded mystical experience as irrational. But according to Dilthey, Schleiermacher was able to avoid this charge of irrationalism by relating core aspects of religious experience to the insights of transcendental philosophy. Instead of interpreting the mystical feeling of communion as an esoteric union with a transcendent God, Schleiermacher explicates it as a general awareness that is attuned to the invisible coherence of things down here (1911/SW.VI,304\u201305). He gives a transcendental reading of what is intuited and felt in the religious mood by transforming it into a creative life-principle. Whereas traditionally mysticism tended to devalue our life in this world, Schleiermacher\u2019s mysticism is seen as affirming it.\n\n2. Dilthey\u2019s Main Philosophical Works\n\n2.1 The 1880s: Broadening the Critical Framework\n\nDilthey\u2019s first major theoretical work is the Introduction to the Human Sciences of 1883. The human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften) encompass both the humanities and the social sciences. They range from disciplines like philology, literary and cultural studies, religion and psychology, to political science and economics. Dilthey insists that the human sciences be related not by some logical construct on the order of August Comte or J.S. Mill, but by means of reflective considerations that take their historical genesis into account. Dilthey writes that\n\nthe human sciences as they exist and as they are practiced according to the reason of things that were active in their history \u2026 contain three classes of assertions. (1883/SW.I, 78)\n\nThese are 1) descriptive and historical statements, 2) theoretical generalizations about partial contents and 3) evaluative judgments and practical rules. The human sciences are more obviously normative in nature than the natural sciences for which formal norms related to objective inquiry suffice. The fact that the human sciences are forced to confront substantive normative issues puts a limit on the kind of theoretical regularities that can be established in the human sciences. Given the core role that human beings play in the socio-historical world, the understanding of individuality is as important in the human sciences as are the explanations to be found through generalizations.\n\nBut the human science of psychology that deals with individual human beings cannot examine them apart from interactions with society. \u201cMan as a fact prior to history and society is a fiction\u201d (1883/SW.I, 83). This means that psychology can be a foundational human science only if it is conceived as being primarily descriptive. Psychological explanations may still be possible, but only by starting with a non-hypothetical base that describes how our experience assimilates social and cultural features. Many human character traits are not purely psychological. Thus when we speak of a person as thrifty we are combining economic and psychological features.\n\nIndividual human beings are important for the understanding of history, but instead of making them the monadic building blocks of history, they are to be considered as points of intersection of many forces. Only a multidisciplinary approach to human history can do it justice. Qua conscious living beings, individuals are the carriers of history, but they are just as much the products of history. Individuals are not self-sufficient atoms. But neither are they to be regarded as swallowed up by encompassing communities like nations or peoples. Concepts that posit the soul of a people \u201care no more usable in history than is the concept of life-force in physiology\u201d (1883/SW.I, 92). Suspicion of those who posit overriding self-sufficient entities like nations and peoples led Dilthey to distance himself from the nationalism of his contemporary Heinrich von Treitschke and to ally himself with a political reformism reminiscent of Kant and Wilhelm von Humboldt.\n\nDilthey conceives of most of the human sciences as analyzing human interactions at a level that can mediate between individual initiative and communal tradition. These sciences deal with what he calls \u201ccultural systems\u201d and \u201cexternal organizations of society\u201d. Cultural systems are associations that individuals join voluntarily for certain purposes that they can only achieve through cooperation. These systems are cultural in the widest possible sense and include all aspects of our social life. They can be political, economic, artistic, scientific or religious in nature and are not normally bound by national or other overarching interests. External organizations of society by contrast are those more controlling institutional structures like a family and a state that we are born into. Here \u201cenduring causes bind the wills of many into a single whole\u201d (1883/SW.I, 94) within which relations of power, dependence and property can be established. It is important to cross-reference cultural systems and institutional organizations. Enlightenment thinkers had focused on cultural systems such as scientific academies and their potential universal scope while overlooking how most educational institutions are controlled by local authorities. Although Dilthey received his training from members of the Historical School, he recognized that many of them had been equally one-sided by stressing the distinctive institutional organizations that separate different peoples while ignoring the role of generalizations made possible through the analysis of cultural systems.\n\nDilthey aims to combine these two approaches to liberalize the historicist perspective and give it a methodological rigor. To understand the role of the law in historical life we must consider it both as a cultural system that frames legal issues in universal terms and as an external organization of society that examines them in terms of the positive laws of particular institutions. The Historical School was wrong to regard individuals as completely subordinate to the bonds of family and state and to think that the positive laws of institutions define the full reality of life. The authority of the state \u201cencompasses only a certain portion \u2026 of the collective power of the populace\u201d and even when state power exerts a certain preponderance it can do so only \u201cthrough the cooperation of psychological impulses\u201d (1883/SW.I, 132).\n\nIn the preface to the Introduction to the Human Sciences, Dilthey refers to his project as a Critique of Historical Reason. We can now see that this is first of all a critique of the metaphysical thesis that there can be an overarching \u201cuniversal explanatory framework for all historical facts\u201d (1883/SW.I, 141). If universal explanations are to be possible for history as well as for nature, then we must recognize that they are only possible for correlating partial contents of reality. The reason that the natural sciences have been so successful in discovering causal laws of nature is that they abstract from the full scope of the external world.\n\nThe conditions sought by the mechanistic explanation of nature explain only part of the contents of external reality. This intelligible world of atoms, ether, vibrations, is only a calculated and highly artificial abstraction from what is given in outer and lived experience. (1883/SW.I, 203)\n\nThe human sciences cannot similarly construct an abstract phenomenal world that focuses on physical and chemical processes and appeals to hypothetical atomic or even subatomic elements. It is incumbent on the human sciences to deal with the more complex networks of the historical world and the actual givens of human beings. Explanations that are adequate for the historical world will require an analysis of the multiple partial contents that are relevant in a particular context. According to Dilthey the human sciences must replace the abstract methodology of the natural sciences with an analytic counterpart.\n\nAbstraction is distinguished from analysis in that the former singles out one fact and disregards the others, whereas the latter seeks to apprehend the majority of the facts that make up the factors of a complex whole. (ca. 1880\u20131893/SW.I, 433)\n\nThe more facts that explanations seek to correlate, the more limited their scope must be. Thus the laws to be discovered in the human sciences will apply not to history in general, but only to specific cultural systems or institutional organizations. It may be possible to arrive at causal laws of economic growth, of scientific progress or of literary development, but not at overarching historical laws of human progress.\n\nSo far Dilthey has argued for a relative independence of the human sciences vis-\u00e0-vis the better established natural sciences. However, from the transcendental perspective that considers the conditions our consciousness brings to experience, the human sciences must claim a reflective priority. The realization that the human sciences not only ascertain what is\u2014as do the natural sciences\u2014but also make value judgments, establish goals and prescribe rules, discloses that they are much more directly related to the full reality of lived experience. The Kantian I-think that is the basis of the conceptual cognition (Erkenntnis) of the natural sciences really derives from a direct knowing (Wissen) rooted in Dilthey\u2019s more inclusive thinking-feeling-willing of lived experience (see 1883/SW.I, 228, and ca. 1880\u201393/SW.I, 263\u201368). The natural sciences merely construct a phenomenal or ideal world that abstracts from the real nexus of lived experience. The world that is formed by the human sciences is the historical-social reality in which human beings participate. It is a real world that is directly possessed or present in what Dilthey calls Innewerden. This term has sometimes been translated as \u201cinner awareness,\u201d but is is better to translate it as \u201creflexive awareness\u201d to indicate how things are there-for-us. Reflexive awareness is a pre-reflective, indexical mode of consciousness that \u201cdoes not place a content over against the subject of consciousness (it does not re-present it)\u201d (ca. 1880\u201393/SW.I, 253). It is the direct know-how that reality is present-for-me prior to any of the reflective act-content, inner-outer, or subject-object distinctions that characterize the representational world of conceptual cognition.\n\nThe human sciences must hold on to the original presence of this directly known reality even as they proceed to use the intellectual tools of conceptual cognition in their analysis of partial contents. The way the historical world is represented and analyzed must in some way still reflect the way history has been lived. The final understanding (Verstehen) aimed at by Dilthey\u2019s human sciences must draw on all our capacities and is to be distinguished from the mere intellectual and abstract understanding (Verstand) of Kant\u2019s natural sciences.\n\nIn attempting to convey the richness and depth of lived experience, the human sciences must also consider the contribution of the arts. Aesthetics constitutes an important cultural system in that it can provide a sense of how the arts can contribute to human understanding in general. Dilthey\u2019s Poetics of 1887 represents an effort to develop certain psychological concepts to explicate the workings of the poetic imagination. Even in ordinary life, the images we extract from experience are subject to metamorphosis. With time all our images are transformed, for \u201cthe same image can no more return than the same leaf can grow back on a tree the following spring\u201d (1887/SW.V, 102). The first law of metamorphosis involves the exclusion of those constituents of images that are not valuable to us. Not every apprehended constituent is worth remembering. According to Dilthey we do not just passively absorb every impression that comes our way. We filter out what is not worth perceiving by a process of apperception. This apperception is guided by what is called an \u201cacquired nexus of psychic life\u201d. Because this gradually acquired nexus differs for each subject, the process of exclusion never has the same outcome.\n\nSome of what has not been excluded by the first law of imaginative metamorphosis can then become the focus of special attention. According to Dilthey\u2019s second law of imaginative metamorphosis \u201cImages are transformed when they expand or contract, when the intensity of the sensations of which they are composed is increased or decreased\u201d (1887/SW.V, 102). Such a change in intensity can apply to either the reproductive imagination of ordinary memory or the productive imagination of poets or novelists. In the former case of memory an increase of intensity tends to be as much a function of a present practical interest as of acquired experience. In the latter case of the imagination of poets an increase of intensity is more likely to be primarily regulated by their overall acquired psychic nexus. What distinguishes the imagination of great poets according to Dilthey is their capacity to ignore the constant distractions and mundane interests of daily life. Only they can unfold imagery in a way that reflects our overall human values.\n\nThe third law of imaginative metamorphosis involves their completion, by which Dilthey means a process \u201cby which something outer is enlivened by something inner or something inner is made visible and intuitable by something outer\u201d (1887/SW.V, 104). In completion there is an interpenetration between inner feeling and outer perception so that the very nucleus of an image can symbolize the overall acquired psychic nexus. Dilthey writes,\n\nOnly when the whole acquired psychic nexus becomes active can images be transformed on the basis of it: innumerable, immeasurable, almost imperceptible changes occur in their nucleus. And in this way, the completion of the particular originates from the fullness of psychic life. (1887/SW.V, 104)\n\nThis last law of imaginative completion applies only to artists and allows them to articulate the essential meaning of life-situations\u2014through them we come to see what is typical in life. These laws of metamorphosis are conceived as explanative to the extent that they appeal to an overall acquired psychic nexus as their ultimate context. But a more comprehensive descriptive account shows these laws to be rather schematic and unable to capture all the qualitative changes that result for our understanding of the world more generally. And for that reason Dilthey backs away from pure psychological explanations after 1887. In the essay \u201cThree Epochs of Modern Aesthetics\u201d of 1892 he redescribes imaginative metamorphosis more structurally. A portrait painter is said to order the structure of what is objectively perceived\n\naround one especially noticeable point, which I will call the aesthetic point of impression. Every carefully observed face is understood on the basis of such a dominant impression \u2026. On the basis of this impression and repeated memory, indifferent features are excluded, while telling features are stressed and refractory ones de-emphasized. The remaining whole is unified ever more decisively. (1892/SW.V, 217)\n\nNow exclusion, intensification and unifying completion are understood as part of a process of articulating the structure of our experience of reality.\n\n2.2 The 1890s: Understanding as Structural Articulation\n\nThis new, more descriptive structural approach is inaugurated in the essay \u201cThe Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its Justification\u201d of 1890. Here Dilthey writes that the structure of all psychic life consists of impressions \u201cevoking purposive reactions in the system of our drives and the feelings connected with them\u201d (1890a/SW.II, 14). Rather than basing our initial sense of an external world on theoretical inferences from effects to causes, he roots it in a felt resistance to the will. But resistance must be internalized as a restraint of a volitional intention for it to signify the existence of something independent. Thus Dilthey is not merely replacing a representational phenomenalism with a direct perceptual realism. Each perceptual process has \u201can inner side\u201d that involves \u201can energy and affective tone deriving from inner strivings that connect it to our own life\u201d (1890a/SW.II, 14). All aspects of our own life are brought into play as we respond to the world.\n\nIn 1894 Dilthey published his \u201cIdeas for a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology\u201d and established how it differs from traditional explanative psychologies. He admits that even a descriptive psychology will seek to explicate the causal relationships of life, but that it must differ from explanative psychology by not trying to \u201cderive a comprehensive and transparent cognition of psychological phenomena from a limited number of univocally determined elements\u201d (1894/SW.II, 116). Unlike the associationists, Dilthey will not posit simple, stable impressions that are then combined into more complex ideas. They introduce unnecessary hypothetical elements into the foundation of psychology.\n\nIn psychology it is precisely the connectedness that is originally and continually given in lived experience: life presents itself everywhere only as a continuum or nexus. (1894/SW.II, 119\u201320)\n\nIt is the task of a descriptive and analytic psychology to explicate how different processes converge in the nexus of consciousness. This nexus is lived and must be distinguished from the overall acquired psychic nexus discussed earlier. The lived nexus is available to reflexive awareness and can be described as itself an ongoing process. Analysis then shows this process to have a rather uniform cross-sectional structure. Almost every momentary state of consciousness can be seen \u201cto simultaneously contain some kind of representing, feeling, and willing\u201d (1894/SW.II, 173).\n\nIf we were merely representational beings, the conditions of psychic life would be merely causal. But we at the same time estimate the value of what we represent through feeling.\n\nOnce external conditions evoke a sense of pressure or intensification in the sphere of feeling, a striving comes about to either maintain or to modify a given state. (1894/SW.II, 177)\n\nThe interest of feeling that attaches to aspects of what is experienced allows us to value them as either favorable or unfavorable to our existence and sets the stage for the will to possibly act on their basis.\n\nTo the extent that the parts [of the experiential nexus] are connected structurally so as to link the satisfaction of the drives and happiness and to reject suffering, we call this nexus purposive. It is solely in psychic structure that the character of purposiveness is originally given, and when we attribute this to an organism or to the world, this concept is only transferred from inner lived experience. Every relation of parts to a whole attains the character of purposiveness from the value that is realized in it. This value is experienced only in the life of feelings and drives. (1894/SW.II, 178)\n\nPsychic life is not constructed synthetically from discrete elements, but is always already a continuum that is constantly differentiating itself from within. By describing and analyzing this continuum Dilthey brings out the breadth and depth of its scope and articulates it as a structural nexus. And as he considers the temporal development of this nexus, he further defines its purposiveness. Although the cognitive and volitional subsystems of mental life may posit external ends, the affective and overall psychic nexus displays what Kant called a purposiveness without a determinant purpose. The overall acquired psychic nexus exhibits a teleology that does not posit any final telos to which all previous stages are to be subsumed. The purposiveness of mental life is immanent and adaptive rather than external and predetermined. Each stage of our life can be understood as an epoch with its distinctive value.\n\nNothing can be more erroneous than viewing maturity as the goal of the development that constitutes life and thus transforming the early years into mere means. How could those years serve as means to a goal which in each case is so uncertain? Instead, it is part of the nature of life to strive to fill each moment with a richness of value. (1894/SW.II, 189)\n\nA further task of Dilthey\u2019s descriptive and analytic psychology is to show how the development of the psychic nexus produces the individuation of human life. Individuality is not conceived in terms of unique qualities that we are endowed with, but as something that each of us acquires historically. It is embodied in what was referred to earlier as a subject\u2019s acquired psychic nexus and is only gradually articulated. Even when people share the same qualities their relative intensity will differ. Sometimes qualities are present to such a small extent as to be, in effect, unnoticeable. Prominent qualities, however, tend to reinforce certain related qualities and suppress others. Each individual can thus be understood as a structural configuration of a set of dominant qualities in tension with some subordinate qualities. This tension may be unresolved for a long time until finally some articulation or Gestalt is reached that defines a person\u2019s character. Dilthey gives the example of strong ambition leading someone to gradually overcome shyness in public. Once a person recognizes that low self-confidence when speaking in public stands in the way of an important goal being fulfilled, that person can begin to cultivate the requisite qualities.\n\nThe initial response to Dilthey\u2019s descriptive psychology was mixed. Hermann Ebbinghaus wrote an extended review which claimed that Dilthey still relies on hypotheses and that the differences between explanative and descriptive psychologies are minimal. Dilthey defended his position by showing that he never meant to banish explanative hypotheses from psychology altogether, merely from its descriptive foundations. Husserl later expressed his regret that the Ebbinghaus review deflected him from reading this \u201cgenial\u201d anticipation of phenomenology until much later.\n\nAnother kind of criticism came from the Neo-Kantians, most of whom wanted to completely divorce philosophy from psychology. In 1894 the Baden School Neo-Kantian Wilhelm Windelband delivered a lecture in which he claimed that psychology has no real relevance for the historical sciences and should be considered a natural science rather than a human science. Windelband sees psychology as searching for laws just as the natural sciences do and historical studies as interested in unique patterns. Thus he proposed that the natural sciences are nomothetic and the historical or cultural sciences ideographic. Dilthey in turn rejected Windelband\u2019s distinction by showing that many natural sciences have ideographic elements and many human sciences such as linguistics and economics have nomothetic aims. Moreover, Dilthey argued that the description of singular historical data only becomes meaningful if understood in the framework of regularities: \u201cWhat is most characteristic of the systematic human sciences is the connection of the general and the individual \u201d (1895\u20136/SW.II, 227). Not only is it the case that universal considerations are as important as ideographic specificity, but also the understanding of individuality is not possible without reference to some broader context.\n\n2.3 1900\u20131911: Historical Understanding and Hermeneutics\n\n2.3.1 Interpreting from the Outside In\n\nThe final phase of Dilthey\u2019s philosophy can be said to begin at the turn of the twentieth century with his essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d. Whereas the early prize-essay on Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics had been more focused on textual and theological interpretation, the new essay makes hermeneutics a connecting link between philosophy and history. Dilthey argues that the study of history can be reliable only if it is possible to raise the understanding of what is singular to the level of universal validity. Here he also comes to the realization that\n\nthe inner experience through which I obtain reflexive awareness of my own condition can never by itself bring me to a consciousness of my own individuality. I experience the latter only through a comparison of myself with others. (1900/SW.IV, 236)\n\nOthers cannot be assumed to be mere extensions of myself. They are accessible to me only from the outside. It is the task of understanding to confer \u201can inside\u201d to what is first given as \u201ca complex of external sensory signs\u201d (1900/SW.IV, 236).\n\nWhereas up to then the intelligibility of lived experience had been assumed to provide us an understanding of ourselves, now Dilthey asserts that we can understand ourselves only by means of our objectifications. The understanding of self requires me to approach myself as others do, that is, from the outside to the inside.\n\nThe process of understanding, insofar as it is determined by common conditions and epistemological means, must everywhere have the same characteristics. (1900/SW.IV, 237)\n\nTo the extent that rules can guide the understanding of the objectifications of life they make possible a theory of interpretation. Hermeneutics is the theory of interpretation that relates to all human objectifications\u2014that is, not only speech and writing, but also visual artistic expressions, more casual physical gestures as well as observable actions or deeds.\n\nThis new hermeneutic perspective that approaches the inside from the outside also alters Dilthey\u2019s conception of psychic structure. In the first of three \u201cStudies Toward the Foundation of the Human Sciences\u201d dating from 1904\u20139, Dilthey considers what linguistic expressions can teach us about the intentionality of consciousness. No longer merely explicating the breadth of psychic life through the interweavings of acts of cognition, feeling and willing, Dilthey uses expressions such as \u201cI am worried about something\u201d to disclose the referential structure of a lived experience. Psychic acts have contents that are related to the objects of the world by means of what Dilthey calls attitudinal stances. These judgmental attitudes toward the world are\n\nindefinite in number. Asking, believing, presuming, claiming, taking pleasure in, approving, liking and its opposite, wishing, desiring, and willing are such modifications of the psychic attitude. (1904\u20139/SW.III, 43)\n\nThese attitudinal and judgmental stances are not just cognitive, but pre-delineate something more encompassing, which can be called \u201creflective knowledge\u201d to distinguish it from the direct knowing of lived experience and reflexive awareness. This judgmental reflective knowledge (Wissen) adds to the conceptual cognition (Erkenntnis) of reality a \u201cpositing of values\u201d and \u201cthe determination of purposes and the establishment of rules.\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 25)\n\nWhile the kind of epistemology (Erkenntnistheorie) established by Kant and others suffices for the natural sciences, the human sciences require a more full-blooded theory of knowledge (Theorie des Wissens). Knowledge is to be \u201cdistinguished from a mere representation, presumption, question, or assumption by the fact that a content appears here with a sense of objective necessity\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 27\u201328). This objective necessity is to be located in the evidentness that accompanies thinking that is properly executed and reaches its goal whether through the self-given reality of lived experience or the \u201cgivenness that binds us to an outer perception\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 28).\n\nFor the human sciences, things in the world are not merely cognitively apprehended as phenomenal objects, but known as real for our life-concerns (Lebensbez\u00fcge). Thinking of the unfinished manuscripts in his office, Dilthey writes in the Second Study Toward the Foundation of the Human Sciences:\n\nI am tired from overworking; having reviewed my files, I worry about their unfinished contents, whose completion demands incalculably more work from me. All this \u201cabout\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, and \u201ctoward\u201d, all these references of what is remembered to what is experienced, in short, all these structural inner relations, must be apprehended by me, since I now want to apprehend the fullness of the lived experience exhaustively. And precisely in order to exhaust it, I must regress further in the structural network to the memories of other lived experiences. (1904\u20139/SW.III, 50)\n\nEvery attempt to characterize a lived experience leads beyond it to other structurally related experiences that ground it. This involves not just an observational process of willful attention, but also an involuntary \u201cbeing-pulled-along by the state of affairs itself\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 51) to other constituent parts of the nexus of human knowledge.\n\nSome of these refinements incorporated into Dilthey\u2019s descriptive program were inspired by reading Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations (1900\u201301). Dilthey specifically follows Husserl in his account of how language contributes to \u201csignificative apprehension\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 60). In reading words we do not represent them as mere sets of letters but fulfill their meaning by representing their objects. There is a triadic structural relation between the intuitive content of a linguistic expression, an act that gives it meaning, and the object that embodies that meaning as what is expressed. But whereas Husserl\u2019s phenomenology focused in the conceptual structures of objective apprehension, Dilthey gives equal attention to the felt structures of what he calls \u201cobjective having\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 66). In objective apprehension we progress from attitude to objects, in objective having we regress from objects to attitude. This regressive turn from the outside to the inside is brought to bear on how feelings are to be interpreted. \u201c Whether we feel our own state or some object, it involves only a state of being as a kind of attitude\u2026. The way this state of being depends on outer objects or on the state of the subject is obscured through an inverse attitude that loses itself in the depth of the subject\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 69). Instead of regarding feelings merely as subjective states such as pleasure or displeasure, they can be interpreted as attitudes that assess what is given in consciousness as either furthering or diminishing one\u2019s state of being in the world. Feelings can be added to our earlier list of attitudes.\n\nFeelings as attitudes allow us to evaluate the world. Our values express adjudicative attitudes based on feeling. Although the setting of purposes is grounded in the lived experience of values, the life of feelings has an immanent teleology that does not require it to go over into the desire to act. The structural nexus of willing is thus different from that of feeling. There are many feelings that evoke further feelings rather than the impulse to do something in response to them. A feeling of suffering can for instance elicit a kind of self-pity that spreads the suffering and elicits a \u201cdistinctively mellow\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 76) mood that immobilizes.\n\nThe final general attitude relevant to the structural nexus of knowledge is that of willing. In the lived experiences of willing \u201cwe possess a reflexive awareness of an intention to realize a state of affairs\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 82). If we call this state of affairs to be realized a \u201cpurpose\u201d then what is expected from this purpose is a satisfaction of some kind.\n\n2.3.2 Reinterpreting Purposiveness and Distinguishing Elementary Understanding and Higher Understanding.\n\nDilthey\u2019s most important work is The Formation (Aufbau) of the Historical World in the Human Sciences of 1910. Here Dilthey applies the same kind of structural analysis that we saw him develop for lived experience to the understanding of history. The human sciences give form to the historical world by analyzing the structural systems in terms of which human beings participate in history. In the Introduction to the Human Sciences Dilthey had conceived the psychic nexus, cultural systems and external organizations of society as purposive systems. Now a more neutral covering concept is used to capture all the ways the forces of life can converge. This is the concept of the \u201cproductive nexus or system\u201d (Wirkungszusammenhang). Now the efficacy of life and of the historical world is to be understood in terms of productivity before any causal or teleological analysis is applied. The carriers of history, whether they be individuals, cultures, institutions, or communities, are productive systems capable of producing value, meaning, and, in some cases, realizing purposes. Each is to be considered structurally as centered in itself.\n\nIndividuals can be studied as psychic productive systems inherently related to each other as well as to more inclusive productive systems that are also at work in history. These larger productive systems come about because of the need for communication, interaction, and cooperation among individuals. But they can also take on a life of their own and survive the individuals that formed and shaped them. Dilthey\u2019s category of Wirkung or productivity is at the root of Gadamer\u2019s theory of the productive history (Wirkungsgeschichte) of works of art that grants them new meanings over time that exceed those intended by their creators. In the Introduction to the Human Sciences, Dilthey had been unwilling to consider purposive social systems as subjects or carriers of history. In The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences, he qualifies his opposition to the idea of a transpersonal subject such as the soul of a people by de-reifying it as the spirit of a people that is to be considered as a logical rather than a real subject. It is possible to regard cooperative productive systems as logical subjects that transcend individuals without positing them as super-empirical real subjects.\n\nDespite this increased importance granted to more encompassing cultural systems and organizations of society, Dilthey continues to insist that the individuals participating in them are never completely submerged by them. This is because any such productive system only engages some aspects of an individual. Moreover, the individuals active in a cultural system often put their stamp on its mode of productivity so that not just the rationally agreed upon function of the system is achieved. Summing up these two points, Dilthey discerns a difficulty in conceptualizing the sciences of these cultural systems in terms of the idea of purposes alone:\n\nThe individuals who cooperate in such a function belong to the cultural system only through those processes by which they contribute to the realization of the function. Nevertheless, they participate in these processes with their whole being, which means that a domain based purely on the system\u2019s functional purpose can never be constructed. Rather, other aspects of human nature are also constantly at work in this domain supplementing the energies devoted to the system\u2019s functions. (1910/SW.III, 208)\n\nIndividuals give only part of themselves to these more inclusive systems, yet they can express their whole being through this part. No cultural system will embody merely the purposes it was meant to fulfill. That is why it is crucial to reconceive purposive systems as productive systems. A productive nexus or system may be purposive in a general sense without fulfilling a determinate purpose. It is to be understood more generally as producing objectifications that express human values as well as purposes\u2014leaving open the extent to which specific goals are achieved. The important thing is how human values and purposes are expressed in productive systems and how their meaning is to be understood.\n\nAs in the essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d, understanding was said to involve a process of referring back from outer sensory phenomena to a reality that involves inner processes. But now in The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences Dilthey recognizes that this inner reality need not be psychological in nature. He uses the example of how the statutes of a state express the common will of a community. The inner content of the laws on the books is a legal meaning-formation. The expressions we read in law books articulate an inner relation among legal imperatives. What is expressed in these laws is not the mental states of individual legislators, but a general way of regulating human relations. Dilthey makes the same claim for individual poetic creations. What is expressed in a drama is\n\nnot the inner processes in the poet; it is rather a nexus created in them but separable from them. The nexus of a drama consists in a distinctive relation of material, poetic mood, motif, plot, and means of presentation. (1910/SW.III, 107)\n\nThe interpretation of history must deal with all manifestations of life, not merely expressions that are intended to communicate a state of mind. In the section entitled \u201cThe Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life\u201d, Dilthey distinguishes three classes of life-manifestations. The first class consists of concepts, judgments and larger thought-formations. They are intended to communicate states of affairs, not states of mind. Thus the proposition \u201ctwo plus two equals four\u201d means the same in all contexts and says nothing about the person uttering it. Actions form a second class of manifestations of life. Actions as such are not meant to communicate anything, but they often do reveal something about the intentions of the actor. Thus if someone picks up a hammer nearby some nails and wooden boards, it is legitimate to assume that he or she wants to assemble the boards into some artifact. If this occurs in a large workshop, it is also plausible to think the person is a carpenter. This might also tell us something about the person\u2019s livelihood, but not much more. There is a third class of life-manifestations that Dilthey calls \u201cexpressions of lived experience\u201d and which disclose more about the individual uttering them. Expressions of lived experience can range from emotional exclamations and gestures to personal self-descriptions and reflections to works of art. Often these expressions are more revealing than was intended:\n\nAn expression of lived experience can contain more of the nexus of psychic life than any introspection can catch sight of. It draws from depths not illuminated by consciousness. But at the same time, it is characteristic of an expression of lived experience that its relation to the spiritual or human content expressed in it can only be made available to understanding within limits. Such expressions are not to be judged as true or false but as truthful or untruthful. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 227)\n\nA work of art is often more disclosive of human life in general than of the specific life of the artist. It may disclose something about the state of mind or the attitude of the artist, but a work of art will only be great if its \u201cspiritual content is liberated from its creator\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 228).\n\nAfter having analyzed these three kinds of manifestations of life, which can be called theoretical, practical and disclosive respectively, Dilthey proceeds to distinguish various modes of understanding them. Elementary understanding goes back to the associative relation that normally exists between an expression and what is expressed in it. It assimilates the meanings that are commonly attached to expressions in the community that we grow up in. Dilthey adapts Hegel\u2019s idea of \u201cobjective spirit\u201d to account for this commonality of meaning. Now objective spirit logically encompasses \u201cthe manifold forms in which a commonality existing among individuals has objectified itself in the world of the senses\u201d, allowing the past to become \u201ca continuously enduring present for us\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229). Whereas Hegel restricted objective spirit to the legal, economic and political aspects of historical life, Dilthey expands the concept to include not only the sciences, but also the triad of art, religion and philosophy that Hegel had assigned to absolute spirit. But most of all, objective spirit embodies the everyday, mundane aspects of life that we grow up with.\n\nFrom earliest childhood, the self is nurtured by this world of objective spirit. It is also the medium in which the understanding of other persons and their life-manifestations takes place. For everything in which spirit has objectified itself contains something that is common to the I and the Thou. Every square planted with trees, every room in which chairs are arranged, is understandable to us from childhood because human tendencies to set goals, produce order, and define values in common have assigned a place to every square and every object in the room. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229)\n\nThis common background suffices for the elementary understanding of everyday life. But whenever the common meaning of life-manifestations is called into question for some reason, higher understanding becomes necessary. This can occur because of an apparent inconsistency among various claims being made, or because an ambiguity that needs to be resolved. In each case we discern an unexpected complexity that requires us to shift our frame of reference. Higher understanding cannot continue to rely on the common meanings of an expression that derive from a shared local background between speaker and listener, writer and reader. Higher understanding must replace the sphere of commonality, where inference by analogy suffices, with that of universality, where inductive inference must take over. Here the human sciences become relevant by offering the appropriate universal disciplinary contexts that can help to deal with uncertainties of interpretation. These universal systematic contexts can be social or political, economic or cultural, secular or religious. When expressions can be determined to be functioning in a specific disciplinary context then ambiguities tend to disappear. Literary scholars may be able to clarify a puzzling poetic passage by showing it to contain a literary allusion to a classical work with a foreign vocabulary. Or they can perhaps clarify it by seeing it as a way of accommodating certain technical demands of the genre as such. These cases of higher understanding establish a larger context of reference.\n\nHowever, higher understanding can also focus on more specific contexts related to a work or its author. The consideration of such contexts should come only at the conclusion of the interpretive process and represents a shift from exploring the relation \u201cof expression to what is expressed\u201d toward the relation \u201cof what has been produced to productivity\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233). Here we move from meaning relationships to something like a productive relationship to which knowledge about the authors becomes relevant. But the first recourse here is to consult more of the products of the author. How does a sentence fit into a paragraph, a chapter, a whole work, or a corpus as a whole? Only if these contexts fail to resolve the problem may we consider psychological claims about the author. The understanding of the individuality of an author should only bring in psychological factors as a last resort. Dilthey writes\n\nwe understand individuals by means of their affinities, their commonalities. This process presupposes the connection between the universally human and individuation. On the basis of what is universal, we can see individuation extended to the manifoldness of human existence. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233)\n\nHowever, the highest form of understanding is not the reconstruction of the individuality of the author. It involves something that has been confused with reconstruction, but is distinct. What Dilthey points to is a process of re-creation or re-experiencing, which he contrasts with understanding as such:\n\nUnderstanding as such is an operation running inverse to the course of production. But a fully sympathetic reliving requires that understanding go forward with the line of the events themselves. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 235)\n\nRe-experiencing develops understanding by completing the hermeneutical circle. If understanding goes \u201cback\u201d to the overall context, re-experiencing goes \u201cforward\u201d by following out the parts that give focus to the whole. A re-experiencing is not an actual re-construction but produces a better understanding that refines the original. This is made clear by the following example:\n\nA lyrical poem makes possible, through the sequence of its verses, the re-experiencing of a nexus of lived experience\u2014not the real one that stimulated the poet, but the one that, on its basis, the poet places in the mouth of an ideal person. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 235)\n\nWhereas the arts can expand the horizon of our lived experience by means of the ideal and imaginary means of fiction, history must do so by a process of structural articulation. The task of the human sciences is to analyze the productive nexus of history as it exhibits itself in stable formations or systematic structures. The productive nexus of history differs from the causal nexus of nature in producing values and arriving at purposes.\n\nThe carriers of this constant creation of values and goods in the world of human spirit are individuals, communities, and the cultural systems in which individuals cooperate. This cooperation is determined by the fact that, in order to realize values, individuals subject themselves to rules and set themselves purposes. All these modes of cooperation manifest a life-concern connected to the human essence that links individuals with each other\u2014a core, as it were, that cannot be grasped psychologically but is revealed in every such system of relations among human beings. (1910/SW.III, 175\u201376)\n\nEach such socio-cultural system can be regarded as being centered within itself on the basis of some function, whether it be economic, scientific, political, artistic or religious. The structures to be analyzed here provide various cross-sections of what takes place in history. But there are also more composite and enduring socio-historical contexts that we can delineate such as nation-states and historical periods.\n\nA nation-state is a composite institutional organization that contains and shapes many socio-cultural productive systems which then generate certain commonalities. When socio-cultural systems transcending the scope of a nation come into contact with local productive systems, they also begin to assume commonalities distinctive of that nation. In the individual members of a nation-state these commonalities can produce a sense of solidarity. But Dilthey also warns of excesses in that regard when he notes that many Germans are \u201cplacing the highest value ... not in the serene world-view of the Greeks, not in the intellectually delimited consideration of purpose of the Romans, but in the raw exertion of power without any limit\u201d (1910/SW.III, 196).\n\nNation-states are regionally defined historical wholes, but we can also delineate temporal composite wholes such as historical phases. What characterizes a generation according to Dilthey is the crystallization of a movement sparked by the maturation of a certain age group. An epoch is more impersonal and large-scale. It marks a pervasive \u201cpermeating tendency\u201d (1910/SW.III, 198). Each epoch defines a life-horizon by which people orient their life. \u201cSuch a horizon places life, life-concerns, life-experience, and thought-formation in a certain proportion\u201d (1910/SW.III, 198), which tends to restrain the way individuals can modify their outlooks. But an epoch is only an overall tendency that encompasses opposing forces. In fact, a new epoch will often be sparked by the dissatisfactions produced by any force that becomes too dominant and complacent.\n\nThe structural analysis of history in terms of cultural systems and the external organizations of society can be guided by the various human sciences. But a reflective mode of judgment is needed when historians try to make sense of the more composite structures of nation-states and epochs. History is both a judgmental art concerned with meaning and a science concerned with objective truth. Only historical reflection can create the right balance that will transform the conceptual cognition of the human sciences into adequate historical knowledge.\n\n2.3.3 The Categories of Historical Knowledge.\n\nThis shift to historical knowledge is the main theme of the notes (ca. 1910) for a second volume of The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences (1910) which were published posthumously in 1927 as Drafts for a Critique of Historical Reason. Here Dilthey analyzes the categories of life that are relevant to historical knowledge. He distinguishes between formal and real categories. Formal categories stem from elementary logical operations that are at work in all apprehension: they include the processes of comparing, noting sameness, differentiating and relating. Although such elementary operations are prediscursive, they provide the basis for discursive thought. The prediscursive noting of sameness prepares the way for the unifying concepts of discursive thought and the process of relating provides the basis for synthetic procedures. These prediscursive and discursive modes of thought account for the formal categories of unity, plurality, identity, difference, degree and relation that are shared by the natural and human sciences.\n\nBut the real categories are not the same in the natural and human sciences. Whereas time is an ideal abstract form for the natural sciences, for the human sciences it has a qualitative content. It is experienced as advancing into the future and \u201calways contains the memory of what has just been present\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 216). The relation between the past and the present becomes the source for the category of meaning which is Dilthey\u2019s main historical category. The present never merely is in the sense of being observable and it can be understood meaningfully only to the extent that the past asserts its presence in it. When the present is lived, \u201cthe positive or negative value of the realities that fill it are experienced through feeling. And when we face the future, the category of purpose arises through a projective attitude\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 222). Meaning, value, and purpose are the three central categories of the human sciences and each relates to time in its own way. What is valued by feeling focuses on the momentary present, but for the will everything in the present tends to be subordinated to some future purpose. Only the category of meaning can expand the present into a presence that includes the past and overcomes the mere juxtaposition or subordination of the various aspects of life to each other. The understanding of meaning involves the encompassing sense of reflective knowledge that attempts to relate cognition to evaluation and the setting of goals.\n\nDilthey\u2019s distinction between the natural and human sciences is not a metaphysical distinction. For that reason he does not create a dualism between nature as the domain of causality and history as the domain of freedom. There are many determining forces at work in history because it cannot be divorced from natural conditions. But to understand how individuals participate in history we must replace the purely external relation of cause and effect with the integral relation of \u201cagency and suffering, of action and reaction\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 219).\n\nThe doing and undergoing that characterizes human involvement in history can be brought home most forcefully in autobiography.\n\nHere a life-course stands as an external phenomenon from which understanding seeks to discover what produced it within a particular environment. The person who understands it is the same as the one who created it. This results in a special intimacy of understanding. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 221)\n\nAutobiography begins with what memory has selected as significant life-moments, which reflection then gives a certain coherence. Thereby the initial tasks of \u201cexplicating a historical nexus are already half solved by life itself\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 221).\n\nBut the fact that history derives a special intimacy through the capacity for autobiography does not mean that we should be content to understand history through individuals alone. This also becomes evident in relation to Dilthey\u2019s own work as a biographer of Schleiermacher. It became ever more clear to Dilthey that his biography could not solve its task of understanding the life of Schleiermacher without considering the intellectual life of Berlin in which he participated. A biography is likely to bring more contextual determining factors into play than an autobiography, but the biographer must remain open to the interplay of these influences and individual initiative. Dilthey writes that an individual\n\ndoes not face a limitless play of forces in the historical world: he dwells in the sphere of the state, religion, or science\u2014in brief, in a distinctive life-system or in a constellation of them. The inner structure of such a constellation draws the individual into it, shapes him, and determines the direction of his productivity. Historical achievements stem from the possibilities inherent in the inner structure of a historical moment. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 266\u201367)\n\nIndividuals worthy of a biography are those who have seized those momentary possibilities.\n\nWhen turning to the nexus of universal history, we move further beyond the individual life-courses focused on by autobiography and biography. Although universal-historical understanding cannot ignore the results of autobiography and biography, it will focus more on the history of nations, cultural systems, and the external organizations of society.\n\nEach of these histories has its own center to which the processes are related and consequently the values, purposes, and significance that result from this relationship. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 291)\n\nAnthropological reflection expects history to teach what life is and yet history is dependent on life as lived. There is a hermeneutical circularity here that could be escaped \u201cif unconditioned norms, purposes, or values [could] set the standard for contemplating an apprehending history\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 281). Unlike his Neo-Kantian contemporaries such as Hermann Cohen and Heinrich Rickert, Dilthey is not willing to accept unconditional values that transcend life. The spiritual nexus of history \u201cis that of life itself insofar as life produces connectedness under the conditions of its natural environment\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 280). Life is the ultimate context behind which we cannot go. It is the horizon of productivity which encompasses the organic and the mental, but cannot be defined by either. Since \u201clife is intimately related to temporal fulfillment\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 249), historicity is part of its essence. Consequently, the objective validity that is to be attached to any value cannot be separated from our temporal engagement with life. Values are not simply given or imposed from on high, but are produced as part of the human process of explicating the meaning of history. In light of Dilthey\u2019s skepticism about transcendent unconditional values, it may seem surprising that he presented an ethical system that expects human beings to make unconditional commitments that are self-binding.\n\nIn 1890 Dilthey offered a lecture course at the University of Berlin that was posthumously published with the title System of Ethics (1890b). Here Dilthey sets himself the task of developing a \u201cpsycho-ethical\u201d approach that is rooted in \u201canthropological-historical analysis\u201d (1890b/SW.VI,104). Whereas traditional psychology has analyzed feelings mainly as responses to sense impressions that come from without, a psycho-ethical understanding of the feelings that can motivate us to act must be rooted in anthropological analysis of our inner drives, instincts and desires. Instead of focusing on the intellectual processes whereby human beings adapt to their surroundings, Dilthey argues that most of our responses are basically emotive and volitional. The feelings that measure the effect the world has on us are not just the subjective aspect of our representations of the world. These feelings are rooted in certain drives among which a sense of group solidarity is central (1890b/SW.VI,104).\n\nThis solidarity encompasses a fellow-feeling (Mitgef\u00fchl)(1890b/SW.VI,104\u201305) that goes deeper than the sympathy of the British moralists. Dilthey regards sympathy as a feeling \u201ctransferred from one living being to another\u201d (1890b/SW.VI,89). Sympathy, compassion, and pity are modes of \u201csuffering with\u201d (Mitleid) that are derivative because they affect us from the outside. They involve an external \u201cconjoint movement\u201d (Mitbewegung) with others (1890b/SW.VI,89). Dilthey considers these psychological forms of sympathy or empathy (Mitempfindung) to be superficial compared to the more basic anthropological fellow-feeling of solidarity that produces an \u201cinner relationship\u201d (1890b/SW.VI,104)\u2013 with others.\n\nThe extent to which we are motivated by a sense of solidarity is a function of the sphere of commonality of objective spirit that we grow up in. Our anthropological sense of solidarity and its fellow-feeling provides a more positive incentive for sociability than Hume\u2019s sympathy and Schopenhauer\u2019s compassion. But even the fellowship of solidarity is a mere natural incentive which does not become ethical until it is transformed into a more active or participatory incentive of benevolence (1890b/GS.X, 70).\n\nAs he develops his anthropologically based approach to ethics, Dilthey leads up to three main ethical incentives. One of them is the benevolence (Wohlwollen) that we just related to human solidarity. The other two incentives are to strive for what is right (Rechtschaffenheit) and to perfect oneself in a socially legitimate manner (Vollkommenheit). These three ethical incentives had already been predelineated as moral principles in Dilthey\u2019s Habilitationsschrift of 1864 entitled \u201cVersuch einer Analyse des moralischen Bewu\u00dftseins\u201d (see 1864/GS.VI, 26\u201327). In fact, the concluding section THREE 12 of the System of Ethics is taken almost exclusively from this earlier work, where the ethical incentives were formulated as three moral oughts. This raises the question how it is possible to move from anthropologically derived ethical incentives that are a posteriori to ultimately arrive at moral oughts that are a priori. There is a crucial subsection THREE 9.3 that prepares us for this transition. It is entitled \u201cThe Feeling of Duty and Justice, the Consciousness of the Commitment that Inheres in the Duty to Do What is Right or Just .\u201d Here Dilthey is quite explicit that the commitment to do what is right demands a consciousness that cannot be conceived as a mere instinctive inner bond with others rooted in our sense of solidarity. The commitment to do what is right must now come from within on the basis of \u201crespect for others as ends in themselves\u201d (1890b/SW.VI, 128). The mere life-value of group solidarity is elevated to the spiritual value of respect for all others as individual ends-in-themselves. Having replaced Humean sympathy with benevolence, Dilthey now engages Kantian duty as part of his analysis of moral self-reflection. But instead of appealing to respect for the law to justify doing what is right, Dilthey derives moral duty from a commitment that is based on both a \u201cfidelity to oneself and respect for the self-worth of other persons\u201d (1890b/SW.VI,128). The sense of obligation (Verbindlichkeit) that comes with this commitment (Bindung) involves a recognition of a reciprocal human connectedness rather than a one-sided dependence on a higher law.\n\nFormally Dilthey moves even closer to Kant at the end of the lectures by acknowledging that ultimately we must make \u201cmoral judgments\u201d that are \u201cunconditional\u201d and \u201csynthetic a priori\u201d (1890b/GS.X, 108). Although Dilthey had rejected the possibility of synthetic a priori theoretical judgments for outer experience, he is now willing to speak of synthetic a priori practical judgments for inner experience. Had Dilthey published his 1890 lectures himself he would probably have tempered the language that was imported from his early essay. But he clearly still thinks that morality requires judgmental assent to oughts that are unconditionally self-binding.\n\nThe normative implications of anthropological reflection about life and history also led Dilthey to address the value of worldviews. Just as the nature of universal history forces us to conceive of history as more than a human science, so worldviews are more broadly based attempts at acquiring a unified perspective on life. The sciences are by their nature partial and cannot provide a comprehensive worldview. A worldview attempts to provide not only a cognitive picture of the world, but also an estimation of what in life is valuable and worth preserving, and finally how we can strive to improve reality. Worldviews have been developed in literary, religious and philosophical works. Philosophers have produced metaphysical formulations of worldviews that attempt to give them a universal conceptual determinacy. Dilthey analyzes three recurrent types of such metaphysical formulations: naturalism, the idealism of freedom, and objective idealism. The naturalism of Democritus, Hobbes and others derives everything from what can be cognized and is pluralistic in structure; idealism of freedom as found in Plato, Kant, and others insists on the sovereignty of the will and is dualistic; objective idealism as found in Heraclitus, Leibniz and Hegel affirms reality as the embodiment of a harmonious set of values and can be considered monistic. The three types of metaphysical worldviews are incommensurable in that each sets its priorities differently. Dilthey finds naturalism too reductive; his ethical views incline him toward the idealism of freedom; aesthetically he felt attracted towards objective idealism. No metaphysical formulation can have more than relative validity because it attempts to arrive at a totalization that transcends experience. Literary and poetic expressions of worldviews tend to be more successful because they do not claim to be totalizing. All that is humanly possible is to probe reality on the basis of life-experience and to settle for more limited philosophical insights informed by historical understanding. Ultimately, our reflective understanding of life and history must remain determinate-indeterminate.\n\nWe can see certain parallels with Dilthey\u2019s attempt to replace metaphysical systems with more informal life-based \u201cmeta-physical reflection\u201d or worldviews in the young Rudolf Carnap, who studied in Jena with Dilthey\u2019s student Herman Nohl before moving to Vienna. Carnap\u2019s paper \u201cThe Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language\u201d refers to Dilthey and his students as positive counterexamples to varieties of meaningless metaphysical systems as found in Fichte, Hegel and Heidegger. Another essay by Carnap entitled \u201cMetaphysics as Expression of an Attitude to Life\u201d acknowledges the importance of Dilthey\u2019s notion of \u201cLebensgefuehl.\u201d Carnap\u2019s analogue for Dilthey\u2019s \u201cWeltanschauung\u201d is \u201cWeltauffassung.\u201d Carnap also incorporated a more or less Diltheyan conception of the human sciences in his Der logische Aufbau der Welt of 1928. Carnap refers to Dilthey\u2019s Introduction to the Human Sciences, but replaces its language of \u201cfacts of consciousness\u201d with that of \u201celementary experiences.\u201d He does not refer to Dilthey\u2019s last main work Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften, but he did read Hans Freyer\u2019s Theorie des objektiven Geistes, a work heavily influenced by Dilthey\u2019s Aufbau and its reinterpretation of objective spirit as the medium of intersubjective communication. Carnap writes in his own Aufbau:\n\nonly the more recent history of philosophy (since Dilthey) has called attention to the methodological and object-theoretical distinctness of the domain of the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). (Carnap 1928: 23)\n\nCarnap acknowledges the independent nature of spiritual (geistigen) or intersubjective objects such as political states and social customs. They differ from psychical and physical objects in that they can \u201csurvive\u201d even as the original subjects that generated them \u201cperish and other subjects take their place\u201d (Carnap 1928: 23). It is not clear why Dilthey\u2019s reflective analysis of the distinctive methods of the various sciences and his empirical approach to lived experience did not earn him more serious consideration by the Vienna Circle as a whole and other analytically oriented philosophers. But what is evident is that his theory of understanding (Verstehen) came to be widely misinterpreted as a kind of empathy. Although Dilthey had sharply differentiated between understanding as a judgmental process and empathy as a mere feeling, Carnap suggested that the understanding of others is an intuitive act that involves a measure of empathy, but which can be cognitively vetted in part through the analysis of objective manifestations ranging from gestures, linguistic expressions to practical actions (Carnap 1928: 55, 143). This suggestion by Carnap may have negatively influenced subsequent discussions of Dilthey\u2019s theory of Verstehen by analytic philosophers, leading Theodor Abel, Ernest Nagel, and Arthur Danto to go even further by reducing it to \u201cempathic identification.\u201d Later Danto recognized that this is not the case and acknowledged that \u201cVerstehen is a very brilliant notion, utterly misconceived heretofore by crass philosophical critics, myself included\u201d (Danto 1970: 215). Verstehen is not some immediate projection of ourselves into others, but stands for a deliberate process that finds the proper context to relate others and their objectifications to what is already familiar to us.

He managed his publications in a way that should strike the contemporary reader as familiar. He would present new ideas and lines of inquiry first in exploratory journal articles (many of them published in Logos, the journal he founded in Freiburg) and subsequently he would incorporate them in larger publications, often including previously published materials. Following a common trend in his time, he kept working at his two major books, The Object of Knowledge (first published in 1892) and The Limits of Concept-Formation in Natural Science (first published in 1902), for his entire life. Instead of writing new books he would rewrite entire chapters and add new sections to his two magna opera, thereby addressing criticism and sometimes even changing significantly his previous views. So, for instance, The Object of Knowledge grew from the 91 pages of the first edition to the 460 pages of the sixth edition in 1928. This style of writing makes the development of his thought particularly perspicuous. However, in spite of his constant revisions and additions, the fundamental principles of Rickert\u2019s philosophy remained constant throughout his career. In keeping with his systematic understanding of philosophy (see below), his approach to new problems was geared towards connecting them to old problems, and his way of handling criticism was often characterized by an effort to reformulate his opponent\u2019s views so as to make them compatible with his own.\n\nRickert had a long and successful academic career. He received several awards and honorary degrees. He taught and in some cases supervised important German thinkers of the next generation, such as Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976), Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) and Walter Benjamin (1892\u20131940). He had close intellectual exchanges with leading figures of his time, including Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911), Georg Simmel (1858\u20131918), Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938), Max Weber (1864\u20131920) and Karl Jaspers (1883\u20131969). Although very few of his writings are available in English, in recent years there has been a growing interest in Rickert\u2019s work, both to the extent that it influenced other philosophers and as a significant contribution to the discipline in its own right.\n\nHeinrich Rickert was born in Gda\u0144sk (then Danzig, in Prussia) on May 25 th 1863. His father Heinrich Rickert Sr. (1833\u20131902) was a politician and editor in Berlin. Heinrich Sr. was a liberal democrat particularly invested in the cause of the German Jews. In 1890 Heinrich Sr. founded the Society Against Anti-Semitism in Berlin (Zijderveld 2006, 9). This is an interesting fact about Rickert Jr.\u2019s background, considering that he eventually worked to support the appointment of philosophers of Jewish descent, such as Edmund Husserl and Georg Simmel, who were not under the protective wing of Hermann Cohen, the head of the Marburg School of Neo-Kantianism (see below) and a very influential Jewish thinker.\n\nRickert is considered the head of the so-called Southwestern or Baden school of Neo-Kantianism, whose exponents worked in the philosophy departments at Freiburg and Heidelberg, both in the region of Baden in southwestern Germany. The Southwestern school stands in contrast to the so-called Marburg school, spearheaded by Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) and continued by Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) and Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). (For an overview of the two schools see Crowell 1999.)\n\nIn spite of their fierce opposition, the two schools present elements of similarity alongside the numerous elements of difference. These have been recently debated among Neo-Kantianism scholars (Krijnen 2001, 77\u201393; Krijnen/Noras 2012). One indisputably common element between the two schools is the preoccupation with the problem of validity, or Geltung, which is arguably the systematic core of Neo-Kantianism in general (Krijnen 2001, 84). Philosophy for the Neo-Kantians is concerned with the systematic elucidation of the a priori principles that allow for valid thinking in various spheres of knowledge. In keeping with Kant\u2019s first Critique, valid thinking is not merely logically consistent thinking. Valid thinking requires, over and above the adherence to the laws of formal logic, thinking in accordance with the a priori principles governing the intelligibility of a given area of reality. These will be, for instance, the principles of causality, substantiality etc. in the sphere of physical nature and principles such as good and evil, responsibility, freedom, etc. in the sphere of ethics. It is the task of philosophy to identify these a priori principles in all the different spheres of culture, including politics, biology, art, history, etc. Helmuth Plessner captures metaphorically the spirit of Neo-Kantianism when he characterizes the Neo-Kantians as \u201cbotanists in the garden of the a priori\u201d (Plessner 1974, 185).\n\nIn their attempt to clarify the way in which we should think of such principles, both the Southwestern and the Marburg Neo-Kantians reject any kind of psychological reading, which dominated among early 19th Century interpretations of Kant. The a priori principles of valid thinking are not mere facts about human psychology; they do not describe merely how our mind happens to function. Their validity is objective, that is, it is part of the formal structure of the objects of investigation and not merely an extrinsic mental scheme that exemplars of the species homo sapiens contingently apply to them.\n\nMoreover, both schools were rather unenthusiastic about the label \u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019. Their goal was not to go \u201cback to Kant\u201d, as Otto Liebmann (1840\u20131912) famously urged philosophers to do in his Kant und die Epigonen (Liebmann 1865), but, rather, to move forward beyond Kant building on his original views. Windelband, Rickert\u2019s mentor and the forefather of Southwestern Neo-Kantianism, pronounced: \u201cTo understand Kant means to move beyond him\u201d (Windelband 1915, IV). Likewise, the Marburg school leader Cohen pointed out: \u201cFrom the very beginning I was concerned with developing Kant\u2019s system further\u201d (Cohen 1902, VII).\n\nThe two schools, however, diverge significantly in their interpretation of Kant. While the Marburg school was predominantly interested in the Critique of Pure Reason (Cohen 1885) and considered it to be an essay in the philosophical foundation of Newtonian science (a reading that is still prominent among contemporary Kant scholars, such as Friedmann 1992), Rickert and the Southwesterners emphasized the importance of reading Kant as a whole and considered the centerpiece of his philosophical program to be the system of the faculties outlined in the introduction to the Critique of Judgment (Rickert 1924b, 167). For Rickert, in particular, already in Kant\u2019s first Critique \u201cthe focal point [\u2026] is not in the transcendental aesthetic and analytic but rather in the dialectic, and this means that the main problem of this work is not a theory of the experiential sciences (Erfahrungswissenschaften). Rather, it revolves around the old, ever-recurring problems of metaphysics. The work on these problems becomes the foundation for an encompassing theory of worldview culminating in the treatment of issues in the philosophy of religion. The theory of mathematics and physics is merely preparatory for the treatment of these issues\u201d (Rickert 1924b, 153). Rickert\u2019s Kant is primarily a philosopher of human culture at large, interested in questions about the meaning and value of our life in the world, whereas Cohen\u2019s Kant is primarily (albeit not exclusively) a philosopher of the natural sciences. Incidentally, the largely ignored influence of Rickert\u2019s Kant-interpretation is still vivid in Heidegger\u2019s acclaimed book Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics (Heidegger 1997).\n\nFrom these diverging interpretations of Kant flows another fundamental theoretical difference between the two schools. This difference has been effectively phrased by Rickert\u2019s student, Emil Lask in terms of \u201cpan-logism\u201d, attributed to the Marburg Neo-Kantians, versus the \u201cpan-archy of logos\u201d, attributed to the Southwestern Neo-Kantians (Lask 1923, 133; Crowell 2010). If we take the distinction between intuition (Anschauung) and concept (Begriff) to be the fundamental paradigm of Kantian transcendentalism, then in Lask\u2019s eyes the Marburg Neo-Kantians are committed to a kind of \u2018pan-logism\u2019 to the extent that they tend to minimize the role of intuition. As is particularly evident, for instance, in Natorp (1911, 26\u201367), for the Marburg Neo-Kantians whatever we might be tempted to consider a pure given or a raw datum of experience can be analyzed into an underlying thought-process, whereby the given is actually constructed according to a conceptually articulable (i.e., logical) pattern. Every alleged pure given (Gegebenes) is actually a task (Aufgegebenes) for conceptual thinking and can be resolved into an underlying thought process governed by logical a priori principles.\n\nBy contrast, Rickert and the Southwestern Neo-Kantians emphasize the ultimate irreducibility of what is given in intuition to conceptual forms. While everything can be grasped by concepts, and therefore no domain of reality and cultural life eludes in principle conceptual mastery (pan-archy), nothing can be grasped exhaustively by concepts, and therefore our rationality has to constantly take into account an irrational residue intrinsic to every conceptual construction. To conceptualize, for Rickert, is to recast the materials delivered immediately by the senses into a conceptual form. In so doing, we necessarily have to be selective, that is, we have to leave out of consideration an overwhelming amount of elements and take up in our conceptuality only those elements that match the criteria originally established for the purpose of solving our theoretical task. To give a simple example, in order to conceptualize, say, linear motion we have to isolate from the overwhelming amount of data stemming from the senses only those features that pertain to the movement of bodies (spatial location, speed, reciprocal position, etc.) and leave out of consideration everything else. This general characterization can serve as a prelude to Rickert\u2019s theory of knowledge, which is the theme of the next section.\n\nFor us, epistemology has become a matter of good conscience, and we will not be prepared to listen to anyone who fails to justify his ideas on this basis. (Rickert 1986, 21)\n\nFor Rickert epistemology or Erkenntnistheorie (\u2018theory of knowledge\u2019) has to be the point of departure and the systematic foundation of philosophy as a whole. He often uses interchangeably the words \u201clogic\u201d (Logik), \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d (Erkenntnistheorie), \u201cmethodology\u201d (Methodologie), \u201ctheory of truth\u201d (Wahrheitslehre) and \u201ctheory of science\u201d (Wissenschaftslehre). (See for instance Rickert 1986, 19; Rickert 1909, 170.) This is because ultimately all these phrases refer to one and the same problem, i.e., the problem of the validity of thought and the principles on which valid thought rests. Erkenntnistheorie, therefore, is his preferred phrase because it makes this fundamental problem most explicit.\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of knowledge is designed to answer the following question: \u201cwhat is the subject-independent yardstick of knowledge? In other words, through what does knowledge receive its objectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 1) Or, following the title of his major work in the theory of knowledge, what is the object of knowledge? In asking this question Rickert is explicitly setting up a transcendental argument that can be summarized as follow: given that (1) there is knowledge and that (2) knowledge as true thought can be contrasted to mere thought in that it grasps some thought-independent object, how are we to think this thought-independent object? (Rickert 1909, 170) Therefore Rickert rejects the idea that the theory of knowledge should somehow respond to skepticism (Rickert 1921a, 7; Rickert 1909, 174). To the extent that skepticism negates the very possibility of knowledge it cannot be meaningfully addressed in a theory that sets out to determine precisely what knowledge is. Nonetheless Rickert believes that a modified version of skeptical doubt, which he compares to Husserl\u2019s epoch\u00e9 (Rickert 1921a, 12), is beneficial to the theory of knowledge. The theory of knowledge cannot begin without some presuppositions, in particular, that there are true thoughts in which a subject successfully grasps an object. \u201cHowever, the theory of knowledge ought to be \u2018presuppositionless\u2019 in the sense that it ought to limit as much as possible the presuppositions upon which the objectivity of knowledge rests\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 12). It is through the exercise of doubt that we get to raise the key question as to whether we necessarily have to posit a transcendent reality existing independently of consciousness as the source of validation for knowledge. The pursuit of the object of knowledge, then, leads straight to the problem of transcendence and its relation to the knowing subject. Note that Rickert is not questioning one of the inescapable assumptions of any theory of knowledge, namely, that there has to be some subject-independent yardstick or criterion that validates knowledge. He is questioning whether this subject-independent criterion has to be understood as a transcendent reality, for instance, a world of mind-independent and presumably physical things in themselves. His conclusion will be precisely that this transcendent criterion cannot be meaningfully conceived of as a reality and that only values can be considered genuinely transcendent.\n\nRickert argues that we can tackle the problem of the theory of knowledge in two ways: \u201cOne can begin first with an analysis of the real act of knowledge as a psychic process and then, from there, move progressively to determine the transcendent object. Secondly, one can attempt to reach as quickly as possible the sphere of the transcendent object and deal with it in a purely \u2018logical\u2019 fashion without considering the psychic act of knowing\u201d (Rickert 1909, 174). He labels these two approaches the \u201ctranscendental-psychological\u201d (or subjective) and the \u201ctranscendental-logical\u201d (or objective) ways (Rickert 1909, 174). While in the first editions of The Object of Knowledge Rickert privileged the transcendental-psychological way, in the early 1900s he introduced the transcendental-logical way and incorporated it into later editions of the book, arguing that the two ways should be considered complementary.\n\nThe most important move at the beginning of the subjective way is to determine the notions of subject and object that the theory of knowledge can legitimately operate with, and, in particular to characterize \u201cthe epistemological subject\u201d (das erkenntnistheoretische Subjekt) (Rickert 1921a, 41). Rickert examines three different subject/object dichotomies. (1) We can define the object in spatial terms as what is out there in the world. This is what the expression \u2018external world\u2019 seems to refer to. Correspondingly, the subject, too, will be defined in spatial terms as the animated body, for which there are spatial surroundings populated by objects. The first dichotomy construes subject and object as \u201ctwo bodies\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 14) facing each other in physical space. (2) We can construe a second dichotomy, in which we take our body, too, to be an object like other objects and consider \u2018subject\u2019 to refer exclusively to consciousness. \u201cIn this second case my consciousness and its content are the subject, and therefore the object is everything that is not my content of consciousness or my consciousness itself\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 15). This second dichotomy captures the traditional distinction between immanence and transcendence. (3) A third dichotomy ensues from a further distinction that we can carry out within the sphere of immanence, that is, the distinction between the ego and its representations, or between any content of consciousness and consciousness itself. In this third case representations, perceptions, feelings, emotions etc. would be the object and the subject would be the ego standing over against them.\n\nBased on these dichotomies, it seems that the problem of transcendence and its possible denial only pertains to (2). It would not make sense to question the transcendence of the object if by object we mean what occupies the spatial surroundings of a psychophysical human subject and, similarly, it would not make sense to deny the transcendence of our representations, perceptions, emotions etc. from the point of view of the pure ego-subject undergoing such representations, perceptions, emotions, etc. Following the subjective way, we should then set out to determine whether we necessarily have to posit the existence of transcendent objects independent from the contents of our consciousness. We should, it seems, assume what the positivists have called \u201cthe standpoint of immanence\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 21) and see if there is some rationally justifiable way to infer our way out of it.\n\nThis conception however, is misleading and if we took it as our point of departure it would put the whole enterprise of the theory of knowledge in jeopardy. Who or what is the subject, for which the problem of transcendence can be meaningfully posed? Rickert indicates that the three concepts of subject considered above ought to be seen in their mutual relations. If we begin with the psychophysical subject in (1), we can obtain the notion of subject in (2) by way of a progressive \u2018objectification\u2019 of the body (Rickert 1921a, 35). I can progressively consider each part of my body as itself an \u2018object\u2019 or content of my consciousness and once the whole body has been \u2018purged out\u2019 the result will be a purely psychic subject, which Rickert defines as \u201cthe limit concept (Grenzbegriff) of the series, in which the physical component in the subject becomes progressively smaller\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 36). In a similar way, we can continue the process of \u2018de-objectification\u2019 of the subject and consider each and every mental state as itself an object for an absolutely non-objective and non-objectifiable ego. In this way we reach the authentic epistemological subject, the identical \u201csubject-factor\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 42) that provides the form \u2018subjectivity\u2019 to every possible content of consciousness. Following Kant\u2019s terminology Rickert designates the epistemological subject \u201cconsciousness in general\u201d, that is, a \u201cnameless, generic, impersonal consciousness\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 42). This consciousness in general has to be distinguished sharply not only from the individual psychophysical human subject but also from the individual psychic subject with its empirical mental states.\n\nRickert insists: \u201cThe question regarding immanence or transcendence only makes epistemological sense with respect to the epistemological subject or consciousness in general\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 43). From this perspective, \u201cto be immanent means nothing but to carry the form of being-conscious (Bewu\u00dftheit) and to be transcendent means to really exist without such form\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 48). Given these definitions, Rickert contends that while there are many good reasons to reject psychological idealism, if one holds fast to consciousness in general there is no good reason to posit the existence of a transcendent reality beyond the sphere encompassed by the epistemological subject. His theory of knowledge is therefore committed to transcendental idealism. In order to defend this point Rickert examines three types of arguments that have been traditionally played out against transcendental idealism as defenses of the necessity to posit a transcendent reality: (1) transcendence as the unexperienced cause of conscious experiences (Rickert 1921a, 62\u201373); (2) transcendence as necessary in order to fill the gaps in our conscious experiences (Rickert 1921a, 74\u201384); (3) transcendence as the objective counterpart of our will, that is, as the correlate of the experience of a resistance and constraint to our willful actions (Rickert 1921a, 84\u201393). All these arguments, however, only show that we cannot reduce reality to psychic existence. In other words, they are good arguments only against a psychological idealism \u00e0 la Berkeley according to which reality would coincide with our empirical mental states. From the point of view of the epistemological subject, however, both psychic and physical occurrences are objects whose reality is encompassed by the form \u2018consciousness in general\u2019. A transcendental idealist, then, emphatically agrees that there is an extra-mental physical reality causing the occurrence of mental states in empirical subjects. To the extent that they are experienced or experienceable, however, both extra-mental (physical things) and intra-mental realities (mental states) have to be seen as content of consciousness, namely, of transcendental consciousness in general. It is important to remember that by \u2018consciousness in general\u2019 Rickert means no individual psychic subject but the general form of subjective accessibility. In other words, to say that all reality is a content of consciousness does not mean that all reality is psychic. It means that all reality (both psychic and physical) is encompassed by a general form of subjectivity, which makes it available for theoretical determination. Commenting on his own brand of transcendental idealism, Rickert states: \u201cour standpoint is the true realism\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 104), in that it refuses to counterpose an immanent psychic reality to an inaccessible transcendent reality to be posited via inferential reasoning. Rickert insists that transcendental idealism considers real precisely the reality that we encounter in everyday life through sensory experience, consisting of immediately aware psychic and physical occurrences. What it rejects is that this reality can be meaningfully construed as transcendent vis-\u00e0-vis consciousness in general.\n\nThe reason why one might be prone to reject transcendental idealism is a wrong conception of what knowledge really is all about. Rickert labels this conception the copy-theory or pictorial theory (Abbildtheorie) of knowledge. According to this conception, \u201cthe act of knowing has to depict (abbilden) a reality independent from its activity of representing (vorstellen)\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 119). The rejection of a pictorial theory of cognition and the ensuing intuitionism (according to which to know is merely to intuit some mind-independent real or noetic object), remains a constant in Rickert\u2019s philosophy (see Rickert 1934a; Staiti 2013a). It also connects Rickert with other Neo-Kantians, including Natorp and Cassirer in Marburg, who likewise reject the notion that knowledge is a merely picturing representation of the object (see Holzey 2010; Kubalica 2013).\n\nIn order to expose the untenable notions in the pictorial theory of knowledge Rickert introduces a distinction between the form and the content of cognition. While nothing is wrong with the idea that in order to have knowledge we have to take up in some representations some content, what distinguishes knowledge from other kinds of representation must be sought in its form. If I say of a piece of paper that it is white, then certainly \u201cmy representation reproduces what is real with respect to the white, and this is why the statement is true\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 125). However, this is not all. \u201cIn the statement at issue (this piece of paper is white), in fact, not only is the being-white asserted alongside the being-white, but rather, the white as \u2018property\u2019 is also attributed to a \u2018thing\u2019, and, in so being, the being-white is determined more specifically. Thing and property, however, are, as much as being and reality, concepts that do not belong in the content of knowledge. One has to know beforehand what it means epistemologically that a \u2018thing\u2019 has a \u2018property\u2019 and what the objectivity of this piece of knowledge rests upon in order to be able to say: \u2018the thought: this piece of paper is white grasps what is real through pictorial representations\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 125\u2013126; Rickert 1909, 177). The theorist of knowledge cannot overlook the gulf that exists between the pre-discursive perceptual experience of seeing a white piece of paper and the articulation of the true judgment \u2018this piece of paper is white\u2019. The judgment does not merely mirror or depict perceptual reality. Rather, the judgment transforms and reshapes the perceptual material delivered by the senses by way casting it into a new form, whose legitimacy does not rest in the faithful depiction of the perceptual scene but in the logical validity of such forms. The problem of the pictorial theory of cognition is that it \u201cignores the form\u201d (Rickert 1909, 178).\n\nThese considerations lead to one of the key theses in Rickert\u2019s theory of knowledge: \u201cThe fundamental problem of the theory of knowledge is the question regarding the yardstick or the object of judging (Rickert 1921a, 131\u2013132). The epistemological subject is not merely a representational subject, but rather a judging subject. Judgment is for Rickert the place where the standpoint of immanence is necessarily broken and the genuine meaning of transcendence becomes manifest. In his analysis of judgment Rickert draws a sharp distinction between the psychological act of judging and the content (Gehalt) of a judgment, which parallels Husserl\u2019s treatment of the same issue in Logical Investigations (Husserl 1973). While the act of judging, say, that 2 + 2 = 4 is a psychic occurrence unfolding in time and differing for each empirical subject making this judgment, the objective content grasped by this act, the true relation 2 + 2 = 4 is timelessly valid and it is one over and against the many psychic acts directed towards it. Moreover, if by real we mean either a psychic or a physical entity, then the content of the judgment 2 + 2 = 4 has to be deemed \u201cunreal\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 145). Taking notice of the objective content of an act and reflecting back on the psychological act of judging that intends such content we also have to highlight a third component of a judgment, which Rickert labels \u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the act (Rickert 1921a, 145), i.e. that which orients the act towards the judged content. As one commentator puts it: \u201cthe immanent sense of the judgment stands in an intermediate position between the real psychic act and the unreal logical content\u201d (Oliva 2006, 97). It is the function (Leistung) performed by the psychic act seen purely and exclusively in its functionality of connecting psychological subjectivity and logical objectivity. Determining what kind of immanent function characterizes judgments and how this function sets them apart from other kinds of psychic occurrences is Rickert\u2019s next step.\n\nIn order to grasp the epistemological essence of judgment and its relation to the fundamental epistemological problem of transcendence we have to describe its difference from a mere representation or string of representations. The best way to characterize the specific essence of judgment is by \u201cconsidering the judgment the answer to a question\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 153). Rickert thus identifies the essence of judgment is thus in the function of \u201caffirmation or negation\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 154), thereby following a trend in logic that dates back to Brentano (see Brentano 1995, 194\u2013234). If we consider exclusively the representational content, the judgment, \u201cthis paper is white\u201d, and the question, \u201cis this paper white?\u201d do not differ in the slightest. The same representational elements are there in a meaningful connection. The genuine performance of judgment, for Rickert, is all contained in the \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 that we could answer to the question, thereby taking a stance with regards to the represented content. In fact, what distinguishes judgment from all sorts of representations is the moment of \u2018stance-taking\u2019 (Stellungnehmen) expressed by the words \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Judging should then be considered a \u201cpractical comportment (Verhalten)\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 165), in which something is acknowledged as true or rejected as false. In this regard, judging has to be considered an \u201cact of valuing\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 165). What is it, however, that elicits from the epistemological subject an act of stance-taking? Rickert explains: \u201cWith our act of affirming we can only orient ourselves toward requirements (Forderungen), only vis-\u00e0-vis a requirement can we comport ourselves in an endorsing fashion. In this way we have obtained the broadest concept for the object of knowledge. What is known, that is, what is affirmed or acknowledged in the act of judgment must be located in the sphere of the \u2018ought\u2019 (Sollen)\u201d (Rickert 1909, 184). This is the kind of transcendence that Rickert set out to determine at the beginning. The object of knowledge has to be conceived as transcendent, however, not as a transcendent reality mirrored by a psychological act of representation but as a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d (Rickert 1909, 187). This prompts the theoretically oriented subject to affirm the transcendent theoretical value of truth in the necessary connection existing between the form and the content expressed in a true judgment.\n\nExamining retrospectively the results of this first subjective path of the theory of knowledge Rickert points out a number of shortcomings. It seems that if we begin with an analysis of the act of judging, we can only reach the transcendent object of knowledge by way of a \u201cpetitio principii\u201d (Rickert 1909, 190). If we take our cues from the psychologically perceived \u201cfeeling of a requirement\u201d (Forderungsgef\u00fchl) and from the evidence of the judged content as the \u201cimmanent indicator of the transcendent\u201d (Rickert 1909, 189), we have no sufficient reason to posit a transcendent object of knowledge unless we somehow already presupposed it in the very analysis of this feeling and its psychological connotations. It seems that the only conclusion we could legitimately draw without falling into circular reasoning is that when a certain compelling feeling of evidence occurs, we feel the urge to affirm the truth of a certain connection between a form and a content. But this does not really amount to proving that the internally felt sense of ought is connected to a transcendent ought. Rickert considers petitio principii inherent in the subjective path to be problematic but nonetheless a useful starting point, in that it allows us to analyze the meaning of certain fundamental concepts of the theory of knowledge such as transcendence, ought, stance-taking and recognition. However, in order to have a complete theory of knowledge, an objective or transcendental-logical path has to be taken.\n\nActs of judgments are not the only kinds of realities to which truth or falsehood attach. Propositions can also be true or false and their meanings can be taken as a new point of departure for the sake of determining the transcendent object of knowledge avoiding a petitio principii (Rickert 1909, 197). The meaning of a proposition can be taken objectively and independently of empirical acts of thought. In this case, we can say of the proposition itself that is either true or false, without thereby referring to the feeling of evidence or necessity perceived by the subject of judgment. In propositional logic we are accustomed to assign a truth-value to a given proposition and in so doing we think of the truth-value as pertaining to the proposition itself and not to the immanent psychological act that affirms the proposition\u2019s truth. This is the advantage of the objective path over the subjective path: \u201cThe subjective path led us to the object as a requirement (Forderung) and this requirement was then interpreted as a transcendent ought. The objective path leads us directly to a transcendent value, and this concept yields the form of the object in its purity for the first time. Value and ought do not coincide. The ought is not the pure value. It represents the unreal as a command and relates it to a subject from which it demands obedience, recognition and submission. This is a secondary and even misleading addition. Only the value which rests upon itself and holds valid as value [\u2026] is the transcendent object\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 242).\n\nRickert considers the concept of transcendent value (as pure validity independent of subjective acts of valuing) the culmination of his theory of knowledge. It is ultimately the theoretical value of truth, the unreal transcendent object, that is \u2018known\u2019 or grasped in every act of true judgment. However, this does not imply a complete rejection or neglect of the valuing subjectivity. Rickert maintains that once the theory of knowledge has established the absolute transcendence of values and their independence from empirical acts of valuing, it is then possible to relate values back to subjectivity. As we know, the immanent sense of acts (Aktsinn) is the unreal component of acts that mediates between the empirical sphere of psyche and the unreal sphere of values. Subjectivity is then interpreted as the \u2018middle\u2019 factor capable of mediating between reality and value, and thereby it receives its philosophical \u2018dignification\u2019. It is fair to say that Rickert\u2019s work in all other fields of philosophy and in particular in the theory of the empirical sciences is an attempt to reconstruct the meaning of various spheres of reality and knowledge from his fundamental insight into the transcendence of values. See also the\n\nSupplement on Rickert\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nEmpirical reality becomes nature when we conceive it with reference to the general. It becomes history when we conceive it with reference to the distinctive and the individual. (Rickert 1986, 54)\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of science is primarily geared towards a philosophical elucidation of the natural and the historical sciences. This is intended to provide a defense of the sui generis scientificity of the historical sciences against the threat of positivism and naturalism. Rickert\u2019s work on this issue builds upon Windelband\u2019s influential paper History and Natural Science (Windelband 1980, 169\u2013185). While Rickert criticizes some terminological and argumentative limits of his teacher\u2019s essay, the bulk of his lengthy volume, The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science: An Introduction to the Historical Sciences (Rickert 1986), is consistent with the tenets of Windelband\u2019s position.\n\nWindelband pointed out that the customary distinction of the empirical sciences into natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften (that is, literally spiritual or mental sciences and used in German to indicate the humanities and the social sciences) is deeply misleading (Windelband 1980, 173). This is because it seems to suggest that these two groups of sciences differ primarily with respect to their subject matter, that is, in the first case \u2018nature\u2019 and in the second case \u2018mind\u2019. However, there are at least two problems with this classification: (1) a significant number of disciplines commonly considered Geisteswissenschaften have little or nothing to do with the study of the human mind. Take, for instance, art history, political economics or archeology. None of these disciplines seems to have mental processes and states as their subject matter. (2) According to this classification psychology should be considered a Geisteswissenschaft and presumably even the most fundamental of all Geisteswissenschaften in that it studies the human mind in the most direct and rigorous fashion. Indeed, in late nineteenth century Germany there was a widely spread expectation that progress in psychology should have led to significant reforms in all other humanistic fields of research. This expectation, however, clashes with the fact that psychology\u2019s method is much more similar to that of physics, chemistry, and biology than with that of literary studies or musicology. Psychology, too, seeks to determine its subject matter in terms of general laws and works with the aid of mathematical models and experiments. Considering these anomalies Windelband\u2019s proposal is to drop content-related distinctions altogether and rely exclusively on a methodological distinction between \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cidiographic\u201d sciences (Windelband 1980, 175). One group of sciences works by way of positing general laws and understanding its objects as examples of such general laws (nomo-thetic). Another group of sciences aims at producing illuminating descriptions of irreducibly individual and unrepeatable occurrences (idiographic). Most importantly, \u201cthe same subjects can be the object of both a nomothetic and an idiographic investigation\u201d (Windelband 1980, 175). From this purely methodological point of view, sciences like psychology, physics, chemistry, and biology all belong in the same group as nomothetic, whereas sciences like history, art history, and musicology are to be considered idiographic. This distinction is meant to reorganize the universe of knowledge and to avoid unhelpful encroachments of empirical psychology on the work of humanistic disciplines, whose theoretical aims are fundamentally alien to nomothetic inquiry.\n\nRickert enhances and corrects Windelband\u2019s perspective in two ways: (1) He revises his terminology and rejects the phrase \u2018idiographic\u2019, which seems to suggest a purely pictorial or reproductive procedure. This would not qualify as knowledge by Rickert\u2019s epistemological standards (see Zijderveld 2006, 246\u2013255; Ferrari 1998). (2) He insists on the necessity of beginning a reflection on the classification of the sciences with a purely methodological criterion, but only to articulate subsequently a more adequate content-related distinction to replace the customary Naturwissenschaft/Geisteswissenschaft pair (Rickert 1962, 11).\n\nRickert defines the task of a logical/methodological investigation of the sciences in the following terms: \u201cThe logical distinctiveness of an empirical science is to be understood in terms of the relationship the content of its concepts bears to empirical reality in its unique and distinctive form\u201d (Rickert 1986, 114). In other words, the task of a theory of science is to determine how the science under scrutiny forms its concepts and in so doing overcomes the unsurveyable, \u201cimmeasurable manifold\u201d (Rickert 1962, 32) of empirical reality as it is given in intuition. Concept formation for Rickert indicates \u201cthe conclusion of an investigation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 27), that is the fulfillment of the scientific task posed at the beginning of that investigation. In keeping with his general rejection of a pictorial theory of knowledge (see above), Rickert rejects the view that the empirical sciences would simply have to depict (abbilden) reality as it is in itself. Rather, the task of the empirical sciences is to re-mold (umbilden) immediately given reality and form concepts, in which only a small fraction of the original given is taken up. The criteria for such selections and re-molding activities culminating in the formation of a scientific concept are the specific preoccupation of the philosophy of science.\n\nAs for the natural sciences, Rickert contends that Kant already provided a satisfactory definition of their logical structure. In the Prolegomena Kant stated: \u201cNature is the existence of things, insofar as [sofern] that existence is determined according to universal laws\u201d (Kant 2002, 89; Rickert 1962, 5). Following Kant, Rickert defines the natural sciences as generalizing (Rickert 1986, 34; Rickert 1962, 46), that is, they form their concepts by way of moving away from the individual, unrepeatable occurrences encountered in experience. As Windelband already saw, the natural sciences view individual occurrences as mere examples of general laws. In this way, individuality \u201cfixes the limits of natural scientific concept formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 40) and calls forth its logical complement: \u201cindividualizing concept-formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 62) as the method defining the historical sciences. The logical distinction between the sciences, then, has to be between the generalizing natural sciences and the individualizing historical sciences. In other words, while the natural sciences build their concepts by way of disregarding what is individual, the historical sciences build their concepts in order to grasp precisely what is individual.\n\nHow are we to understand, then, historical individuality? Rickert\u2019s definition unfolds in three stages (Rickert 1986, 98). (1) In the broadest sense, the individual is every single empirical reality in its uniqueness and distinctiveness. This, however, is not yet historically relevant individuality. (2) In a more specific and etymological sense, a historical individual is what \u201cshould not be divided\u201d (Rickert 1986, 85), that is, it is an individual whose \u201cuniqueness is related to a value\u201d (Rickert 1986, 84). Rickert suggests to compare a lump of coal and the famous Koh-i-noor diamond. While the lump of coal can be split at any time without any significant loss, the Koh-i-noor ought not be spilt because it is a good, that is, a bit of reality related to a value and valued by any subject capable of carrying out valuations. (3) The historical individual as the object of the historical sciences has to be a good related to generally acknowledged values as opposed to merely personal values. In other words, while a certain item can be valuable to me as an individual (for instance, because a beloved person gave it to me), this is not enough to make it an object of historical interest. The Koh-i-noor, on the contrary, has a more than merely individual historical relevance because it is inextricably related to the historical vicissitudes of India and British colonialism.\n\nThe notions of value and value-relatedness are crucial to determine Rickert\u2019s material or content-related (inhaltlich) criterion for the demarcation of the sciences. In this respect we have to distinguish between the value-free sphere of nature and the value-related sphere of culture (Rickert 1962, 21). Accordingly, the material distinction that has to replace the customary distinction between natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften is the distinction between the sciences of nature (value-free objects) and the sciences of culture (value-related objects). It is the reference to objectively acknowledged cultural values that \u2018preserves\u2019 the individuality of empirical objects and makes them relevant to historical inquiry.\n\nIn the context of this distinction Rickert insists on the important distinction between Wertung, or valuation, and Wertbeziehung, or the act of relating something to a value. The two notions stand in sharp opposition. While human subjects in their practical lives constantly engage in valuations resulting in positive or negative value-judgments, the historical scientist must abstain from every act of valuation and limit herself to the ascertainment of objective value-relations in the cultural materials under scrutiny. \u201cAccordingly, if it is to express the character of history as a theoretical science, the procedure that we speak of as oriented to values is to be most sharply separated from one that posits values. This means that history treats values only in so far as they are actually accepted by subjects so that certain objects are actually denoted as goods. Thus, even if history deals with values, it is not a science that posits values\u201d (Rickert 1962, 89). Rickert gives the following example to illustrate this distinction: \u201cWe can regard the personality of Luther as either a good thing or a bad thing. In other words, we can believe that it was a stroke of luck for the cultural development of Germany or that it brought misfortune. On this point, the opinions of historians will probably always be in disagreement. But no one who knows the facts will doubt that Luther had some sort of significance with reference to generally acknowledged values, and it can never occur to a historian to claim that Luther\u2019s personality is historically unimportant\u201d (Rickert 1986, 93; for a critical response to this view see Oakes 1988, 111\u2013144).\n\nBy contrasting the generalizing method of the natural sciences dealing with value-free objects and the individualizing (i.e., historical) method of the cultural sciences dealing with value-related objects, Rickert does not mean to say that values play no role in the natural sciences or that generalizing procedures and general objects are completely absent form the cultural sciences. On the contrary, he emphasizes that \u201cnatural science is not free of valuations\u201d (Rickert 1986, 93). In a way that anticipates much late twentieth century philosophy of science (see for instance Laudan 1985; Lacey 1999; Allchin 1999) Rickert insists that natural science and, for that matter, science in general obeys \u201clogical values to which the investigator is committed, and which are implicitly presupposed in all scientific concept formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 94). What remains \u2018value-free\u2019 is the material that the natural sciences investigate. To stay with the above example, for a mineralogist studying diamonds the Koh-i-noor will be merely an instance of some general law of crystallization as much as any other diamond. It is not considered in its relation to culturally acknowledged values. On the other hand, the historical sciences do not completely dispense with elements of generality. Rickert identifies four senses in which \u2018the general\u2019 is at play in historical research. \u201cFirst, the elements of all scientific concepts are general\u201d (Rickert 1986, 115). This means that, for example, in order to form the concept \u2018French Revolution\u2019 we have to use general concepts such as \u2018French\u2019 and \u2018revolution\u2019. However, these two general concepts are compounded in order to capture a unique historical event. In a second sense, as we saw, history has to take into account the relation of events and objects to general values. However, the fact that a certain object has a reference to a general value (e.g. the French Revolution bears a reference to the general value \u2018political freedom\u2019) does not make the concept of that object general. \u201cThird, historical science never regards individuals in isolation, as the generalizing sciences do, but in a general nexus\u201d (Rickert 1986, 115). We cannot understand the individual Robespierre unless we view his actions in the meaningful general context of the French Revolution. Such \u2018nexus\u2019, however, is not itself a general concept but is itself an \u2018individual\u2019, that is, a unique and unrepeatable constellation of events. Fourth, in some cases the historical scientist will deliberately study groups of individuals, say, late-medieval serfs in Holland. In this case single individuals (either people or objects) will be seen as mere examples of dynamics and characteristics pertaining to their group in a way that seems to resemble the generalizing procedure of natural science. However, even in this case the historian is not interested in the \u2018general nature\u2019 of human groups but in the individuality of the group at issue.\n\nRickert engaged in a lifelong controversy with another prominent theorist of the human sciences, Wilhelm Dilthey (on the controversy see Makkreel/Luft 2010 and Makkreel 2010). Dilthey advocated the necessity to maintain a primarily content-related distinction to demarcate different ambits of science and he defended the legitimacy of the phrase Geisteswissenschaft. Dilthey rejected the argument that psychology could not be foundational for the human sciences because of its methodological similarity to the natural sciences. He considered the empirical (or, in his language, explanative) psychology of his time to be deeply flawed in that it imitated the methods of the natural sciences without paying attention to the specificity of the mental domain (Dilthey 2010, 119). Psychology, for Dilthey, should be conducted in a descriptive-analytical spirit, starting off from the overall meaningfulness and intelligibility of mental phenomena and working to describe the intricate connections or nexuses of significance characterizing human life (Dilthey 2010, 182). \u201cSuch a psychology will become the foundation of the human sciences, just as mathematics grounds the natural sciences\u201d (Dilthey 2010, 165). This is because, for Dilthey, all the products of culture studied by the human sciences are nothing but \u201cpsychic life that has become objective, [\u2026] the products of active forces of a psychic nature and stable configurations formed from psychic elements and their laws\u201d (Dilthey 2010, 171). For this reason, Dilthey contends that in the human sciences we can only understand, as opposed to explain, (Dilthey 2010, 119) cultural products (poems, artworks, juridical systems, etc.) to the extent that we reactivate the psychic life at their origin and relive (nacherleben) the life-experience that brought them about. If we had theoretical tools provided by a descriptive psychology to orient ourselves in the complexity of psychic objectifications, we would make significant advancements in the human sciences, too.\n\nRickert is willing to grant the \u201cparamount significance of mental beings within the historical material\u201d (Rickert 1986, 123) and the importance of \u201chistorical personalities that valuate\u201d (Rickert 1986, 122) for the cultural sciences. He is also open to the use of Geist, provided that this term is considered synonymous with culture. However, he insists that Dilthey\u2019s emphasis on psychic life and reliving is both systematically and methodologically misleading. First, not all of psychic life is relevant in the cultural sciences. Most psychic manifestations, both those occurring in individuals and those objectified in cultural objects, are completely devoid of historical significance, in that they lack the reference to a general value. Second, even if we had the capacity to relive past experiences in their total intensity and vividness, this would not amount to understanding those experiences and their cultural objectifications. In the historical sciences, too, to know does not mean merely to mirror or depict a real object. Only if the notion of value and the objective value-relatedness of historical individuals (be they physical or psychic) are taken as the systematic point of departure can the subjectivity involved in history be adequately understood. \u201cThe fact that history is a science of mental entities does not determine its logical structure, for mental processes can also be represented in a natural scientific or generalizing fashion. Rather, the converse is true: On the basis of the logical structure of historical science [\u2026] it can be understood why history primarily takes a certain kind of mental life as the object of its investigation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 127).\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of generalizing and individualizing concept formation as the systematically fundamental criterion for the demarcation of science elicited other waves of criticism. Husserl, for example, considered it an oversimplification of the Kantian problem of the transcendental deduction in that Rickert simply takes for granted that the infinite, unsurveyable manifold of immediate experience is amenable to conceptualization (Husserl 2001, 91). However, given his premises it is hard to see why a completely chaotic and heterogeneous immediate experience would nonetheless lend itself to conceptual rationalization. The problem, according to Husserl, is that for Rickert \u201cworld-experience (Welterfahrung) remains an empty word\u201d (Husserl 2001, 100). Moreover, and similarly to Dilthey, Husserl laments the fact that Rickert downplays historically active subjectivity as the source of culture. Like Rickert, Husserl distinguishes between nature and culture in terms of \u201cthe world considered without significance\u201d as opposed to \u201cthe world full of significance\u201d (Husserl 2002, 139), however, he immediately relates back such significance to the operations of \u201cmeaning-bestowing subjectivity, which endows things with spiritual meaning [vergeistigen] through operations of significance [Bedeutungsleistungen]\u201d (Husserl 2002, 140). For this reason, Husserl considers the whole dispute about whether the correct pair of concepts to demarcate the ambits of science should be nature/Geist (Dilthey) or nature/culture (Rickert) \u201ca mere verbal dispute\u201d (Husserl 2002, 140). Another line of criticism of Rickert\u2019s distinction comes from his student, Emil Lask. In his personal notes Lask forcefully asserts that \u201ca purely logical meaning of nature must be absolutely denied\u201d (Lask 1924, 272). Lask argues that in Rickert\u2019s reconstruction natural-scientific generalization and historical individualization are treated as equally legitimate and complementary ways of conceptualizing empirical reality. Against this view Lask contends that the generalizations carried out by the natural sciences presuppose a preliminary \u2018devitalization\u2019 (Ert\u00f6tung) and \u2018quantification\u2019 of reality, in which the dimension of significance and value is put out of play (Lask 1924, 244). In a way that anticipates Husserl\u2019s later treatment of this issue in The Crisis of the European Sciences (Husserl 1970). Lask points out that our original experience of the world is pervaded with value and significance and it is only by way of an abstractive impoverishment of this original experience that the natural sciences create their value-free (and to that extent artificial) field of research. As a matter of fact, however, there is evidence that Rickert was well aware of the quantifying tendency of natural science (see for instance Rickert 1900, 76), although he did not assign to it a central role.\n\nFundamental progress in the cultural sciences with respect to their objectivity, their universality, and their arrangement in a coherent system, is dependent on progress in the development of an objective and systematically articulated concept of culture, i.e., on the approach to a knowledge of value based on a system of valid values. (Rickert 1962, 139\u2013140)\n\nWhile Rickert does not believe that significant progress in the historical sciences of culture can be expected from the development of psychology, he believes that a philosophy of history grounded in an unconditionally valid system of values (Rickert 1924a, 118) would be of paramount importance. If philosophy were able to identify and justify a formal set of values common to all cultures and historical constellations, then the historical sciences could employ such a formal set of values to orient their inquiries. In order to do this, however, philosophy cannot simply rely on empirical generalizations. Given the multiplicity of cultures and the complexity of human history, it would be impossible to adopt a generalizing procedure in order to identify a robust set of values common to all. \u201cRather, it would be appropriate to reflect (completely independently of the multiplicity of the historical material) on that which holds valid by necessity, that is, the formal presupposition of each value-judgment claiming more than individual validity. Only when such timelessly valid formal values are found will it be possible to relate them to the plenitude of empirically detectable values actually developed in history\u201d (Rickert 1924a, 118). Rickert underscores in various places that such system, however, should be understood as completely \u201copen\u201d (Rickert 1913, 297; Rickert 1921b, 348\u2013355; see Bohlken 2002, 124). This means that it is intended to provide merely the \u201cmost encompassing framework in which all meaningful cultural life plays itself out\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 225). The areas of values identified in the system can be filled with the most diverse concrete historical values.\n\nRickert\u2019s first attempt to articulate a timelessly valid system of values can be found in his paper On the System of Values (Rickert 1913). The position developed here was eventually recast and schematized visually in the first (and only) volume of his System of Philosophy (Rickert 1921b). Rickert begins his inquiry by describing different kinds of goods, that is, concrete objects related to values. His intent is to read off the objectively valid values from concrete classes of goods. The human creation of goods related to values follows a general impulse towards \u201ccompletion\u201d (Vollendung), which can be best described as the attainment of a certain goal. Moreover, each realization of values in a good can be understood as the work on a certain \u2018content\u2019, which receives a value-related form. Such content can be interpreted as a whole consisting of parts. Starting from these abstract distinctions, Rickert identifies three domains of goods, that of the \u201cuncompletable (unendlich) totality\u201d, that of \u201cfully completed (voll-endlich) particularity\u201d and that which synthesizes the two in a \u201cfully completed totality\u201d (Rickert 1913, 302). To each of these domains of goods Rickert assigns a temporal dimension, such that the goods of un-ending totality are goods of the future, those of fully completed particularity are goods of the present and those of fully completed totality are goods of eternity. A further overarching distinction, however, cuts across these three domains of goods, thus giving as a result six domains: the distinction between contemplation and activity, whose parallel categories of objects are \u201cthing\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d. After fleshing out this general scheme Rickert fills in the six domains with actual values and the corresponding cultural activities according to the following schema (Rickert 1921b, annex):\n\nGoods: asocial matters (Sachen)\n\n\n\nSubjective Comportment: monistic contemplation\n\n\n\nForm: encompassing Stages of completeness Goods: social persons\n\n\n\nSubjective Comportment: pluralistic activity\n\n\n\nForm: pervading Domain of Logic (1)\n\n\n\nValue: truth\n\nGood: science\n\nSubjective Comportment: judgment\n\nWorldview: intellectualism FIRST STAGE\n\nUn-completable totality\n\nGoods of the future Domain of Ethics (4)\n\n\n\nValue: morality (Sittlichkeit)\n\nGood: community of free people\n\nSubjective Comportment: autonomous action\n\nWorldview: moralism (Moralismus) Domain of Aesthetics (2)\n\n\n\nValue: beauty\n\nGood: art\n\nSubjective Comportment: intuition (anschauen)\n\nWorldview: aestheticism SECOND STAGE\n\nFully completed particularity\n\nGoods of the present Domain of Erotics (5)\n\n\n\nValue: happiness (Gl\u00fcck)\n\nGood: loving community\n\nSubjective Comportment: inclination\u2014devotion (Hingabe)\n\nWorldview: eudaemonism System of Philosophy (8)\n\n\n\nComprehensive theory of worldviews INTERMEDIATE STAGE\n\nImmanent syntheses Love between man and woman (7)\n\n\n\nWorldview: eroticism Domain of Mystics (3)\n\n\n\nValue: impersonal sanctity\n\nGood: the All-One (world-mystery)\n\nSubjective Comportment: solitude (Abgeschiedenheit) (divinization)\n\nWorldview: Mysticism THIRD STAGE\n\nFully completed totality\n\nGoods of eternity\n\n(Transcendent syntheses) Domain of the Philosophy of Religion (6)\n\n\n\nValue: personal sanctity\n\nGood: the world of god (G\u00f6tterwelt)\n\nSubjective comportment: piety\n\nWorldview: Theism\u2014Polytheism\n\nThe following points are distinctive of Rickert\u2019s approach to values as presented in the above table:\n\n(1) Note that Rickert distinguishes the way in which values relate to their materials in the spheres of contemplation and in the sphere of practice. In his language, the value of truth \u2018encompasses\u2019 scientific theories and likewise the value of beauty encompasses works of art. This means that the value is experienced as something essentially \u2018beyond\u2019 the particular theory or artwork at issue. On the contrary, in the sphere of practice values \u2018pervade\u2019 their materials, that is to say they structure them \u2018from within\u2019, as it were.\n\n(2) Rickert prides himself on having \u2018discovered\u2019 and defended the autonomy of the fifth domain of values, which he labels \u2018erotics\u2019 (Rickert 1913, 313\u2013319). Erotics is the sphere of practical life in which subjects cultivate specific values attaching to their relationships to particular people or groups of people. According to Rickert in the philosophical tradition this autonomous domain has been unduly overshadowed by the domain of ethics, which constantly tried to impose its distinctive values on erotics (Rickert 1921b, 406). However, for Rickert our practical life would be unbearable if it were dedicated exclusively to the pursuit of ethical values and the utopian ideal of a community of free subjects (that is, Kant\u2019s kingdom of ends). We need a particular sphere of relationships in which the practical thrust of our social life finds full realization in the present. The values characterizing these spheres, such as family, homeland, religious community, etc. need to be respected and studied as a class of values in its own right.\n\n(3) Rickert assigns an important role to religion in the totality of cultural life (see Crowe 2010). He points out an inevitable tension between the pursuit of goods of totality in domains (1) and (4), which are ultimately unattainable in our earthly life, and the pursuit of goods of particularity in (2) and (5), which are fully attainable but inevitably finite. Religion opens up the space for \u2018transcendent syntheses\u2019, in which this tension is overcome through the pursuit of goods of eternity. These, in Rickert\u2019s view, do justice to both our human desire for infinity and our human need for actually experienced fulfillment. Mysticism thus offers a transcendent synthesis between the sense of fulfillment characterizing aesthetic contemplation and the unending process of scientific theorein via conceptual knowledge. Similarly, the religious devotion to a divinity experienced as \u2018dwelling among us\u2019 (in both polytheistic and monotheistic religions) promises a transcendent synthesis between the values of ethics and those of erotics.\n\n(4) For Rickert, however, the transcendent syntheses promised by religion are prefigured, as it were, in two earthly kinds of syntheses, that is, the love between man and woman in the sphere of practice and the production of a philosophical system oriented towards a comprehensive worldview-theory in the sphere of contemplation. As for the love between man and woman, Rickert\u2019s view rests on the dubious assumption that women are \u201cessentially\u201d more oriented toward the realization of goods of the present, while men are \u201cessentially\u201d more oriented toward the realization of goods of the future (Rickert 1921b, 403). Since no meaningful existence can be devoted exclusively to one type of goods (the goods of the future being ultimately unattainable and the goods of the present being ultimately too narrow), Rickert argues that the \u201cpersonal union\u201d (Rickert 1921b, 402) between man and woman amounts to a mutual completion and a synthesis of the two domains of values. Needless to say, to a contemporary reader this view sounds extremely antiquated and even sexist. However, it has to be interpreted in the context of Rickert\u2019s time. In his eyes, insisting on the mutual completion and irreducibility of the values traditionally associated with masculinity and those traditionally associated with feminineness (Rickert 1921b, 403) was a way to defend the equal value of men and women in the whole of cultural life. Philosophy as a worldview-theory based on the system of values, in turn, can provide a comprehensive picture of the world in which all contemplative and practical activity takes place. To the extent that it strives towards a comprehensive system, however, philosophy tends to exceed the sphere of theoretical goods (Rickert 1921b, 408). Instead of partaking in the indefinitely open work of the specialized sciences philosophy attempts to survey the totality of cultural life and to systematically determine its underlying value-related structure. In each successfully articulated philosophical system we then find a completed cultural good, which differs from the characteristic open-endedness of theories in the specialized sciences. The philosopher thus occupies the middle ground between the scientist moving indefinitely forward in her specialized investigations and the artist striving to produce a complete artwork. Philosophy, then, can then be considered an immanent synthesis between the unending totality characterizing the goods of science and the particularity characterizing the goods of art.\n\nPhilosophy has to be characterized as the scientific activity, which, in the stream of restlessly forward-moving development, endeavors to make a stop and find a resting point. It stands still in order to bring to light the significance for the meaning of life of what has been hitherto achieved. (Rickert 1921b, 410)\n\nRickert\u2019s conception of philosophy is tightly connected to his notion of worldview. Worldview (Weltanschauung) was a buzzword in early twentieth century German culture. Life-philosophers and anti-rationalists used the phrase \u2018Weltanschauung\u2019 to designate the inherently elusive and obscure source of all cultural life and thinking (see Dilthey 1960, 80; Simmel 1996, 29; Mannheim 1952, 38). On this reading philosophy is nothing but the conceptual articulation of pre-theoretical worldviews that are inextricably related to the historical, psychological, and cultural conditions of individual philosophers. Worldview philosophy was extremely critical of all attempts to describe the discipline as a science, that is, as a purely theoretical enterprise. Rooted in existentially grounded worldviews, philosophy is an expression of the whole human being and not merely an impersonal conceptual construction of the one-sided \u2018theoretical man\u2019 (see Staiti 2013b, 795\u2013799).\n\nRickert agrees that philosophy, unlike the specialized empirical sciences, must be oriented toward the world as a whole (Weltganze), and not merely toward this or that specific part of the world (Rickert 1910, 1; Rickert 1934, 1). However, he firmly rejects the view that, in order to grasp the world as a whole, philosophers ought to shun the ideal of scientificity and work as whole human beings merely expressing what their existential intuition of the world-whole suggests. In this regard, for Rickert, the phrase \u2018worldview\u2019 should designate the goal of philosophical work and not philosophy\u2019s obscure existential origin. Furthermore, the goal of a comprehensive theory of worldview can only be achieved with the aid of concepts and logical thinking, that is, adopting a scientific standpoint. Contra Dilthey, Simmel, and the antirationalist life-philosophers Rickert points out that \u201conly the one-sided, theoretically oriented man is able to reflect upon the world in its totality\u201d (Rickert 1933, 50). On the contrary, \u201c[t]he whole human being, precisely as \u2018whole\u2019 or \u2018existing\u2019 human being, will never transcend his \u2018small\u2019 world and this small world inevitably takes on different shapes for different people. For the pre-scientific man only that which stands in an essential connection with his own life can become \u2018world\u2019\u201d (Rickert 1933, 49\u201350; see Staiti 2013b: 799\u2013804). Rickert contends that the historical beginnings of philosophy in ancient Greece coincide with the birth of a purely \u2018theoretical man\u2019, that is, of a subject who pursues knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake and in so doing discloses a dimension of totality unknown to natural, practically oriented human subjects (Rickert 1923b).\n\nIn order to produce knowledge about the world as a whole, philosophy cannot rely on empirical methods like the specialized sciences do, nor can it simplistically project one concept or set of concepts describing one of the world\u2019s parts onto the world-whole. For Rickert philosophy has to rely on what he calls \u201cthe heterological principle\u201d (Rickert 1921b, 57; Rickert 1934b, 39). Scholars agree that the notion of heterology is the most distinctive element of Rickert\u2019s philosophy (Glockner 1937, 11; Flach 1958, 564; Orth 1998, 81) and even his \u201cprinciple of all principles\u201d (Krijnen 2001, 256). Heterology is a relational mode of thinking, which Rickert considers paramount to the theoretical determination of objects in general (Rickert 1921b, 57) and utterly unavoidable for a conceptual grasp of totalities. It consists in using a pair of mutually exclusive concepts, that is, concepts that negate each other, and take them together as complementary. To think heterologically means to posit a given initial concept (thesis) and then proceed to posit a second concept that can be seen as its \u2018other\u2019 (hetero-thesis), so that the two concepts taken together cover the entirety of the totality to be theoretically determined. \u201cWherever we can construct concepts that, through their determinations (i.e., their limitations), do not merely negate, but they simultaneously determine positively the negated component that is missing from the whole, we can think in terms of alternatives. In so doing we are able to grasp conceptually, through a kind of detour, a whole that cannot be grasped through concepts in a direct fashion. This is because we can construct two concepts, under which every element belonging to the whole necessarily falls\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 34). We already encountered heterological pairs of concepts in the previous sections, for instance, the transcendental-psychological and the transcendental-logical paths in the theory of knowledge and generalizing and individualizing concept formation in the theory of science (see above.) In both cases the two opposite concepts, if taken together, circumscribe a totality: in the first case, the totality of epistemology, and, in the second case, the totality of scientific methods in empirical research. The \u2018test\u2019 for successful heterological reasoning is that the negation of one of the two related concepts results positively into the other concept, so that one can be a priori certain that any item not falling under the first concept necessarily falls under the second concept. As an example Rickert illustrates how to determine heterologically the totality of bodies (Rickert 1934b, 42). We can start with the thesis \u2018organic living bodies\u2019 and if we proceed to negate it we see that the merely negative concept \u2018~ organic living bodies\u2019 immediately results in the positive concept \u2018dead mechanical bodies\u2019. Taken together the two concepts amount to a successful theoretical grasp of the whole \u2018bodies\u2019. We can see with evidence that within the totality \u2018bodies\u2019, whatever body does not fall under the category \u2018organic living body\u2019 necessarily falls under the category \u2018dead mechanical body\u2019. Using heterology philosophy can reflect upon the world as a whole in terms of \u201cworld-alternatives\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 42) and set out to determine what pair of concepts is best suited to encompass the totality of what is. As we know from previous sections, Rickert contends that the pair of concepts nature/psyche does not withstand the heterological test, in that what is not nature can be either psyche or timelessly valid value. Ultimately for Rickert the correct heterology in terms of which we can approach philosophically the world as a whole is reality/value (Rickert 1913, 11). This is because whatever is not an empirical reality (be it physical or psychic) lies necessarily in the sphere of value and vice versa. Once this broad categorization of the world as whole is established, philosophy can set out to determine more specifically the subordinated wholes out of which the world as a whole is constituted and to articulate meaningfully their mutual relations.\n\nOnly an ontological pluralism does justice to the richness of the world. (Rickert 1932, 100)\n\nFrom roughly the beginning of the 1920s Rickert\u2019s philosophy is characterized by what has been referred to as an \u201contological turn\u201d (Farges 2010, 26; Kuttig 1987). However, in Rickert\u2019s eyes the introduction of ontology is not a departure from his earlier epistemological focus or the leap into a completely new philosophical dimension. As his definition of ontology as \u201cthe doctrine of what is predicated as being\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 54) already suggests, ontological questions are deeply connected to questions about judgment and predication. In other words, if we take our knowledge to consist of judgments and if we take our judgments to consist of a formal and a material component, then it is legitimate to ask what is the material component cast into conceptual forms in judgments. As the opening quote of this section indicates, for Rickert it is important to uphold pluralism in ontology. In keeping with the pluralism of meaningful predication (there is a plurality of things that we can meaningfully articulate judgments about), we cannot dogmatically presuppose that there is only one meaning of the \u2018being\u2019 addressed in our predicative activities. In this regard, far from being detrimental to a genuine ontological investigation, Rickert\u2019s insistence on the preeminence of epistemology turns out to have a positive effect on ontology. If the compass to orient ourselves in ontology is meaningful predication, then we are from the beginning immune to dogmatic reductions of what is to one monistically conceived dimension of reality (Rickert 1934b, 57).\n\nRickert\u2019s ontology contemplates four \u201ckinds of being (Seinsarten) of the world\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 153): (1) sensible (sinnlich) being; (2) non-sensible (unsinnlich) being; (3) pro-physical (pro-physisches) being; (4) supersensible (\u00fcbersinnlich) being.\n\n(1) Sensible being is the ontological category under which fall both physical and psychological being, that is, material things and mental states. Both the sphere of the physical and the sphere of the psychological are directly accessible to experience (Rickert 1934b, 63\u201364) and can be the object of meaningful predication. Therefore they must be granted equal ontological worth. Psychophysical dualism, however, causes the classical problems of mind-body causal interaction versus mind-body parallelism. Rickert\u2019s sympathies are clearly with the idea of psychophysical causality (both body to mind and mind to body) versus the hypothesis of psychophysical parallelism and the ensuing panpsychism (Rickert 1900). He considers psychophysical parallelism a self-undermining hypothesis to the extent that it relies on the atomization and quantification of psyche. Defenders of psychophysical parallelism (such as Baruch Spinoza and Gustav Fechner) introduced this hypothesis in order to preserve the autonomy of the psyche as the domain of the qualitative, which they take to be essentially different from merely quantitative physical being. However, in order to articulate their model they have to rely on a quantification of the psyche, which undercuts precisely the premise, based on which psychophysical parallelism was considered a good alternative to psychophysical causality to begin with (Rickert 1900, 76; Rickert 1934b, 66\u201373). The reason why the idea of a two-way causal link between mental and physical being seems to pose an impossible puzzle is that, prima facie, the order of the psychic and the order of the physical strike us as belonging to two separate ontological domains. However, for Rickert this is because we generally overlook the tertium comparationis, which proves that they actually belong in one an the same ontological dimension, namely, that they are both domains of sensible being, i.e., being that is directly accessible to perception. From this perspective causal interaction between mind and body is nothing but causal interaction between two ontologically homogeneous species of one and the same ontological genus \u2018sensible being\u2019. To be sure, the physical and the psychic display vastly different characteristics (extension vs. unextendedness; intentionality vs. lack of intentionality; spatiotemporal individuation vs. temporal individuation.) However, for Rickert this is not enough reason to consider the two dimensions as ontologically heterogeneous. If they are ontologically homogeneous, then it is the task of specialized empirical research and not of philosophy to determine their causal relations.\n\n(2) The ontological homogeneity of the physical and the psychic becomes even more clear if we turn our attention to a completely different ontological sphere, which taken together heterologically with sensible being completes the concept of the world of experience (Erfahrungswelt). The second kind of being in Rickert\u2019s ontology is what he calls non-sensible being. In order to introduce non-sensible being Rickert recommends that we turn our attention to word-meanings (Rickert 1934b, 79). While having a conversation, we do not only perceive the physical body of our interlocutor and the psychic reality attached to it. We also \u2018receive\u2019 in the same direct, immediate way the meanings of the words that he or she is uttering. These meanings are not psychic realities. They do not coincide with the thoughts of the speaker or with the acoustic stimuli of the listener. The very same meanings could be conveyed by a completely different sensible \u2018support\u2019 such as ink scribbles on paper. We can even recognize the same meaning as being instantiated by different words in different languages, such as the identical meaning of \u2018red\u2019, \u2018rot\u2019, \u2018rosso\u2019 and \u2018rouge\u2019. While the meaning of words must be carried by some sensible support, it is itself not sensible. It is not sensed or perceived but rather understood. This is why Rickert proposes to call the second ontological domain the non-sensible sphere of understandable meaning-configurations (verstehbare Sinngebilde) (Rickert 1934b, 81). Word-meanings, however, are only a tiny fraction of the meaning-configurations that we can experience. The arrangement of the musical notes in a symphony is likewise understood as a meaning-configuration possibly carried by different sensible supports\u2014the same melody can be played in a different key, with a different instrument, it can be sung, etc. Looking at the works of a great artist we can understand one and the same non-sensible meaning-configuration (say, the same \u2018style\u2019) realized sensibly in different media. The universe of meaning-configurations constitutes for Rickert an authentic mundus intelligibilis experienced in concomitance with but as different from the mundus sensibilis of perceivable being. However, he takes pains to remind us that we should not repeat the old Platonic mistake of taking the world of non-sensible being to be a metaphysically separate reality. Understandable meaning-configurations are an ingredient of our everyday experience and so they have to be counted among the ontological ingredients of the experiential world. In exploring the world of meaning-configurations we must take into account the principles that allow for meaning-configurations to be intelligible. Not every string of words is intelligible and, most importantly, not every intelligible string of words is true. The same holds for every meaning-configuration. It is intelligible only if its constitutive non-sensible elements are held together by the reference to a specific value. True sentences, for instance, are unified by their reference to the theoretical value of truth. In this way, Rickert clarifies the ontological status of values as non-sensible beings. The real dualism pertaining to the world of experience, then, is not the one between body and mind but the one between the sensible world of perceivable entities and the non-sensible world of understandable meaning-configurations (Rickert 1934b, 92\u201397). This insight defeats a view Rickert calls \u201chyletic sensualism\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 93) that he attributes to both Kant and Husserl. Hyletic sensualists assume that the content of our experience can only be sensible, and that whatever is non-sensible and intelligible must be ascribed to the form of our experience instead. However, based on the above analyses, Rickert emphasizes that the very content of our experience is both sensible (perceivable) and non-sensible (intelligible). Accordingly, in order to generate knowledge of sensible entities and intelligible meaning-configurations the conceptual forms of our cognition must apply to both domains.\n\n(3) Upon closer scrutiny, the kind of content that we encounter in the world of experience and conceptualize in the empirical sciences shows itself to be a compound of form and content. In fact, the entities that we encounter and theorize about in the world of experience are always objects, in a broad sense comprising physical, psychic and non-sensible entities (meaning-configurations). In keeping with the Kantian tradition, however, objects are the result of synthetic processes of objectification guided by some categories (forms). It is therefore possible to raise a question about a third domain of being: how are we to think the pure content or hyle that is immediately experienced prior to all objectification and categorization? At first this universe of absolutely raw and unsynthesized content has to be conceived of as prior to the distinction between sensible and non-sensible being, and, within the sphere of sensible being, prior to the distinction between physical and psychic reality. This is why Rickert suggests to call this third domain of being the \u201cpro-physical world\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 111; Rickert 1921b, 296), using improperly the term \u2018physical\u2019 in the phrase to indicate the whole domain of the experiential world. In this sense, \u201cthe problem of prophysics [is] at the same time the problem of the immediate\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 112), that is of the pure, immediately lived content preceding all synthesis and categorization. The regression to the prophysical world, however, does not leave us with a completely undifferentiated and inchoate mass of raw \u2018content\u2019. If we think of objects as the products of a subject\u2019s activity of categorial formation, then suspending all categorial syntheses leads us back to a pre-objective subject (Rickert 1934b, 115), whose synthetic activity brings about objects out of the pure pro-physical material in the first place. One might be inclined to think that the pro-physical subject coincides with Kant\u2019s transcendental apperception, that is, a mere empty \u2018form\u2019 of subjectivity or consciousness in general. However, and in keeping with the analyses of subjectivity in The Object of Knowledge (see above), in order to be responsible for the processes of objectification and thus form primordial materials into proper objects, the pro-physical subject must be conceived of as active and capable of stance-takings toward values (Rickert 1934b, 118). In other words, the pro-physical subject that we necessarily have to think as prior to all psychic, physical and meaning-related objectifications must be conceived of as free (Rickert 1934b, 120). While empirical psychology operating in the sphere of already objectified sensible being presents us with empirical subjects who are causally determined in various ways, pro-physics unearths a transcendental dimension of freedom that is presupposed by all objectifications. Rickert suggests that this insight solves the \u201cmystery\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 123) of freedom by way of dissolving, as it were, the traditional antinomy between freedom and determinism. These two notions, in Rickert\u2019s view, belong in two distinct ontological spheres. While the objectified psychic subject is indeed causally determined as much as any other bit of sensible being, the pro-physical subject responsible for each objectification is inherently free. In this sense, freedom and determinism are not opposed. To the extent that determinism presupposed the process of objectification, (psychophysical) determinism presupposes (prophysical) freedom. After establishing the ontological features of the prophysical subject, we can turn to the primordial materials or contents that the prophysical subject forms. Rickert suggests to calls the branch of prophysics dealing with pure materials Zustandslehre, an expression hardly translatable into English without losing its intended assonance with Gegenstandslehre (Rickert 1934b, 127). Gegen-stand is the German term for object, that is, literally, that which stands over and against a subject. However, if Gegend-stand is the product of an objectifying process, then Rickert suggests that we call that which is thereby objectified and placed \u2018over and against\u2019 Zu-stand, which can be roughly translated as \u2018state\u2019. A doctrine of pure states (reine Zust\u00e4nde) is meant to investigate the pre-objectified, pure content independently of the categorial forms that pervade such content in our sensible experiences of fully formed objects (Rickert 1934b, 129). The gist of Rickert\u2019s Zustandslehre is that even in the pro-physical world we have no reason to think of content in a monistic fashion. \u201cIn the Zustandslehre we can exhibit the ultimate ground for the encompassing dualism of the world of objects. Already the dimension of pure states (das Zust\u00e4ndliche) pertaining to understandable objects, that is, its bare material, is as non-sensible as the form which creates non-sensible objects out of it. The understandable meaning-configuration has both a non-sensible form and a non-sensible content\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 131). In other words, Rickert wants to say that the understandable meaning-configurations considered in the second domain of ontology are non-sensible through and through. One might be tempted to think that a word-meaning is composed of a non-sensible form (the ideal Bedeutung) and a sensible content, say, the acoustic data forming the distinctive sound of the word \u2018red\u2019 in English or those forming the distinctive sound of the word \u2018rosso\u2019 in Italian. On Rickert\u2019s account, however, this would be wrong. We have to distinguish the acoustic carrier of the word-meaning from the word-meaning as a whole, in both its form and its content. The acoustic carrier is entirely sensible and the word-meaning itself is entirely non-sensible. The conclusion of Rickert\u2019s prophysics is that if we consider its domain as that of the \u201cuniversal minimum\u201d of thinkability (Rickert 1934b, 133), then we have to concede that such universal minimum already entails a plurality of factors, namely, the minimal distinction between I (the prophysical subject) and non-I (the domain of pure states) and the further distinction within the sphere of non-I between the pro-physical sensible and the pro-physical non-sensible, whose objectifications carried out by the free pro-physical subject give rise to the objects in the world of experience.\n\n(4) The fourth and last ontological domain Rickert considers is that of supersensible being, traditionally addressed by metaphysics. Rickert\u2019s approach to metaphysics is guided by the problem of the ultimate connection between reality and value. Both the analysis of the world of experience and the analysis of the prophysical world resulted in an inevitable dualism between the sensible and the non-sensible, viz., the perceivable and the understandable. This poses the problem of how to preserve the dualism and still be able to conceive of the world as a whole in a unitary fashion. The first clue to think about the unity of the world is provided by the doctrine of the prophysical subject: \u201cIt produces a connection of what is real and what is meaningful (das Sinnhafte) and at the same time with the valid value\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 135). With its free stance-takings relating (sensible and non-sensible) materials to (non-sensible) values the prophysical subject encompasses both terms of the dualism and thus provides a criterion to conceive of them as united. However, this seems to tie the unity of reality and value to the particularity and contingency of actual stance-takings. This unity seems to be extremely precarious and ultimately grounded in the arbitrary acts of a pro-physical subject. The thought of a unity of reality and value beyond the particular acts of valuing subjectivity and thus beyond the scope of contents of consciousness opens up the intellectual space of metaphysics. Rickert is adamant that ultimately the transcendent unity of reality and value beyond subjectivity is the object of \u201cfaith\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 137) and not scientific knowledge. However, he insists that we need such faith in order to live both as practical and as theoretical human beings. \u201cIf the world were not arranged in such a way that our stance-taking toward the value of truth \u2018succeeds\u2019 beyond the I\u2019s act, then science, which pushes forward to cognize the world, is impossible. As scientific people, too, we need the assumption that there is a more than particular, \u2018cosmic\u2019 connection of value and reality\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 138). The \u201csupersensible unity\u201d of value and reality (Wirklichkeit) or the domain of \u201cvalue-reality\u201d (Wertrealit\u00e4t) (Rickert 1934b, 139) is the object of metaphysics. Describing the mode of access to the domain of value-reality in metaphysics, Rickert holds fast to Kant\u2019s view that metaphysics is not possible as a science. This, however, entails neither that metaphysics is altogether impossible, nor that some other kind of non-scientific knowledge may not be produced as legitimate metaphysical knowledge. Rickert refers to metaphysical knowledge in scare quotes as \u201callegoric\u201d, \u201cimage-building\u201d (sinnbildlich) or \u201csymbolic\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 140). In other words, metaphysics is bound to employ images, metaphors and oblique expressions in order to produce indirect knowledge of the transcendent, subject-independent unity of reality and value. Rickert here clearly has in mind the most illustrious of all metaphysicians: Plato. When he called the Forms \u2018real\u2019 he borrowed a phrase that has an established meaning for this-worldly realities and applied it metaphorically to the domain of otherworldly or supersensible being. Moreover, as is well known, he made abundant use of allegories, similes and mythological stories in order to illustrate the ultimately inaccessible world of the supersensible. Finally, Rickert warns against a conflation of metaphysics and religion (Rickert 1934, 201). While in concrete cultural worlds and living individuals these two spheres of culture often intersect and overlap, it is important to keep them conceptually distinct. Metaphysics is a theoretical enterprise trying to determine conceptually supersensible being with the aid of metaphors, symbols, etc. It does involve faith but it is a purely rational faith in some kind of transcendent unity of reality and value. Religion, on the contrary, is characterized by faith in the existence of a supersensible divine being, in which ultimately all values and meanings are grounded. Both are valuable and important component of culture. Empirically speaking, they often occur together and have numerous mutual influences. However, they can never be reduced theoretically to one another. In other words, the rational faith of metaphysics does not automatically lead to religious faith in a divine being and, conversely, religious faith does not necessitate the believer to accept that the ultimate unity of reality and value is accessible (through symbolic knowledge) to the rational discourse of metaphysics."}], "Wilhelm Windelband was born on 15 March 1848.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/windelband-wilhelm-1848-1915", "page_content": "WINDELBAND, WILHELM\n\n(1848 \u2013 1915)\n\nThe German philosopher and historian of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband was born in Potsdam and educated at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

He studied at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nWindelband is now mainly remembered for the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which he introduced. These have currency in psychology and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings.

He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/windelband-wilhelm-1848-1915", "page_content": "WINDELBAND, WILHELM\n\n(1848 \u2013 1915)\n\nThe German philosopher and historian of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband was born in Potsdam and educated at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

Professor at Z\u00fcrich (1876), Freiburg (1877), Strasbourg (1882), and Heidelberg (1903).\n\nWindelband is known for his works on the history of philosophy, History of Ancient Philosophy (1888; Russian translation, 1893) and History of Modern Philosophy (vol. 1-2, 1878-80; Russian translation, vol. 1-2, 1902-05), in which the philosophical systems of the past are presented from a Kantian position. In a characteristically neo-Kantian spirit Windelband eliminates the concept of thing-in-itself from Kant\u2019s doctrine and attempts thereby to overcome the dualism of Kantian philosophy in a subjectivistic way. Windelband defines philosophy as \u201cthe critical study of values of universal validity\u201d (Preliudii [Praludien], St. Petersburg, 1904, p. 23) and as a normative doctrine based on value judgments and on the cognition of what ought to be. He contrasts philosophy with the natural sciences, which are based on theoretical judgments and empirical data of what is. Windelband interprets values as being a priori, transcendental, and universally valid. By acknowledging mankind\u2019s self-determination in accordance with an \u201cethical ideal\u201d as the ultimate aim of historical progress, Windelband reduces social problems to ethical ones. He declares the dualism of the world of reality and the world of values to be a \u201csacred mystery\u201d revealing the limitation of our knowledge and directs us into the sphere of religious values.\n\nIn evolving a methodology of the sciences he breaks down the sciences into nomothetic sciences, which deal with laws, and idiographic sciences, which study specific phenomena in their uniqueness. \u201cThe former are the sciences of laws, the latter are the sciences of events\u201d (ibid., p. 320). In this way Windelband denies that the discovery of laws is the guiding principle of historical knowledge.\n\nWORKS Geschichte und Naturwissenschaft, 3rd ed.

He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/windelband-wilhelm-1848-1915", "page_content": "WINDELBAND, WILHELM\n\n(1848 \u2013 1915)\n\nThe German philosopher and historian of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband was born in Potsdam and educated at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

He studied at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nWindelband is now mainly remembered for the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which he introduced. These have currency in psychology and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a neo-Kantian who argued against other contemporary neo-Kantians, maintaining that \"to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\". Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system.\n\nWindelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.\n\nBibliography\n\nThe following works by Windelband are available in English translations:\n\nBooks\n\nHistory of Philosophy (1893) (two volumes) reprinted 1901, 1938 and 1979 by Macmillan\n\n(1893) (two volumes) reprinted 1901, 1938 and 1979 by Macmillan History of Ancient Philosophy (1899)\n\n(1899) An Introduction to Philosophy (1895)\n\n(1895) Theories in Logic (1912)\n\nArticles\n\n\"History and Natural Science\" (J.

He taught philosophy at Zurich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition -- the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value. Windelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence -- the knowing, willing, and feeling subject -- and consciousness in general\n\n\n\n\"Reprinted ... from the revised edition of 1901, translated by James H.

He studied at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nWindelband is now mainly remembered for the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which he introduced. These have currency in psychology and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a neo-Kantian who argued against other contemporary neo-Kantians, maintaining that \"to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\". Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system.\n\nWindelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.\n\nBibliography\n\nThe following works by Windelband are available in English translations:\n\nBooks\n\nHistory of Philosophy (1893) (two volumes) reprinted 1901, 1938 and 1979 by Macmillan\n\n(1893) (two volumes) reprinted 1901, 1938 and 1979 by Macmillan History of Ancient Philosophy (1899)\n\n(1899) An Introduction to Philosophy (1895)\n\n(1895) Theories in Logic (1912)\n\nArticles\n\n\"History and Natural Science\" (J.
