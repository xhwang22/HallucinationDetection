The group topped the charts in the late 1960s with their lively combination of rock and soul music. The four founding members of the group were vocalist-keyboardist Felix Cavaliere (born November 29, 1944, Pelham, New York), vocalist Eddie Brigati (born October 22, 1946, New York, New York), drummer Dino Danelli (born July 23, 1945, New York), and guitarist Gene Cornish (born May 14, 1945, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).\n\nThe group\u2019s members were experienced musicians who had played with various bands before forming the Rascals in 1964. Cavaliere, a classically trained pianist, had been the only white member of a rhythm-and-blues (R&B) band in high school and had formed a doo-wop group in college. Brigati had been a pickup singer with local R&B bands. Danelli, as a teenager, had played drums with jazz musician Lionel Hampton before turning to R&B. Cavaliere met Danelli in New York and the pair went to Las Vegas, Nevada, where they played with a casino house band. Upon returning to New York, Cavaliere briefly joined Joey Dee and the Starliters, which included Brigati and Cornish. When Cavaliere, Brigati, and Cornish left the Starliters and joined up with Danelli, the group came together as the Rascals and began writing songs.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the Rascals played gigs on the New York club scene, in New Jersey, and as the regular band on a floating nightclub in Long Island, New York. New York promoter Sid Bernstein, who had brought the Beatles to America, took over as manager and signed them to Atlantic Records as the Young Rascals. In 1965 the Rascals opened for the Beatles at New York\u2019s Shea Stadium. Their first single, \u201cI Ain\u2019t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\u201d (1965) was followed by \u201cGood Lovin\u2019\u201d (1966), which soared to number one on the charts. Over the next few years the band turned out a number of top 20 hits, including \u201cYou Better Run\u201d (1966), \u201c(I\u2019ve Been) Lonely Too Long\u201d (1967), \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d (1967), \u201cA Girl Like You\u201d (1967), \u201cHow Can I Be Sure\u201d (1967), \u201cIt\u2019s Wonderful\u201d (1968), \u201cA Beautiful Morning\u201d (1968), and \u201cPeople Got to Be Free\u201d (1968), the latter written shortly after Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. The Young Rascals\u2019 debut album, The Young Rascals (1966), went gold as did their subsequent releases Collections (1967), Groovin\u2019 (1967), Time/Peace: The Rascals\u2019 Greatest Hits (1968), and Freedom Suite (1969). In 1968 they dropped the \u201cYoung\u201d from their name and returned to being the Rascals.\n\nWhile not an overtly political group, the Rascals took a stance against racism by insisting that a black group share the bill with them on live concerts\u2014a position that at the time cost the Rascals some concert dates in the southern United States. By the early 1970s, however, the group was experiencing strain, and their record sales and concert attendance declined sharply. Brigati left the group in 1971; Cornish left the following year. Although the remaining Rascals changed recording labels, moving from Atlantic to Columbia, and added several new performers to the lineup (guitarist Buzzy Feiten, formerly with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band; bass player Robert Popwell, who had worked with Bob Dylan and Aretha Franklin; and vocalist Ann Sutton, who had sung with Philadelphia-based soul and jazz groups), the band broke up in the early 1970s.\n\nCavaliere went on to pursue a solo career as a performer and producer; Brigati and his brother, David, recorded together; and Cornish and Danelli formed a new group called Bulldog that later evolved into Fotomaker. In 1988, Danelli, Cornish, and Cavaliere reunited for an American tour, though the following year they became embroiled in a lawsuit over the use of the Rascals name. Cornish and Danelli ended up calling themselves the New Rascals while Cavaliere billed himself as \u201cformerly of the Young Rascals.\u201d In 1992 a two-CD career retrospective, The Rascals Anthology 1965\u20131972, was released. The same year Cavaliere released his first solo album in more than a decade. The Rascals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nIn 2012, after more than 40 years apart, the four original members of the Rascals reassembled for an American reunion tour. The show featured a concert as well as taped segments that included interviews with the group and actors re-creating important events from the band\u2019s history."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/-----c9331ec46e8c4865a524331d40021cd7", "page_content": "BILLINGS, Mont.

The quartet released impeccably performed pop masterpieces that featured soulful singing, and songwriting that captured the essence of the most optimistic elements of 1960s youth culture. Such songs as \"Groovin'\" and \"People Got to Be Free\" escaped the prison of 1960s' cultural artifacts by benefit of the crisp musical arrangements and lack of pretension in the vocal performances, and have become true timeless pop classics that have been labeled as prime examples of \"blue-eyed soul.\"\n\nThe group formed in New York in 1965. Drummer Dino Danelli was a teenage prodigy, having performed with Lionel Hampton and Little Willie John. Keyboardist Felix Cavaliere was a student of classical piano, and the only white member of the Stereos. While he was a student at Syracuse University, Cavaliere formed a doo-wop group known as the Escorts. Cavaliere moved to New York City, where he met Danelli. The duo traveled to Las Vegas to play in a casino house band, and then returned to New York, where Cavaliere accepted a job with \"Peppermint Twist\" singer Joey Dee's band the Starliters. Other members of the Starliters included singer Eddie Brigati and guitarist Gene Cornish. Cavaliere, Danelli, Cornish, and Brigati formed the Young Rascals shortly thereafter, releasing the 1965 single \"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore,\" which was sung by Brigati. Cavaliere took over lead vocals on the group's follow-up single, \"Good Lovin',\" which was a remake of a song originally recorded by the Olympics. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1966. The early recordings of the Rascals were produced by future Eric Clapton and Allman Brothers' producer Tom Dowd. With Dowd, the group created a raucous, driving sound that emphasized Cavaliere's Hammond organ playing and rhythm-and-blues-influenced vocals. The group never hired a full-time bass player, relying instead on session and pickup players for studio and live performances.\n\nDespite the band's American popularity, they were unable to crack the European market until the release of the 1967 single \"Groovin.'\" The song featured another classic Cavaliere vocal, but with a more jazz-influenced musical backing assisted by Atlantic Records producer Arif Mardin. By now known as the Rascals, the group registered other hits in 1967 with \"How Can I Be Sure\" and \"Beautiful Morning.\" In Rock: The Rough Guide, critic Richie Unterberger assessed the group's string of hits: \"All had a light, beautifully serene grace, perhaps reflecting Cavaliere's increasing infatuation with Eastern mysticism in general, and guru Swami Satchinanda in particular. This was soul music of a new sort, equal parts white and black, driven as much by soul-searching concerns as by romantic ones.\"\n\nThe year 1967 was to be the band's creative peak. The following year they released another stellar single, \"People Got to Be Free,\" but alienated some audiences with a 1969 double album that featured the song Freedom Suite. Written by Cavaliere and Brigati, \"People Got to Be Free\" was reportedly inspired by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. The group did their best to emulate the social politics of King and Kennedy by insisting that they share all their billed performances with a black group. The move resulted in the band playing few if any dates in the South.\n\n\"People Got to Be Free\" was the group's last hit single, as they began to focus on integrating jazz improvisers such as Alice Coltrane and Ron Carter on their subsequent recordings. Critics generally dismissed these efforts as pretentious. See, released in 1970, led critic Lenny Kaye to ponder whether the group wasn't better off recording singles rather than full-length albums. \"Given the space of an entire album, the group seems to founder about, coming up with material that is in some cases good, but more often simply innocuous,\" wrote Kaye in Rolling Stone. The group employed such Eastern instruments as sitars and tablas to accompany the songs, which Kaye disparaged as \"quasi-mystical \u2026 reflecting itself in lyrics full of Significance and Cosmic Wonder.\" When the band stuck to their tried-and-true formula for rhythm-and-blues inflected pop, however, Kaye found them at the top of their game: \"Both 'See' and 'Carry Me Back' rock like mad, spurred by the frenetically tight drumming of Dino Danelli and carried by those soaring voices that once sat solidly behind Joey Dee and the Starlighters.\" Kaye praised the songs as \"full of fire and topped with a pair of great lyrics,\" and as \"easily the equal of anything the Rascals have yet done, which is to say that they're very good indeed.\"\n\nFor the group's other 1970 release, Search and Nearness, they recruited the help of jazz artists Hubert Laws, Joe Farrell, and Ron Carter. The group left Atlantic Records and signed with Columbia. Before their label debut, however, Brigati left the group in 1970, and Cornish quit the following year. Cavaliere and Danelli recruited Buzzy Feiten from the Butterfield Blues Band, session player Robert Popwell, and singer Ann Sutton. The latter lineup left no music of lasting value, however, and Cavaliere and Brigati folded the Rascals' tent in 1972.\n\nIn 1988 Cornish, Cavaliere, and Danelli reunited for a tour that ended in acrimony, and in 1989 Cornish and Danelli sued Cavaliere to prohibit him from touring using the Rascals' name. The judge ruled that Cornish and Danelli could tour as the New Rascals, and that Cavaliere could promote his concert appearances as a former member of the Young Rascals. Through the years the various members of the band have surfaced in different projects. In the 1970s Cornish and Danelli were in the groups Bulldog and Fotomaker; the latter with Wally Bryson of the Raspberries. Brigati toured and recorded with his brother David, and the brothers were featured in the 1991 New York Rock and Soul Revue with Steely Dan member Donald Fagen. Cavaliere toured for a season with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band.

At Van Zandt's urging, the four original members played a 2010 charity show together, and in 2012 Van Zandt wrote and produced a \"bioconcert\" called \"The Rascals: Once Upon a Dream\" -- a multimedia show featuring performances by the band and clips from its 1960s heyday.\n\nIt ran for 15 shows on Broadway, then toured the country for several months."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyexpertnews.com/art-culture/arts/dino-danelli-whose-drums-drove-out-the-rascals-is-dead-at-age-78/", "page_content": "Dino Danelli, whose hard-hitting, energetic drumming propelled the Rascals to a string of hits in the late 1960s, including the No. 1 records \u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d \u201cGroovin'\u201d and \u201cPeople Got to Be Free,\u201d died Thursday in Manhattan.

I will follow this up with a review of The Rascals\u2019 Greatest Hits album next month)\n\nDino Danelli was the drummer for the Rascals, among the first American bands to emerge in response to the so-called British Invasion, from their formation in 1965 until their breakup in the early 1970s.Danelli, whose hard-charging, high-energy drumming powered the Rascals to a string of hits in the late 1960s, including the No. 1 records \u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d and \u201cPeople Got to Be Free,\u201d died on Thursday Dec.15, 2022 in Manhattan. He was 78.\n\nJoe Russo, a close friend and the band\u2019s historian, confirmed the death, at a rehabilitation center. He said Mr. Danelli had been in declining health for several years.\n\nThe Rascals (billed on their first three albums as the Young Rascals) were among the first American bands to emerge in response to the so-called British Invasion of 1964.\n\nFormed in New Jersey in 1965, the quartet \u2014 featuring Felix Cavaliere on organ and vocals, Eddie Brigati on vocals, Gene Cornish on guitar and Mr. Danelli on drums \u2014 drew on a range of influences, including doo-wop, jazz and soul.\n\nMr. Danelli, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great jazz drummers Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa, merged percussive virtuosity with a rock sensibility. Like Ringo Starr of the Beatles, he set the template for the rock drummer archetype: disciplined and precise, but with a flair that drew the crowd\u2019s eye. He would twirl his sticks \u2014 a trick he learned from his sister, a cheerleader \u2014 and throw them in the air, before catching them without dropping the beat.\n\nMr. Danelli was responsible for the band\u2019s first big hit. He was a fan of obscure soul records, and one day at a record shop in Harlem, he found a single by the Olympics, \u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d written by Rudy Clark and Arthur Resnick, which reached No. 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. \u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s try it, let\u2019s put a new version to it,\u2019\u201d he said in a 2008 interview with the drummer Liberty DeVitto. \u201cIt was just a lucky find.\u201d The Rascals played the song during a 1966 appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d It soon topped the charts and \u2014 with its opening shout of \u201cOne, two, three!\u201d \u2014 became one of the best-known songs of the decade."}]}
