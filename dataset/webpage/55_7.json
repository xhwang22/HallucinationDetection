Schools, universities, and other education institutions play a critical role in helping individuals, communities, and societies reach their potential\u2014from early childhood to postsecondary attainment. However, many communities receive inadequate funding for their schools, which can affect the quality of teaching, access to resources, and learning outcomes. This lack of resources has global implications: by 2030, 825 million young people will lack the basic reading, math, and digital literacy required to compete for jobs. In particular, girls around the world face barriers to education, and more than 100 million girls today are out of school.\n\nResource gaps can lead to achievement gaps, which can further perpetuate existing racial and wealth inequalities. In the United States, for example, school districts with more than 50 percent Black or Latino students are two times more likely to have a funding gap than higher-income districts. Often, these under-resourced schools face additional challenges in preparing students for post-secondary education and for future employment opportunities, which in turn serve as a barrier to upward mobility.\n\nGiven the enormous challenges faced by the education sector, philanthropy can play a significant role in advancing initiatives and strengthening institutions to help ensure a quality education for all.\n\nEducation Ecosystem Overview\n\nGiven the breadth of the education space, there are many players involved, including across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors:\n\nGovernment agencies provide funding for public schools and colleges, establish curricula, and set performance standards for students and teachers.\n\nSchools and universities provide students with learning environments and opportunities to achieve their potential.\n\nTeacher preparation programs equip prospective educators with the skills and training needed to succeed in the classroom.\n\nNonprofits and NGOs conduct research, advocate for education reform, work with schools to develop and implement programs, and offer supplemental out-of-school-time programs.\n\nCorporations, foundations, and individual donors provide significant funding for initiatives that support education institutions and educators as well as financial aid for students.\n\nPhilanthropy Trends\n\nPhilanthropists have long contributed to education, which is consistently one of the largest giving categories in the United States. In 2020 alone, for example, U.S.-based donors gave more than $71 billion to education, which represented 15 percent of all giving and was surpassed only by charitable giving to religion, according to Giving USA. Philanthropy is uniquely positioned to facilitate collaboration between policymakers, business groups, and schools to achieve scale and impact. The sector also provides substantial support for policy reform and advocacy efforts to address the systemic barriers that contribute to unequal access to education.\n\nFunders support a wide range of projects, initiatives, and areas across education. According to a benchmarking study by Grantmakers for Education, 57 percent of grant dollars in 2018 went to elementary or secondary education, compared with 49 percent for postsecondary education and workforce/career readiness and 4 percent for early learning.\n\nThere are challenges for philanthropists specific to the education sector, such as the lack of consensus around measuring impact. There are varying opinions, for example, on the most effective indicators for assessing educational performance, and those frameworks have evolved, with commonly cited metrics ranging from secondary-school graduation rates to third-grade reading levels to eighth-grade algebra proficiency.\n\nUltimately, philanthropists play a significant role in the evolving education landscape, across various geographies and education stages. Examples of how donors are working in the educational sector are below.\n\nPromoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in education:\n\nThe Lumina Fund for Racial Justice and Equity supports organizations and efforts working to eradicate systemic racism and to advance equity and justice, with a focus on higher education in the United States.\n\nHolistic approaches to education focused on social and emotional learning (SEL), mental health, and well-being:\n\nThe Social and Emotional Learning (SEL For Teachers) project, a partnership between the NoVo Foundation and Education First, works to build momentum for high-quality SEL practices through education, technical assistance, and networks and has awarded more than $1 million since 2016 in grants to teachers and districts through the SEL Innovation Fund.\n\nProviding educators with career development, training, and mental health resources:\n\nThrough the LIGHT Awards program, the Intrepid Philanthropy Foundation supports teachers by offering multi-year grants to teams of teachers to engage in professional learning opportunities of their choosing.\n\nAdvancement of global education, including under the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals framework:\n\nThe International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity engages with world leaders, policymakers, and researchers to promote and increase investment in quality education and lifelong learning for all, and its goals are aligned with the 2030 timeline for the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAddressing student debt and the lack of post-secondary education funding:\n\nThe Achieving Success in Postsecondary Education project, which emerged from a partnership between Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and the TIAA Institute, surveyed the state of student debt in the United States and highlighted trends in postsecondary education funding.\n\nHow to Get Started in Education Philanthropy\n\nFunders looking to get started in philanthropy focused on education should engage with member organizations and peer-learning networks that have published extensive research and analysis on the fields. National networks like Grantmakers for Education, for example, regularly provide resources such as publications, convenings, and webinars for funders focused on improving education outcomes. NewSchools Venture Fund holds an annual summit to exchange innovative ideas to advance public education in the United States. Regional and local organizations can also provide resources for understanding the education landscape\u2014such as the East Bay Community Foundation in Oakland, California, which contributes to local efforts such as LitLab that work to ensure success in early education.\n\nUltimately, many funders reflect on their own educational experiences as a start point for discovering the education issues, causes, and organizations that are most aligned with their interests\u2014and to identify the specific geographies or levels of the education system that resonate the most with them. From there, they can read about issues in education, talk with other funders to learn about their approaches to education philanthropy and connect with individuals already working in the education space to learn about the needs and gaps within their specific areas.\n\nExperts at Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors focused on education include Amy Holmes, Liza Primeau, Joanne Schneider, Meenakshi Abbi, and Tina Joh.

As funders, governments, and academia address the role of research in social impact, the deliberations on researcher activism, advocacy and lobbying have seen a resurgence. This study explores the perceptions of 52 faculty and 24 government decisionmakers on the roles, responsibilities, and restrictions of an academic to proactively engage in efforts that can be interpreted under these three terms. Data was coded through inductive thematic analysis using Atlas.Ti and a framework approach. We found that discordant perceptions about how much activism, advocacy and lobbying faculty should be engaging in, results from how each term is defined, interpreted, supported and reported by the individuals, the School of Public Health (SPH), and government agencies. Influential faculty factors included: seniority, previous experiences, position within the institution, and being embedded in a research center with an advocacy focus. Faculty views on support for advocacy were often divergent. We surmise therefore, that for effective and mutually beneficial collaboration to occur, academic institutions need to align rhetoric with reality with respect to encouraging modes and support for government engagement. Similarly, government agencies need to provide more flexible modes of engagement. This will contribute to alleviating confusion as well as tension leading to more effective engagement and consequently opportunity for evidence-informed decision making in public health globally.\n\nFunding: The study was conducted through support provided by The Lerner Center for Health Promotion at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health without restrictions.

We report on these perceptions, the structural factors associated with them, as well as provide ideas to reconcile the conflict between academic work and activism, advocacy, and lobbying.\n\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) many of these engagements are embedded in the daily work of academics but not necessarily a focus of the institution\u2019s formal policies [ 29 , 42 , 68 , 69 ]. The diverse manifestations of activism, advocacy and even lobbying guidelines and activities across SPHs supports their heterogenous nature. Such endeavors may additionally be underpinned by the lens they apply to (global) public health as one that is technical, humanitarian, social justice centered, entrepreneurial, or some combination [ 70 ].\n\nCommitment to institutionalization of advocacy can be seen through creation of the Center for Public Health Advocacy at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) [ 61 , 62 ] as well as the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Northeastern University (although this resides in the school of law). [ 63 ] Others, like the UCLA Fielding SPH\u2019s advocacy fellowships, [ 56 , 64 ] and UC Berkeley SPH and JHSPH\u2019s advocacy courses and certificates [ 65 \u2013 67 ], demonstrate their support through capacity strengthening programs for individuals.\n\nRegardless of variations in emphasis on advocacy-like engagement, SPHs in the USA are increasingly establishing structures and processes to encourage contributions to public health decision-making. This is apparent in clear guidelines and definitions of activism, advocacy, and lobbying permitted within the Yale SPH [ 60 ]. It is also apparent in institutionalized forms such as the establishment of the Activist lab at Boston University SPH where they define an activist as \u201cone that aims to bring about foundational change\u201d and therefore incorporate advocacy training as part of SPH curricula as well as through independent workshops. They also dedicate October as Activist Month.\n\nDoberstein [ 14 , 58 ] found that, at least amongst Canadian decision-makers, that academic research was perceived with and afforded greater credibility than that from think tanks and advocacy organizations. Similarly, Kotcher et al [ 59 ] suggest members of the public have expectations of researchers related to engagement. An internal decision-making heuristic using status, expertise and authority as a filter [ 14 ] has great implications for academic researchers in terms of privilege, expectations, responsibility and opportunity.\n\nResearch translation and use are increasingly appearing as cornerstone goals across SPHs. SPH faculty however, vary widely in the extent to which they engage with stakeholders\u2013particularly policymakers [ 27 \u2013 30 ] and/or produce research outputs that are timely, relevant and useful [ 31 ]. There are several reasons for this: First, the distinction between \u201cpure science\u201d and \u201capplied science\u201d remain entrenched amongst some scientists [ 32 ]; Second, the academic incentive structure values research grants, publications, and teaching as currency, with implementation or practice activities often viewed as ancillary [ 27 , 29 , 33 \u2013 42 ] despite mission statements that prioritize both; Third, the policy environments and the processes for decision-making are complex\u2014involving a multitude of actors, varying timelines and competing political priorities. Navigating this arena is often foreign and unchartered for many faculty. Efforts to engage in this arena that are not transactional or instrumental in nature but instead genuine and relational, appear nebulous, daunting, and dependent on relationships [ 28 , 41 , 43 \u2013 48 ]. Fourth, engaging on a policy issue is seen by some academics as contradictory to their core endeavors while for others being activist-academics [ 49 , 50 ] or policy entrepreneurs [ 51 , 52 ] is central to their role. This institutes a (false) dichotomy between activist and theorist [ 49 , 53 , 54 ] and ultimately results in (self) censorship [ 15 ]. This inevitably compromises an SPH\u2019s ability to achieve these aspects of its mission.\n\nAs the US government\u2014federal as well as state\u2013increasingly engages in regulating various aspects of the health system, clear definitions of advocacy, lobbying and political activities appear on some of the agency websites [ 25 , 26 ]. We note that these may at times differ from the pure dictionary meanings and therefore political organizations\u2013as well as academic organizations engaging with them\u2013often provide specificity around their own boundaries surrounding these terms as well as associated activities.\n\nThe various noun and verb definitions of Advocacy, Activism, and Lobbying between the British Oxford English Dictionary (OED) [ 23 ] and the American Merriam Webster Dictionary (MWD) [ 24 ] indicate subtle differences in meaning within the English language. Both the British and American definitions of advocate are similar with the mention of public support for a cause, person, or policy. The OED further indicates advocacy as a public action. Also, both dictionaries clearly state lobbying as intent to influence a legislator or member of a legislative body. The differences appear starker however in the definition of activist/activism whereby the British OED provides a more political orientation than American MWD, with a specific focus on affecting political change. The consistency between these definitions of expressing active, as opposed to passive pursuit of influence is however notable. There are implications therefore not only in Western organizations but also former colonies in the Global South that encompass meanings and interpretations based on language and historic politics.\n\nWe begin by outlining how these three terms\u2013advocacy, activism and lobbying\u2014are defined in the purist form. Recognizing that the literature as well as researchers likely come from different Western ideologies of training, we perused British as well as American dictionary definitions as seen in S1 Table .\n\nThe intentionality to affect timely and relevant change as a result of policy (or other) research results is key to activism, advocacy and lobbying. However, the interpretation of the terms and the activities associated with them vary.\n\nThe relevance of research to practice, policy and the public has been emphasized by funders [ 1 \u2013 6 ], governments [ 7 , 8 ], decision makers [ 9 , 10 ] and other scholars in the social sciences [ 11 \u2013 14 ]. This form of \u2018engaged scholarship\u2019 [ 15 \u2013 19 ] is notable in policy-focused public health research [ 20 , 21 ]. With respect to academia, historically, universities were reputed as institutions conducting theoretical, abstract research accessible primarily to the intellectual elite. Over time they have begun to shed this perception by demonstrating emphasis and efforts towards policy and social impact, dissemination and communication of research, through formal institutional vision and mission statements. The changing landscape of academia reflects on the evolving role of a researcher in the field of public health from academia to encompassing activism, advocacy, or lobbying: a researchers that is perhaps more assertively engaged, and perhaps, more impactful.\n\nCodes were extracted for content and multiple responses for a single participant were then consolidated in Excel using the framework method for analysis [ 87 ]. Respondent quotes were extracted using deductive thematic analysis and coded based on predetermined categories associated with interview questions. Following initial analysis overarching themes emerged from which inductive thematic analysis resulted in a number of subthemes that centered around advocacy activities. Since these were unanticipated, in addition to inductive thematic analysis transcripts were additionally searched for the terms \u2018advocacy\u2019, \u2018lobbying\u2019, and \u2018activism\u2019 in order to collate those quotes appropriate for additional thematic analysis. The resulting quotes painted a robust picture of the complex nature of advocacy and its role or place in faculty decision-maker engagement.\n\nEligible faculty and decision-makers were contacted a maximum of twice for interviews occurring between November 1, 2017 to February 5, 2018 either in-person, over video Skype, or by telephone. Interviews typically lasted between 30\u201375 minutes depending on respondent availability and were audio-recorded with participant verbal consent. Participant responses were transcribed verbatim, and all transcripts were imported into ATLAS.ti [ 86 ] for analysis. A common codebook was developed to inform thematic analysis; a sample of transcripts were co-coded by the study team and reviewed as a group, in order to establish inter-coder reliability while remaining transcripts were coded individually.\n\nThere were no direct questions on activism, advocacy or lobbying but opinions on these emerged organically when asked questions about the nature of engagement between faculty and decision-makers -more specifically how faculty became involved with a particular issue and how evidence was promoted or shared with decision-makers, and ways in which JHSPH could provide training for faculty with these engagements. For decision-makers questions that explored the role of researchers in bringing evidence to bear on the decision-making process, and potential facilitators and barriers to evidence-informed decision-making elicited responses relevant to activism, advocacy and lobbying.\n\nAs with previous mixed-method studies [ 29 , 83 , 84 ], ours consisted of a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. The initial phase of our study was conducted between May\u2013December of 2016 and sociometric surveys were used to map academic faculty and decision-maker networks. In establishing faculty decision-maker network maps, we sought to determine what factors were involved in building and maintaining relationships by performing in-depth interviews with a subsample of faculty and decision-makers. The faculty that were selected for interviews met the following inclusion criteria: Highly engaged\u2014Faculty who had 5 or more contacts with decision-makers at any one government level and/or in the top 10 percentile of those with the most connections across all four government levels (n = 49); Non-engaged- Faculty with 0 or 1 contacts with decision-makers (n = 57). Inclusion criteria for decision-makers focused on those who were mentioned by faculty on 2 or more occasions (n = 92).\n\nOur initial study population consisted of 211 full-time faculty from JHSPH yielding relationship with over 700 decision-makers at the Baltimore city, Maryland state, USA federal, and global levels [ 28 ]. Decision-makers were defined as those individuals in a position to make decisions or exert influence in a decision-making situation and who plays a key role in the administration or leadership of an organization.\n\nFocused attention to advocacy within programs relevant to family and reproductive health was also apparent through the Gates Foundation launch of the Advance Family Planning (AFP) advocacy initiative at JHSPH in 2009 [ 81 ]. Furthermore, interest in understanding how advocacy manifests at JHSPH and its implications was explored in 2013 and led to recommendations for a high-level forum on public health advocacy [ 82 ]. In this white paper, Rimon et al [ 82 ] define advocacy as follows: \u201cAdvocacy aims to influence policy and practices in ways that benefit people\u2019s health and well-being and the societies in which they live. Advocates within government, civil society and academia use evidence and other rationales to improve the social good by:\n\nAt the time of this research, elements of SPH attention to advocacy was established and growing. For instance, JHPSH was offering a course in Health Advocacy by the Department of Health Policy and Management [ 73 ] and one on Media Advocacy and Public health by the Department of Health Behavior and Society [ 74 ]. Faculty publications of advocacy relevant topics were also diverse ranging from informing policy debates on critical issues such as injury [ 75 ] and mental illness and gun policy [ 76 ], to the role of public health professionals in informing the judiciary [ 77 ], to implications for public health education and curricula [ 78 \u2013 80 ].\n\nThe University as a whole is registered as a private, tax-exempt non-profit organization. For this reason, it is required to report faculty and staff activities that may enter the realm of advocacy and/or lobbying, with restrictions on certain activities. Ensuring that employees understand this has been important to the administration- guidelines for identifying as well as reporting such activities are frequently shared with faculty through email as well as through an online guiding document [ 71 ] and website [ 72 ]. Furthermore, the Office of Government and community affairs at JHU \u201cworks to build and strengthen Johns Hopkins\u2019 relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders\u201dand faculty can contact them with questions through the weblink ( http://web.jhu.edu/administration/gca ).\n\nJHSPH was founded in 1916 and is the largest school of public health in the world comprised of 10 departments, over 70 centers and institutes, and approximately 2200 faculty. Located in Baltimore, JHSPH has unique physical access to city, state and federal government agencies. The school\u2019s primary campus is just 1.5 miles from City Hall, 27 miles from the Maryland State House and just 38 miles from the United States Capitol in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cWe had to think about how we protect the scientific definition [\u2026] so that they couldn\u2019t change our research and that is absolutely essential. If I have scientific evidence that could be vulnerable to legislation, I would put a layer on top of it and change the name slightly so that is what gets changed in legislation rather than the actual research itself.\u201d (Decisionmaker_City_3).\n\nFrom the decision-makers\u2019 perspective, there appeared to be concurrence about the potential role of intermediaries. Some suggested that there may indeed be better presenters of research results and their implications than the academics themselves, describing helpful interactions with such actors. Whereas others expressed that this translation was precisely the role of academics due to their credibility and expertise: \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to testify, we always bring JHU in. They are included in the whole process, but we write our own briefs and remarks and presentations based on the data (that JHU provides).\u201d (Decisionmaker_City_3).\n\nThere was concern however that funding research for the intention of policy and practice influence could misguide research that otherwise may have been more important to public health.\n\nFederal as well as Global decision-makers in our respondent pool often played the role of funder, thereby steering the research to questions more applicable to anticipated and relevant policy and practice decisions. In such cases, decision-makers themselves play the role of advocates using evidence to demonstrate support for or against a policy decision. This process does not only relieve the responsibility for advocacy from the academic but may also be an opportunity for an indirect activist to enter into engagements that will advance EIDM.\n\n\u201cBut also depending on the funder, funding mechanisms can make it possible to create relationships with policy makers so you would naturally be in contact with them. For example, in these UNICEF and USAID funded projects you may be engaging with a minister of health or more often at a lower level than the minister \u2026\u201d (Assistant_Professor_2).\n\n\u201cIs there funding that can include or expect engagement with policymakers? Yes, that\u2019s all my finding. That\u2019s what my program is. I\u2019m going to take the science to Capitol Hill, I\u2019m going to work with advocacy groups, I\u2019m going to develop some of the science. I\u2019m going to bring that into teaching. I\u2019m going to do outreach, etc\u201d (Associate_Professor_1).\n\nOther intermediaries with particularly significant influence in the research and engagement process are funders. Respondents shared examples where funders increasingly pushed for research outcomes over outputs, while others noted that recent cuts in USA federal spending on research heightened the need to both demonstrate impacts of research as well as continue advocating for renewed investment.\n\nA handful of respondents expressed that such centralized entities could play an important role in the process of faculty and policymaker engagement through their ability and expertise to advocate or lobby. This was noted as the case for the Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse, and the Center for a Livable Future. The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing noted that \u201c\u2026there is an MOU between the University of Konstanz in Germany and JHSPH\u2014where there is a full time person in the European Parliament who is registered as a Lobbyist\u2026used to have the same on the US side\u2026\u201d (Professor_1).\n\nAnother idea revolved around creating and/or leveraging dedicated roles for activism and advocacy. For instance, University-based Research Centers (URCs) or Institutes at JHU provide a platform for advocacy activities: \u201cthe (decisionmakers) all came to the table to talk about our center and our work and (center director) is leading that relationship between those individuals to try to push along some legislation: trying to decide when (they) go to the Hill (sic) with these issues, what exactly should they propose etc\u2026.\u201d (Research_Associate_1). Many such URCs have advocacy as part of their mission thereby legitimizing such activities and permitting employment of dedicated staff for information dissemination or advocacy.\n\nProfessional associations like the American Public Health Association were also reported to play a similar role of facilitation due to their ability to hire third-party expertise for advocacy efforts. However, faculty noted that these efforts were further from members\u2019 control due to the vast and broad membership structure of these types of associations. Their value toward advocacy was also noted by a decision-maker respondent \u201cCivil Service Organizations have an important role to play either as a lobbyist or driver (toward evidence informed decision making) for an academic\u201d (Decisionmaker_Global_2).\n\nOne way around the concern about risking reputation, neutrality and potentially even university rules was to tailor some of the research outputs in ways that they could be used by professional advocacy organizations. These strategies ranged from looking ahead to policy opportunities on the horizon and tailoring research questions appropriately, to writing up summaries of research findings in a format usable by advocacy organizations (i.e. a policy brief): \u201cSo, while I feed information and partner with advocacy groups, I don\u2019t have conversations with a policymaker. It just stops at like a factsheet, a training, something like that. I certainly do promote my work with nonacademic stakeholders.\u201d (Assistant_Scientist_1).\n\nOftentimes, forms of indirect advocacy were viewed in a positive light in contrast to more direct forms of advocacy. For instance, some faculty members expressed being more comfortable participating in general advocacy for broad categorical issues like funding for public health activities, while remaining a safer distance away from taking a position on specific pieces of legislation. Others said they join nonprofit associations that fund advocacy work they agree with and use opportunities like \u201clobbying days\u201d organized by those association bodies to participate. Structures such as these offer a space for personal engagements with an independent association to be clearly distinguished from professional engagements perceived to be associated with the SPH.\n\nFaculty also noted that having more seniority within the school was an influential factor: \u201cI think some of the advocacy rulings of the university are constraining for young faculty who are developing their career paths\u2026.\u201d (Professor_6). However, another junior faculty member recognized that having access to the school\u2019s senior researchers, and the reputation they carry could also facilitate advocacy opportunities for them, \u201c[This] is a leading SPH and so the researchers, especially senior researchers are some if not the best in the world. (Name redacted) has been working in this issue for 30 years so has a wealth of knowledge; unlike me who is only in (his/her) 30s.\u201d (Research_Associate_1)\n\nFaculty willingness and likelihood to engage with decision-makers and advocate for change in a meaningful way was sometimes inhibited by their ability to do so. Several respondents expressed that a significant barrier to advocacy was simply a discomfort with the skills and traits needed to be a successful advocate. \u201cI don\u2019t know the first thing on (advocating for educational tax exemptions) and I would love some training for doing that.\u201d (Assistant_Scientist_2). Many faculty respondents expressed an interest in advocacy training, which included skills such as problem identification, power mapping, coalition building and communications. Additionally, some noted that the school itself had the skills in house to create advocacy resources for current academics. Others suggested increasing the emphasis on advocacy skills as a part of graduate school curriculum.\n\nFaculty noted that the rules for visits to the State and Federal legislature came with increased scrutiny as faculty members were required to report these to the university. \u201cI\u2019ve seen faculty reprimanded for jumping past the lobbyists and representing the university.\u201d (Professor_4). This is likely justified in most cases since faculty are generally permitted to speak in their individual capacities but not as representatives of the university, a regulation that is common across most institutions. One respondent indicated that while they empathize with the SPH\u2019s concerns from a legal standpoint, this hinders the cause of research informing action.\n\nOpinions on this support began to diverge, however, when there was a perception of \u2018politicization\u2019 or \u2018disabled neutrality\u2019- oftentimes occurring in parallel with word choice. For instance, if the word \u201clobbying\u201d was used in conjunction with or as replacement for \u201cactivism\u201d or \u201cadvocacy\u201d, perceptions of leadership support altered. The interpretation of \u201clobbying\u201d clearly varied amongst faculty with concerns that perhaps how faculty interpret relevant activities may not align with guidance from the SPH: \u201cWe are very concerned about lobbying, we are very concerned with use of the Johns Hopkins name, and all of that becomes a little intimidating for some faculty who really get the message of against talking to the policymakers because it could interfere with the Johns Hopkins message that they\u2019re trying to convey.\u201d (Professor_3)\n\nFrom the faculty perspective, support from leadership on engaging in advocacy activities was recognized and welcomed: \u201cI appreciate that management understands that advocacy is important. Because in public health, if you aren\u2019t trying to change things for the better you aren\u2019t really fulfilling your goals as a health professional.\u201d (Associate_Professor_1).\n\nIn order for faculty to engage in advocacy activities, the role of the institution was also raised. Decision-makers appeared to appreciate efforts made from the SPH, in contrast to individual faculty, to engage with them on key matters pertaining to policy and practice decision-making. However, one decision-maker indicated wanting to see more of this.\n\nWhile academics described their decisionmaker engagements and their willingness to publicly advocate for certain policy or practice influence, they also shared concerns about the need to maintain an unbiased and/or neutral reputation. \u201cThere is always a concern of being an impartial scientist and not being objective.\u201d (Assistant_Scientist_1). This was echoed by decisionmakers, \u201cActually when we work with experts, we ask for declaration of interests and we don\u2019t engage with researchers who will gain benefits from the policy area\u2013it could be both financial or their own academic interests. Ensuring scientific integrity and rigor.\u201d (Decisionmaker_Global_1).\n\nDecisionmaker respondents did not express a clear opinion either in support of or in opposition topolicy engagement being an inherent responsibility of academics. However, several of these respondents shared that academics engaging with intention was becoming increasingly more common. \u201c\u2026we cannot generalize- but we see more and more certain academic groups being more concerned about the implications of their work.\u201d (Decisionmaker_City_2). One decisionmaker noted that rules around registering as a lobbyist were different based on city or county level, and they found that restrictions on academics to register as a lobbyist in one city to be a limiting factor for their ability to influence policy.\n\nWhile extremely reluctant to \u201cspeak for others\u201d, faculty respondents offered hypothetical contrary positions to their own. \u201c\u2026obviously different areas of research lend themselves more to policy advocacy than others\u201d (Professor_2). In addition, several faculty did note that one\u2019s career can still be successful even in the absence of engaging in advocacy, and in some cases, even necessary. However, those who subscribe to the importance of advocacy posit that careers should not be at risk since: \u201cI think [the University] is big enough to allow some to do this [advocacy], and some to do that [no advocacy].\u201d (Professor_3).\n\n\u201cThere is a general feeling that doing advocacy is kind of like doing a four-letter word act in public. You\u2019re somehow \u201ctainted\u201d if you\u2019re an advocate. I believe there are many people who subscribe to that philosophy. They feel research is a pure thing, and the only way to advance is to do really good research. I obviously don\u2019t agree with that. It\u2019s just not correct, although there are many people who feel that way.\u201d (Associate_Professor_1).\n\n\u201cI think most researchers are still scientifically minded and believe research should be scientific at their core and not be influenced by policy or policymakers and believe researcher\u2019s job is to do the science, provide the evidence and somebody else should take the baton and pass it along.\u201d (Assistant_Professor_1).\n\nRegardless of the level of government that faculty engaged with, we found a variety of perspectives on whether advocacy falls under the remit of researchers. Most faculty expressed that the active pursuit of engagement with decision-makers for the purposes of influencing decisions was an inherent responsibility or duty of an academic. \u201cI think it\u2019s always good to be an advocate for what your department is doing, what you are doing, what you can bring to the table and you need to be a voice as you can\u2019t expect people to always reach out.\u201d (Assistant_Professor_1).\n\nFaculty as well as city decisionmakers were well aware that the City government tends to have fewer resources at its disposal, particularly for research. The onus, therefore, of seeking out what types of information City officials need to improve health-related policy appears to rest on the research community. Faculty felt that that city-level decision-makers were, in several cases, more accessible than state, federal or global policy decision-makers and therefore this responsibility didn\u2019t appear too contentious.\n\nFaculty respondents were acutely aware of the differences in engaging with various levels of government, both in terms of mission as well as process. In one such example, a faculty member noted that the \u201clower\u201d levels were focused on solving high-urgency health problems while the \u201chigher\u201d levels were focused on writing longer term policy improvements. However, there was little discussion or mention of the uniqueness to global policy advocacy.\n\nAmongst the three terms \u201clobbyist\u201d when used in its noun form was the clearest and least contested due to its political underpinning despite inconsistencies on who was target audience. However, in its verb form, it was often used interchangeably with the verb \u201cto advocate.\u201d Activities therefore were more favorably viewed that labels: ie doing advocacy work was different than being called an advocate. The terms \u201cactivist\u201d and \u201cactivism\u201d appeared more rarely.\n\n\u201cMany folks in academia are not aware of the fact that they more than likely need to register as lobbyists for what they are doing and that became problem with one group. I think the Bill was introduced \u2026and there was a brouhaha as they (the academic colleague) hadn\u2019t registered as a lobbyist\u2014and the reason I think was that they were pursuing or working under a grant that expressly indicated that they can\u2019t engage in lobbying, or however it was expressed in the grant. Therefore, they might have lost the grant if they did register and that became a problem\u201d (Decisionmaker_City_1).\n\n\u201cI sit on one of the study section panels that reviews grants for (The National Institute of) General Medical Sciences (GMS) and we are instructed that we do not review a grant in translation to something bigger. We review it on its science, its discovery. There\u2019s a whole part of (NIH) that is devoted to new science, and I would say that maybe 60\u201370% of our money comes from GMS\u201d (Professor_4).\n\n\u201cLobbying\u2014That needs to be addressed at your (academics\u2019) end\u2026Are you working under some grant or other restraint against lobbying? And what does that mean? I mean lobbying could mean a lot of things. It could mean political lobbying\u2014that is not technical lobbying in our terms. Lobbying means communicating with the legislative body to seek change and you are expending or spending salary payment for that and that could be internal even if you are an employee.\u201d (Decisionmaker_City_1).\n\nDecision-makers provided different interpretations of the rules that govern lobbying at various jurisdictions, particularly when recounting their experiences with faculty running against the rules for lobbying. We note this in the first quote below by a City government official, which was supported by a response from a faculty member:\n\nOne faculty member acknowledged the lack of clarity around the definition of lobbying\u2013whether it meant trying to influence decision-making with research\u2013stating: \u201cWe could have several lengthy arguments about whether providing scientific advice is lobbying\u201d (Professor_1).\n\nWhile we did not ask questions specific to advocacy, activism, and lobbying in our interviews, faculty members often responded to our questions about faculty/decision-maker engagement by raising notions of one or more of these. However, utilization of the terms often deviated from the official definitions of these and were used more colloquially. For example, the term \u201clobbying\u201d was sometimes used to describe efforts to influence people and issues far beyond the political parameter set by the dictionary definition\u2014using it to describe efforts to influence non-politician or legislative bodies such as university leadership for a range of things from additional resources to new policies.\n\nThe recognition of engagement being driven by the goal of influencing an outcome was expressed consistently by decision-makers and embedded in their stories of initiation and motivation behind partnerships: \u201cAny proactive form of engagement and trying to communicate that value of a piece of science for public health purpose (is welcomed).\u201d (Decisionmaker_Global_1)\n\nWe report on the dominant themes that appeared from our interviews which include how the various terms are perceived; differences across government levels; the role of academics in advocacy; and examples of advocacy activities (direct as well as indirect).\n\nAn overview of the 52 faculty participants can be found in S2 Table . Of the 92 decision-makers eligible from Phase I, only 69 were still in their original roles or with the organization during phase II. Of those 24 participated in the study with the following distribution: City\u20146, State\u2013 9, Federal\u2013 3, and Global\u2013 6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs academia traverses from generating purely scientific impact to additional social and policy impact, the roles of researchers, decision-makers and the citizens in the research-to-impact interface is also evolving. However, the path to impact can vary from dispassionate dissemination of research evidence to more engaged advocacy. SPHs promote faculty and research impact through mechanisms such as translation of research results into public policy. However, at what point does this comprise activism, advocacy or lobbying? For those who enter the field of public health to have an impact on the populations they serve\u2014and with school missions echoing this same notion\u2014it can seem counterintuitive and even confusing to be both, encouraged to influence policy while having mechanisms that prohibit influencing politics, when the two are so intertwined.\n\nWe studied the perceptions of such activities with academic faculty at one SPH as well as those of decision-makers from the City, State, Federal and global agencies who engage with the SPH. This was against the backdrop of studies that and perceptions capturing conflicting support, encouragement, resistance and distaste for activities comprising these terms across a variety of stakeholders in the research to policy and practice interface.\n\nWe focus on two ideas in this section: The first is what we know and how to think about academics as activists, advocates and lobbyists. The second summarizes lessons for scholars, administrators and higher education leadership who are attempting to align the practices of their faculty with the missions of the organization.\n\nA is for\u2026? While activism, advocacy and lobbying are components of the larger movement on engagement with decision-makers (stakeholder engagement, integrated knowledge translation, co-production of research etc.) they do not present the same benefits or challenges as other activities that fall under the larger umbrella given the contentious nature of their interpretation. Our results indicate that discordant perceptions about how much activism, advocacy and lobbying faculty should be engaging in, results from how each term is defined, interpreted and reported by the individuals, the SPH and government agencies. Personal values, professional norms, and institutional regulations across contexts vary greatly, presenting heterogeneity in where academics lie on what can be described as a continuum of activism [88, 89] regardless of how they self-identify, given some commonalities inherent to their pursuit of socially relevant research [53]. This may be compounded by differences in even purist definitions of these terms across British and American dictionaries that imply cultural embeddedness in how these activities are perceived and encouraged. It is therefore not surprising that we see diverging opinions in how SPH faculty perceive, judge and engage in advocacy activities. It is also not surprising that these opinions result in either implicit and unrecognized activism, explicit but downplayed advocacy, or explicit and celebrated strategies. Similar to studies from the UK [55], our study suggests that these interpretations conceptualize advocacy as either \u201crepresentational\u201d or \u201cfacilitational\u201d [90]. There is a danger that \u2018benign and acceptable\u2019 activities currently supporting evidence informed decisions may suffer rejection or retribution if indeed they are officially recognized as advocacy. Without definitional clarity, the debates and confusion are likely to persist. We therefore recommend dedicated attention to providing this clarity and ensuring that faculty and partners alike have a clear understanding of the activities that fall within each. Scholars studying the challenges of academic engagement with decision-makers have garnered experiences from several contexts to provide guidance on strategies for engagement [29, 91\u201393] as well as tools to support enhanced use of research findings [94\u201396]. However, any academic endeavor in advocacy training would need to be coupled with experiential opportunities if deep learning and true competency is desired [56], else, theory is unlikely to translate into practice. Some programs that attempt to address this goal include The Science and Technology Policy Fellowship [97], and the Health Policy Fellowship [98]. The results of the current study suggests that HEIs and programs would benefit from additional translational partnerships with relevant academic entities. It would be remiss not to recognize the impact of the recent COVID-19 Pandemic which has resulted in sweeping attention to public health, public health experts and SPHs globally. We have seen several academics previously not used to public engagement being requested to provide their thoughts, opinions and advice thereby throwing them into the public eye. It is likely that previous established professional connections catalysed some experts receiving more requests than others. As one faculty member at a UK-based University reported in an academic professional news publication \u201cthe challenge of COVID-19 has produced a range of new and productive relationships between the academic and policy worlds. It has demonstrated the huge potential for bringing together government with a much wider range of disciplines than has traditionally been the case. But the future of these relationships is far from assured\u201d [99]. The above may have provided encouragement for some researchers to engage with\u2014or caused others to shirk further away from\u2014the public eye during the pandemic. Regardless of the effect on academics, what the pandemic has shown is that evidence-informed decision making is critical and that evidence from academia is considered rigorous, trustworthy and relevant in times such as these. It has also shown that skills to engage with the public and in advocacy are critical to advance changes in policy, practice as well as public attitudes and knowledge.\n\nImplications for researchers, scholars and academic faculty For scholars who explicitly identify as activist-academics [49, 50] or policy entrepreneurs [51, 52] there is a recognition that their research interests align with their political values and beliefs [100] resulting in advocacy being entrenched in their very approach to research. For such faculty, direct advocacy doesn\u2019t present much discomfort. However, understanding whether they should expect indifference, support or discouragement from the administration can present anxiety. For academics struggling with the cognitive dissonance of remaining a neutral academic while still trying to affect policy or practice change, one option would be to engage in indirect advocacy. This could be by aligning professionally with an epistemic community that contributes to the actions of an advocacy coalition [101] or more personally with a social movement. Weible et al [101] highlight the differences between different types of political associations\u2013in particular, advocacy coalitions\u2014championed by \u201cpolicy actors\u201d trying to influence policy\u2014and epistemic communities\u2013championed by experts trying to influence policy. The intensity and length of time of such associations may be determined by the nature of the policy problem in terms of its threat (eg: chronic, acute, sporadic,) its temporality (eg: sudden, enduring, etc) and in its likely affect (for example, coalition formation and/or maintenance) [101] thereby permitting academics to engage in different ways. Such associations serve as intermediaries or knowledge brokers between the research and policy community. Other intermediaries that can also serve a brokering function include funders, the media, consortia [102], and knowledge translation platforms\u2013particularly in LMICs [103\u2013106]. Public health as a field often involves public health policy and programmatic studies that are essential to its evidence base and its relevance. Because policy studies and relevance are so critical to public health, one might posit that there are more such instances of interactions between public health academics and policy and programmatic partners in government. While this can certainly occur in medicine and law, perhaps public health has an especially close nexus to policy making relevance. Regardless of how academics choose to engage and where on the continuum they lie, we recommend reflective scholarship as critical for enhanced contribution to change [107, 108]. This reflexivity and positionality, we argue, extends to SPHs as well.\n\nImplications for SPHs and other Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) globally Reflection on institutional opportunities, policies and processes for faculty advancement and promotion need to occur to recognize, support and reward efforts and activities that promote engagement with stakeholders with the aim to influence change in policy and/or practices [109\u2013113]. We assert that these need to be cognizant of the varied foci of the various departments within an SPH as well as the predilections and seniority of faculty. This may also vary across SPHs that are embedded in universities or HEIs that bear different legal status\u2019 (eg private vs public, for profit vs not-for-profit etc). Guidance however, on how to navigate this space can be found through several organizations [26, 114, 115] Given that definitions vary between British and American dictionaries, we posit that these terms manifest differently across faculty regardless of training, or across practice of activities that fall under these definitions in different parts of the world. We urge SPHs such as JHSPH that comprise international faculty and engage with stakeholders globally, to seek to clarify these terms, identify permissible and prohibited activities that fall within them, and ensure that all staff are aware of these. Furthermore, we recommend that these be accessible to all stakeholders that the SPH engages with in order to avoid confusion and manage expectations regarding the extent to which faculty can engage, particularly with respect to policy decision-making. One question remains however: if the formal rules on lobbying are limited to legislatures, what does that mean for engagement with administrative / agency officials? We call on SPHs to facilitate this discussion further.\n\nAdvancing advocacy at JHSPH Advocacy has increasingly become important at JHSPH since the beginning of this study. In 2018 the strategic plan for JHSPH highlighted advocacy among the goals set forth in order to \u2018set the best course for the school\u2019s future and unleash the power of public health\u2019 [116]. More specifically, it urges faculty to go beyond scientific publications and become better at engaging decision-makers and others of the importance of evidence-informed programs and policy. With a core strategy of the school over the next four years being one of advocacy, the launch of the Center for Public Health Advocacy housed within the Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health, is well situated to \u2018support a culture of evidence-based advocacy\u2019 [62] and enhance faculty capacity to reach this goal. We have seen the advent of more courses being offered such as Policy Advocacy in Low- and Middle-Income Countries through the Department of International Health\u2019s Summer Institute [67], thereby implicating yet another department at the SPH in the quest for capacity strengthening in advocacy. Furthermore, a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies provides support for Science communication and advocacy through the Bloomberg Health Initiative [117, 118]. The implications of nuanced terminology and its interpretation in practice at the local as well as the global level should be of primary interest for an internationally reputed institution such as JHSPH that seeks to build the next generation of (culturally) competent public health researchers and faculty at the local, national and global levels. Knowledge, skills and enhanced faculty competence in advocacy therefore becomes critical for the SPH."}, {"url": "https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/15-women-leading-way-girls-education", "page_content": "Across the globe, about 31 million girls of primary school age are not in school.

As Tony says, When you serve something greater than yourself, whether it be your family, your local community or at a global level, you discover a deeper purpose and and create more meaning in your life. In the U.S. there is a strong culture of philanthropy \u2013 high net worth individuals who have chosen to donate financial resources to communities and causes that need support. Tony is one of many people making a positive impact in the world by supporting causes that matter to him personally. For years, Tony has given to others, from leading the 1 Billion Meals Challenge with Feeding America (which has helped provide more than 850 million meals so far to those in need), to working with Operation Underground Railroad to prevent child trafficking, Tony\u2019s learned that the key to fulfillment lies in giving. Famous philanthropists make their impact in the world by giving back a portion of their monetary wealth. Even if you don\u2019t have large pools of capital to deploy into nonprofits or other recipients, you can still give \u2013 your time, your energy, or whatever resources you have that you\u2019d like to share. In this way, everyone can become a philanthropist.\n\nYou can make a positive difference in the lives of others right now Start giving back today\n\nWhat is a philanthropist? To find the keys to becoming a philanthropist, no matter your financial means, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the question, \u201cWhat is a philanthropist?\u201d Let\u2019s start with the philanthropist meaning straight from the dictionary: phi\u00b7lan\u00b7thro\u00b7pist /f\u0259\u02c8lanTHr\u0259p\u0259st/ noun: philanthropist; plural noun: philanthrophists 1. a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. In short, a philanthropist is someone who donates their money, experience, time, talent or skills to help others and create a better world. Though we often think of them as people who have millions of dollars to donate, you don\u2019t have to be a famous philanthropist with a huge net worth to qualify. This is just one of a few misconceptions about how to be a philanthropist.\n\nWhat are the benefits of being a philanthropist? Most philanthropists aren\u2019t in it for fame or recognition. The biggest benefit of being a philanthropist is that it fulfills some of our deepest human needs. We all have these needs: certainty, significance, variety, love/connection, growth and contribution. Which of these needs is most important to us and the ways we go about fulfilling them are what make us who we are. Philanthropy fulfills our need for contribution. Have you ever reached a major milestone in your life \u2013 your dream job, starting a business, financial freedom \u2013 and wondered why you still feel like something is missing? It\u2019s likely because you\u2019re not fulfilling your need for contribution. As Tony says, \u201cIt is not what we get, but who we become and what we contribute that gives meaning to our lives.\u201d Being a philanthropist can actually improve your own life, too. The law of attraction states that we get back the energy we put into the world. By focusing on giving back, making a difference and creating positive change, you\u2019ll create a cycle that brings abundance back to you tenfold.\n\nIs there a difference between charity and philanthropy? Charity is the actual action that is taken to improve someone\u2019s life: stocking shelves at a food bank like Tony\u2019s Feeding America project, building shelters for refugees or providing medical care after a disaster. As an organization, a charity is the entity that coordinates and supplies these on-the-ground services. Philanthropy is what supplies charities with the funds, personnel and equipment they need. So what is a philanthropist versus a volunteer?

They have the funds to make a big difference and the social capital to spread their message. You might not have these same resources at your disposal, but you still have the opportunity to make a positive impact. If you can\u2019t donate goods or money, donate your time or skills. The meaning of being a true philanthropist isn\u2019t about money \u2013 it\u2019s about passion. Stay local There are many ways that you can give back to your local community without spending money. Serve at a soup kitchen or stock donations at a food pantry. Make boxes for a meal delivery service. Volunteer with an after-school program, become a mentor to at-risk youth or work at a community center. Find a local cause that speaks to you and donate your time. Raise awareness What is a philanthropist if not someone who uses their position to help better the lives of others? You may not have as much money as famous philanthropists, but you still have plenty to be grateful for. Advocating for a group less fortunate than yourself is the ultimate way to become a philanthropist without spending a cent. Use your skills or experience Everyone has gifts, and many of those gifts are useful when it comes to how to become a philanthropist. Use writing skills to create marketing materials or write grants for a nonprofit. Teach math or reading to disadvantaged kids. If you have knowledge about a specific topic, like the law, accounting or regulations in a certain industry, use it for good. Set aside a small portion of your paycheck Even five dollars a week adds up to more than $250 per year. Save a small amount each week, then make an annual donation at a certain time of year. Donate school supplies in the fall, holiday gifts in the winter or books for summer reading at the beginning of the break.\n\nFAQs about philanthropists What were the biggest charitable donations in 2020?

Both tenses are used to express that an action began in the past and is still going on or has just finished.\n\nThe present perfect simple tends to stand out as mainly being used to express that an action is completed or to emphasise the result.\n\nBut \"to be\" in this tense followed by an adjective or a state (not a verb gerund like \"watching\", but \"happy\" or \"on holiday\", for instance) is a special case and can only exist in this form because the key verb is \"to be\". It would be incorrect to say:\n\n*He has been being...\n\nThis means that whether the action is continuing to the present moment or not, depends on the context or the implications that the verb allows. So, I can say:\n\nI've been at work since 6AM.\n\nAnd this implies that I am still at work right now.\n\nBut then again,\n\nI've been worried sick about you!\n\ndoesn't imply that right this second I'm worried because I'm talking to the person and know they are safe. This tense is used because my worry started in the past, and continued up to the very recent present, but actually stopped just a moment ago.\n\nFor your example, \"involving\" yourself in something isn't the kind of thing you start and stop, but more of an ongoing state (depending heavily on the context though), so even if right this second he isn't doing something that means he is actively involved (like maybe he's eating or sleeping right now), he is still in general involved right now."}]}
