He lived in the house of the former abbot of St Mary\u2019s Abbey in York, which has survived as King\u2019s Manor.\n\nFollowing the death of Archbishop Lee in September 1544, Holgate was named his successor and was consecrated as Archbishop of York at Lambeth in January 1545, renouncing papal authority.\n\nFrom then, the tenets of Protestant theology were regularly expounded in the Minster for the first time, and organ music was abolished. He instructed that the Minster Library be furnished with new Protestant commentaries on the Bible by theologians like Calvin.\n\nArchbishop Holgate founded three grammar schools in 1546, one at his birthplace of Hemsworth in the West Riding, one at Old Malton and one in York.

But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F31981", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "https://tudorsdynasty.com/members-henry-viiis-privy-council-1540/", "page_content": "The Privy Council was a group of men who were advisers to the King. It included a variety of men including those from the religious sector to very important state offices, as you\u2019ll note from the list.\n\nAfter 1540 the Privy Council (19 men) worked together as a board having letters and warrants signed collectively by them.\n\nThe Privy Council sat virtually every day. Within it Court and State became as one, for the Privy Council met almost exclusively at Court after the reconstructions of 1536-7 and 1540. It also sat judicially as the Court of Star Chamber on Wednesdays and Fridays: councillors commuted by horse or barge to Westminster. -Tudors.org\n\nHere are the nineteen men who were part of Henry VIII\u2019s Privy Council in 1540, with a brief description:\n\nThomas Audley, Lord Chancellor\n\nThomas Audley, Lord Chancellor became a member of Henry VIII\u2019s Privy Chamber in 1527 and was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1533 after the resignation of Thomas More.\n\nThomas Audley had a very illustrious career at Tudor court. In 1529, he received two titles when he was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Speaker of the House of Commons. In 1532, Audley was knighted and also succeeded Sir Thomas More as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. In 1533, he was\ufffdappointed Lord Chancellor succeeding Sir Thomas More and on 29th of November 1538 he was created Baron Audley of Walden and installed as a Knight of the Garter shortly afterward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that Audley was friendly toward Henry VIII\ufffds agenda. One could say this is why he was given so many great titles, especially Lord Chancellor. He backed the King on his desire to divorce Katherine of Aragon and his marriage to Anne Boleyn. Audley\ufffdpresided at the trials of Fisher and More in 1535, and was again part of the trials in 1536, during the downfall of Anne Boleyn and the men around her.\n\nWe know that Henry VIII \ufffdinterfered so much in the chancellor\ufffds domestic concerns as to command him to marry, and to bring about the match, and promise to endow him accordingly\ufffd\ufffd\n\nAudley married Elizabeth Grey sometime between 1538 and 1540 \ufffd she was his second wife. About 1540 Elizabeth gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Margaret Audley.\n\nThomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden died on 30 April 1544\n\nSir John Baker, Chancellor of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths\n\nSir John Baker was a well-known figure at court and had the reputation as a brutal persecutor of protestants which earned him the nickname \u2018Bloody Baker\u2019. Legend says that he was riding to persecute some protestants when he heard Queen Mary had died. The place where he turned back became known as Baker\u2019s Cross\n\nIn June 1540 he was knighted and the same year he was a member of Henry\u2019s Privy Council. In 1545, he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nBaker first married Katherine Sackville and then Elizabeth Dineley with whom he had five children with.\n\nHe died in London from a short illness in December 1558 less than a month after the death of Queen Mary.\n\nSir Anthony Browne, Master of the Horse\n\n\u201cBrowne gave early evidence of a wayward personality when, in March 1519, he struck a colleague in Sir Thomas Boleyn\ufffds embassy to France. The King demanded the recall of both, but Browne\ufffds career was not to suffer: Boleyn gave him a good report and Francis I on leave taking made him a gentleman of his household with a pension of 200 crowns a year.\u201d \u2013 The History of Parliament\n\nWhen Browne was appointed ambassador to France in 1527, he revealed an\ufffdanimosity to the French court that only grew over the years. \u201cHis despatches strike a slightly petulant note, he found fault with everything, the French manner of hunting, the King\ufffds latest mistress, the Order of St. Michael which he considered a poor copy of the Garter, and the fact that he could find nothing worth purchasing.\u201d Henry VIII must have found Browne a loyal and competent servant since continued to send him on French embassies.\n\nAs Master of the Horse, Browne was in charge of the maintenance of the royal horses. This would include their feeding and training. He would also accompany Henry VIII whenever he rode.\n\nBrowne\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Browne, Countess of Worcester was one of the principle accusers of Anne Boleyn. It was her brother that she confessed an affair between Anne and court musician, Mark Smeaton, as well as incest with her brother, George Boleyn.\n\nWilliam Fitzwilliam, Earl of Southampton, Lord Privy Seal\n\nFitzwilliam, a former servant of Cardinal Wolsey, was a prominent member at court. Like his half-brother, Anthony Browne, in 1536, he was instrumental in bringing down Anne Boleyn.\n\nRaised at court alongside young Henry, Prince of Wales he indeed had a close relationship with the future King. After Henry\u2019s coronation in 1509, Fitzwilliam was made a Gentleman Usher and King\u2019s Cupbearer, and gradually rose at Court.\n\nAs Lord Privy Seal, Fitzwilliam supervised the staff of clerks plus he prepared documents for authentication by the Great Seal.\n\n\u2018He acted as \u201cenforcer\u201d for Henry in the fall of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, the Pilgrimage of Grace and the Exeter Conspiracy. In 1539, as Admiral, he conveyed Anne of Cleves from Calais, and on first meeting her wrote letters in her praise to Henry, \u2018considering it was then no time to dispraise her, \u2026 the matter being so far passed.\u2018\n\nSir John Gage, Comptroller of the Household\n\nAs Comptroller of the Household, Gage was responsible for the royal household\u2019s finances. Along with this position he held several prestigious offices including:\ufffdChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Constable of the Tower\ufffdand Lord Chamberlain.\n\n\u201cAn Esquire of the Body to both Henry VII and Henry VIII, he served offices in the Pale of Calais, becoming Comptroller in 1524. After receiving a knighthood in 1525,\ufffdhe moved to the post of Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in 1526, leaving court in 1533.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe remained active, attending, in 1537, the baptism of Prince Edward and the funeral of Jane Seymour.\u201d\n\nSir John Gage died on 18 Apr. 1556.\ufffd\n\nSir William Petre, King\u2019s Secretary\n\nAs a conservative Catholic he became a secretary to Henry while his second wife, Anne Browne served as lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine Parr. Petre\ufffdis said to have been employed by Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire, as tutor to his son George.\n\nPetre was married twice, firstly to Gertrude Tyrrell in 1533, and after her death in 1541 he married Anne Browne in 1542.\n\n\u201cIn January 1544 Petre was knighted and appointed one of the King\ufffds two principal secretaries, the other being William Paget; a member of the Privy Council virtute officii, he attended its meetings regularly. He was one of the six persons authorized to sign documents with a stamp of the King\ufffds signature and one of the five appointed to advise Queen Catherine Parr during her regency in July 1544.\u201d\n\nSir Richard Rich, King\u2019s Solicitor\n\nDue to Rich\u2019s testimony in 1535, Thomas More was condemned for treason because of a personal conversation the two men had together. Rich was also instrumental in the downfall of Thomas Cromwell in 1542.\n\nAs King\u2019s Solicitor, he went to Kimbolton Castle in January 1536 to take the inventory of the goods of Katherine of Aragon \u2013 he\ufffdthen wrote to the King advising how he might properly obtain her possessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRich was also an assistant executor of the will of Henry VIII and received land for it. In February 1547 he was created Braon Rich and then became Lord Chancellor from 1548-1551.\n\nRich and his wife Elizabeth Gynkes had a wopping fifteen children together.\n\nSir Richard Rich died in June 1567.\n\nSir John Russell, Lord High Admiral\n\nJohn Russell was present throughout the entire reign of Henry VIII. He was knighted in 1522 and was created Comptroller of the King\u2019s Household in 1537. In 1540 he was appointed Lord High Admiral until 1543 when he relinquished his title to become Lord Privy Seal.\n\nHis wife, Anne Sapcote was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine Parr and was a frequent member at court.\n\n\u201cAfter Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves at Rochester, the next day he asked Russell if he \u201cthought her fair\u201d. Russell replied with his natural diplomacy and prudence that he took her \u201cnot to be fair, but of a brown complexion\u201d.In 1542, Russell himself resigned the Admiralty and succeeded to the Privy Seal on the death of Southampton. He was High Steward of the University of Oxford from 1543 till his death.\u201d\n\nRussell fell ill at the beginning of 1555, making his last appearance at Council on the 11th of January \u2013 he died the 14th of March.\n\nSir Ralph Sadler, King\u2019s Secretary\n\nSadler served as secretary to Thomas Cromwell and was knighted in 1540, as well as becoming a joint secretary to the king alongside Thomas Wriothesley.\n\nWhen Cromwell went to the Tower in June 1540, Sadler was the only one who dared to carry Cromwell\u2019s letter for mercy to the King. The King did not grant mercy and it\u2019s unknown if he actually read the letter.\n\nIn January 1541, Sadler himself was imprisoned in the Tower, only to attend a Privy Council meeting six days later having cleared himself.\n\nSir Ralph died 30 March 1587\ufffdreputedly, \u201cthe richest commoner in England.\u201d\n\nSir Anthony Wingfield, Vice-Chamberlain\n\nWingfield was a member of court since the reign of the first Tudor King \u2013 Henry VII. He was Esquire of the Body at the court of Henry VII in 1509.\ufffdWingfield was at the funeral of the King.\n\nIt is during the reign of Henry VIII that Wingfield showed great advancement. In 1513 he was knighted\ufffdhis part in the capture of Tournai and he only grew from there.\n\nSimilar to his prominent kinsmen he served a long time \ufffdin the administration of his county (Suffolk). \ufffdIn 1539 his responsibilities included being part of the royal household and he had a seat on the Privy Council \u2013 which allowed him to profit from the Dissolution of monasteries.\n\nAnthony Wingfield was made a Knight of the Garter on St George\u2019s Day 1541.\n\nHe died on 15 Aug. 1552 at the house of his friend Sir John Gates (listed above) at Bethnal Green.\n\nSir Thomas Wriothesley, King\u2019s Secretary\n\nWriothesley was the one of two secretaries of King Henry VIII, along with Ralph Sadler. \u201cA naturally skilled but unscrupulous and devious politician who changed with the times, Wriothesley served as a loyal instrument of King Henry VIII in the latter\u2019s break with the Catholic church.\u201d\n\nIn 1532, Wriothesley was sent abroad as a bearer of despatches.\n\nIn late 1539, when Anne of Cleves was due to arrive in England, Wriothesley lead the naval escort. On 27 December, Anne arrived at Deal Castle in Kent.\n\nWriothesley continued to support Norfolk\u2019s and his pro-Catholic faction, but like many of the time did so when it suited him at court.\n\nHe died 30 July 1550.\n\nAlso on the Privy Council but not included:\n\nThomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nStephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester\n\nThomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, Lord Treasurer\n\nRobert Radcliffe, Earl of Sussex and Lord Chamberlain\n\nCuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham\n\nEdward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, Privy Councillor\n\nWilliam Lord Sandys, Lord Chamberlain of the Household\n\nCharles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, President of the Privy Council\n\nSources:\n\nEvans, Victoria Sylvia; \u201cWho\u2019s Who at the Tudor Court\u201d (Dorothy M.

He quotes approvingly Thomas Norton (d. 1584), a busy conciliar agent, who claimed that the Privy Council was \u2018the wheels that hold the chariot of England upright\u2019.4 In many ways, it was significantly different to the Councils of France and Spain: they could only advise action, which could not be implemented without the king\u2019s formal instruction. But the English Privy Council was invested with full executive authority: by instruments signed by its members, instruments lacking explicit royal endorsement, it could make things happen.\n\n\n\nThis essay begins by outlining how the Privy Council emerged in the later 1530s and aims to show the ways in which it differed from the king\u2019s council of the Middle Ages. Membership is analysed before we consider functions and jurisdiction. The next section deals with location and procedure, so that readers may gain a sense of the machinery generating the sources that are now being made more easily accessible. A closer investigation of the nature of the sources themselves then follows, concluding with some remarks about staff, not least the clerks, whose unrelenting labours kept the operational wheels turning. The sixteenth-century history of the Privy Council has not been uncontroversial; two major debates are sketched below. The essay concludes with some \u2018Notes on Using the Privy Council Registers\u2019 because there are potential pitfalls for readers unused to Tudor primary sources, and especially for those who may consult the manuscripts with reference to the Victorian-Edwardian publication entitled Acts of the Privy Council.5 If the essay tends to draw examples from Elizabeth\u2019s reign, then that is partly because it constituted the bulk of the period under review and partly because materials relating to the years 1558\u20131603 are those with which the author is most familiar.\n\n\n\nThe Late Medieval King\u2019s Council and the Emergence of the Privy Council\n\nEngland\u2019s medieval kings had a council, but not a Privy Council in the Tudor sense. Under the Lancastrians and Yorkists, peers saw themselves as the sovereign\u2019s \u2018natural counsellors\u2019 and could offer counsel either informally at Court or formally in a Great Council, an ad hoc gathering of notables. More flexible than Parliament, which in any case met infrequently, the Great Council gave the king the opportunity to test the political water over problematic issues, usually concerning foreign affairs. However, he also needed to choose some men to help him govern on a day-to-day basis: to advise in the making of decisions; to dispatch orders in the light of those decisions; and to adjudicate disputes. Such men made up the king\u2019s council, which is sometimes labelled the \u2018continual council\u2019 so as to avoid confusion with the Great Council; indeed, at times during Henry VI\u2019s reign, the continual council was regarded as a standing committee of the Great Council. Yet we must take care not to define \u2018continual council\u2019 too narrowly. Medieval monarchs appointed numerous councillors, who collectively (albeit amorphously) constituted their council; it need not necessarily assume an institutional shape. Kings could use individual councillors, or informal groups of councillors, entirely as they saw fit, depending upon the exigencies of the moment. Some councillors were barely employed at all. But, for certain periods during the fifteenth century, selected councillors did meet for executive purposes in an institutional guise, the various incarnations of that guise enjoying differing degrees of autonomy, since the king was not always present. Despite the paucity of relevant records, we can tell that, under Henry VI, the proportion of lay magnates to prelates and officials changed dramatically across the intermittent executive manifestations of the continual council, thereby reflecting political vicissitudes. The number of councillors in attendance fluctuated considerably too, though rarely rose above twelve in 1437\u20131443, with the mean figure falling to 4.5 for 1443\u20131446. It was evidently very difficult for a collection of councillors, sitting as an executive board, to remain in session for many consecutive days, or even nearly consecutive days, because those who were either magnates or bishops needed to be elsewhere in order to look after their own affairs. There can be little doubt that the Lancastrian council was large in total, small in its gatherings and unstable.6\n\n\n\nSome similar conclusions may be drawn from a study of Edward IV\u2019s reign. J. R. Lander found the names of 105 men who were identified as councillors other than in connection with diplomacy. But only 39 documents disclose attendances at meetings of the continual council. These sources never give a presence of more than 20 councillors; the average was much lower, though precision is impossible because the scribes\u2019 lists end with \u2018et cetera\u2019, which probably covered some less important laymen. Numbers fluctuated wildly even at meetings held quite close together; clerics were generally the largest single element. Since Edward IV was a competent king, in contrast to the disastrously feeble Henry VI, the doctrine that magnates were \u2018natural counsellors\u2019 now became less prominent. And with a strong monarch in control, Edward\u2019s council lacked independence: while not negligible, it \u2018did not normally act as an executive body\u2019.7\n\n\n\nIgnoring the brief reigns of Edward V and Richard III, several of these features continued under Henry VII, the first king of the Tudor dynasty. At least 227 men were appointed councillors during his 24 years on the throne. We cannot know how many there were at any one time, but it is unlikely that they ever met together in one body; to quote S. B. Chrimes: \u2018all that was ever done by the council was done by groups of councillors\u2019, though these were loose gatherings rather than committees, in the modern sense of that word. Up to two dozen councillors have been highlighted as attending meetings more often than the rest: the frequency with which they were summoned reflected the special trust that the king had reposed in them. Chrimes warns us that it is \u2018a misnomer\u2019 to call these men an \u2018inner council\u2019, for any meeting at which they were present \u2018was the council in so far as the council was manifested in general meetings\u2019.8 Some scholars thus write of an \u2018inner ring\u2019 instead of an \u2018inner council\u2019.9\n\n\n\nHowever meetings were constituted, councillors faced a mixed workload of administrative and judicial tasks. Moreover, it was not unusual for Henry VII\u2019s councillors to divide. One group, conventionally described as the council attendant, was located at Court and therefore itinerated. Attendance at any one known gathering of this segment totalled no more than 11 between 1493 and 1508. Of the other councillors, some stayed at Westminster and operated in the Star Chamber during the four law terms.10 Attendances there averaged 15.11 Interchangeable in membership and undifferentiated in function, the two portions merged when the king returned to Westminster.\n\n\n\nSo far, there was no such thing as a \u2018Privy Council\u2019, meaning an organized institution of strictly limited membership. True: the term \u2018privy council\u2019 can be traced back to at least the fourteenth century, but it only meant the closeness to the king of his more intimate advisers. That was to change under Henry VIII.\n\n\n\nA small council existed at the beginning of the reign, composed of the survivors of the \u2018inner ring\u2019 of his father\u2019s council. As previously, it divided into a council attendant and a council in Star Chamber. Thomas Wolsey\u2019s rise to power transformed that situation. As lord chancellor from 1515, he re-organized the council about himself in Star Chamber, which in effect downgraded the council attendant. Furthermore, his unprecedented emphasis upon the council\u2019s judicial function swamped Star Chamber proceedings with petitions. Soon (in 1517) Wolsey found it necessary to enhance efficiency by dedicating specific days of the week to the hearing of suits. He also appointed three informal tribunals (1517\u20131520) to help deal with the vast extra burden. From 1520, the case backlog was being referred to junior councillors whose sessions counted as committees of the council in Star Chamber. These innovations opened up a differentiation between political/administrative activities and judicial activities that was eventually to lead to the emergence of the Court of Star Chamber, which was the Privy Council, supplemented by expert judges, sitting in its judicial capacity. But Wolsey did not finish there. In 1519, most judicial functions remaining with the council attendant were transferred to a new court sitting during the law terms in the Palace of Whitehall, the ancestor of the Court of Requests, which became solidly institutionalized after personnel changes in 1529 and 1538. Needing books for recording its decrees, this new court appropriated the old registers of the council attendant.\n\n\n\nIn the 1526 Eltham Ordinances, Wolsey produced the blueprint for a renovated council attendant, though its provisions were scarcely robust, in that they permitted the absence from Court of important officers, stipulating that two councillors were always to be present \u2018except the King\u2019s grace give lycence to any of them to the contrary\u2019. As G. R. Elton observed: \"A council attending on the king which might consist of two of the lesser councillors was clearly no privy council, and the hope expressed that by this order \u2018the King\u2019s highnesse shall alwayes be well furnished of an honourable presence of councillors about his grace, as to his high honour doth apperteyne\u2019 has the flavour of subtle irony.\"12 In any case, the blueprint was ignored during what was left of Wolsey\u2019s ascendancy.\n\n\n\nWith Wolsey\u2019s fall in 1529, the council assembling in Star Chamber began to wither, while the council attendant, now grappling with the problem of how to annul Henry\u2019s first marriage, became prominent. The fact that the king had begun personally to direct strategy, in his first sustained engagement with state business, powerfully contributed to this gravitational shift toward the itinerant Court, which paid only fleeting visits to Westminster. The annulment crisis had seen the rise at Court of an \u2018inner ring\u2019 advising Henry. It was this \u2018inner ring\u2019 among councillors attendant that Thomas Cromwell joined in 1530. Nevertheless, the \u2018inner ring\u2019 was still not a formalized \u2018Privy Council\u2019: we are talking about a collection of specially trusted councillors among the larger body of sworn councillors. Even so, various sources indicate that it was in the hands of this sub-set of the whole council that executive affairs had become vested, rather than in the hands of the Star Chamber subset overseen by the new lord chancellor, Sir Thomas More. Importantly, the beginning of a bifurcation was signalled by secretarial innovations. There were two established clerkships of the council. From 1530, the senior clerk concentrated exclusively on Star Chamber operations, being joined in 1532 by the incumbent of a new office called clerk of the writs and processes before the king\u2019s council in the Star Chamber at Westminster. As J. A. Guy notes, a \u2018professional secretariat\u2019 had been created there. Moreover, further adjustment to the clerkships of the council in January 1533 saw the junior clerk assigned to the council attendant. The official council record stayed with the senior clerk in Star Chamber.\n\n\n\nIn June 1534, Thomas Cromwell was thinking about further changes to the council, but what seems to have provided the immediate stimulus to the formalization that constituted the creation of the Privy Council was the crisis, in the autumn of 1536, caused by the various risings across most of northern England collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. In replying to the rebels\u2019 demands, the King identified 12 members of \u2018our Pryvey Counsell\u2019, though the list prudently omits Cromwell, Sir Thomas Audley (lord chancellor) and Thomas Cranmer (archbishop of Canterbury) because they had been singled out as targets for attack; the real total was therefore 15. Moreover, government instructions sent to captains in the field between 14 October 1536 and 8 April 1537 were signed by the whole council, these signatures revealing its newly restricted membership: the judges and other legal professionals had vanished. By amalgamating these two collections of names, we reach a total of 19 councillors \u2014 the same number, in fact, as belonged to the Privy Council in August 1540 when it decided to appoint a clerk and inaugurate a register of its proceedings. On that occasion, what was clearly now an organized institution of fixed membership \u2014 quite different to what Elton called the \u2018indefinite fluidity\u201913 of the old council attendant \u2014 declared that: \"there should be a clerk attendant upon the said Council to ... register all such decrees, determinations, letters and other such things as he should be appointed to enter in a book, to remain always as a ledger, as well for the discharge of the said councillors touching such things as they should pass from time to time, as also for a memorial unto them of their own proceedings.\"14 Formalization had occurred at some indeterminate point between the \u2018emergency\u2019 council of 1536\u20131537 and the Privy Council of August 1540. A concomitant change was differentiation amongst the councillors: only some were sworn of the Privy Council; B-List members of the unreformed council, excluded from the new streamlined body, were termed either \u2018ordinary councillors\u2019 or councillors \u2018at large\u2019, enjoying honorific status for life. They were employed at Court to sift petitions and suits, deciding whether to send them to the Privy Council, to the Court of Star Chamber or to the Court of Requests.\n\n\n\nDespite these changes, there was initial continuity over seals. The medieval king\u2019s council had been inconsistent in its manner of authenticating missives, though the signet (affixed by the king\u2019s secretary) had increasingly given way to the privy seal. The early Privy Council still employed the privy seal for its dispatches. However, for reasons that remain unclear, that arrangement no longer sufficed, so that, in 1555, the Privy Council resolved to move Philip and Mary for permission to have its own seal. The request was successful, for a dedicated seal (of novel design) was in use from at least May 1556. There were two seals, one for each duty clerk, by the end of 1573.\n\n\n\nMembership\n\nAlthough the terms \u2018the council\u2019 and \u2018the Privy Council\u2019 came to be used interchangeably for the rest of the period, it is clear that a new institution had emerged, defined to a considerable degree by the character of its membership, membership itself deriving (following selection by the sovereign) from the swearing of a specific oath.15 Sir John Fortescue usefully indicated the composition of the continual council of the fifteenth century when he asserted that it was: \"chose off grete princes, and off the greteste lordes off the lande, both spirituelles [i.e. clergy] and temporellis [i.e. temporals, members of the laity], and also off other men that were in grete auctorite and offices\".16 In terms of Henry VII\u2019s known councillors, that meant a breakdown thus: 61 clerics, 49 lay administrators, 45 courtiers, 43 peers and 27 lawyers.17 But the Privy Council had a very different complexion.\n\n\n\nOne key feature, bound up with the Reformation, was the drastic diminution of the clerical element. As early as August 1540, a Privy Council numbering 19 contained only three churchmen: the Archbishop of Canterbury and two diocesan bishops; none sat ex officio. Perhaps predictably, Mary appointed slightly more ecclesiastics, yet without increasing the proportion, for the size of the Privy Council grew too. Under Elizabeth, only the presence of John Whitgift, sworn in the mid-1580s, prevented the extinction of the clerical component; neither of the Queen\u2019s previous archbishops of Canterbury had been chosen, much to their political disadvantage.\n\n\n\nThe other main feature was the gradual restriction of membership (with a few exceptions) to office-holders. The holders of major offices had always been a significant constituency within the medieval continual council, and that remained true of the Privy Council of August 1540. At that point, the lay offices involved were: lord chancellor of England; lord high treasurer of England; great master of the king\u2019s Household and lord president of the Council (posts held together); lord privy seal; lord great chamberlain of England; lord high admiral of England; lord chamberlain of the king\u2019s Household; lord warden of the Cinque Ports and treasurer of the king\u2019s Household (posts held together); comptroller of the king\u2019s Household; master of the king\u2019s horse; vice-chamberlain of the king\u2019s Household; king\u2019s secretary (two); chancellor of the Court of Augmentations; and chancellor of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths. The single lay privy councillor not an office-holder was Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, a brother of Queen Jane Seymour. It should be noticed that this list comprises a mixture of state and Household offices. Some would disappear over succeeding years, such as chancellor of the Court of Augmentations and chancellor of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths; those institutions were to be absorbed by the Exchequer in the 1550s. A few would be held so consistently in plurality that the titles temporarily dropped out of common usage. Under Elizabeth, for example, the office of lord privy seal was usually held by the principal secretary. Certain offices were to fall into abeyance, as did that of lord president of the Council after 1558. In some cases, offices would no longer be regarded as qualifying the incumbent for a seat at the board. The venerable post of lord great chamberlain of England, for instance, was essentially ceremonial; the holder did not become a privy councillor in Elizabeth\u2019s reign. On the other hand, some members of the Elizabethan Privy Council held offices that had been ignored in August 1540: chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; chancellor of the Exchequer; earl marshal; master of the Ordnance; and president of the Council in the Marches of Wales. Many of the others, however, held the same posts as those listed in August 1540. So while certain positions clearly did bring a seat ex officio \u2014 it is inconceivable that a Lord High Treasurer of England would be excluded \u2014 there remained great flexibility over which particular offices privy councillors might hold. In general, one can say that there was a growing sense that councillors should exercise managerial responsibility over a department, either of the state apparatus or of the Household \u2014 indeed, that they should, to some extent, develop an expertise. Only the relative stability caused by Elizabeth\u2019s longevity, coupled with her reluctance to re-shuffle office-holders, made that a practical possibility. Certainly, few would doubt that Sir Walter Mildmay (a privy councillor from 1566) acquired impressive financial expertise over his 30 years as chancellor of the Exchequer, 1559\u20131589.\n\n\n\nThe tendency for key offices to be held by a new breed of lay bureaucrat \u2014 men of gentry (or lower) stock who were university educated and often boasted a legal training at the Inns of Court \u2014 meant the progressive squeezing out of the ancient nobility, unless the preferment of peers could be justified on meritocratic grounds. Elizabeth\u2019s reign provides the most obvious evidence of this process. Given the troubled situation at the time of her accession, not least over religion, the new Queen wisely appointed to her Privy Council a number of ex-Marian councillors who were too important to be ignored: the Earls of Arundel, Derby, Pembroke and Shrewsbury; it is a moot point whether or not Pembroke should be included among the ancient nobility: his earldom only dated from 1551, though he claimed descent from Herbert Earls of Pembroke of an earlier creation. Arundel and Shrewsbury were made lord steward and president of the Council in the North respectively. But, as the heads of powerful magnate interests, they were not automatically replaced on the Privy Council when they died. The next Earls of Derby and Shrewsbury had to wait over a decade before their appointments, having by that time proved themselves to be reliable servants of the Crown through holding local offices such as lord lieutenant and justice of the peace. Other great aristocratic dynasties, like the Percys and the Nevilles, were excluded from the start. To be replaced by professional bureaucrats of humble birth rankled, but the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland made the mistake of seeking remedy in rebellion, which was also intended to bring about the restoration of Catholicism; the failure of the Northern Rising of 1569 destroyed their families\u2019 influence for the rest of the century. Peers did join the Privy Council after Elizabeth\u2019s first appointees had begun to die off. However, they were mostly either first or second generation title-holders, normally secured appointment to an important post and remained out-numbered by non-peers. The 7th Earl of Shrewsbury and the 4th Earl of Worcester, both sworn in 1601, were the exceptions to prove the rule; neither held major office.\n\n\n\nAs a broad trend, the professionalization of the Privy Council was brought into differing degrees of focus by two factors: overall size and attendance patterns. The small Privy Council of August 1540 persisted until the death of Henry VIII, who had recognized its competence by providing (in his will) that it should govern the realm during the minority of Edward VI. Nevertheless, the first Edwardian Privy Council, composed of the deceased monarch\u2019s 16 executors, almost immediately relinquished power to one of its number, the young King\u2019s uncle, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, who in February 1547 was appointed lord protector and created Duke of Somerset. Somerset was given licence to appoint privy councillors at pleasure, an authority he then exercised, out of political necessity, to establish what amounted to the second Edwardian Privy Council, which emulated the Henrician body both in size (about 21 members) and composition. However, the Lord Protector increasingly sidelined colleagues in the formulation of policy. The popular rebellions of 1549, caused by various religious, social and economic circumstances, sparked a Privy Council coup d\u2019\u00e9tat led by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who would eventually be created Duke of Northumberland in 1551. With Somerset deposed and later executed, and the protectorate revoked, Dudley was able to exploit his position as lord president of the Council to rationalize its proceedings and re-establish competence; in short, there was a revival of fortune. One side-effect, though, was that Dudley was obliged to purge the Privy Council of his enemies and pack it with his friends; the result was that membership soared to 32. Such an expansion might have been inimical to efficient management had not Sir William Cecil, principal secretary of state for 1550\u20131553, pioneered what Hoak calls \u2018the system of government by a small working group of the larger board\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe particular context of Mary Tudor\u2019s seizure of the throne in 1553 caused her to appoint far more privy councillors than had been usual in the recent past. The first group of 18 \u2014 most already officers in her Household, but reinforced by East Anglian notables flocking to offer military support \u2014 was chosen rapidly at Kenninghall (in Norfolk) between 9 and 12 July in order to co-ordinate the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Lady Jane Grey. Almost nobody in this initial cohort could bring experience of high office. Once Mary\u2019s bid for the throne had developed an unstoppable momentum, and the Dudley regime backing Lady Jane Grey had collapsed, the new sovereign began to appoint a second cohort of 22 councillors. Selected between 20 July and 4 September, this group included 17 men who had served as privy councillors at one time or another since August 1540. The magnates and gentry of the coup soon gave way to this latter collection of experienced bureaucrats as the most active councillors. Additional appointments were made as the reign proceeded, so that Privy Council membership topped 50. But only 19 men shouldered the executive burden on a regular basis; William Paget, Lord Paget of Beaudesert from 1549, sought to preserve efficiency by organizing various conciliar committees. Nonetheless, complaints that the Privy Council was too large and unwieldy were hard to dispel. Relying uncritically on the misleading reports of resident foreign ambassadors, historians used to believe that the Marian Council was riven by dissent; more recent research has exposed that idea as false. In Hoak\u2019s words, the myth about faction \u2018has obscured the reality of institutional stability and administrative continuity, the latter explained by the presence of Henrician and Edwardian careerists like Paget\u2019.18\n\n\n\nElizabeth restored the Privy Council to Henrician proportions. As indicated above, political considerations necessitated the retention of some ex-Marians, so her early Council numbered 18 by the end of 1558; it would have hit 19 if Sir Thomas Cheyne had not died so soon after his promotion. The total hovered just below the 20 mark until October 1571, when it began a steady descent to 13 in January 1573, recovering sufficiently thereafter to reach 20, which was the highest Elizabethan figure, achieved in September 1586. A prolonged decline then set in: by the end of July 1596, if only for the space of a month, there were a mere nine councillors. From that low point up to the Essex rebellion of February 1601, membership barely approached double digits, though a flurry of appointments made shortly afterwards \u2014 three in June 1601 and one in December 1602 \u2014 left 14 men sitting at the board when Elizabeth died in March 1603. The Queen had discovered the risks of sustaining a ruling elite that was too narrow, one that did not adequately represent wider political interests. But even these late remedies were not enough. As with Elizabeth\u2019s increasing aversion to the creation of peerages, her willingness to allow the Privy Council to contract as much as it did \u2014 often choosing sons to replace dead fathers instead of infusing wholly fresh blood \u2014 caused the build-up of a dangerous log-jam in the struggle for honour and preferment that James VI of Scotland was obliged to clear as soon as he claimed his inheritance.\n\n\n\nFunctions and Jurisdiction\n\nThe Privy Council\u2019s primary function \u2014 that with the longest ancestry stretching back into the remote history of the medieval council \u2014 was to advise the sovereign. Henry VII frequently attended meetings of his continual council, and personally intervened in debate too, but it was very rare after 1540 for any of his successors to be present at a formal gathering of the Privy Council, though that changed under the Stuarts. Edward VI probably thought that he was observing some Privy Council meetings, and certain contemporaries concurred, yet Hoak has shown that these were specially staged events involving councillors, and not proper sessions; it is telling that the King\u2019s presence is not recorded in any of the Edwardian registers.19 Under Elizabeth, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, a privy councillor since 1562, admitted in 1578 that \u2018our conference with Her Majesty about affairs is both seldom and slender\u2019.20 He is borne out by the difficulty of finding much evidence of the Queen consulting the Privy Council as a board. Historians who describe it as a body \u2018presided over\u2019 by the monarch are wide of the mark.\n\n\n\nHow then was the duty to counsel exercised? Before answering that question, we should perhaps ask another: in what circumstances did a sovereign need counselling? In theory, one might say in all circumstances, for the Tudor age is generally held to have been a period of \u2018personal monarchy\u2019 \u2014 the head of state directed government. But that had already become something of a fiction by 1485. No king or queen, even one as diligent as Henry VII, could possibly be aware of everything that passed for government activity; there were simply not enough hours in the day to read all the paperwork, let alone digest the information and make decisions. Much had to be done by others in the sovereign\u2019s name. The challenge, therefore, is to identify in which contexts, and to what degrees, the monarch did actually take a personal interest and drive the agenda. In this connection, it is curious that entries in the Elizabethan Privy Council registers, while sometimes invoking the Queen\u2019s authority, hardly ever cite her involvement. By contrast, where we have external evidence of disputes at the Council table, and especially of Elizabeth consulting the board collectively, the point at issue almost always turns out to relate to foreign policy, including under that heading (despite her detention in England) the dilemma of what to do about Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. Such things left barely any impression upon the registers. How do we account for these disjunctions? The most rational explanation is that Elizabeth had reserved to herself much of the conduct of foreign policy, leaving aspects of implementation to the Privy Council. This situation meant that although the Council occasionally received letters from English ambassadors and other oversees agents so as to keep it informed of developments, the bulk of the incoming foreign correspondence was directed to the principal secretary; packets of letters seem not to have been addressed to the Queen \u2014 she saw what the principal secretary chose to show her. It also meant that executive orders over foreign policy were not routinely framed as Privy Council letters, instead being communicated either formally via royal signet letters usually drafted by the principal secretary or informally via the principal secretary\u2019s \u2018private\u2019 correspondence.\n\n\n\nThis was therefore the sphere in which the Privy Council\u2019s advice-giving function principally operated. But since deliberations over what advice to give were not in themselves instances of the exercise of the royal prerogative, there was no need, in the registers, to record them, or even the nature of the resulting advice itself, which the Queen all too often ignored, to her councillors\u2019 chagrin. In any case, we know that the clerks were required to withdraw when sensitive foreign affairs were under discussion. Because the principal secretary was the linchpin of the political system at Court, functioning as the Privy Council\u2019s chairman, it is easy to suppose that he briefed councillors orally about signet letters ostensibly deriving from the Queen, and perhaps also about relevant portions of his own correspondence; certainly, the Privy Council cited what were probably signet letters in its outgoing letters, as in 1574, when (according to the register entry) a letter to the Earl of Thomond referred to a separate letter addressed to him by Elizabeth.21 However, the extent to which the Council corporately contributed to the preparation of signet letters is extremely unclear. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the registers rarely reveal the Council writing directly to foreign authorities, particularly rulers. Two examples are the missives sent to the Prince of Orange and the estates of Zeeland (in the Low Countries) in October 1576, though these were about how continental pirates had preyed upon English ships rather than about the prosecution of English foreign policy per se.22 References to the dispatch of letters to English ambassadors resident abroad are similarly few and far between \u2014 and they also tend to be about commercial matters.23 What the registers document plentifully are conciliar orders that relate to the domestic ramifications of foreign policy decisions, such as the need to raise troops or victual them.24\n\n\n\nIt follows from the foregoing analysis that Elizabeth seems, by and large, to have delegated the administration of domestic affairs to the Privy Council. She surely cannot have absorbed, or even have been interested in, the details of the innumerable problems that pressed upon the Council\u2019s time, not least those represented by private suits. In only a small minority of cases, therefore, is it likely that the Council, through the principal secretary, bothered to take matters to the Queen for resolution. Where this occurred, the rationale is rarely immediately obvious, but can be discovered by means of contextualization. For instance, given that the registers are full of entries about the imprisonment of suspects, and yet those entries usually say nothing about royal intervention, we initially wonder why the Privy Council should have made a point of stating, in a letter of April 1574 addressed to the sheriff of Norfolk, that it was the Queen\u2019s pleasure for John Appleyard, a prisoner in Norwich Castle, to be transferred to the sheriff\u2019s house. In May, another letter cited her pleasure as the basis for ordering Appleyard\u2019s removal to the custody of the Dean of Norwich.25 However, the reason why the case was taken to the Queen becomes clear when we recall that Appleyard was half-brother to Amy Robsart, the deceased wife of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth\u2019s favourite; indeed, he belonged to Leicester\u2019s affinity. To give a second example: an entry for February 1575 discloses the Privy Council communicating the Queen\u2019s wish that the five addressees investigate a Staffordshire affray that had led to a fatality.26 The key here is the fact that one party was made up of Edward and Robert Bowes, members of a gentry family with close Court connections: they and their four brothers were all in the Queen\u2019s service at one time or another.\n\n\n\nIn deciding foreign policy, and those domestic cases passed up from the Privy Council, the Queen was not obliged to consult the Council as a board. Natalie Mears notes that, for debate over major issues, Lord Burghley produced memoranda, extant examples of which can be tied to 17 meetings, or series of related meetings, involving councillors. In ten instances, all about foreign affairs, the Privy Council registers survive for the same periods. But when we try to map the memoranda on to register entries, we find disparities over date, or location or the identities of the councillors concerned.27 This discovery implies that somebody \u2014 either Elizabeth or councillors acting collectively \u2014 had formed committees of the Privy Council in order to deal with specific problems. The existence of such committees is attested in the later registers themselves.28 However, the suggestion that the Queen may have been counselled by unregistered Council committees does not lessen the significance of the Privy Council\u2019s counselling function; it merely underlines the board\u2019s institutional flexibility. Not that that means that she necessarily had to consult councillors in multiple, for there is evidence of Elizabeth seeking advice informally from individual privy councillors, particularly Lord Burghley or the Earl of Leicester. Indeed, on an ad hoc basis, she could look beyond the ranks of privy councillors entirely, tapping into the wide experience gathered by diplomats like Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. A few sources hint at the Queen using some of her intimate female friends, who had Household positions, as go-betweens. There were thus many channels, formal and informal, through which counsel could be both solicited and delivered.\n\n\n\nApart from counselling, the Privy Council\u2019s main function was to govern the realm on the sovereign\u2019s behalf. That meant exercising the royal prerogative by delegation, which is why councillors took signs of disrespect towards themselves, either individually or corporately, as little less than l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. Yet freedom of action was limited. One obvious constraint was parliamentary statute. Conversely, the Council was in an excellent position to seek to legislate the government out of difficulties because councillors managed Parliament. They planned the government\u2019s legislative programme for each parliamentary session and oversaw the passage of Bills from within the two Houses, for those who were peers automatically sat in the House of Lords, while the rest usually belonged to the House of Commons, where, sitting around the speaker\u2019s chair, they could easily whisper instructions on the order of business. Since regular attendance was not always possible, and for other reasons, the Privy Council under Elizabeth often used members of Parliament (MPs) such as Thomas Norton and William Fleetwood \u2014 respected and versatile lawyer-bureaucrats \u2014 to help push through legislation, though success was not guaranteed: the Queen could (and did) employ her right of veto. Day-to-day parliamentary affairs scarcely ever intruded into the Council\u2019s registers, but isolated entries do reveal councillors\u2019 broader interests in such things as elections or abuses of procedure.29\n\n\n\nAnother constraint was the common law. Just as the sovereign could not stand above the common law, nor could privy councillors. Moreover, as Sir John Baker has remarked, the late medieval council \u2018was not supposed to interfere in matters belonging solely to the common law\u2019. It had no jurisdiction, for example, over felony. Instead, it offered \u2018equitable\u2019 remedies \u2014 \u2018in the sense of remedies not available at law\u2019 \u2014 for petitioners complaining of private wrongs that had public dimensions. That remained true after the emergence of the Privy Council. But it would be erroneous to conclude that the board had no interest in crimes and misdemeanours. On the contrary, councillors energetically promoted inquiries into (amongst other things) cases of affray, assault, barratry, bribery, burglary, embracery, forgery, kidnap, larceny, libel, manslaughter, murder, perjury, riot, robbery, sedition, slander, subornation of witnesses, treason and trespass. Licences to torture suspects \u2014 or even just to show them the rack in the hope of provoking a confession \u2014 are sprinkled throughout the registers.30 Misdemeanours could be punished on the Privy Council\u2019s own authority: miscreants were usually bound over to be of good behaviour, or put in the pillory, or imprisoned. For serious crimes, prosecutions were continued at the common law, having been referred either to the relevant central courts at Westminster \u2014 king\u2019s bench and common pleas \u2014 or to the assize courts. The assize courts were convened twice yearly when pairs of judges rode the six circuits into which the English counties had been divided. By punishing misdemeanours, the Privy Council acted coercively as if it were a court, yet it was technically not a court of law. Professor Baker urges us to see it more as a board of arbitration:\n\nThe informality of conciliar proceedings, though part of their attraction for plaintiffs, was open to the same objections as were voiced against the Chancery. In particular, the duty of attendance from day to day (in person or by counsel) at varying locations, enforced by heavy bonds, could place an intolerable burden on defendants. The procedure often resembled a form of compulsory arbitration. Arbitration was not in itself objectionable. Indeed, it was very widely used by voluntary submission. But in this case it was imposed on one of the parties and displaced his legal rights, because the Council had assumed the same power as the Chancery to inhibit related proceedings in the regular [i.e. common law] courts by means of injunctions. Such a procedure was arguably contrary to the medieval statutes of due process, some of which were explicitly directed against interference with the course of the common law by extraordinary processes.\n\nBaker seems here to be writing of the late medieval king\u2019s council, though his observations appear to be equally applicable to the Privy Council.31 Despite the potential threat to legal rights, complainants flocked to the board in sufficiently large numbers for councillors to essay counter-measures. In 1582, they declared that the multitude of private causes between parties was frequently interrupting the Queen\u2019s \u2018speciall services\u2019. Consequently, no suits that could be handled in the ordinary courts would henceforth be received \u2018onless they shall concerne the preservacion of her Majesties peace or shalbe of some publicke consequence to touche the government of the Realme\u2019.32 This ruling had no visible impact, the Privy Council renewing complaints about the press of private suitors in 1589 and 1591. If any change occurred, then it may have been in the manner of dealing with such suits rather than in their volume. At any rate, the anonymous author of a brief text of 1600 on the \u2018Duties of a Secretary\u2019 noted, in the section about the Council, that suits between party and party: \"... are very seldom heard particularly, but rather ended by overruling an obstinate person, who is made to acknowledge his fault, or else the parties are remitted to some court of justice or equity, or recommended by some letters to some justices in the country to compound the differences either by consent of the parties or by direction ...\" The Privy Council was thus a clearing-house for the disposal of disputes. Those in which the Crown was a party, and a breach of the peace had been alleged, were sometimes referred to the Council\u2019s other guise of the Court of Star Chamber, \u2018where great riots and contempts are punished\u2019.33 Further institutions were part of this same complex framework. Although the Council\u2019s jurisdiction was circumscribed by both parliamentary statute and the common law, its geographical range extended throughout the sovereign\u2019s dominions, except for privileged places, such as the many chartered urban settlements, as well as the two universities; in those localities, councillors had to work sensitively through the local authorities. But in view of communications difficulties, and the old lawlessness of border territories, it was impossible to govern everywhere else effectively from Court, however peripatetic it might be. Two regional councils, which lasted into the next century, had therefore been created.34\n\n\n\nThe Regional Councils\n\nThe Council in the North went back to the private council of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who was appointed to govern the northern counties by his brother, Edward IV. On seizing the throne as Richard III, the former duke maintained the Council under the presidency of his nephew. It then seems to have vanished under Henry VII, but a new entity, staffed mostly by lawyers and bureaucrats, had emerged by 1525, being thoroughly re-organized by Thomas Cromwell in 1537. Importantly, the Council in the North was not an off-shoot of the central Council, a portion of which was at that time beginning to turn into the Privy Council. Instead, it existed by virtue of a royal commission, drawing much of its power from commissions of the peace and of oyer and terminer.35 Unlike the Privy Council, the northern Council enjoyed a common-law jurisdiction, enabling it to try cases of felony and treason. Civil matters (disputes between party and party) also contributed to its workload. The Council in the North was subordinate to the Privy Council, which nevertheless carefully monitored its proceedings. The registers reveal many instances of the latter sending executive orders to the former and of it intervening in cases which the northern body was hearing, though it is easy to miss such entries because, in Elizabeth\u2019s reign, the correspondence is recorded as having been addressed only to the Council\u2019s head, described either as the \u2018Lord President of the Northe\u2019 or as the \u2018Lord President of Yeorke\u2019.36\n\n\n\nThe history of the Council in the Marches of Wales was similarly discontinuous. At first a Council set up by Edward IV to administer his marcher lands, it had been revived by Henry VII for his elder son, the Prince of Wales, and then again in 1525 for the Princess Mary. Cromwell had put the Council on a more formal footing in the 1530s: a statute of 1534 gave it power to oversee the execution of justice in the franchises (privileged areas) of the marcher lords. A second act of 1543, which consolidated Henrician legislation for Wales, explicitly mentions a president and Council in Wales and its marches. Henceforward, the institution had a statutory foundation that was lacking in the northern Council, despite the fact that they had both originated in royal commissions. However, it emulated its counterpart in possessing a common-law jurisdiction, derived from commissions of the peace and of oyer and terminer. Civil disputes also came within its purview. A complicating factor was that the 1543 statute established four courts of Great Sessions, which applied the common law in the 12 Welsh shires, so that wrangles over competence inevitably ensued. Indeed, the picture was even more complex than that, for this regional council\u2019s jurisdiction stretched beyond Wales and Monmouthshire to include the English counties of Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire, though Cheshire was extracted in 1569. In those areas, there was thus the potential for conflict with the Westminster courts. Once again, the Privy Council was superior and undertook a supervisory role \u2014 the registers contain plenty of examples of cases being transferred between the Privy Council and Ludlow.37\n\n\n\nThe Privy Council and the Church\n\nThis account has hitherto been confined to the secular sphere, yet the ecclesiastical sphere did not escape conciliar encroachments upon it, which may surprise those who believe claims that the Reformation under Henry VIII had given rise to a model of strict separation between the administrations of Church and state. For example, although the destruction of altars had already taken place in some parishes, the national campaign of demolition \u2014 and replacement of altars by communion tables \u2014 received legitimacy from a Privy Council letter seemingly sent to every bishop in November 1550.38 The traditional structure of Church courts had emerged from the religious turmoil largely unscathed. There had even been innovation: by royal letters patent, Elizabeth in 1559 had created a permanent court for each of the two provinces of Canterbury and York that was designed to reinforce the disciplinary machinery available to the archbishop; these new courts came to be called the Courts of High Commission. Additional royal commissions established temporary courts of similar character, and for the same purpose, in certain dioceses. But these developments did not stop the Privy Council from intervening in a wide range of ecclesiastical matters. In July 1565, for instance, it ordered the Bishop of Durham to see to the appointment of a learned preacher to serve the garrison at Berwick-upon-Tweed. In November 1570, it summoned the Bishop of Chester to explain burgeoning nonconformity, especially in Lancashire, that had been attributed to his negligence.39 Four years later, councillors required the Archbishop of Canterbury to revoke one of his commissions and insisted that he cause the examination of some religious prisoners on a set of articles of their devising, they having found fault with his earlier inquiries. Soon afterwards, the Privy Council sent instructions to the Bishop of London following the discovery of a separatist conventicle in the capital.40 Cases could be multiplied; the Council was at the forefront of efforts to secure conformity to the Elizabethan Church Settlement.\n\n\n\nThe Privy Council as a Point of Contact\n\nFinally, an important function of the Privy Council was to serve as what G. R. Elton called a \u2018point of contact\u2019.41 We have recognized its role as a focus for ambition. But once they had achieved a place at the board, councillors could help to bind the nation together by acting as conduits of information and patronage between the political centre and the provinces. They all possessed broad acres, with parcels of land concentrated into major estates in one shire or another, like William Cecil\u2019s properties in Hertfordshire (Theobalds) and Lincolnshire (Burghley). Such holdings, and the wealth thereby generated, gave local prestige, which was cemented by tenure of local office. Under Elizabeth, if not before, every privy councillor was a justice of the peace, most on several benches; many were appointed to ad hoc royal commissions of various kinds. Some became lord lieutenant of their county or high steward of an incorporated town. Collectively, therefore, they could bring to the table an awareness of conditions across much of the realm, as well as knowledge of the men on the ground, such as fellow JPs, who might be called upon to execute government policy. It is easy to suppose that the artist of the famous \u2018Rainbow\u2019 Portrait (c.1600\u20133) primarily had the Privy Council in mind when, by depicting eyes and ears across Elizabeth\u2019s cloak, he alluded to the agents through whom she received intelligence. The conceit was designed to flatter an ageing queen, but we will not go far wrong if we attribute this state of near omniscience to the Privy Council itself.\n\n\n\nLocation and Procedure\n\nThe Privy Council was part of the royal Household, known as the Court, which meant that it itinerated. For most of the year, the Court moved between the sovereign\u2019s principal palaces, classed as \u2018standing houses\u2019, usually spending a few weeks at a stretch, or sometimes several months, at each one. These \u2018standing houses\u2019 \u2014 the most famous being those at Greenwich, Hampton Court, Richmond and Whitehall \u2014 all included a \u2018Council Chamber\u2019, containing the Council table, though whether or not these rooms were exclusively for the use of the Privy Council is unclear. We should probably imagine a small suite of rooms: Sir Julius Caesar, writing soon after the accession of Charles I in 1625, noted that the clerks and their servants sat writing in a little room adjoining the main chamber.42\n\n\n\nParticularly during the summer, the Tudor monarchs liked to venture further afield, going \u2018on progress\u2019, as it came to be called.43 While there is an example from 1564 of Elizabeth\u2019s Council dividing, one portion with the Queen in Cambridge corresponding with another portion located in London,44 it was normal in the later sixteenth century for an undivided Council to travel with the Court, which stayed, at vast expense to the hosts, in the mansions of \u2018lucky\u2019 noblemen and gentlemen. On 23 July 1578, for instance, a Privy Council meeting was held at Mark Hall, James Altham\u2019s property at Latton (near Harlow) in Essex, and another the next day at Sir Ralph Sadler\u2019s house at Standon in Hertfordshire.45 The number of councillors in attendance sometimes fell when the Court was on progress, and it was not unknown for the Privy Council to delay dealing with a major issue until it had returned to a \u2018standing house\u2019, when more members would be available.\n\n\n\nThe rhythm of the Council\u2019s year was also affected by the four law terms: Michaelmas (about seven weeks from either 9 or 10 October); Hilary (about three weeks from either 23 or 24 January); Easter (about four weeks beginning 17 days after Easter Day); and Trinity (three weeks from the Friday following Trinity Sunday). During these periods, wherever the royal Court might be, a number of privy councillors journeyed on Wednesdays and Fridays to the Palace of Westminster, where they sat judicially in the Camera Stellata, a pair of rooms \u2014 an \u2018outer\u2019 room and an \u2018inner\u2019 room \u2014 jointly so called because their azure ceilings were decorated with gold stars. They were joined on these occasions by some of the senior judges, who were not as a rule sworn of the Privy Council, as well as by other figures whose ad hocpresence was deemed desirable; in early 1594, for instance, Lord Buckhurst (a privy councillor) wrote to the Bishop of Winchester to tell him that it was the Queen\u2019s pleasure that the Bishop should join the privy councillors and judges from time to time.46 Those constituting the bench were given a large dinner shortly before noon on the days when the Court of Star Chamber, as it came to be known, was in session.\n\n\n\nCouncillors gathering in the Camera Stellata sometimes chose to transact Privy Council business either before or after the proceedings of the Court of Star Chamber. In order to do so, they may have withdrawn to the \u2018inner\u2019 room. Alternatively, they stayed in the \u2018outer\u2019 room, but required everybody else to withdraw, changing the colour of the carpet on the table so as to signify the assumption of a different institutional guise: a red carpet meant an ordinary meeting of the Privy Council; a green carpet meant a session of the Court of Star Chamber. It is important to be aware of these customs because the Privy Council\u2019s registers often note it as meeting in the Star Chamber.47 This does not, however, mean that the business recorded was the business of the Court of Star Chamber, for that institution had its own support staff and generated a completely different archive, now badly depleted.48\n\n\n\nEven though the Privy Council sat all year round, councillors were heavily influenced by the termly routine that their Court of Star Chamber activities obliged them to follow: they often summoned individuals to appear before them at the beginning of the next law term, or perhaps by the end of it; on one occasion, they ordered a jury to be forthcoming at the Star Chamber the day after term had finished.49\n\n\n\nCertainly under Elizabeth, it is very difficult to find evidence of the Queen, or the principal secretary, summoning privy councillors to attend specific meetings. On the other hand, albeit rarely, the Council itself was not above instructing members absent from Court to repair there on a particular day \u2018for consultacion of suche matters as were to be considered\u2019.50 But such missives were normally unnecessary: unless they had been granted leave of absence because of some special duty, councillors were usually courtiers, so they could be warned orally of proposed meetings. Even oral notice may well have been otiose, since the Council strove to establish a pattern for its sessions. In December 1558, it resolved, with the new Queen\u2019s consent, that Monday mornings and both mornings and afternoons on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays should be ordinary Council days, further days being used as needed. If it hadn\u2019t already been modified, this scheme was changed in 1565, when the Council made a distinction between term time and vacation time: in the former, it would ordinarily sit on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday afternoons; in the latter, it would sit during the mornings of those same days, deciding on each occasion whether or not to continue in the afternoon. The Council\u2019s commitment to a Tuesday\u2013Thursday\u2013Saturday frequency was reiterated in 1574, but no mention was made of mornings and afternoons, so the implication must be that it meant both.51 As the reign wore on, dispatches increasingly bore complaints of pressure of work. Unsurprisingly, conventional wisdom holds that, from some indeterminate date, the Privy Council began sitting nearly every day.52\n\n\n\nEarlier historians have claimed that meetings of the Privy Council were held in secret, but that is not entirely true. Some credible late Jacobean orders, probably reflecting long-standing practice, relate that \u2018... When the Body of the Council doth assemble, they are always to passe through the Presence Chamber, and none to come the private way, except upon speciall and secret Committees ...\u2019.53 The intention was presumably for courtiers (in the loosest sense) to be aware that the Council was about to sit, for the Presence Chamber was a semi-public space: accommodating the throne, and used as the sovereign\u2019s public dining-room, it has been described as \u2018a rendezvous for the court, where everyone who mattered met to gather news and to gossip\u2019.54 Courtiers \u2014 both long-term residents and short-term visitors \u2014 needed to know that a meeting was imminent so that they could prepare to proffer their private petitions once the councillors had reached the Council Chamber.\n\n\n\nMorning meetings commonly began at 8.00, or between then and 9.00, afternoon sessions probably commencing at 1.00.55 The whole affair seems to have been highly ritualized. An Act of Parliament of 1539 prescribed an order of precedence for certain chief officers of the Church of England, of the state and of the royal Household, to be reflected in the seating plan \u2018in all great Counsells and Congregacions of Men\u2019. Although the framers of the statute clearly had Parliament largely in mind, it was also intended to apply to Star Chamber gatherings, \u2018and in all other assemblies and conferences of Counsell\u2019. Of the posts specified, some did not necessarily entail Privy Council membership, such as that of archbishop of Canterbury, while a few were subsequently even left vacant. But many automatically brought a seat at the Council table: lord chancellor, lord high treasurer of England, lord high admiral, lord chamberlain of the Household and principal secretary.56\n\n\n\nTwo types of evidence suggest adherence to the Act, which should be seen as a manifestation of the general Tudor obsession with precedence, not least among peers; one clause affirms the traditional hierarchy found within the nobility. Firstly, those compiling the Council\u2019s registers scrupulously observed the order of precedence when noting attendances. Indeed, it is almost certain that the many presence lists reproduce the seating plan. Thus, for instance, that for 15 February 158757 respects the statute in placing the archbishop of Canterbury (John Whitgift) first, followed by the lord high treasurer of England (William Cecil, Lord Burghley). Then comes the Earl of Derby because he was the lord steward, an office that put him above the other earls, who are listed according to their dates of creation: Warwick in 1561 and Leicester in 1564. The lord high admiral (Lord Howard of Effingham) and the lord chamberlain of the Household (Lord Hunsdon) feature next since they were only barons, and therefore ranked beneath earls, but they appear before the other barons, Lords Cobham and Buckhurst, even though Cobham\u2019s peerage was of much greater antiquity. Non-peers bring up the rear, led by two officers of the Household whose posts were ignored by the 1539 Act: the comptroller (Sir James Croft) and the vice-chamberlain (Sir Christopher Hatton). The two principal secretaries are recorded in order of appointment: Sir Francis Walsingham in 1573 and William Davison in 1586; Walsingham in any case trumped Davison as a knight. John Wolley was the Queen\u2019s Latin secretary.\n\n\n\nFurther evidence for the implementation of rules over precedence comes from examples of Privy Council dispatches. On 25 August 1588, the Council resolved to circularize the lords lieutenant of various counties about troops sent to the camp at Tilbury in Essex. For some obscure reason, one of these letters, although signed, was retained, and found its way into the State Papers Domestic.58 Anyone consulting the manuscript will be struck by the curious arrangement of signatures beneath the main text, odd gaps being left between certain names. The explanation, of course, is that the signatories were observing protocol: Sir Christopher Hatton signed at the top left-hand side as lord chancellor (\u2018Canc:\u2019 is short for \u2018cancellarius\u2019, the Latin word for chancellor), with Lord Burghley signing next to him as lord high treasurer of England, and so on. Spaces were left in respect of absentees: they might have an opportunity to add their signatures before the letter was sealed and dispatched.\n\n\n\nOnce councillors had settled in their appropriate seats, petitioners were admitted to deliver their supplications, on their knees, at the upper end of the table, withdrawing immediately. It is most unlikely that such petitions were even read straight away, let alone acted upon; they probably entered a filtering process, overseen by the principal secretary between meetings, an unknown proportion re-appearing at subsequent sessions, when the concerns they raised came to be discussed. Many original petitions addressed to the Privy Council survive amongst the State Papers Domestic;59 there are more at Hatfield House and in William Cecil\u2019s portion of the Lansdowne manuscripts at the British Library. They are frequently a problematic source for the historian because, for mysterious reasons, petitioners conventionally did not date their texts, so that if the documents were not dated upon receipt by way of endorsement, and if they fail to mention any dated or datable events, it can be difficult to connect them to other materials in order to pursue individual complaints.\n\n\n\nAfter the petitioners had departed, councillors could get down to business, assuming that they were quorate. The presence of any three seems to have been enough to cause the Council Chamber to be cleared of extraneous persons, privacy being desirable not only \u2018for Dignity\u2019, but also in case members needed to confer, or make other preparations, prior to the formal session,60 though William Fleetwood, the capable recorder of London often employed as a conciliar agent, thought it worth noting, as if surprised, that just three councillors had been sitting at the table during his appearance before the Privy Council in early 1584.61 In general, however, the government tended to think in terms of a minimum of six. William Paget suggested a quorum of that number in his memorandum of 1550.62 Lord Hunsdon, who must surely have known the facts, reported in 1582 that six privy councillors\u2019 signatures were required as authorization to torture a prisoner on the rack.63 Many commissions, from Henry VIII\u2019s reign through to Elizabeth\u2019s, state that warrants for payment must be signed by at least six councillors, some insisting that the lord high treasurer of England be one.64 A very early Jacobean notice about procedure for dealing with private suitors, which announces that Tuesday afternoons would henceforth be dedicated to their causes, speaks of no fewer than six councillors being on duty.65 Attendance numbers fluctuated for all kinds of reasons, but 23 was not unknown under Mary and 14 can be found towards the beginning of Elizabeth\u2019s reign;66 three was the exception throughout the period.\n\n\n\nRobert Beale, a clerk of the Elizabethan Privy Council, tells us that the principal secretary was expected to produce a memorial of the matters that he intended to propound and have \u2018dispatched\u2019 at each sitting.67 Lists of items to be addressed survive amongst the State Papers Domestic,68 though there is nothing to suggest that such documents were ever circulated in the manner of a modern agenda. They probably derived from more general types of aide memoire, like one of Sir Francis Walsingham\u2019s \u2018diaries\u2019, preserved elsewhere, which contains sections bracketed as relating to Council business.69 According to sources dating from the 1620s, the principal secretary stood at the upper end of the table to inform members of all relevant developments as prelude to soliciting their collective resolutions on actions to be taken.70 It was his duty, in this briefing exercise, to read aloud incoming letters, whether directed to the Council or to the sovereign.71 But Beale knew that councillors seldom had either the time or the patience to listen to everything that they should, and therefore advocated the preparation of summaries from which the principal secretary could speak.72 Having broached selected issues, the principal secretary then resumed his seat for the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\nIt is at this point that our sources let us down. Nobody was interested in producing a blow-by-blow account of how debate had proceeded. There are no \u2018minutes\u2019 in the modern sense of a record summarizing key contributions and specifying what actions have been agreed upon and who is to execute them. Each decision was all-important, not how it was reached, for an embryonic doctrine of collective responsibility, which we associate with the later Cabinet, already existed under Elizabeth, if not before. That does not mean, however, that nothing is known of the discussions themselves. In general terms, they probably followed the etiquette prescribed in the 1620s: councillors were to speak succinctly, but freely and in confidence. If the Privy Council was essaying an arbitration, then it was to confine itself to questioning both parties during the time of their presence, leaving further discussion until the parties had left. Hat culture being significant under the Tudors, councillors were to remain bareheaded while addressing colleagues, though covered when speaking to non-councillors. Should resolution of a dispute prove impossible by debate, then the issue was to be put to an oral majority vote. Members\u2019 votes counted equally, but the lowest ranking councillor was required to express his opinion first. Information about voting patterns was not to be disclosed.73 As for particular debates, we can sometimes find evidence of what councillors had said, or at least of their views on specific matters, from private correspondence amongst themselves. Tales of division at the Council table were occasionally picked up by foreign ambassadors resident in London, who naturally had informants at Court, but the informants\u2019 reliability may be doubtful \u2014 and we should not ignore the possibility that ambassadors tailored what they had heard in order to suit their masters\u2019 perceived demands. Ambassadorial dispatches must therefore be treated with caution.\n\n\n\nBeale recommended that the principal secretary make a brief note of each Privy Council decision, but, lest that be insufficient, that he also command the duty clerks to approach the table and listen carefully so that they could help him in framing responses, typically either letters or warrants, though other types of document included commissions, instructions to diplomats, Orders in Council, passports and placards.74 Standard texts could quickly be copied from precedent books, fresh particulars being inserted on a case-by-case basis. Non-routine texts, however, needed to be drafted after each meeting by the clerks, who worked under the principal secretary\u2019s direction, but probably used their own servants as scribes. Many of these drafts, confusingly termed \u2018minutes\u2019 in the sixteenth century, survive in the State Papers Domestic.75 Even if not endorsed as such, \u2018minute\u2019 sometimes abbreviated to \u2018M.\u2019 as in this example, they are easy to spot because the scribes commonly adopted a wide line-spacing so as to allow plenty of room for corrections, which can be numerous. In Beale\u2019s day, \u2018minutes\u2019 were ostensibly scrutinized by both principal secretary and lord high treasurer of England before neat versions were presented to the other privy councillors for signature. How long this process took is unclear. Nevertheless, it is likely that some part of every Council meeting was devoted to signing dispatches relating to the proceedings of the previous session, or of sessions further back than that. We know that if a meeting was poorly attended, or if a matter was especially important, then the clerks would carry dispatches around the Court soliciting the signatures of further councillors until it was decided \u2014 by whom is not apparent \u2014 that there were enough.76 Having been folded and sealed closed, dispatches were conveyed to domestic destinations by staff of the Chamber, underlining the extent to which the Privy Council was integrated into the Household structure.\n\n\n\nRecords and Staff\n\nMuch of what the Privy Council did was reactive, so we should begin by considering the fate of incoming materials. Petitions have already been mentioned. Other documents addressed to the Council included letters from absentee councillors, English ambassadors serving abroad, chief governors of Ireland (based at Dublin), the Council in the North (based at York), the Council in the Marches of Wales (based at Ludlow), archbishops and bishops of the Church of England, justices of assize, justices of the peace, commissioners, urban authorities, senior officers of chartered trading companies and private individuals. It was not unusual for such communications to enclose reports, certificates or accounts of examinations of suspected malefactors. Some manuscripts were eventually brought together topically, such as musters returns, but the bulk were gathered into monthly bundles, which were deposited in a large compartmentalized chest. This chest, used from 1547 and endowed with a keeper answerable to the clerks, was carried from place to place as the Council itinerated. At length, as the chest filled up, old bundles were removed, ending up in the hands of the nascent State Paper Office, which stored them under the Elizabethan Banqueting House in the palace of Whitehall. What happened next is partly obscure. One scenario is that the bundles were not robust, and that conciliar documents became mixed up with papers recovered from successive secretaries of state, kept in the same place. Another scenario is that the bundles were robust, but that the burgeoning secretarial archive already contained a substantial number of Council papers that ought properly to have been pulled out. Either way, some intermingling occurred, which was fortunate because it meant that when the secretaries\u2019 papers were re-located in the palace, sometime between 1614 and 1619, certain Privy Council papers went with them and therefore avoided the complete destruction of the Banqueting House early in the latter year.77 These circumstances explain the presence of so much conciliar material in what has since become various classes of State Papers preserved at Kew.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Whitehall fire of 1619 was still a disaster for the historian of the Tudor Privy Council. For one thing, the incoming correspondence that had not leaked into the secretarial archive was burnt, along with the registers of such material that seem (on later evidence) to have been kept under Edward VI, and perhaps under Mary I too; certainly no trace of them remains.78 Moreover, a substantial proportion of the later Tudor records of two other key government departments \u2014 the Signet Office and the Privy Seal Office \u2014 were also consumed. But the \u2018minutes\u2019 of Privy Council dispatches were not safe either, for the clerks had taken to lodging them in the chest \u2014 the extant registers contain numerous references to this practice79 \u2014 and bundles of old \u2018minutes\u2019 had periodically been transferred from the chest to the basement of the Banqueting House.\n\n\n\nThe loss of the majority of the incoming materials, as well as of so many \u2018minutes\u2019, means that those registers surviving the conflagration, which mainly relate to outgoing material, now constitute the principal record of Privy Council activity. There are several gaps in the series, only some of which are accounted for by the fire; it is clear that care of the volumes was lax and that a few had vanished \u2014 presumably borrowed by officials and never returned \u2014 before 1619. The first three registers, covering the period from 10 August 1540 until two days before Henry VIII\u2019s death on 28 January 1547, at one time all belonged to the category of non-fire disappearances, but the earliest was later restored to the State Paper Office and today inaugurates the sequence deposited at Kew;80 the second is still missing, while the third is preserved at the British Library.81 Except for a few days at the beginning and end, Edward VI\u2019s reign is almost entirely covered by the Kew registers, though, as we shall see shortly, that is not to say that there have not been losses.82 Under Mary I, as might be expected given the political context of her assumption of power, the picture becomes more complicated, and the first relevant Kew volume does not begin until 22 August 1553, nearly a month after her accession, counting Lady Jane Grey\u2019s abortive reign as 6\u201319 July 1553. The second Marian volume runs on past the Queen\u2019s death on 17 November 1558 into her half-sister\u2019s reign.83 It is for the Elizabethan period that we are faced with the most serious lacunae, some extending for consecutive years, such as April 1559\u2013June 1562, September 1562\u2013November 1564 and May 1567\u2013May 1570. In fact, the 1560s, frustratingly just when the new Protestant regime was establishing itself, is easily the worst affected decade; what we possess are fragments of an unknown number of registers \u2014 some apparently little gatherings of leaves rather than all big pre-bound books \u2014 that have since been bound together.84 There are further difficulties later in the reign, conspicuous examples being the gaps for August 1593\u2013October 1595 and January 1602\u2013March 1603, the latter continuing until May 1613.\n\n\n\nThe registers extant at Kew are not of uniform character. Historians noticed long ago that most volumes have a \u2018rough\u2019 appearance, with entries written hurriedly, in a large variety of hands; indeed, many passages bear corrections and some have been struck out. In contrast, a few volumes, while still penned in a standard sixteenth-century script, seem to be fair-written texts, usually the work of one scribe, or perhaps of a small number each responsible for lengthy portions. J. R. Dasent, the lawyer who in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries published transcripts of the Tudor registers dating from after 22 April 1542, was apt to classify them as either \u2018rough\u2019 or \u2018fair\u2019 on fairly slender grounds and gave the impression that, had all the originals survived, there would have been two series, one of rough drafts and the other of fair-written copies. However, this implication was convincingly refuted by E. R. Adair. He showed that the \u2018rough\u2019 registers are the real Privy Council registers, entered up from day to day, or very nearly so. In fact, the early so-called \u2018rough\u2019 registers contain several original recognizances \u2014 essentially performance bonds, subscribed by individuals in trouble \u2014 and even councillors\u2019 autograph signatures, added for a while under Edward VI by way of verification. Adair argued that only four volumes can justifiably be called \u2018fair\u2019, though it is unclear why they were produced and for whom; in two of these four cases the \u2018rough\u2019 manuscripts are also available. There is no evidence to suggest that these four exceptional volumes were ever part of a larger series of contemporaneously fair-written copies.85\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that, when he encountered both types of register overlapping temporally, Dasent printed the fair-written one, using the \u2018rough\u2019 one \u2018to clear up certain small points of difficulty\u2019. Important discrepancies \u2014 matter found in one source, but not in the other \u2014 are noticed only vaguely in his Introduction, so that it is often difficult to determine, in the main text, exactly where he changes manuscript.86 Furthermore, two \u2018rough\u2019 Marian registers have come to light since Dasent\u2019s day, and it remains to be seen how far they differ from the fair-written version that he printed.87\n\n\n\nThe extant volumes vary in another significant way: in the nature of the material that they contain. Although Dasent chose to call his publication Acts of the Privy Council of England, that was not the Tudor designation. In the sixteenth century, each of these stout volumes was commonly termed \u2018The Counsell Booke\u2019, or \u2018this Register Booke of Counsell\u2019, or merely the \u2018register\u2019. And councillors described the products of their labours as \u2018ordres\u2019, \u2018decrees\u2019 and \u2018determynacions\u2019; in D. E. Hoak\u2019s words, \u2018only rarely did they find themselves having accomplished an \u201cActe\u201d\u2019.88 But regardless of the terminology adopted, it is crucial to understand that the registers are selective: they do not represent the totality of the Council\u2019s multifarious activities. Hoak himself points out that, under Edward VI, the Council failed to record some of its meetings; one of his examples is of an interview that it is known to have had with the French ambassador in August 1547. Professor Hoak suspects that certain omissions were procedural: the Privy Council \u2018simply chose not to record conferences with resident ambassadors\u2019.89 That seems generally to have been true for the whole of this period. The rare occasions when Queen Elizabeth consulted the Privy Council as a body are similarly undocumented in the registers. The texts of royal proclamations, covering a wide variety of matters from the prohibition of seditious books to the regulation of wages, are also omitted, despite the fact that these important instruments of government originated in the Council and many specify that the Council was to be responsible for their enforcement \u2014 they get cited often enough when councillors sought to discipline offenders.90 The Privy Council played a central role in deciding who should sit as a justice of the peace on each county bench. As magistrates died and needed replacing, fresh commissions were frequently issued by the Lord Chancellor through his ancient department of Chancery, yet the historian looks to the registers in vain for direct evidence of nominations; only when the Council removed a justice of the peace, or an appointment proved sufficiently controversial to cause a dispute, is there likely to be any trace there. Even regular events left no mark: every November, or sometimes early December, councillors joined senior judges in the Exchequer at Westminster to compile a short-list of the names of men suitable for appointment as county sheriffs for the following 12 months. The Council usually attended upon the sovereign a few days later when the final choice was made, but, once again, the registers are silent.\n\n\n\nThese exclusions become comprehensible when we realize that the duty clerk responsible for keeping the register was charged to see that \u2018nothing worthie to be registred be omitted\u2019 \u2014 \u2018worthiness\u2019 is, of course, a matter of judgement. In 1550, the Council reaffirmed what it had agreed in 1540: that registration was intended \u2018for the dischardge of the said Counsaillours tooching such thinges as they shulde passe from time to time, as also for a memoriall unto them of their owne proceadinges\u201991 The Privy Council exercised the royal prerogative by delegation. In practice, therefore, such a statement meant that it needed to have a record of instances of that exercise, a record to which reference might have to be made so as to meet any one of several conceivable eventualities: being held to account by the sovereign; facing an appeal; having to mete out punishment for non-compliance, itself a further exercise of the royal prerogative. Council activities that were advisory rather than executive, like short-listing potential sheriffs, need not be registered because prerogative power was not being deployed. Moreover, where the Privy Council was the initiator of a process concluding with the promulgation of an official instrument by another organ of central government, let us say Chancery, it left formal record of such promulgation to that other organ. What councillors did maintain, distinct from the registers, were informal compilations of important information. Thus, while the Chancery machinery formally issued commissions of the peace, doubtless based upon oral discussions between the Privy Council and the lord chancellor, individual councillors kept lists, regularly updated, of who sat on each county bench at any one time. We might say then that the Privy Council registers record executive orders that were instantly valid in their own right: they did not need to go through any other government organ for validation. This is very far from meaning, however, that the Council operated in isolation, for it attracted suits that could not be prosecuted anywhere else and referred to other bodies\u2019 suits that could. Crown policies necessarily had to be pushed through the existing institutional framework; officers were constantly bombarded with instructions. But it does mean that the Privy Council did all of this while occupying a position of unimpeachable superiority, or at least impeachable only by the sovereign. It follows from this point that the greater the degree to which a conciliar order drew upon prerogative power, and the more particular the problem to which that power was being applied, then the more likely it was that the order would be recorded formally, either in a register entry or in the shape of a \u2018minute\u2019 lodged in the chest.\n\n\n\nSo the registers were intended to be the permanent official record of the Privy Council\u2019s deployment of the royal prerogative. That deployment typically took the form of letters. But until the later 1580s, register entries consist of summaries that, from the historian\u2019s point of view, can be disappointing. Here is an entry from November 1573: \"letters to divers Bisshopes in England for the observacion of the Uniformytie in Religion, acording to the boke of Commen Prayer and her Majesties late Proclamacion.\"92 What did this circular letter say? By the 1590s, missives were transcribed in full, except for the formulaic opening and closing sentences.93\n\n\n\nA common, albeit more specialized type of dispatch, was the warrant, usually authorizing a payment. Many were addressed to the treasurer and chamberlains of the Exchequer,94 though others were sent to the treasurer of the Chamber.95 Where they were directed depended upon the structure of Crown finance, which changed dramatically under the Tudors. In the mid-sixteenth century, such warrants were dispatched to a wide variety of accounting officers, such as the treasurer of the Court of Augmentations (Sir John Williams), the receiver of the duchy of Lancaster and the receiver of the Court of Wards and Liveries.96 Sometimes the word \u2018warrant\u2019 was used other than in connection with the disbursement of money, seemingly for situations in which councillors were not so much issuing an order as signifying their approval for some course of action, perhaps the arrest of named suspects or the requisitioning of a means of conveyance.97\n\n\n\nOf the bewildering range of other kinds of document that feature amid the notices of letters and warrants, the Order in Council is prominent. These texts, rather than being addressed to anyone in particular, were declarations either of the Privy Council\u2019s judgements in specific civil disputes or of rules that would henceforth apply in some sphere of activity. For instance, in June 1565, councillors set down an Order stipulating (amongst other things) that legal suits involving inhabitants of Guernsey and Jersey should be prosecuted there and not in English courts of record.98 Incidentally, this entry clarifies what seems to have been the convention since at least February 1547:99 that what was written in the register was the actual Order in Council, but that its content might be communicated to interested parties via transcripts authenticated by the signature of one of the Privy Council\u2019s clerks. Another fine example of an Order in Council comes from May 1574, when councillors issued regulations for the government of the four Inns of Court.100\n\n\n\nInstructions generated a further category of entry. In the realm of diplomacy, instructions to ambassadors tended not to be reproduced, the register merely recording that they had been subscribed by the Privy Council. When a set of instructions was signed for Thomas Bodley\u2019s mission to Denmark in 1588, it was noted that the \u2018minute\u2019 remained in the chest.101 From the mid-1580s, as England became embroiled in war against Spain, military instructions proliferated, the texts sometimes being transcribed in full, especially during the 1590s; the instructions issued to Sir Henry Docwra in January 1599, for the conducting of 2000 footmen from the Low Countries to Ireland, are a good example here.102\n\n\n\n\u2018Placard\u2019 is not easy to define because there were lengthy periods during which the term was unused \u2014 and when it was used, it seems to have meant the same thing as a warrant other than a warrant for payment. In other words, placards authorized arrests103 and allowed requisitions.104 The word \u2018commission\u2019, as attached to items dispatched by the Privy Council, appears to have been synonymous with \u2018placard\u2019 and \u2018warrant\u2019 in the context of licensing requisitions.105 However, these so-called commissions \u2014 the nomenclature is evidently very loose \u2014 should carefully be distinguished from \u2018real\u2019 commissions, formally naming commissioners and specifying tasks, which were generated by other institutions of central government, such as Chancery and the High Court of Admiralty, admittedly sometimes at Privy Council behest.106 Indeed, it is commissions of this latter sort that are cited most often in register entries.107 \u2018Passport\u2019 is a more straightforward description, though we should note a curious reversal: today, states issue passports so that their citizens may travel abroad; in the sixteenth century, the Crown issued passports in order to permit foreigners to transit its own area of jurisdiction. Entries recording the grant of a passport to an English subject are relatively rare.108\n\n\n\nExcept for Orders in Council, which in practice took effect via transcripts authenticated by the clerks, all the other original documents issued by the Privy Council achieved their force by virtue of councillors\u2019 signatures. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to suppose that the registers notice only items for dispatch. Bonds and recognizances \u2014 two terms that are largely interchangeable \u2014 account for many entries during the mid-Tudor period, less so later. Most recognizances were for good behaviour and appearance before the Council, specifying how much money would be forfeit upon default.109 Under Elizabeth, there are lists of bonds for loans to the Crown, which were brought before the Council for cancellation.110 Scattered entries record conciliar decisions without indicating any consequent action, presumably because it was implicit; one example is the acknowledgement of agreement that the conditions of the ex-bishop of Durham\u2019s imprisonment in the Tower of London could be relaxed.111 More common, particularly for Elizabeth\u2019s reign, are notices of the appearances of those figures required to attend upon the Council according to bonds taken elsewhere.112 Indeed, it is evident that from the early 1580s, if not before, suspects appeared initially before the clerks rather than before the Privy Council itself, pleading to have their appearances recorded for the safeguard of their bonds; it is an error to assume, therefore, that the dates of these appearances necessarily correspond to the dates of Council meetings.113 Once a face-to-face examination by councillors had occurred, the result was often noted, especially when it involved summary committal to gaol.114 Finally, Council registers contain what can best be described as miscellanea. Items of interest include: plans for changes to be made to Edward VI\u2019s coronation service;115 memorials of the oath-swearing of new privy councillors, such as that of Christopher Hatton in 1577;116 a copy of a letter addressed by King James VI of Scotland to the English ambassador to his Court;117 an interleaved Order in Council about reform of Elizabeth\u2019s Household in religious affairs, unusually bearing councillors\u2019 autograph signatures;118 and the interleaved original manuscript of Arthur Hall\u2019s submission for having offended the House of Commons and impugned the reputations of some of its members.119\n\n\n\nMost registers, while maintaining a chronological arrangement, mix up letters, warrants, Orders in Council, instructions, and so forth. However, there was a period of experimentation during the ascendancy of the Duke of Somerset as lord protector in the first part of the reign of Edward VI. For mysterious reasons, the Privy Council decided, soon after Henry VIII\u2019s death, that the standard Council book should be reserved for the registration of warrants for payment and that a separate volume would be used for the registration of letters. The extant warrant-book runs from 31 January 1547 to 4 October 1549, just after the beginning of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Somerset.120 We have the start of a letter-book, written on leaves at the end of the last Henrician register, but it only extends from 6 February until 13 June 1547.121 Although there is strong evidence (in the shape of later extracts) to suggest that a fresh letter-book was kept after 13 June 1547, probably until Somerset\u2019s fall, this volume has disappeared. For over two years, therefore, the formal record of Edwardian Privy Council activity is highly imperfect.\n\n\n\nIt should be obvious from the foregoing account that with all the political and religious turmoil under the Tudors, as well as the increasing pressure of private suits, the management of Privy Council business was a struggle. Leaving aside the co-ordinating role of the principal secretary, much depended upon the diligence of the clerks. Initially only one, William Paget, the number doubled in 1543, when Paget became a privy councillor and was replaced by John Mason (already his deputy) and William Honyngs. A third clerk was added in 1547, enabling the junior clerk to be assigned the exclusive task of keeping the register, and a fourth joined the team in 1576. The total stood at four for the remainder of Elizabeth\u2019s reign, though a rota (of sorts) ensured that not all were on duty simultaneously. As Paget\u2019s elevation suggests, a clerkship of the Privy Council was no career dead-end. On the contrary, most of the sixteenth-century clerks were highly talented bureaucrats, whose considerable diplomatic and linguistic skills allowed several to serve as ambassadors in their own right. Some were knighted. They included Robert Beale, Sir Thomas Wilkes, Daniel Rogers and Sir Thomas Edmondes.\n\n\n\nSubordinate to the clerks was the keeper of the Council Chamber, first mentioned in 1547. His job was two-fold: to prepare the room for each sitting, which meant providing freshly cut flowers and sometimes purchasing new cushions, and to act as door-keeper, a function that gave plenty of scope for extorting fees from anxious suitors. Reference has already been made to the keeper of the Council chest. Apart from ensuring security as the chest was carried from place to place, he gradually assumed (from the clerks) the responsibility for maintaining supplies of stationery, such as blank pre-bound volumes for use as the register, pens and ink. Although essentially an archive, the chest was more than that, for it also held reference works, like the books of English and Irish statutes acquired in 1574,122 which might be consulted frequently. A relatively humble servant, the keeper was thus quite an important officer if the Council was to operate with any efficiency.\n\n\n\nModern Academic Debates\n\nThere have been two major controversies about the significance of the Privy Council in the sixteenth century. G. R. Elton began the first debate when he argued in 1953123 that, during his political ascendancy in the 1530s, Thomas Cromwell had created a new system that was \u2018modern\u2019 in its bureaucratic organization and \u2018national\u2019 in its scope, very different to the \u2018half-formal household\u2019 methods of government \u2014 essentially \u2018personal\u2019 \u2014 held to have been characteristic of the Middle Ages. He saw the emergence of the Privy Council \u2014 defined as a permanent, streamlined and efficient board of predominantly lay office-holders, possessing executive independence \u2014 as a key component of this crucial transformation. Various aspects of Elton\u2019s thesis were challenged in the early 1960s,124 but it was not until 1986 that a general attack was mounted in the shape of a multi-author collection of essays, one of which (by John Guy) claimed that, while some change in the 1530s is undeniable, the Privy Council resulted from a process of evolution and owed little to Cromwell\u2019s direct instrumentality.125 A related wrangle turned on the extent to which the Henrician Privy Council was a Household organ, as argued by David Starkey. Although there are tricky technical issues about where exactly the Council met, the core problem, as George Bernard has pointed out, is over categorization:\n\nStarkey is right to criticise Elton for exaggerating the difference between administration and politics ... [He] has little difficulty in showing that so rigid a distinction between administration and politics, between administration and the court, cannot be sustained. But Starkey in turn fails to convince when he claims that politics and administration \u2018inescapably overlap and interact\u2019. The claim that all government is always \u2018political\u2019 is excessive ... What Elton and Starkey are offering is a choice between two over-simplified models ... Closer to the realities of early Tudor government would be an alternative that allowed degrees of interaction between administration and politics but also allowed some separation, while seeing neither interaction nor separation as inevitable.126\n\nWe lack a comprehensive study that takes account of these revisionist insights.\n\n\n\nThe second debate concerns the Privy Council\u2019s capacity for independent government and (more broadly) the nature of the later Tudor constitution. Such matters had been sketched by Elton,127 but were taken up by Patrick Collinson in his characterization of Elizabethan England as a \u2018monarchical republic\u2019. \u2018At times\u2019, he wrote, \"there were two governments uneasily coexisting ...: the queen and her council ... two somewhat distinct poles of authority, as it were the magnetic pole and the true pole ...\" Collinson developed this idea in connection with the 1584 Bond of Association, and allied documentation, in which Lord Burghley and others envisaged, upon Elizabeth\u2019s death at the hands of Mary Stuart\u2019s Catholic supporters, the Privy Council exercising a jurisdiction that ought properly to have been extinguished \u2014 for it automatically dissolves on the demise of the Crown \u2014 so as to augment itself as a Great Council of the Crown of England, which would then recall the last Parliament in order to punish whoever had killed the Queen and determine the succession. This was, argued Collinson, \u2018the Elizabethan Exclusion Crisis\u2019.128 John Guy placed these issues into a wider context in his discussion of the tension between the notion of a sacral imperial monarchy, a notion to which Elizabeth obviously adhered, and that of a confessionally-driven conciliarism that was quasi-republican. For Guy, the dominant idiom until c.1585\u201387 was that of a \u2018mixed polity\u2019 in which the royal prerogative was limited by conciliar advice and the need to secure the assent of the whole realm in Parliament for any substantial political or religious changes. After Mary Stuart\u2019s execution in 1587, however, talk of \u2018mixed polity\u2019 went out of vogue and \u2018the theory of sacral monarchy re-established itself as the political norm\u2019. On the basis of this contrast, Guy felt justified in writing of the \u2018two\u2019 reigns of Elizabeth I.129 Collinson\u2019s idea of \u2018monarchical republicanism\u2019 has since been expanded by Stephen Alford, who traced Lord Burghley\u2019s mid-1580s contingency plans for conciliar rule back to an important text of 1563, which the then Sir William Cecil had drafted for incorporation into an abortive parliamentary Bill on the succession, though the radical implications of that text had been noted by some scholars working even before Collinson\u2019s research.130 The theme of a \u2018monarchical republic\u2019 has recently been the subject of a collection of essays, but it remains to be seen what kind of long-term impact the concept will have on the historiography.131\n\n\n\nNotes on Using the Privy Council Registers\n\nReaders wishing to trace either a general topic or a particular case through the registers will find the task challenging for various reasons. Some disputes were handled intermittently over several weeks, even months and years. Unfortunately, however, cross-referencing within entries is not only patchy, but may also be inaccurate through the misquotation of dates. Indeed, it may be fruitless, given current gaps in the manuscripts. Dasent\u2019s publication offers some help, though not much. The basic problem here is that his series of volumes amounts to a transcription rather than an edition, as modern scholarship would understand that term. This means that, apart from dealing with selected issues in his (by now superseded) Introductions, he neither contextualized entries, nor attempted to offer personal identifications; such a huge project was too daunting. These drawbacks are reflected in Dasent\u2019s indices. For one thing, the indices concentrate on proper names, whether of individuals or of places, at the expense of subjects; a modern edition would be much more systematic in the treatment of subjects. For another thing, they list in alphabetical order the myriad spellings \u2014 some highly eccentric \u2014 in which personal names appear in the registers, without seeking to cross-reference (either to each other or to a standard form) those that relate to the same person. A similar difficulty emerges where name spellings are identical, or nearly so, across several register entries, but the entries introduce variant territorial identifiers. Dasent indexed these personal names on the assumption that they belonged to distinct individuals. Only readers with a detailed knowledge of the period will recognize, for instance, that, in the 1580s, William Shelley of Michelgrove in Sussex was also William Shelley of Sutton in Herefordshire. It is the same story in respect of office-holders. Those writing register entries were utterly inconsistent as to whether they referred to office-holders by name or by office, though there was a clear preference for the latter overall. So an entry might record that the lord treasurer had been sent a letter ordering him to make a payment to Mr Baeshe; it omits to explain that this was because Baeshe was general surveyor of victuals for the navy. For certain major offices, such as bishop, Dasent principally indexed under the office title, but for others, such as lord keeper of the great seal, he principally indexed under the holder\u2019s surname. Whichever strategy he adopted, Dasent sought, in these cases, to bring together in one place all references to the same person. Yet he failed to do this in respect of lesser offices whose incumbents could not readily be identified. Thus, for example, the Robert Worsley cited in one register entry is taken in the index to be different to the Mr Worseley (of unspecified Christian name) who is mentioned in another entry as keeper of recusant prisoners in Manchester; they were the same. The upshot of these remarks is that readers searching on the basis of Dasent\u2019s indices need to consider more than simply the obvious spelling of a personal name and to remember that individuals may feature elsewhere in the registers, albeit identified either in association with an office or only by that office.\n\n\n\nIt is important to bear in mind two points concerning the calendar. The first point is that England used the Julian Calendar (later called \u2018Old Style\u2019) throughout "}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Privy-Council-United-Kingdom-government", "page_content": "Privy Council, historically, the British sovereign\u2019s private council. Once powerful, the Privy Council has long ceased to be an active body, having lost most of its judicial and political functions since the middle of the 17th century. This atrophy was a result of the decline of the sovereign\u2019s responsibility for political decisions as power moved from the monarch to the prime minister and the cabinet. In modern times, meetings of the Privy Council are held for the making of formal decisions.\n\nThe Privy Council is descended from the Curia Regis, which was made up of the king\u2019s tenants in chief, household officials, and other advisers. This group performed all the functions of government in either small groups, which became the king\u2019s council, or large groups, which grew into the great council and Parliament.\n\nBy the time of the reign of Henry VII (1485\u20131509), the king\u2019s council had become the instrument of the crown; it was made up of the Privy Council, the prerogative courts of Chancery, Star Chamber, and High Commission, and their local subsidiaries.\n\nThe council system worked well as long as the king was capable of choosing the right men and providing leadership. The kings from the house of Stuart were unable to do this, and jealousy and anger at the council\u2019s political activities grew among parliamentarians and common lawyers. Amid the religious and constitutional controversies of the mid-17th century, the council system was swept away, but the Privy Council was never formally abolished. It was revived under Charles II (1660\u201385), but after that the crown increasingly turned to the cabinet. An attempt to return the Privy Council to power was made in the Act of Settlement of 1701 (Hanoverian Succession), but it proved futile.\n\nFrom the time of the accession of George I (1714\u201327), the Privy Council became a purely formal body meeting to transact formal business. By 1960 there were more than 300 members, mostly dignitaries who held or had held high political, judicial, or ecclesiastical office, along with an occasional eminent person in science or letters.\n\nThere is, however, a Privy Council office, with the lord president of the council as responsible minister. It is concerned with the making of orders in council and issuing royal charters, chiefly to municipal corporations and to charitable bodies engaged in education, research, and the encouragement of literature, science, and the arts. The council bears the main responsibility for research through the department of scientific and industrial research. Usually it functions through committees, the most noteworthy being the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which was established by statute and hears appeals from ecclesiastical courts, prize courts, and courts from the colonies as well as some independent members of the Commonwealth."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zqt9xsg/revision/2", "page_content": "Elizabeth\u2019s first key task was to surround herself with trusted advisers, a group called the Privy Council .\n\nThe Privy Council were a group of powerful noblemen appointed by Elizabeth.

They were tasked with offering advice to the Anglo-Saxon kings such as Alfred the Great .\n\nHistorically, in the UK, the Privy Council is a formal body of advisers to the British sovereign who guide the monarch on the exercise of their royal duties. Members are appointed by the monarch; today, it is mainly comprised of senior politicians, while the archbishops of York and Canterbury and the Bishop of London become members automatically upon their appointments.\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest of 1066, a council known as curia regis \u2013 'royal council' or 'king's court' \u2013 conducted much of England's state business, replacing the former Witena\u0121emot. The curia regis met on special occasions, or when it was summoned by the king, and was comprised of high-ranking officials and land-owning ecclesiastics. The term 'privy' was not actually applied to the council until the 15th century.\n\nIs there an initiation ceremony?\n\nNew members of the Privy Council still take an oath. Before 1998, when it officially became public, it was considered criminal, and possibly treasonous, to reveal said oath.

They were also used by the monarch as a way of bypassing parliament and the courts. In 1540, Henry VIII\u2019s Privy Council included men such as Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk and President of the Privy Council, Thomas Audley, Lord Chancellor and Sir Richard Rich, the King\u2019s solicitor.\n\nThe Privy Council managed parliament itself, using it as a weapon to help influence the decisions of the sovereign\n\nWhile Parliament during the Tudor and Elizabethan periods was an intermittent body, the Privy Council met every day by the end of Elizabeth I\u2019s reign. Indeed, the Privy Council managed parliament itself, often using it as a weapon to help influence the decisions of the sovereign. During the so-called \u2018personal rule\u2019 of Charles I \u2013 the 11-year period between 1629-40, when the monarch ruled without summoning Parliament once \u2013 the Privy Council, in parliament\u2019s absence, had the power to issue and enforce law and order.\n\nHow has the Privy Council's role and powers changed?\n\nDuring the British Civil Wars, the Privy Council (together with the monarchy and House of Lords) was abolished by Oliver Cromwell. Instead, he appointed a Council of State, which was later known as the Protector\u2019s Privy Council, in 1649, following the execution of Charles I. Comprised of 13-21 men, elected by parliament to advise Cromwell, the Council sat until 1660, when Charles II was restored to the throne. He reinstated the Privy Council, albeit much smaller than its Tudor cousin.\n\nThe development of constitutional monarchy during the 18th and 19th centuries ( ie, a monarchy restricted by laws and which shares its power with government) saw the role of the Privy Council change to an administrative link between monarch and government with limited functions. Today, some 650 people sit on the Privy Council including current and former prime ministers, Prince Charles and Prince Philip. Instead of sitting daily, it meets about once a month, presided over by the Queen.\n\nHave any monarchs ever ignored the advice of their Privy Council?\n\nThe last monarch to refuse an order of the Privy Council was Queen Anne in March 1708. She withheld royal assent on the Scottish Militia Bill, fearing that the proposed Scottish troops would be disloyal to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis content first appeared in the April 2017 issue of BBC History Revealed"}, {"url": "https://inews.co.uk/news/privy-council-what-meaning-members-accession-council-king-charles-iii-1845000", "page_content": "Following her death at the age of 96, Queen Elizabeth was succeeded by her oldest son, King Charles.\n\nThe former Prince of Wales, now King Charles III, said in a statement after his mother\u2019s passing: \u201cThe death of my beloved mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.\u201d\n\nCharles became King without ceremony. However he will be formally proclaimed King in front of an Accession Council \u2013 made up of Privy Counsellors \u2013 which traditionally convenes soon after the sovereign\u2019s death.\n\nWhat is the Privy Council?\n\nThe Privy Council dates back to the 13th Century, when it was an executive arm of the English Government.\n\nHowever, its powers declined over time and its political authority transferred to the Cabinet in the late 17th Century.\n\nIt remains an advisory body to the monarch, with the Privy Counsellors required to take special oaths.\n\nCounsellors are appointed by the monarch on the advice of those who have held senior political or judicial roles in the UK or Commonwealth.\n\nWho is in the Privy Council?\n\nThere are 718 Privy Counsellors, including lifetime peers and senior politicians, civil servants, Commonwealth high commissioners, and the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nIn normal circumstances these members advise the monarch on matters of state.\n\nThe Privy Council Office is responsible for summonsing or inviting Privy Counsellors and certain other dignitaries to the King\u2019s accession, and so not all Counsellors will be in attendance.\n\nWhat happens at the Accession Council of Charles III?\n\nCharles is scheduled to be formally proclaimed King on Saturday 10 September at 10am, in front of the Accession Council at St. James\u2019s Palace, London.\n\nHere, there will be a formal proclamation of the death of the monarch and the accession to the throne of the new sovereign.\n\nThe number of people who can attend usually exceeds 700, but given the short notice, the turnout is expected to be lower.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said the council will be split into two parts.\n\n\u201cPart I, the Privy Council, without the King present, will proclaim the Sovereign, and formally approve various consequential Orders, including the arrangements for the Proclamation,\u201d it said.\n\nAt this meeting, the Lord President of the Privy Council \u2013 currently Penny Mordaunt MP \u2013 will announce the death of Queen Elizabeth II and call upon the Clerk of the Council to read aloud the Accession Proclamation text.\n\nThen, the proclamation is signed by senior figures including the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord Chancellor.\n\nOnce the procomlotion has been signed, the Lord President calls for silence and announces the remaining items of business, which deal with matters such as circulating the proclamation and directing orders to fire guns at Hyde Park and the Tower of London.\n\nBuckingham Palace added: \u201cPart II is the holding by The King of His Majesty\u2019s first Privy Council. The King will make his Declaration and read and sign an oath to uphold the security of the Church in Scotland and approve Orders in Council which facilitate continuity of government.\u201d"}]}
