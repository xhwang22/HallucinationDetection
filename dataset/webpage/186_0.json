He took the Vikes through 1983, with a 39-10-17 regular-season record in 12 seasons, before handing the coaching reins to former national team player Bruce Twamley.\n\n\n\nHughes' tenure on the UVic soccer bench is surpassed only by Bruce Wilson 's current 30-season run. Hughes is one of only five coaches to have guided the Vikes in 50 years, including team founder Wally Milligan for three seasons, Twamley for four seasons and former Canadian national team player Ike MacKay for one season.\n\n\n\nHughes coached UVic to its first CIAU national men's soccer title in 1975, defeating the Alberta Golden Bears and Saskatchewan Huskies in the Canada West playoffs, before downing Dalhousie and Concordia as UVic hosted the national tournament at Centennial Stadium.\n\n\n\n\"Brian was an excellent coach and was very good at inspiring a group of young, energetic players we had at the time,\" said Robin Burrell, who played for UVic under Hughes. \"It was a learning experience from the outset, and Brian was instrumental in instilling a love for the game in all who were fortunate enough to learn from him.\"\n\n\n\nSeveral of Hughes' later UVic players went on to play in the Canadian national team program.\n\n\n\n\"Many great players emerged from UVic,\" noted Burrell.\n\n\n\nTwamley guided the Vikes to their second of five national titles in 1987. Although no longer coach, that championship was sweet for Hughes, because son John Hughes was a star player on the 1987 UVic team. Brian Hughes was especially proud to see his son graduate from Mount Douglas Secondary \u2014 where he played on a Rams team that included Yahoo co-founder Jeff Mallett and historic soccer heart-transplant pro Simon Keith \u2014 before John Hughes went on to play pro in the CSL for the Victoria Vistas and internationally for Canada U-19 and then earning five caps with the Canadian senior national team. Brian Hughes, as the inaugural head coach of the Vistas, got to coach his son in the CSL.\n\n\n\nHughes continued his respected coaching career and taught the game at several levels, including with the national team program. Hughes, with co-coach Brett Hyslop, guided the Lower Island team to the Canadian U-19 title in 1993.\n\n\n\nAs a player, Brian Hughes made the U-23 team for Wales and performed professionally for Swansea City from 1956 to 1964. He was a highly proficient defender, scoring seven goals from his rearguard position, in 231 English League appearances.\n\n\n\nHughes led Swansea to a breathless run in the 1963-64 FA Cup, beating Barrow, Sheffield United, Stoke City and Liverpool before just failing to make the final in Wembley after bowing 2-1 in a semifinal loss to Preston North End before 68,000 fans at Villa Park in Birmingham.\n\n\n\nHughes came to the fledgling NASL, playing in the league's first two season in 1967 and 1968, for the Atlanta Chiefs. He moved to Victoria in 1970, beginning his Island soccer journey as playing coach of London Boxing Club of the VISL.\n\n\n\n\"Brian was such a nice guy and also very competitive. He had played at a high level for Swansea, so he understood the game well. He understood it inside out,\" said Frank Woods, who played under Hughes at UVic, and later in the national team program.\n\n\n\nHughes' former players and others in the Island soccer community are invited to attend a celebration of his life on Nov. 3, between 2 to 5 p.m., at the Uplands Golf Club clubhouse.\n\n\n\nHughes is survived by his wife of 60 years, Lorna, son John and granddaughters Kierra, Carys, Brynna, Shelby and Abbey.

(Of the latter, his influences have thus far been primarily Latin.) Not restricted entirely to conventional guitars, Hughes has also been known to employ the oud, bouzouki and balalaika. He has for over twenty four years worked in the studio with singer/songwriter Loreena McKennitt,[1] co-produced many of her recordings, and leads her touring band. Hughes has many albums starting from the early 1990s. His music is contemporary jazz using the jazz guitar for his instrumental music. His latest release is the CD Fast Train To A Quiet Place released in July 2011. Many of his works can be heard on The Weather Channel's Local on the 8's and on Sirius XM's Watercolors channel.\n\nHughes grew up in Alberta, Canada and studied at Grant MacEwan College (now MacEwan University) in Edmonton and the Banff School of Fine Arts with guitarists Ed Bickert and Gene Bertoncini. In 1981 he moved temporarily to Los Angeles where he studied at the Guitar Institute with Pat Martino, Joe DiOrio and Robben Ford. In 1987 Hughes relocated to Toronto where he began working with harpist Loreena McKennitt and in 1991 recorded his first album as a leader for Justin Time Records. Hughes subsequently recorded \"Under One Sky\" for Justin Time in 1992 and then started his own label Sylvan House Music in 1995 which was distributed by Warner Music Canada and licensed to Higher Octave / EMI in the USA and abroad.

In 1992, when Loreena was nominated for a Juno Award as producer on The Visit, Brian was also nominated as co-producer for his work on the album. He also mixed her 2012 Grammy-nominated Troubadours on the Rhine.\n\nThe Visit won a Juno Award for Best Roots & Traditional Album and is the recording that propelled Loreena onto the international stage.\n\nAn accomplished guitarist/composer/producer, Brian has been described as \u201cunclassifiable\u201d and \u201cgenre busting\u201d. He has built a successful career of his own, recording nine jazz albums, most of them released under his own record label Sylvan House Music and available through his website. Over the years, he\u2019s earned a string of accolades, including winning SOCAN\u2019s Jazz and Instrumental Composer of the Year Award seven times. \u201cIt\u2019s really great when you get acknowledged \u2013 it\u2019s a little notch in your belt, but then you move on,\u201d he says.\n\nSo where did it all start?\n\n\u201cI was around 14 or 15 and I was only dabbling in guitar really. I\u2019d be walking home from school having these fantasies about being on stage in Edmonton or Vancouver playing for 20,000 people. I guess it kinda worked out,\u201d he laughs.\n\nBorn in Alberta, Canada, Brian moved to Los Angeles in 2000 to pursue opportunities in the robust jazz community there. Through the decades his music has been influenced by everyone from Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix to Talking Heads and jazz great Wes Montgomery. When he was a teenager, his friend\u2019s sister was into Celtic music and that\u2019s where he heard it first. \u201cWhen I did that 15-minute section of the Toronto concert with Loreena in 1987 as soon as she started playing I knew all the parts would come together, that I could move my jazz and rock sensibility into the music.\u201d\n\nBrian\u2019s main instrument is guitar, but he also plays the oud, bouzouki and the balalaika. He has toured with The Chieftains, produced and mixed international platinum-selling albums for several prominent Greek recording artists, appeared with Loreena on The Late Show with David Letterman, and the title track from his album Shakin\u2019 Not Stirred was featured in an episode of the popular television series Sex and the City.\n\nBrian has also joined creative forces with two other long-standing members of Loreena\u2019s band: cellist/singer Caroline Lavelle and violinist Hugh Marsh in a project dubbed Secret Sky. Four years ago, they released their first CD by the same name. Despite living in three different countries, they were able to stitch together the music remotely thanks to Brian\u2019s production skills, the advancements in home recording technology and as Brian puts it, \u201cwith a lot of back and forthing\u201d. He describes the album as having \u201cthe passionate feel reminiscent of some of the expansive, filmic albums of the \u201870s\u201d. To the layperson, it may seem like a strange way to make a record, but it\u2019s become increasingly common and easier to produce.\n\n\u201cWith Loreena\u2019s albums we had the luxury of all being in the same room. That way, you have the opportunity to pick up on the vibes of other musicians and work off each other,\u201d says Brian. \u201cBut both ways have their benefits.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Visit: The Definitive Edition, Brian is looking back 30 years to the time of the original recording in 1991. Three decades is a long time and he admits his brain is \u201ca bit fuzzy\u201d, but there are some things that are etched in his memory.\n\nHis girlfriend at the time, Pamela (now his wife of 27 years), had an apartment in Toronto back then where her brother\u2019s balalaika hung on the wall. He\u2019d won it as a prize for best costume on a cruise when he was 12 (dressed as a chicken). One day while working on The Visit, Brian took the balalaika off the wall and started playing. When Loreena heard the instrument, she felt it belonged in the musical imagery of \u201cThe Lady of Shalott\u201d, and so it made its way into the recording.\n\n\u201cThey were pretty intense studio sessions and we were at it every day,\u201d recalls Brian. \u201cLoreena\u2019s more of a morning person and I\u2019m more of an evening person, but it all worked out. The sessions were a lot of fun. We were big on textures and ambient sounds and we had these wonderful tribal drum sounds, Middle Eastern percussion and great fiddling.\u201d\n\nLoreena has her own special memories from the time and of working with Brian. \u201cIt\u2019s been great to have Brian\u2019s support all these years, in the studio and on the road. In addition to being able to travel the world while performing, we\u2019ve also had some great times, great meals and some really great laughs. I remember one time when we were recording at Real World Studios and I was auditioning musicians. Out of fun, I put little coloured dots on my forehead and I would add to them as the day went on. Before each of the musicians would come in to play for me, Brian would mention to them that I had this odd fascination with putting dots on my forehead. But he cautioned them to please, whatever they do, don\u2019t say anything when they met me. The musician would politely come into the studio and we\u2019d work with them playing a few tracks, all the while suspecting how whacky they must have thought I was. When the day was over, we had a great laugh over how considerate and respectful everyone had been, though likely privately wondering \u2018what was up with her\u2019!\u201d\n\nBrian too has some funny memories from The Visit. \u201cI can remember Loreena saying to me, \u2018Brian, give me a drag of your cigarette\u2019, then it would go to her head and she\u2019d have to lie down on the sofa for 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nThese days, Brian and his wife Pamela divide their time between L.A. and their hacienda in Mexico. Since the pandemic put the kibosh on live performances of all kinds, they\u2019ve been working on their place in Mexico and \u201cdoing a lot of dog walking\u201d.\n\nAnd of course, he\u2019s dreaming again of performing in front of thousands of people someday soon.\n\nBrian Hughes on Spotify\n\nBrian Hughes Best Of on Spotify\n\nBrian Hughes on AppleMusic\n\nwww.brianhughes.com\n\nSecret Sky on Spotify\n\nSecret Sky on AppleMusic\n\nwww.secretskymusic.com\n\nWritten by Diane Sewell, a career journalist for more than 30 years.

When Brian is not playing, composing, or teaching music, he is seen on the tennis court where he displays equal talent!\n\n\n\nIrish pianist Brian Hughes recently graduated with Distinction in a Master of Performance in Collaborative Piano at the Royal College of Music, training in many areas including improvisation and composition for the screen.\n\nHe has performed across a wide variety of genres, including art song, opera, musical theatre, popular and orchestral. Venues he has performed in across London include the Royal Albert Hall (opening ceremony of the ATP Champions\u2019 Tennis Finals), Wigmore Hall (auditioning for an Irish Heritage Bursary), Princess Alexandra Hall at the Royal Over-Seas League (Irish Heritage concert), and recitals in churches such as St Marylebone (with flutist Amy Gillen), St. James\u2019 Sussex Gardens (with soprano Leilani Barratt) and St. George\u2019s Hanover Square (Irish Heritage Christmas Concert).\n\nBrian has a lifetime of experience in music education working with all ages. His teaching style has a rare sensitivity to engaging and working with others, which he has developed not just through his one-to-one teaching, but also as an accompanist with choirs, singers, and instrumentalists of all ages.\n\nBrian loves to teach piano holistically by incorporating many different elements into his lessons to help students become well-rounded musicians: playing by ear, playing by imitation, improvising, reading, singing, working on technique and composing, aiming to connect all these different aspects of music with one another.\n\nAs someone who first began playing by ear and improvising, to then learning piano by reading, Brian\u2019s teaching philosophy is that it is possible to learn both simultaneously and that it doesn\u2019t need to be one or the other.\u201d\n\nBrian was the musical director and arranger/composer for a new musical entitled The Ballad of the Cosmo Cafe in 2019, which was performed in Belsize Park as part of the Insiders/Outsiders festival.

(Of the latter, his influences have thus far been primarily Latin.) Not restricted entirely to conventional guitars, Hughes has also been known to employ the oud, bouzouki and balalaika. He has for over twenty four years worked in the studio with singer/songwriter Loreena McKennitt,[1] co-produced many of her recordings, and leads her touring band. Hughes has many albums starting from the early 1990s. His music is contemporary jazz using the jazz guitar for his instrumental music. His latest release is the CD Fast Train To A Quiet Place released in July 2011. Many of his works can be heard on The Weather Channel's Local on the 8's and on Sirius XM's Watercolors channel.\n\nHughes grew up in Alberta, Canada and studied at Grant MacEwan College (now MacEwan University) in Edmonton and the Banff School of Fine Arts with guitarists Ed Bickert and Gene Bertoncini. In 1981 he moved temporarily to Los Angeles where he studied at the Guitar Institute with Pat Martino, Joe DiOrio and Robben Ford. In 1987 Hughes relocated to Toronto where he began working with harpist Loreena McKennitt and in 1991 recorded his first album as a leader for Justin Time Records. Hughes subsequently recorded \"Under One Sky\" for Justin Time in 1992 and then started his own label Sylvan House Music in 1995 which was distributed by Warner Music Canada and licensed to Higher Octave / EMI in the USA and abroad. Brian recorded three more albums (Straight To You, One 2 One and Shakin' Not Stirred) under this arrangement before releasing Along The Way with A440 music group in 2003. Hughes returned to his Sylvan House Music imprint for the release of LIVE (2007), No Reservations concert DVD (2009) and Fast Train to a Quiet Place in July 2011. Brian relocated to Los Angeles in 2000 where he continues to reside.\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBrian received the SOCAN (Society of Canadian Authors and Composers) Jazz and Instrumental Composer of the Year award in: 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2008. He was also nominated for a Juno Award as \"Producer of the Year\" in 1991 for the Loreena McKennitt album \"The Visit\".\n\nDiscography\n\nTitle Year of Release Current Label Between Dusk...And Dreaming 1991 Justin Time Records Under One Sky 1992 Justin Time Records Straight To You 1996 Sylvan House Music / Distribution 13 One 2 One 1998 Sylvan House Music / Distribution 13 Shakin' Not Stirred 1999 Sylvan House Music / Distribution 13 Along The Way 2003 Sylvan House Music Live 2007 Sylvan House Music / Distribution 13 No Reservations concert DVD 2009 Sylvan House Music / Distribution 13 Fast Train to a Quiet Place 2011 Sylvan House Music / Distribution 13\n\nYahoo Music - Brian Hughes Albums\n\nReferences\n\nYanow, Scott.
