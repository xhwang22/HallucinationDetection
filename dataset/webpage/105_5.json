He emphasizes York\u2019s successes, but by no means avoids its obstacles and problems. The result is a history that effectively delineates the university as observers and participants broadly saw it over time\u2026Horn\u2019s history is buoyant and optimistic\u2026\u201d\n\n-Paul Stortz, Literary Review of Canada, Vol. 17, No. 2, March 2009\n\nTORONTO, March 26, 2009 -- On Thursday, March 26, 2009, York University marks a momentous occasion\u2014the 50th anniversary of the York University Act. A year-long celebration will include numerous \u201cU50\u201d events showcasing the successes that have been built by the faculty, researchers, students, administrators, and partners from different disciplines over five decades.\n\nAs a memorial for this landmark occasion, York is publishing a history of the university. York University: The Way Must Be Tried is a co-publication with McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press. In 2002, President Lorna Marsden named Michiel Horn, Professor Emeritus of History, Glendon College of York University, as the author of the official history of York University.\n\nYork University: The Way Must Be Tried is a definitive history. Michiel Horn has drawn together the vision and the people who have contributed to the greatness of York. He documents the founding of a brand new university, with 76 students and 50 faculty members, and follows the making of this major institution right through to the position that York University has achieved to date \u2013 the third-largest university in Canada, with 52,000 students enrolled in 11 faculties on two campuses (2007 figures). Horn deftly weaves together the archival research with anecdotes he gleaned from personal interviews with over 250 faculty members, Senate members, Board members, administrative staff, and students to shape his compelling image of York University.\n\nSays Horn, \u201cYork has grown, sometimes according to plan, sometimes haphazardly, sometimes in response to external forces, but almost always in the spirit of (its motto)\u2014\u201cTentanda Via, the way must be tried.\u201d\n\nThe Odyssey Begins\n\nThe institutional odyssey started in 1957 when a group of Toronto business and professional people saw an opportunity to meet the demands for adult education in the fastest-growing city in Canada. With the availability of public funds through the federal government and the anticipated impact of the baby boomers in the 1960s, the organizing committee received the green light to establish a university in federation with the University of Toronto.\n\nOn March 26, 1959, the York University Act received royal assent.\n\nThe Original Vision: A Small Liberal Arts University\n\nFrom the beginning, the establishment of York University was seen as an opportunity to develop a unique intellectual environment. If you were to choose one word to describe York\u2019s ethos, it is \u201cinterdisciplinarity\u201d\u2014\u201cthe commitment of faculty members and students to make an effort to look and reach across disciplinary boundaries in their teaching, learning, and research,\u201d says Horn.\n\nThe first president, Murray G. Ross, conceived of the original vision for York as a small liberal arts university with a program that would focus on \u201cliberal and general education, as opposed to one of specialization.\u201d In early 1962, Ross believed that growth should be slow and guided. However, a report by the Committee of Presidents of the Universities of Ontario warned that enrolment would increase more rapidly than expected. York\u2019s Board of Governors made the decision to expand\u2014the target: 7,000 students by 1970.\n\nWith this decision, Ross ran into opposition from the faculty. This led to one of the first confrontations York would witness between a president and the faculty, with Ross being charged with not living up to earlier agreements. In the end, the board sided with Ross. The incident is now part of York University\u2019s folklore and mythology.\n\nOver the course of Ross\u2019 tenure, York grew enormously. By 1970, 9,000 full-time students and 6,300 part-time undergraduates were enrolled on two campuses. York\u2019s budget had increased to $29 million, with 700 faculty members and 1,700 administration staff. This rapid growth had been demanded by the government and was necessary to meet the demographic realities.\n\nKeele Campus\n\nOn many levels, the rapid growth of York University mirrors the incredible growth of the GTA. Early students on the Keele campus pictured themselves as \u201cpioneers.\u201d The major construction projects under way gave the campus a vital energy. It was brand new and the students themselves were often the first in their families to attend a university\u2014a pattern that continues to this day.\n\nYork University was often prescient in seeing trends ahead of the curve, then building to meet the needs posited by these trends. In 1961, when the Toronto Board of Education stressed the necessity of improved access to higher education for adults, Ross\u2019 long-range vision of an evening college with its own program of study, targeting working people, was justified, and York established the Joseph E. Atkinson College.\n\nIn 1968, Osgoode Hall Law School became a faculty at York. Osgoode developed the reputation for engaging the law with other disciplines in exciting and imaginative ways and this was a major attraction for both faculty and students. In 1971, Osgoode\u2019s operation of Parkdale Community Legal Services became a story of success for the community; by 2005 Ontario had 75 clinics modeled on Parkdale, which was \u201cthe jewel in the crown of the legal clinic system.\u201d\n\nEarly Milestones\n\nIn 1965, York reached two milestones\u2014a new York University Act was passed and the university severed ties to the University of Toronto. York, eager to celebrate its independence, launched its own fundraising campaign, the York University Founders Fund Campaign.\n\nIn 1963, the twenty-year master plan for York University was released: by 1980 the enrolment target would be 20,000 students, 1700 faculty and 3200 other staff members. Glendon would be home to the liberal arts university modelled on US institutions such as Amherst, Atkinson College would continue to develop as planned and the Keele campus would be home to a multi-faculty university with both undergraduate and graduate programs. The total cost for the completion of the complex of buildings necessary to support the master plan came to $150 million\u2014money that would come from the provincial government and the Founders Fund Campaign.\n\nIn 1965, Ross appointed Escott Reid to be the founding principal of Glendon College. Reid proposed that Glendon become bilingual and bicultural\u2014\u201cGlendon College should play a great role in helping to train a new generation of Canadians who would make a better job of relations between English- and French-speaking Canadians than their parents and grandparents.\u201d Students who applied to Glendon were attracted by its small size and by the opportunity to improve or maintain their French-language skills. And Glendon\u2019s public forums attracted political heavyweights such as Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, Ramsay Cook, and Eric Kierans.\n\nThe Meaning of the Historic Events of 1972\n\nThe years 1972/1973 witnessed the most dramatic episode in York\u2019s history. In 1972, York\u2019s deans were in full revolt against President David Slater, and this forced the Board of Governors to secure his resignation. It began in the fall of 1972, when provincial government grants to universities were lower and enrolment had fallen. York seemed to be bucking this trend and the academic planners prepared optimistic forecasts, with \u201creal monies being committed on a hypothetical income.\u201d As a result, a modest rise in enrolment resulted in a $4-million shortfall for York. Slater recommended that the Senate consider the dismissal of tenured and untenured faculty for budgetary reasons. However, his indecision in the face of opposition from the Senate and the faculty called his leadership into question.\n\nIn fact, says Horn, York\u2019s structures were unequal to the challenges caused by the shortfall. People were looking for someone to blame and Slater became the victim. Horn, who was monitoring the meetings with great concern for the welfare and security of the faculty, gives a riveting, first-person account of this struggle.\n\nIn 1974, H. Ian Macdonald, a former Deputy Minister of Economics, was named York\u2019s third president. His greatest challenge\u2014 dealing with the bad press that York had received.\n\nFuture Tense\n\nBy 2008, the Keele campus had changed dramatically. The architectural face of York University has grown. The New Archives of Ontario is currently under construction and the Seymour Schulich Building has been finished. The campus population, which is the equivalent to a city the size of Belleville on a weekday, reflects the multicultural nature of Toronto\u2014the two most prominent groups on campus being those of Chinese and South Asian heritage.\n\nHorn explains that \u201cthe heterogeneity of the student body has presented challenges. The issue of race has been contentious over the years.\u201d A number of high-profile confrontations between groups with conflicting views prompted York University to issue a statement on York Values in 2008 during the celebration of their fifth annual Multi-cultural Week, calling for a \u201creciprocity of respect.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, a report on the future of York University for the coming three decades, entitled 2020 Vision: The Future of York, recommended York become a \u201ccomprehensive university, developing its own distinctive idiom with a focus on growth...\u201d In this quest, York has become more research-intensive. Current President Mamdouh Shoukri is committed to raising York\u2019s research profile in health and the pure sciences and engineering. With the successful launch of the Faculty of Health, York has now positioned itself to make a case for a medical school.\n\nToday, universities focus on public-private partnerships that work toward practical applications. To this end, two faculties will be merged on July 1, 2009, to form the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies\u2014Atkinson College and the Faculty of Arts. Horn sees this as a unique opportunity to re-shape the university\u2019s future in the 50th anniversary year.\n\nInternationally, York University\u2019s strengths are perceived to be the social sciences, the fine arts, the Seymour Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School. With the growth of transnational corporations, business schools have had to develop a global approach. By 2006, the Seymour Schulich School of Business had opened training centres in Beijing, Mumbai, Seoul, and a corporate governance centre in Moscow. A number of influential organizations rank universities. Business schools live and die by these rankings and Schulich has performed well\u2014it has been ranked first in Canada for the MBA programs for the sixth straight year by The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal ranks Schulich Number One in Canada and eleventh in the world.\n\nIn the past decade, York has increased its support of research in response to the recommendations of the 2020 Vision report. Already a leader in Knowledge Mobilization, York is home to high-powered research centres that make up the Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science (CRESS). Biochemist and molecular biologist Ronald Pearlman notes that \u201c\u2026the pursuit of funding is highly competitive, but York has done well\u2026 insiders and granting agencies know that York has a strong and well-deserved reputation in science.\u201d\n\nYork\u2019s achievements may also be measured by the success of its fundraising campaigns. The target for the current Power of 50 fundraising campaign is $200 million\u2014an enormous increase over the original York University Founders Fund Campaign, whose goal was $15 million. Over the years, York\u2019s remarkable stature has attracted a large amount of philanthropic support and by 2008, the Power of 50 campaign had already raised more than three quarters of its goal.\n\nMichiel Horn is Professor Emeritus of History, Glendon College of York University. A prolific author and editor, his most recent publications are the award-winning Academic Freedom in Canada: A History (1999), and the English-language translations of a novel by Dutch author Maarten \u2019t Hart, The Sundial (De zonnewijzer) (2004) and a work by sociologist Benjo Maso, Sweat of the Gods: Myths and Legends of Bicycle Racing (Het zweet der goden: legende van de wielersport) (2005).\n\nYork University is the leading interdisciplinary research and teaching university in Canada. York offers a modern, academic experience at the undergraduate and graduate level in Toronto, Canada\u2019s most international city. The third largest university in the country, York is host to a dynamic academic community of 50,000 students and 7,000 faculty and staff, as well as more than 200,000 alumni worldwide. York\u2019s 11 faculties and 26 research centres conduct ambitious, groundbreaking research that is interdisciplinary, cutting across traditional academic boundaries. This distinctive and collaborative approach is preparing students for the future and bringing fresh insights and solutions to real-world challenges.

His work was presented as a poster in a research conference at the University, and he went on to complete his undergraduate honours thesis with Haas.\n\n\u201cI presented my work as an undergraduate thesis manuscript, which taught me a lot about scientific writing,\u201d said Fawzy.\n\nOutside the classroom, Fawzy was immersed in many student success programs and student clubs, many at Stong and Calumet Colleges. He was a peer tutor and a peer mentor with the Kinesiology and Health Science student Organization (KAHSSO), and become president of KAHSSO in his fourth year, overseeing its free peer tutoring and peer mentoring programs and student success events. Fawzy also held roles as a president\u2019s ambassador, a student health ambassador and an executive at two student clubs: The Canadian Association of Research in Regenerative Medicine (CARRM) and SickKids. Additionally, he held governance positions including as a student representative at the Faculty of Health petitions committee and the Faculty of Health Council. He also sat on the Student Success Council at Stong and Calumet Colleges.\n\nA point of pride for Fawzy is his role in the creation of the Ambassador Program under KAHSSO with the help of the executive council and support of Stong and Calumet colleges. The program, he said, was initially created to enhance events on campus, but is now evolving to go beyond campus and engage high school students as well create a kinesiology alumni network and many other initiatives in the local community geared around mental health and career exploration.\n\n\u201cIt is really difficult for me to pinpoint one learning experience that was most valuable,\u201d said Fawzy. \u201cRather, the most valuable things I learned came from my mentors at York University, outside the classroom. My time interacting and working with Drs. Mazen Hamadeh (Head of Stong College), Jennine Rawana (Head of Calumet College), and Tara Haas (Kinesiology Professor) as well as President Lenton when I was a president\u2019s ambassador were the most valuable learning experiences for me at York. I learned a wide range of skills ranging from leadership, communication and networking to culturing cells and working with mice models for research. Truly a rich and diverse learning experience.\u201d\n\nYork, he said, is an \u201coutstanding educational institution,\u201d noting the kinesiology program ranked No. 1 in Canada and 16th in the world in 2017 (ShanghaiRanking). \u201cYork provided me with endless opportunities, from research, to student success programs, to having a say in decisions and providing my ideas/proposals directly to the University president. I am very grateful for those opportunities that allowed me to excel and develop life skills during my time at York.\u201d\n\nAs for earning the award, he says he feels thankful and humble.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an honour to be recognized with the past recipients of this award who have done tremendous things during their time at York. It really motivates me to continue to excel both academically and also with my involvement in student success programs and other extracurriculars.\u201d\n\nFawzy hopes to pursue a career in medicine as a physician scientist."}]}
