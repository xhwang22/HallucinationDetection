He was 76.He was born Ronald William George Barker in Bedford, England on September 25, 1929 and raised in Oxford. Educated at the City of Oxford High School, he took a job as a clerk at Westminster Bank, all the while harboring dreams of becoming an actor.He was offered his first break in 1948 when he joined the Manchester Repertory Company. His roles were small, but for a starry-eyed 19-year-old it could not have been more fascinating. Three years later, he joined the Oxford Playhouse where he gained more experience, particularly in comedy, and in 1955, director Peter Hall gave him his first big opportunity at the famed Arts Theatre in London, where he worked steadily and developed his craft over the next several years.After some success on BBC radio, Barker moved into films. His parts were small, but his comic timing and avuncular mannerism made him memorable in some sharp comedies: the little known Terry Thomas gem(1962); a put-upon customer at a railway station in(1963); his first prominent film role as doleful sad sack in(1964); and a cameo in the pleasant if harmless family outing(1965).Yet his achievements in film paled in comparison to his success on television, which would prove to be Barker's calling card. In 1966, commentator David Frost would hire him (along with Ronnie Corbett and John Cleese) for, a wildly popular revue show that would satirize the popular fads and political situations of the day. From there, he moved ontothe following year which was also hit. Not coincidentally, his good fortune on television led to improved film parts: a dramatic turn in a spy thriller starring veteran character actor Van Heflin(1967); and as a ghost who tries to help young children save a historical landmark in(1968).Still, his success up to this point was marginal when compared to the golden stride he hit in the '70s. He starred in no less than three hit series that decade: the popular sketch comedy opposite Ronnie Corbett in(1971-1987); the endearing prison sitcom(1973-1977); and as a frugal Northern shopkeeper with a penchant for stammering in(1973-1985). All three of these programs had developed a huge cult following in America over the years due to their screening on public television, and it's safe to say that Barker was, if not an international star, a very welcome talent and presence to million of fans worldwide.This decade would also contain his most lauded film performance - that of Friar Tuck in Richard Lester's(1976), co-starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn. Barker offered a cheeky take on this established character with just the right touch of pathos, making him an essential component to this robust adventure film. Oddly, despite his good critical notices, he made only one more film that decade, a full theatrical feature based on his television series,(1979).Barker was still a popular fixture in British entertainment when he semi-retired in 1987. He spent most of his time operating an antique shop in the Oxfordshire village of Chipping Norton, but he was always coaxed back for an occasional appearance, the most impressive by far were his two serio-comic turns in(2002), playing the wise manservant to Albert Finney's Winston Churchill; and the HBO special(2003), a moving portrayal as a retired general maintaining his wit and dignity after tragic circumstances opposite Dame Maggie Smith.

(ga)\n\nRonald William George Barker OBE (25 September 1929 \u2013 3 October 2005) was an English actor, comedian and writer. He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as Porridge, The Two Ronnies, and Open All Hours. Barker began acting in Oxford amateur dramatics whilst working as a bank clerk, having dropped out of higher education. He moved into repertory theatre with the Manchester Repertory Company at Aylesbury and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and starred in ITV shows. After rejoining the BBC, Barker achieved significant success with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u201387), with Ronnie Corbett. The duo maintained their careers as solo performers; Barker notably starred as inmate Norman Stanley Fletcher in the sitcom Porridge (1974\u201377) and its sequel Going Straight (1978) and as shopkeeper Arkwright in Open All Hours (1976\u201385). He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including \"Gerald Wiley\") to avoid pre-judgments of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and received an OBE in 1978. Later television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.

What luck that the star of that show, David Frost, put me under contract, that resulted in Porridge and Open All Hours, and who paired me with the wonderful Ronnie Corbett. What luck to have had a wife for forty-five years, who throughout my television career, sat in the audience of every show and laughed louder than anyone else.

He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as Porridge, The Two Ronnies, and Open All Hours.\n\nBarker began acting in repertory theatre and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and starred in ITV shows including a short film.\n\nAfter rejoining the BBC, Barker found fame with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u20131987), with Ronnie Corbett. He starred in the sitcoms Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and Open All Hours. He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including \"Gerald Wiley\") to avoid pre-judgments of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and received an OBE in 1978.\n\nLater television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.\n\nEarly life\n\nBarker was born on 25 September 1929 in Bedford, Bedfordshire, the only son of Leonard (known as \"Tim\") and Edith (known as \"Cis\") Barker Barker's elder sister Vera was born in 1926 and his younger sister Eileen was born in 1933.His father was a clerk for Shell-Mex, and this job saw the family move to Church Cowley Road in Cowley, Oxfordshire when Barker was four. Barker's biographer Bob McCabe described his childhood as \"a happy time, marred by no ructions or family tensions, apart from the occasional wet sock.\" As a child, Barker enjoyed dressing up, particularly in his father's pierrot outfit, as well as films, comics, and animals. He developed a love of the theatre, often attending plays with his family. The first play he saw was Cottage to Let and he once skipped school to see Laurence Olivier in Henry V. He frequently stood outside stage doors to collect autographs, his first being the actress Celia Johnson.\n\nBarker grew up in the Florence Park area of Oxford, and went to Donnington Junior School, and then the City of Oxford High School for Boys. Barker's chemistry textbook at Oxford was previously used by T. E. Lawrence. He found his talent for humour at school and developed his musical ability by singing in the choir at St James's, his local church. He got into the sixth form a year early after gaining the School Certificate[12] but he felt what he was learning would be of no use to him in later life and so left as soon as he could. After leaving school he trained as an architect but gave it up after six months, feeling he was not skilled enough. Barker took his sister Vera's job as a bank clerk at the Westminster Bank after she had left to become a nurse. He harboured dreams of becoming an actor, and took up amateur dramatics, although initially he just saw the pastime as a chance to meet girls. For 18 months, while at the bank, he worked as an actor and stage manager, making his first appearance in A Murder Has Been Arranged as the musical director of the play-within-a-play. Eventually he gave up his job to become a professional actor. His father did not support his acting ambition.\n\nCareer\n\nTheatrical career\n\nBarker failed to get into the Young Vic School, but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was employed as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning \u00a32.10s.0d (\u00a32.50) a week. He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J.M. Barrie's Quality Street.He went on to play the organist in When We Are Married and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in Miranda, Barker realised he wanted to be a comic actor. He was described as \"ha[ving] the talent to be a great straight actor\", but noted: \"I want to make people laugh. Never mind about Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charley's Aunt. My mission in life was now crystal clear.\" He appeared in stage adaptations of Treasure Island and Red Riding Hood before getting his first leading role in The Guinea Pig as a working class boy at a public school.[14] When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after. Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of \"Charlie\" so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance. He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players. There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he \"ever learned about comedy.\"\n\nHe joined the Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked there for three years, appearing in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 1955.[2][5] By the time he had made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays. Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening. Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce for two years from 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Night's Dream as Quince.\n\nEarly media career\n\nBarker's theatrical success enabled him to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name \"Ronald\", was now referred to as the less formal form \"Ronnie\", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggit's. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the lookout Able Seaman 'Fatso' Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton, in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes. He also featured in the show's radio spin-off The TV Lark as Fatso Johnson, a camera operator, and as a trainee chef in Crowther's Crowd in 1963, and had roles on Variety Playhouse. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn's show I'm Not Bothered. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch).[22] This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint and The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover. In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpson's gentle comedy, The Bargee, as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbett's rascally Hemmel Pike. Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).\n\nIn 1966, Barker got his break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report, having been recommended for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, while many of the other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on.[25] Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The Frost Report's best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.\n\nAfter the first series, the special Frost Over England was produced, winning the Golden Rose at the Montreux Television Festival. With a second series of the show announced, Frost, recognising their potential, signed both Barker and Corbett up to his production company David Paradine Productions. As part of the deal Barker was given his own show in 1968, The Ronnie Barker Playhouse, which comprised six separate, thirty-minute plays. Barker starred in each piece as a different character. After two series of The Frost Report on the BBC, totalling 26 half-hour episodes, Frost moved to ITV after helping to set up London Weekend Television. There, Frost hosted Frost on Sunday, with Barker and Corbett following and again performing sketches on the programme. Barker began writing sketches for the programme under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. Barker and Corbett had a greater role on the show than on The Frost Report and Corbett felt \"more aware of what [they] were doing.\"\n\nBarker began using the pseudonym Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces to be accepted on merit and not just because he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, and they were very well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett \"Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there\", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, \"I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?\" One of the first sketches he wrote was called \"Doctor's Waiting Room\", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for \u00a33,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and No\u00ebl Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.\n\nIn 1969 Barker was able to write, produce and star as General Futtock in the film Futtocks End which featured no dialogue and only \"grumble[s] and grunt[s]\". The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode \"Ah, There You Are\" by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen. The character returned for the 1969\u20131970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker. Despite Barker's success on ITV, LWT's programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frost's company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.\n\nMove to the BBC and The Two Ronnies\n\nSoon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson performed a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two also had to keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who were sitting in the audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he \"must have offered them too much money.\"Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work in the same way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.\n\nTheir show together was The Two Ronnies, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success. The show, as described by Anthony Hayward of The Independent, was \"a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries.\"[5] The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbett's monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two in the style of newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase \"It's good night from me \u2013 and it's good night from him.\" This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the show's run. The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker \"was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience.\" Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act. Filming took place over four months of each year. After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.\n\nBarker wrote much of the show's material, roughly three-quarters, again under the name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily involved with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a \"perfectionist\" and \"as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look.\"After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look through all of the potential material for the studio recording of the rest of the show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting \"People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage \u2013 wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune.\" They took turns to play the parts which had the \"good lines\". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: \"You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers.\"\n\nBarker's material included the sketch which came to be known as \"Four Candles\", airing in 1976, although in the original script it was entitled \"Annie Finkhouse\". It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of things in a hardware store. The sketch's humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between \"four candles\" and \"fork handles\". The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes, Hillingdon who wrote in to The Two Ronnies to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store. Barker was never happy with the sketch's final line (a male assistant asking \"What sort of billhooks did you want?\") and changed it (to a female assistant asking \"What sort of knockers were you looking for?\") for the stage version of The Two Ronnies, although he was still not totally satisfied with it. Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the show's most famous one and was voted as the show's best in a TV special, while also placing fifth on Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches. The original script, hand-written by Barker, was sold for \u00a348,500 at auction in 2007 after being featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow the previous year.\n\nThe show was considered a \"national institution\" with audiences of between 15 and 20 million regularly tuning in to its 93 episodes. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1971 and 1977 for the show. The Two Ronnies ended with the 1987 Christmas special. In 1978 the two performed a stage version of the show at the London Palladium; lasting for three months, it followed the same format as the show, with old sketches and some new material, supported by variety acts. Barker's unease with appearing as himself in the stage show led him to create a fictionalised version of himself to play instead. A second stage series took place in 1983.[53] Barker was reportedly offended by a sketch called 'The Two Ninnies' on the BBC's Not the Nine O'Clock News, which mocked their act as being based on dated innuendo-based humour.\n\nAfter a tip-off from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Barker and Corbett opted to move with their families to Sydney, Australia in 1979 for the year to exploit a tax loophole and avoid paying the year's income tax. They performed their stage show for four weeks in Sydney and a further four in Melbourne; because of their existing popularity in Australia and, what Corbett terms, the Australian audiences' \"[comedic] soul that still related to the UK,\" they made no changes to the routine. Barker made no other appearances that year and spent his time writing and engaging in recreational activities.[58] Following the show's success, Kerry Packer commissioned a six episode TV series of The Two Ronnies in Australia for Nine Network. The show comprised material not yet shown in Australia from The Two Ronnies and new content targeted more towards an Australian audience.They returned for a second series in 1986.\n\nBarker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent, films The Picnic (1975) and By the Sea (1982). By the Sea was Barker's tribute to the seaside postcard humour of Donald McGill and his most \"personal\" work. The show was also widely syndicated in North America by PBS and CBC, and in 1980 they appeared in the short-lived NBC variety show The Big Show; the two were glad the show did not last as they objected to the use of canned laughter by the American networks.\n\nPorridge, Open All Hours and other work\n\nFollowing the success of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide what he wanted to do.[2] The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, allowing time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each.[63] Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973's Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge, airing from 1974\u20131977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show \"was about what it took to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane.\" The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge's voice was performed by Barker. The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as \"a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what remains one of the most classic British sitcoms ever produced.\" The Times called Fletcher his \"finest creation\". Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.\n\nIn 1976, Barker played Friar Tuck in the film Robin and Marian, directed by Richard Lester. The same year, determined not to be remembered only as Fletcher, Barker opted to end Porridge after two series and instead focused on the second pilot Open All Hours, alongside David Jason. Barker starred as Arkwright, a money-grabbing, stuttering shopkeeper. Arkwright's stutter was not in the script; Barker was inspired to use it by Melvyn's performance and use of a stutter in a 1955 play the two performed at the Palace Theatre called Hot Water. Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two but was not renewed due to low ratings. As a result, Barker backtracked on his earlier decision and produced a third series of Porridge, as well as a film adaptation. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom Going Straight which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison. While not as popular as Porridge, Barker again won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance. Plans to further the show were ended when Barker's co-star Richard Beckinsale died of a heart attack in 1979 aged 31. With repeats of Open All Hours earning high ratings on BBC One, the BBC commissioned a further series of the show in 1981, with another two made as well as the show continued its ratings success.[2][5] Both shows placed in the top ten of the 2004 poll to determine Britain's Best Sitcom; Porridge finished seventh and\n\nOpen All Hours eighth.\n\nBarker's next sitcom, The Magnificent Evans, which was about a Welsh photographer and aired in 1984, was not successful. His final sitcom, Clarence in which he played Clarence Sale, a removal man with failing sight, aired in 1988. Barker wrote the show himself, again using a pseudonym, this time as \"Bob Ferris\".\n\nRetirement and re-appearances\n\n\"I had completely run out of ideas and it scared and panicked me. I was always able to write scripts but, you know, I couldn't think of a single thing to write about. It was a very weird sensation. I had seen friends of mine start burning out. No one wants to see a 70-year-old on television who can't remember his lines. And also I had lost interest\"\n\n\u2014Barker on his decision to retire\n\nIn 1987, before Clarence aired and after rejecting Hall's offer of the part of Falstaff in a Royal National Theatre production of Henry IV, Part 1 & 2,Barker retired from show business, aged 58, \"at the height of his fame\", citing a decline in his own writing quality, lack of ambition and ideas, and a desire to go out on top so as not to damage his legacy, as well as concerns about the state of his heart. He had decided to retire in 1985 but his decision was kept secret for two years, Corbett being the only one knowing about it. He made his decision public on an appearance on the chat show Wogan. Retired, Barker opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire and resisted all calls to come out of retirement from then onwards. He joked: \"I lose money every week, but it's a hobby. It's cheaper than skiing and safer at my age.\" Because of its unprofitability, the shop was sold after ten years. He wrote his autobiography, Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and released All I Ever Wrote, his complete scripts, in 1999. He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, which was performed at The King's Head Theatre, but garnered a negative response, with Barker stating it got \"the worst notices of any play in the history of the theatre.\"\n\nJust over a decade after retiring, Barker was persuaded to make occasional appearances on television again. In 1997 he appeared with Corbett at the Royal Command Performance, driving on stage in a motorcycle as the Two Fat Ladies, and in 1999 he was reunited with Corbett for Two Ronnies Night on BBC One, and the following year for A Tribute to the Two Ronnies.[5] In 2002, director Richard Loncraine persuaded Barker to appear as Winston Churchill's butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama The Gathering Storm and then cast him in the larger role of the General in the TV film My House in Umbria in 2003, alongside Maggie Smith (whom he had, early in their careers, advised to give up acting as he felt she would not be a success). In the same year, he briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box. Barker received several lifetime achievement awards. He won the Royal Television Society's award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975. Sir Alec Guinness presented him with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards in 1990, while he received another such honour at the BBC Centenary Programme in 1996. In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, a televised celebratory tribute evening. In 2005, he and Corbett were part of the first 100 people given stars on London's Avenue of Stars. Previous awards included the Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981. Following the success of Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, Barker wanted to return The Two Ronnies to television and the BBC commissioned The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, a clip show of their best sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were recorded in one day due to Barker's declining health and aired in 2005. The project, when announced, met with \"some derision among the professional critics\", but after the first episode drew eight million viewers, they had to \"eat their words\". The final special, and Barker's final appearance on television \u2013 The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook \u2013 was recorded in July 2005 as a result of Barker's failing health and aired posthumously in December.\n\nActing and writing style\n\n\"I'll tell you who my favourite performer is. Ronnie Barker. Surprised? You shouldn't be. He's really great.\"\n\nSir Alec Guinness\n\nBarker became a comic actor in his theatre days, noting \"I think it's better to make people laugh than cry.\" He has been described by The Times as \"not a comedian, [but] an actor with a talent for comedy,\" who \"slipped into characters with apparent ease.\" Barker felt he was funny only in character. The BBC wrote of him: \"Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself 'completely boring' without a script.\" Peter Hall spoke of Barker's skills as a dramatic actor, calling him \"the great actor we lost\" and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions. Barker, though, preferred comedy, and felt it was \"as good and as important as serious work\" and he was not \"dumbing down\" by doing it. Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying \"no matter how farcical [his performance] was ... there was always an element of reality to what he did.\" Corbett praised Barker's skill at playing serious authority figures saying absurd things, using Barker's verbal dexterity and energetic performances.\n\nBarker's writing style was, for The Times, \"based on precise scripts and perfect timing.\" It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres.[2] Dennis Baker of The Guardian wrote that Barker \"preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy.\" Corbett said he had \"a mastery of the English language\".\n\nIn private, he annotated a copy of A Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear, penning punch lines of his own for each limerick. On the title page he wrote, \"There was an old fossil named Lear, Whose verses were boring and drear. His last lines were worst \u2013 just the same as the first! So I've tried to improve on them here.\" The annotated copy of Lear's book, signed and dated November 2001, was auctioned in 2012.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBarker met Joy Tubb in Cambridge while she was a stage manager for two plays he was in. They married nine months later in July 1957 and had three children: two sons, Larry (born 1959) and Adam (born 1968), who became an actor, and one daughter, Charlotte (born 1962), who became an actress. Larry was named after Barker's idol Laurence Olivier.The family lived in Pinner for many years, and subsequently in a converted mill in Dean, Oxfordshire. According to Corbett, Barker was \"first and foremost a family man\". Joy died in January 2011, aged 78.\n\nBarker received an OBE in 1978. He was an avid collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards.[88] He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, \"I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have to be someone else to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose.\"\n\nBarker was a heavy smoker until 1972, when he gave up the habit after having a pre-cancerous growth removed from his throat; he took to drinking wine and using placebo cigarettes to maintain his concentration and help him sleep.He underwent a heart bypass in 1996 and survived a pulmonary embolism the following year.\n\nDeath\n\nBarker opted not to have heart valve replacement surgery, and his health rapidly declined after the recording of The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook. He died of heart failure at the Katherine House hospice in Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on 3 October 2005, aged 76, with his wife by his side. News of his death made top billing on television news bulletins, and The Sun ran a front page with just the headline \"It's Goodnight From Him\" and an image of Barker's glasses.\n\nBarker was cremated at a private humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was attended only by family and close friends.[68][97] A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read at the service, while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French and June Whitfield. A recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon from The Two Ronnies was played, and while the cross was in procession in the aisle of the abbey, it was accompanied by four candles instead of the usual two, in reference to the Four Candles sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe sign of the Four Candles, a Wetherspoons pub in Oxford named after Barker's comedy sketch.\n\nFollowing his death, the Writer of the Year Award at the British Comedy Awards was renamed in his honour. In 2005 he was voted as the 16th greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders in a poll to find The Comedian's Comedian.\n\nThe BBC described him as \"one of the leading figures of British television comedy\", and \"much loved and admired\". The Independent called him \"a master of television sitcom\". The Guardian said he was \"much loved ... both as an actor and a writer he was recognised as a master of pyrotechnic puns, surreal behaviour in public and private places, and crackling cross-chat\". It concluded that \"it says much about the decline of the British television industry that Ronnie Barker, one of its most creative comic talents, should have turned his back on it long before he died at the age of 76\". In a eulogy for Barker, the Reverend Robert Wright stated that he was \"undoubtedly one of the very greatest television comedy actors\" and that \"as a performer he made comedy look effortlessly funny\".\n\nIn 2006 Barker's stage play Mum was adapted and directed by Neil Cargill for BBC Radio 4, and broadcast as an Afternoon Play, starring Maxine Peake and Sam Kelly.\n\nIn Barker's home town of Oxford, a Wetherspoons pub on George Street is named after his Four Candles sketch. A bronze statue of Barker sculpted by Martin Jennings, and showing him in character as Norman Stanley Fletcher, was unveiled at the entrance of the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre in September 2010 by his widow Joy, David Jason, and Ronnie Corbett.\n\nIn 2015, the Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture (also referred to as The Ronnie Barker Talk) was commissioned by the BBC at the instigation of the head of comedy commissioning, Shane Allen. The first lecture was given in August 2017 by Ben Elton.[106] Elton's lecture focused on the future of the British sitcom.\n\nFilmography\n\n\"I have to tell you that all through my fifty years in the business, two words have always been in my thoughts \u2013 these two words are 'What luck'. What luck to have met, in the far-off days of weekly rep, a marvellous comedian called Glenn Melvyn, who gave me my first TV job and taught me how to stutter. What luck to have been in Oxford rep when a young Peter Hall arrived as director and brought me to London's West End. What luck that James Gilbert saw me do a radio show and put me in The Frost Report. What luck that the star of that show, David Frost, put me under contract, that resulted in Porridge and Open All Hours, and who paired me with the wonderful Ronnie Corbett. What luck to have had a wife for forty-five years, who throughout my television career, sat in the audience of every show and laughed louder than anyone else. And finally, standing here before you, with this most honoured award bestowed upon me by you, what luck, what wonderful luck, to be flanked on either side by my two best friends, Ronnie Corbett and David Jason. And I might cry, Gwyneth Paltrow, watch out.\"\n\n\u2014Excerpt from Barker's speech at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute Corbett says the speech was \"the first time there truly was no mask. Ronnie Barker spoke as himself, truthfully, simply and from the heart.\"\n\nFilms\n\nYear Film Role Notes\n\n1958 Wonderful Things!

Barker got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966 where he met future collaborator Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and was to star in a number ITV shows including a short film during this period.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was after rejoining the BBC that he found fame with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u20141986) with Ronnie Corbett. After the series of pilots called Seven of One, he gained starring roles in the sitcoms Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and Open All Hours. Apart from being a performer, he was noted as a comedy writer both under his own name and the pseudonym Gerald Wiley, which Barker adopted to avoid pre-judgements of his talent. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times, amongst other awards, and received an OBE in 1978.\n\n\n\nLater television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he decided to retire in 1987. After his retirement, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1997, he appeared in a number of smaller, non-comic roles in films.\n\n\n\nBarker's writing style was \"based on precise scripts and perfect timing.\" It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres. He \"preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy.\" He \"never liked sex or obscenity on television, but there was no shortage of frisky gags in The Two Ronnies\". Corbett said he had \"a mastery of the English language\"."}], "The Frost Report also featured John Cleese, Ronnie Corbett, and other future stars of British comedy.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/march/the-frost-report", "page_content": "Image: David Frost squares up to Ronnie Barker in a promotional shot for the special 'Frost Over England' in March 1967.\n\nThe satirical comedy show The Frost Report made its first appearance on 10 March 1966. Each week David Frost took a different subject and examined it with the help of illustrative sketches. The supporting cast for the first episode was Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, John Cleese, Nicky Henson and Nicholas Smith. In addition Julie Felix and Tom Lehrer provided music. Barker was already well known but it was Cleese, Corbett and Henson's first break on television.\n\nThe theme of the first week was Authority. Subsequent weeks looked at Holidays, Sin and Elections. The fifth week - on Class - featured the series' most enduring sketch, with Cleese, Barker and Corbett cast as upper, middle and lower class. It was written by Marty Feldman and John Law. Other writers on The Frost Report included future Pythons Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, alongside Tim Brooke-Taylor and established names such as Frank Muir and Denis Norden.\n\nThe Frost Report helped establish satire as a staple of television comedy, inspiring programmes such as Not the Nine O'clock News. The on screen and backstage talent involved with making the show went on to contribute to the some of the most loved programmes on television. Frost himself continued his ascent and became known for his with searching political interviews. He was knighted in 1993 and died in 2013."}, {"url": "https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/frost_report/features/beyond-the-class-sketch/", "page_content": "Beyond the class sketch The Frost Report. Image shows left to right: David Frost, Julie Felix, Sheila Steafel, Ronnie Barker, John Cleese, Ronnie Corbett. Credit: BBC\n\nWe all know the famous sketch. A suave, young John Cleese in a bowler hat looks down on Ronnie Barker, asserting 'I look down on him, because I am upper class.' Barker in turn looks to him: 'I look up to him, because he is upper class, but I look down on him' - he turns to look down at a young Ronnie Corbett - 'because he is lower class. I am middle class,' he announces as he looks directly to camera. Corbett, comically dressed as an urchin, does the same, as he declares 'I know my place.'\n\nMost could identify this as the oft-repeated class sketch from The Frost Report. However, a simple question often lingers: what exactly was The Frost Report? For a series that played a pivotal role in creating legends and shaping the comedy landscape of the next few decades, very little outside of this iconic sketch has been in the public domain since its initial broadcast, which only enjoyed a relatively short run from 1966 - 67.\n\nThe title, The Frost Report, refers to David Frost: a journalist, writer, producer and comedian who became known the world over for his series of interviews with disgraced US President Richard Nixon in 1977, colloquially referred to as simply Frost/Nixon. These sensational interviews (which Frost funded himself, as American television networks were not interested in supporting them) delved into the Watergate Scandal, Nixon's personal life and the legality of his actions. Frost probed Nixon in a way no other journalist would have dared, with the resulting programmes attracting 45 million American viewers - still a world record for the most viewers of a political interview in history - and have been the subject of many plays and films since.\n\nDavid Frost\n\nMichael Grade said of Frost, who died in 2013: \"He was kind of a television renaissance man. He could put his hand to anything. He could turn over Richard Nixon, or he could win the comedy prize at the Montreux Golden Rose festival.\"\n\nNow predominantly remembered as a legendary journalist rather than for his significant contributions to entertainment and comedy, television was, predictably, where Frost started out. After university he found work at Associated-Rediffusion (the ITV broadcaster of the day in London), and was chosen to host a brand new satirical comedy. The year was 1962, and the BBC had just commissioned a pilot inspired by the sketches that were being performed at Peter Cook's The Establishment - a club based in Soho where satire was the order of the day and stars such as Eleanor Bron, John Bird, and John Fortune regularly performed.\n\nThe fact that this idea was reworked into a vehicle for David Frost was something that Cook reportedly resented, thus beginning a rivalry between the pair: at one time Cook dubbed Frost 'the bubonic plagiarist', so jealous was he of the success of the resulting show, That Was The Week That Was (regularly shortened to TW3) - a series that would change the television landscape forever, bringing satire to mainstream audiences.\n\nFrost's involvement came about thanks to John Bird (Frost's flatmate and Cambridge University alumnus, who would later find the height of his own fame in satirical sketch show Bremner, Bird And Fortune). He had persuaded the show's creator, writer and producer Ned Sherrin, to see David Frost performing live, after which he was duly signed up.\n\nThat Was The Week That Was. Image shows from L to R: David Frost, Roy Kinnear, Kenneth Cope, Lance Percival, William Rushton. Copyright: BBC That Was The Week That Was. Image shows from L to R: David Frost, Roy Kinnear, Kenneth Cope, Lance Percival, William Rushton. Copyright: BBC\n\nThat Was The Week That Was broke new ground and is still the blueprint for almost every satirical variety series. It was dry and intelligent, making no attempt to pander to its audience. It took breaks for debates, while surrounding serious moments with sketches and songs - It was not afraid to be silly, it was not afraid to be serious. Sometimes the audience seemed genuinely unsure of how to react, the humour was so understated.\n\nOne sketch in the first episode sees Frost interview a supposed cartoonist about his life:\n\n'You have an amusing time, but not much time for leisure?' Frost asks earnestly.\n\n'Well, what leisure time I do get I spend dreaming about living on a very small desert island with only one palm tree,' he tells Frost seriously, while he draws this for us and nods.\n\nThe audience are simply unsure what to think or how to respond. It feels like the origins of the bizarre, irreverent satire of Chris Morris's The Day Today (1994).\n\nThe writing and performing talent were of the highest calibre. Over the course of its two series, sketches were penned by Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl and Eric Sykes amongst many others. And it was this eclectic mix that brought in humour from across the spectrum of comedy, politics and society. The show was a hit, featuring beloved performers of the day, such as Hattie Jacques and Roy Kinnear, in sketches that underpinned each episode.\n\nEven Peter Cook (who later started writing for the series) put aside his feud with Frost, after a dramatic turn of events saw him step in to save David Frost from drowning in a swimming pool. Alan Bennett joked at the 1995 memorial service for Cook that rescuing Frost was the one regret he frequently expressed.\n\nThat Was The Week That Was. Image shows left to right: Lance Percival, Millicent Martin, Al Mancini That Was The Week That Was. Image shows left to right: Lance Percival, Millicent Martin, Al Mancini\n\nDespite overwhelming positivity in its reception amongst both audiences and critics, the BBC did receive complaints about TW3. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had initially been supportive of the show, but it soon became a bone of contention amongst MPs; but after American President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the episode being recorded and broadcast the very next day changed its tone entirely and became a tribute, exhibiting the programme's power and ingenuity.\n\nThe show was effectively axed in 1964, with the BBC offering the simple explanation that it was a General Election year. No more was said about the series returning. Frost took the format to America, where TW3 ran for one series and a special, That Was The Year That Was, a comedic recap of the last twelve months.\n\nFrost's next project was another series produced by Ned Sherrin, Not So Much A Programme More A Way Of Life - one of the longest programme titles in television, it was at least shortened to the much more catchy NSMAPMAWOL (pronounced Ens-map-may-wall).\n\nEns-map-may-wall saw Frost and Sherrin attempt to build on the success of TW3. Frost co-presented the show with Willie Rushton and the poet P. J. Kavanagh. It was also notable for some of the first major television appearances of John Bird, Eleanor Bron, Roy Hudd, and John Fortune, and featured Michael Crawford in a regular spot as 'Byron'. It was popular and ran for a stonking 62 episodes in 1964 and 65, but once again proved too much of a hot potato for the BBC - one sketch provoking particular ire for being disrespectful to the Royal Family - and did not return after that (admittedly very lengthy) single series. However, Frost was undeterred and he returned just a year later with another format: The Frost Report.\n\nThe Frost Report. Image shows left to right: Nicholas Smith, Julie Felix, Tom Lehrer, Ronnie Barker, John Cleese, Ronnie Corbett, Nicky Henson, David Frost. Credit: BBC\n\nThe Frost Report took an approach to satire that was far less directly political - an ingenious way to swerve controversy. Frost did not focus on Parliamentary matters or ministers: this wasn't about simply giving the government of the day, or indeed the opposition, a good kicking. This was Frost taking a more abstract and timeless approach to satire, with each episode focused on and themed around a specific topic. As such, the series took a sideways look at concepts that are the fundamental building blocks of society - such as law, money, love, education and sin - and analysed them in a non-partisan way.\n\nIn the pilot, he and his team explored authority: 'Authority tries to protect its position by the language it uses,' Frost tells us in a piece to camera. 'It never means what it says: \"the matter is under consideration\" means \"we have lost the file\"; \"the matter is under active consideration\" means \"we are trying to find the file\". It's the same with all other statements.'\n\nWe then see observe a series of cutaways between the Two Ronnies and John Cleese delivering statements, and back to Frost who tells us what they really mean:\n\nBarker: It is not in the public interest to do this.\n\nFrost: Means, it is in the public interest to do this, but not in ours.\n\nCorbett: Public feeling is not yet ready for such a step.\n\nFrost: Means, public feeling is ready for such a step, but we're frightened of The Daily Express.\n\nBarker: This is an urgent problem, and we are therefore setting up a Royal Commission.\n\nFrost: Means, that we hope in three years time, everyone will have forgotten about it.\n\nCleese: In the fullness of time ...\n\nFrost: Means, never.\n\nCleese: In the not-too-distant future.\n\nFrost: Never.\n\nCleese: Never.\n\nFrost: As soon as we dare.\n\nBy any decade's standards it was a fantastic start. Frost's monologues were honest and straightforward: they certainly seemed to be his genuine musings on the subject at hand. He and the writers, headed by Antony Jay (future co-creator Yes Minister) clearly felt no need to moderate the show's satirical points for the BBC now that it steered clear of the directly political. The sketches, which were often no more than a few seconds long, benefited hugely from the talents of Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett and John Cleese, three people who would become legends of the sketch genre in the years that followed, and with hindsight it's clear that some sketches stray directly into the territory of Python or The Two Ronnies. One sketch sees Corbett and Barker as policemen:\n\n'Good morning, Super!' Barker says as he ambles up to Corbett. 'Good morning, wonderful,' he replies.\n\nA quick cut back to Frost catches him laughing at this, 'They won't tell me what that means,' he laughs, perhaps sensing the start of something between the pair. This, right here, was the origin of their double act.\n\nThe Frost Report. Image shows left to right: John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett The Frost Report. Image shows left to right: John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett\n\nThe famous class sketch appeared in the fifth episode of the series, which was, somewhat unsurprisingly, titled The Frost Report On Class.\n\n'What is class?' Frost asks us. 'Class is the ladder in the social stocking,' he says. 'It's having grapes on the sideboard, even though there's nobody ill,' he muses; and throughout the episode, Frost makes the point that the class system always seems to be with us, whether we like it or not.\n\nBut the question remains, why is the class sketch the sketch we always see? What made it so important? Oddly, there's nothing in particular that causes it to leap out at you in the context of the episode. Frost introduces it quite simply, segueing from another point he says, 'But how do the classes see each other?'\n\nAnd the sketch itself does not stand out more broadly, as it is indicative of The Frost Report's style. All the sketches of the series were direct, to the point, and, if we're honest, accurate in their speedy analysis of society - not just then, but interestingly, now. They are as incisive and precise as a surgeon's scalpel. Never the less, somehow this one has proven emblematic. Written by Marty Feldman and John Law, the sketch was cited by The British Film Institute as being of cultural importance. They commented:\n\n'Its twinning of height and social position, combined with a minimal script, created a classic TV moment. The sketch's influence has persisted to the present day, having been referred to in 21st-century discussions of politics, sociology, and even football.'\n\nNow often cut short, the full sketch ends with Ronnie Barker declaring:\n\n'We all know our place, but what do we get out of it?'\n\n'I get a feeling of superiority over them,' Cleese explains, looking down over the two Ronnies.\n\n'I get a feeling of inferiority from him,' says Barker, as he looks up to Cleese, 'But a feeling of superiority over him,' he gestures down to Corbett.\n\nRonnie C then delivers the punchline: 'I get a pain in the back of my neck.'\n\nRonnie Barker was such a fan of the sketch that he wrote three follow-ups in the same style for later Frost Report episodes. He and Corbett would perform it again in 2000, this time with Stephen Fry in place of Cleese, as they satirised three periods in history (present day, the Renaissance and the Middle Ages). John Cleese also paid homage in 2017, this time Americanising the subject.\n\nAnd that is the enduring legacy of the sketch, putting the class system in such bold terms highlighted both the ridiculousness and the ultimate inevitability of it, whatever the decade, be it the sixties, the dawn of the new millennium or even now.\n\nIt seems every comedian, sketch show or sitcom needs its defining 'moment'. Python had the dead parrot sketch, The Two Ronnies had their four candles, Mitchell & Webb wondered if the Nazis ever asked 'Are we the baddies?', Father Ted gave us a lecture on cows we will never forget, Pike's name went on the list, Del Boy fell through the bar, David Brent performed a little dance, Eric Morecambe played all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order, the cast of Goodness Gracious Me went out for an 'English' and Hancock gave blood.\n\nDavid Frost pictured in profile with a number of cameras and their operators in the background, on set. David Frost. Credit: BBC\n\nFrost, himself, had little to do with the class sketch, yet he hardly seemed to mind. His illustrious career continued apace and he consolidated his role as an interviewer shortly after The Frost Report's end. This heralded his drift away from the comedy world, as he became more and more successful as a serious journalist.\n\nIn his lifetime, David Frost would interview eight British Prime Ministers (Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron) and seven US Presidents (Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush). In between all this, he found time to present Through The Keyhole, which ran on various channels between 1987 and 2008. The series was revived in 2013, where Frost was replaced as host, perhaps somewhat oddly, by Keith Lemon.\n\nIt's clear to see what an enormous affect The Frost Report had on modern satirical comedy shows. From Brass Eye to Newswipe With Charlie Brooker, from 10 O'Clock Live to The Mash Report, from Spitting Image to Dead Ringers, all have taken their cue, to a greater or lesser extent, from Frost. He had shown, with great skill, how to tackle tricky topics and find the humour in them. Taking a tricky subject and robbing it of its sting with daftness - that, in essence, was the enduring power of the iconic class sketch, and of The Frost Report."}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1cc4b4ec-f758-11e5-803c-d27c7117d132", "page_content": "What is included in my trial?\n\nDuring your trial you will have complete digital access to FT.com with everything in both of our Standard Digital and Premium Digital packages.\n\nStandard Digital includes access to a wealth of global news, analysis and expert opinion.

Today we look at one of David Frost\u2019s many comedy shows he made for the BBC. Airing on April 7, 1966, \u201cThe Frost Report on Class\u201d featured, among many other things, a frank discussion of Britain\u2019s class system, as well as a sketch featuring television newcomers John Cleese, Ronnie Corbet, and Ronnie Barker that has been named by Channel 4 as one of the 50 Best British sketches of all time.\n\nIn the early 1960s, after the success of Beyond the Fringe, there came to England a satire boom. David Frost placed himself at the forefront of this boom as the host of the program That Was the Week That Was. Each episode featured sketches, monologue jokes, and musical numbers that skewered the leaders and events of the day. The show proved immensely popular and controversial, resulting in its cancellation after just two seasons, and a move to America.\n\nFrost as a figure also became rather divisive during this time. Peter Cook accused Frost of plagiarizing him. (At Cook\u2019s memorial service in 1995, Alan Bennett recalled that Frost frequently said that the time in Los Angeles when Cook pulled a drowning Frost out of a swimming pool was one of his only regrets.) Eric Idle, a writer for The Frost Report, lampooned him on both Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus (as interviewer \u201cTimmy Williams\u201d) and when hosting Saturday Night Live as a self-obsessed, self-promotional interviewer who had little interest in his guests.\n\nThe Frost Report began in England in March of 1966 as TW3 ended in America. The class episode that we\u2019ll be looking at today was the fifth episode of the first series, and features a remarkable collection of writers and performers. The cast featured the aforementioned Cleese, Barker and Corbett, as well as Nicky Henson and Sheila Steafel and a pair of special guests we\u2019ll get to in a bit. In the writer\u2019s room you had, among others, Frost, Cleese, the incomparable Marty Feldman, Barry Cryer, Dick Vosburgh, and future Pythons Terry Jones and Graham Chapman (Idle and Palin would join later in the show\u2019s run).\n\nThe show begins with Frost behind the desk as he gives a brief introduction to the world of class in England. He begins with examples of how the upper class man and the lower class man behave in the world of advertising. The lower class man has an egg for lunch, and the middle class man has a Milky Way bar. \u201cIn all of this class discrimination, the only thing that embraces both sides, is a small circular mint with a hole in the middle.\u201d\n\nThe two things that impressed me most about this show were the pacing of the material and the honesty that was being presented here. The Frost Report is a \u201cmixed media\u201d kind of show: it features taped pieces, monologues, live sketches and musical performances. Within each of those different types of segments, they were all of a varying length, which in my experience, is kind of rare for this time period. As a rule, I would say sketches in the 1940s-1970s run somewhere between \u201ctoo long\u201d and \u201caggressively too long.\u201d The first video sketch in this episode required crew members to lug giant cameras outside, to a location, and rent cavemen costumes for a discussion of early class rivalries in which Caveman 1 hits Caveman 2 over the head with a club. \u201cUgh!\u201d replies the attacked caveman. Caveman 1 speaks in a very posh accent, \u201cNow, now. Surely you mean \u2018Oh-hhhhhh.\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s it. Clearly this pacing had an influence on the Pythons, who would play with the structures of television programs in a variety of ways.\n\nThe best example of the show\u2019s honesty in dealing with the idea of class is through its most famous sketch. \u201cThe Class Sketch\u201d was written by Marty Feldman and John Law, the latter of whom would go on to write the screenplay for the Peter Sellers Casino Royale. In the sketch we see the tall John Cleese, in a bowler cap, as the representative for the upper class, Ronnie Barker, in a good suit as the middle class, and Ronnie Corbett, in a newsboy cap, as the working class. In turn each of them describe their position in society and their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nUpper: I\u2019ve got innate breeding, but I haven\u2019t got any money. So sometimes I look up to him. (he squats down to middle class height)\n\nMiddle: I still look up to him because, although I have money, I am vulgar. But I am not as vulgar as [the working class], so I still look down on him.\n\nWorking: I know my place. I look up to them both. Though I am poor, I am rich, industrious, and trustworthy. I could look down on them both, but I don\u2019t.\n\nA short segment of the sketch is available on YouTube:\n\nHowever, the clip does not include the punchline of the sketch.\n\nMiddle: We all know our place, but what do we get out of it?\n\nUpper: I get a feeling of superiority over them.\n\nMiddle: I get a feeling of inferiority from him. But a feeling of superiority over him.\n\nWorking: (looking up to them, literally) I get a pain in my neck.\n\nIn addition to the Frost commentary and sketches, there are also a pair of musical contributions. Julie Felix sings a folksy, acoustic version of \u201cI\u2019m Sticking with the Union\u201d halfway through the show. Then, later in the program, a frequent performer on the American version of That Was the Week That Was, Tom Lehrer, appears with a song. If you\u2019re not familiar with Tom Lehrer, he was a satirical musical performer with a sharp bite like no other. Due to the fact that he would sing from behind a piano, he tends to get lumped in with the milquetoast Mark Russell, but Lehrer could be very piercing with his satire, and his song on this episode of The Frost Report, entitled \u201cNational Brotherhood Week,\u201d is the perfect example.\n\n\u201cThe Frost Report on Class\u201d doesn\u2019t offer anything in the way of a solution for the issues described here, but it did shine a light on a world that wasn\u2019t often discussed so frankly. While The Frost Report would only last another two years, the impact it had on the world of comedy is incredible. The fact that it brought together the majority of the Pythons (minus Gilliam) is enough of a contribution that it belongs in the comedy history books. In summary:\n\nPizza!

The format parodied a current events show, with David Frost 'reporting' on various allegedly topical issues which would then lead to skits and blackouts. Ironically, this comedy format was actually pioneered in the States back in radio days, with Fred Allen conducting his 'surveys' on Allen's Alley ... then, on early television, Steve Allen (no relation to Fred) doing his 'man in the street' interviews, followed by Jackie Gleason(!) doing his 'American Scene magazine' blackouts.\n\n\n\nI have only a patchy memory of 'The Frost Report', as it was usually transmitted at times that conflicted with my employment ... and there were no VCRs in those days. I recall a very bitter skit performed by John Cleese and Sheila Steafel in which she was meant to be his mother; I noticed that their accents didn't match, and Cleese was nearly two feet taller than Steafel ... which would have been funny if it had been relevant to the skit, but it wasn't.\n\n\n\nI recall much more pleasantly the Christmas special edition, 'Frost Over Christmas', which aired on Boxing Day 1967. The highlight was a sketch in a cocktail party setting, featuring a conversation between 5'2\" Ronnie Corbett -- only slightly taller than Sheila Steafel -- as a very dull little man from 37 Alveston Road, Hendon (one of the most boring neighbourhoods in London) and 6'5\" John Cleese as a man whose life would seem to be one of multi-faceted excitement. No matter what plodding observation Corbett makes, Cleese tops it with an allusion to his James Bond-like exploits ... which Corbett then turns back into an observation on life in Hendon. I'm not describing it well, but those of you who are familiar with the comic timing of Corbett and Cleese will believe me when I say it was well and truly hilarious.

If you are a disadvantaged child, you are 27% less likely to achieve five or more GCSEs at A*-C grades. If you attend a private school, by the time you are 40 you will be earning 35% more than a state school pupil. If you are homeless as an adult, you were almost certainly poor and working class as a child.\n\nClass shapes our world. For many, it constrains their life chances and checks their aspirations. For others, it confers a life of power and privilege.\n\nThe relationship between the Labour party and its working-class constituency has become unstitched\n\nYet class no longer seems to shape our politics. The key divide in politics today, as many have observed, is not class but culture. What\u2019s your view on immigration? Are you patriotic? Does multicultural London still feel British? On such questions, rather than on traditional economic issues, does Britain today seem to cleave.\n\nThe two parties that traditionally gave political expression to the class divide appear lost. The relationship between the Labour party and much of its working-class constituency has become unstitched over the past three decades. Brexit has exacerbated that process. The Tories are suffering a similar fate.\n\nOn Friday, the CBI warned Tory leadership candidates that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. The Tories seem disinclined to listen. \u201cFuck business,\u201d Boris Johnson suggested not so long ago.\n\nThe European elections revealed a polarisation between the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats. Last week, a YouGov poll suggested that in a general election, too, the electorate might divide on similar lines. It\u2019s a single poll that needs to be viewed with scepticism, but it does capture the new zeitgeist. The main political faultline, not just in Britain but throughout Europe, is less about left and right than about those who feel at home in \u2013 or willing to accommodate themselves to \u2013 the new globalised, technocratic world and those who feel left out, dispossessed and voiceless.\n\nWhat happens, though, when political boundaries no longer map on to social or material divisions in society? When class shapes the social world but is no longer represented on the political landscape?\n\nLook more closely at the political faultline and the significance of such questions become clearer. Those who feel disaffected by the new globalised world range from millionaire globetrotters such as John Cleese, who last week bemoaned the fact that \u201cLondon was not really an English city any more\u201d, to south Wales steelworkers whose lives have been turned upside down by global capital. Those much more at ease with the new world range from Sri Lankan cleaners working night shifts in London to Lord Bilimoria, the Indian-born founder of Cobra beer and a leading figure in the Remain campaign.\n\nThe new political cleavage doesn\u2019t reflect the distinction between the 'elite' and the 'masses'. It obscures it\n\nFaced with his sense of disaffection, Cleese can swan off to the Caribbean island of Nevis, where he now lives. South Wales steelworkers are trapped in the insecurities of their lives. Millionaire Bilimoria can prevaricate over cuts to tax credits in the House of Lords. A cleaner may be forced into more than one job to accumulate even the most basic weekly wage.\n\nThe new political cleavage doesn\u2019t, as many suggest, reflect the distinction between the \u201celite\u201d and the \u201cmasses\u201d. It obscures it, helping conceal the fact that the political interests of the cleaner and the steelworker are far more similar than of either to Cleese or Bilimoria. Whether in south Wales or south London, workers suffer from the casualisation of work, the stagnation of wages, the imposition of austerity.\n\nThe cultural divide in politics cannot erase the material reality of working-class lives. But it has transformed the way that many view that reality. On the one side, many have come to see immigration as the cause of their problems and a more nationalistic politics as the solution. On the other, many dismiss working-class voters who backed the Brexit party as bigots.\n\nAgainst this background, many influential voices insist that the class politics is passe and we must accept the new cultural divides.\n\nThere are, though, no cultural solutions to the social problems confronting us. To pretend that there are will only exacerbate popular anger as people\u2019s lives remain untransformed. We need not to deny material reality, but to change the way that people perceive it, challenging both the view of migrants as a social problem and the dismissal of the disenchantment of sections of the working class as mere bigotry. It has never been more important to remind ourselves of the importance of class and of its impact on the lives of millions."}, {"url": "https://www.vulture.com/2015/09/david-frost-john-cleese-and-the-two-ronnies-report-on-class.html", "page_content": "If you are living in America, when I say \u201cDavid Frost,\u201d you\u2019d probably say, \u201cThe 2008 film Frost/Nixon.\u201d And if I were to say \u201cBritish class system\u201d you\u2019d probably say something about \u201cupper class twits\u201d or \u201cchim-in-ey sweeps\u201d or something like that.

Caveman 1 speaks in a very posh accent, \u201cNow, now. Surely you mean \u2018Oh-hhhhhh.\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s it. Clearly this pacing had an influence on the Pythons, who would play with the structures of television programs in a variety of ways.\n\nThe best example of the show\u2019s honesty in dealing with the idea of class is through its most famous sketch. \u201cThe Class Sketch\u201d was written by Marty Feldman and John Law, the latter of whom would go on to write the screenplay for the Peter Sellers Casino Royale. In the sketch we see the tall John Cleese, in a bowler cap, as the representative for the upper class, Ronnie Barker, in a good suit as the middle class, and Ronnie Corbett, in a newsboy cap, as the working class. In turn each of them describe their position in society and their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nUpper: I\u2019ve got innate breeding, but I haven\u2019t got any money. So sometimes I look up to him. (he squats down to middle class height)\n\nMiddle: I still look up to him because, although I have money, I am vulgar. But I am not as vulgar as [the working class], so I still look down on him.\n\nWorking: I know my place. I look up to them both. Though I am poor, I am rich, industrious, and trustworthy. I could look down on them both, but I don\u2019t.\n\nA short segment of the sketch is available on YouTube:\n\nHowever, the clip does not include the punchline of the sketch.\n\nMiddle: We all know our place, but what do we get out of it?\n\nUpper: I get a feeling of superiority over them.\n\nMiddle: I get a feeling of inferiority from him. But a feeling of superiority over him.\n\nWorking: (looking up to them, literally) I get a pain in my neck.\n\nIn addition to the Frost commentary and sketches, there are also a pair of musical contributions. Julie Felix sings a folksy, acoustic version of \u201cI\u2019m Sticking with the Union\u201d halfway through the show. Then, later in the program, a frequent performer on the American version of That Was the Week That Was, Tom Lehrer, appears with a song. If you\u2019re not familiar with Tom Lehrer, he was a satirical musical performer with a sharp bite like no other. Due to the fact that he would sing from behind a piano, he tends to get lumped in with the milquetoast Mark Russell, but Lehrer could be very piercing with his satire, and his song on this episode of The Frost Report, entitled \u201cNational Brotherhood Week,\u201d is the perfect example.\n\n\u201cThe Frost Report on Class\u201d doesn\u2019t offer anything in the way of a solution for the issues described here, but it did shine a light on a world that wasn\u2019t often discussed so frankly. While The Frost Report would only last another two years, the impact it had on the world of comedy is incredible. The fact that it brought together the majority of the Pythons (minus Gilliam) is enough of a contribution that it belongs in the comedy history books. In summary:\n\nPizza!
