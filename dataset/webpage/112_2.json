Tell us about what made Lusia Harris\u2019s story so appealing to you.\n\nGet Food & Dining in Rhode Island Sign up for news and updates about the best recipes to try, restaurants and bars to check out, and things to do on weekends in Rhode Island. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nCrouse: I\u2019ve spent a long time reporting on women\u2019s sports and trying to cover them in unusual ways, whether it\u2019s exposing the punishments women athletes face for having children or just helping bring excellent women athletes\u2019 profiles before a mainstream audience. There was never really a job on those themes for me to apply to, so I came up with how I wanted to do it myself, doing stories that I hoped would resonate with readers like me (especially because I\u2019m an athlete myself). Lucy Harris\u2019s story fit right into that.\n\nWe produced her story as part of a documentary series I came up with as an experiment with Breakwater Studios about people who were incredibly talented and on the cusp of making history, but were forgotten for any number of reasons \u2013 obviously that premise applies to so much of women\u2019s sports. It\u2019s hard to get historical stories, especially in a documentary, to echo in ways that make people think about the world around them right now, but in this case, the resonance with barriers that contemporary female athletes face was clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: I feel like every college athlete should be required to study Lusia Harris\u2019s career. Luckily, the award comes at a perfect time because we\u2019re gearing up for what looks to be a really competitive women\u2019s Final Four. What\u2019s something you learned about during the making of the documentary that everyone should know?\n\nCrouse: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard directly from a woman who was at the center of the revolutionary changes to women\u2019s sports in America that were unfolding 50 years ago, at the dawn of Title IX (which granted women and girls equal opportunities in school sports to those enjoyed by boys and men). It was interesting to learn that Lucy made her women\u2019s team so good that the women\u2019s basketball team at her small Mississippi school flew in planes to their games, while the less competitive men\u2019s team took buses.\n\nYou rarely hear of women\u2019s teams leading the way, or getting resources that reflect their superiority. It contradicts the tired argument that \u201cnobody wants to watch women play.\u201d Of course they do \u2013 we just have to tell the stories with the same level of quality we tell stories about men.\n\nQ: Shaq and Steph Curry were executive producers of the documentary. How much were they involved in the day-to-day of the project and what was it like to work with them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrouse: They were incredible promoters of Lucy Harris\u2019s story. I hope what they did for \u201cThe Queen of Basketball\u201d can wind up being a model for how male athletes with outstanding platforms \u2014 or any powerful men whose power has grown in systems that were optimized for them to succeed \u2014 can use their audiences to bring attention to extraordinary, but lesser known, women. Sharing the love lifts everyone up.\n\nQ: You grew up in South Kingstown, went to Harvard, and now have won an Oscar at The New York Times. What\u2019s the Rhode Island-related documentary you\u2019d just love to work on?\n\nCrouse: The Pulitzer prize-winning novelist Jhumpa Lahiri graduated from my high school several years ahead of me; her mother was my teacher\u2019s aide when I was an elementary student at South Road School in Wakefield. I\u2019ve never met Lahiri, but have always admired her, and was surprised there wasn\u2019t more of a shrine to her in my high school \u2013 I just remember a small plaque with her name on it in a corner of our library, which I would look at and think, we should be shouting her name from the rooftops! with everything she\u2019s achieved.\n\nHer writing gave me a new lens for thinking about my hometown, for good and bad, as has following some of her family\u2019s experiences in the town when they\u2019ve been in the news. In keeping with the themes of her books, I think that story would make a powerful foundation for a look at the modern American town (and about how they are changing \u2013 as well as how they aren\u2019t). I\u2019d love to know more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story first appeared in Rhode Map, our free newsletter about Rhode Island that also contains information about local events, data about the coronavirus in the state, and more.

Howard Lindsay (b. March 29, 1889, Waterford, New York, U.S.\u2014d. February 11, 1968, New York, New York) and Russel Crouse (b. February 20, 1893, Findlay, Ohio, U.S.\u2014d. April 3, 1966, New York, New York) were notable both for their continual successes and for the way they complemented each other\u2019s talents.\n\nPrior to meeting Crouse, Lindsay had already gained experience as an actor, director, and playwright, traveling for 42 weeks in the production of Polly of the Circus. Crouse\u2019s early experience was primarily journalistic, although he did write a libretto for The Gang\u2019s All Here (1931), which ran for only two weeks. He also wrote several nostalgic books in the early 1930s about 19th-century America.\n\nWhile trying to salvage a play in 1933, producer Vinton Freedley paired the talents of Lindsay and Crouse. The result was Anything Goes (1934) and a partnership that was to expand and mature over the following years. Their longest-playing drama was a 1939 production based on Clarence Day\u2019s book Life with Father, which ran for 7 1/2 years (3,213 performances) and in which Lindsay played Father opposite his real-life wife, Dorothy Stickney. When Lindsay and Crouse were offered Arsenic and Old Lace in 1940, they tried their hands at theatrical production, and the result was another success. In 1946 the pair won the Pulitzer Prize in drama for State of the Union (1945), which was a satire of American politics. Sections of this play were rewritten every day to correspond to actual events. They also wrote the libretto for the play The Sound of Music (1959).\n\nLindsay and Crouse\u2019s work had a universal appeal, created by a blend of Lindsay\u2019s theatrical knowledge and Crouse\u2019s sharp wit.
