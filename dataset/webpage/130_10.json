"https://en.everybodywiki.com/Bill_Brown_(radio_personality)", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Brown (August 15, 1942 \u2013 October 9, 2011) was a long time air personality on the \"oldies\" radio station WCBS-FM in New York City.[1] For most of his tenure there he aired at midday on the station. Brown also did many voiceovers on commercials airing on that and other New York City radio and television stations.\n\nEarly career [ edit ]\n\nBrown was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia in 1942.[2] Bill Brown began his radio career at various radio stations, including San Diego Top 40 station 136/KGB (now KLSD). Brown began working on WOR-FM (now WEPN-FM) in 1966 doing various swing airshifts, eventually becoming full-time. Initially, WOR-FM was a progressive rock station, but it evolved into an adult top 40/oldies station by 1968.\n\nIn 1969, WCBS-FM traded in their easy listening 'Young Sound' format for an album rock format similar to WABC-FM (later WPLJ) and WNEW-FM. Brown was on the original airstaff. Unfortunately, WCBS-FM could not lay claim to sizable ratings in the New York City radio market while other stations such as WNEW-FM and WPLJ gained most of the rock n'roll radio audience. After research and several years of very low ratings WCBS-FM dropped the AOR format on July 7, 1972 at 6 AM and began playing Oldies from 1955 to then current product. Initially the station played both rock and roll songs and non rock songs of the 1950s and early 60's and only softer rock and pop hits of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brown, along with the rest of the airstaff including Don K Reed (who was hired in January 1972) all stayed on with the Oldies format. Back then, it was common for airstaffs to stay on after format changes and not as common to lay off entire airstaffs. By the end of 1972, Brown was on the station weekdays 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Saturdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n\nOver the next few years most of the staffers of the station would leave, but Brown and Don K Reed stayed on and were still part of the station in 1974. In 1975, Brown also became Program Director of WCBS-FM. For a few months he gave up his midday airshift. By the end of 1976, Brown was on from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays along with his Saturday morning shift. Under Brown, WCBS-FM moved away from easy listening and began to play more 60's rock. In 1978, Brown gave up his program director position but retained his airshifts. His shift was still 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Saturdays.\n\nIn 1984, when Ron Lundy arrived, Brown was moved to 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. while Ron moved to the 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. slot. Harry Harrison now aired from 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. (previously he was on 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.). Bill's Saturday shift was then 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every second week. Bill Brown also continued doing voiceovers for many commercials airing on WCBS FM and other radio stations. He celebrated 20 years in 1989, 25 years in 1994, and 30 years of service in 1999. In 1994, he officially dropped his Saturday morning airshift in honor of his many years of service at the station.\n\nAs airstaff occasionally came and went (though staffers stayed many years in most cases), Brown continued on consistently from noon to 3 p.m until 2005, when his airshift was moved to 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. With his years of service, age, and retirements of other well known staffers it was speculated that his retirement was not far off.\n\nThe switch to JACK [ edit ]\n\nBill Brown remained at WCBS-FM until the station's two-year \"sabbatical\", which started on June 3, 2005. Although ratings were decent and the station was profitable, CBS executives abruptly laid off the entire airstaff at 4 p.m. that day. Bill Brown was the last live air personality to sign off several minutes before 4 p.m.. He came out of Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffett and played Rescue Me by Fontella Bass. It was unclear whether or not he knew the end was happening from his last statement, though he did not say a typical goodbye. His last words were, \"CBS-FM 101.1, Fontella Bass... Do you ever feel the urge to just kinda scream, \"RESCUE ME!?\"... I'm beginning to get that feeling, here's Fontella Bass.\" Other airstaffers definitely did not know the end was near as they said goodbye and stated when they would be back. The rest of the airstaff did not know what was happening until after Brown signed off and was at the meeting. In fact, half the airstaff did not even attend this meeting and were told through a conference call. These staffers could not be present because this meeting was only announced at 2 p.m. that day. At the 4 p.m. meeting, the staffers were laid off and informed that Oldies and Greatest Hits CBS-FM would be shut down immediately and replaced by an adult hits format of over 2,000 songs called, \"Jack FM\". From the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. hour the station played 8 oldies and greatest hits with jingles in between, followed by 30 minutes of stunt montages. At 5 p.m., the jockless JACK format signed on.\n\nBrown then retired from CBS-FM after 33 years of playing oldies, as well as nearly 36 years of service. He is the only air personality to be with the station through their entire first run using live on-air personalities. He did one of their first shifts the day WCBS-FM adopted the rock format in 1969 and the very last live airshift doing oldies in 2005 (Don K. Reed was the only other air-personality to have been with CBS-FM during their entire run as an oldies station. He did the fourth shift on July 7 into July 8, 1972 and did the 4th to last live airshift from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. on June 5, 2005).\n\nBrown died on October 9, 2011 at the age of 69.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\u2191 Colford, Paul D.

Either Brown plays football or trains for it, but not both.\n\nBrown decided to call it a career. \"I've got a family to take care of,\" he said. \"I'm a father now.\"\n\nHe was 33 years old.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Brown returned to Cleveland and worked as a security guard at Mapco until his death in October 1990 after suffering heart problems while working the night shift. He was 44.\n\nModell sold the team to Steve Bisciotti and Thomas J. Wyant Jr. in 1994. The new owners moved the team to Baltimore where they are today known as the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nBrown died two months before his 45th birthday.\n\nFootball players have long careers because they don't want to suffer any injuries that might prevent them from playing again. As soon as they hit 30, many teams start looking for replacements.\n\nThe main reason many players stop training is because they need to take care of their families.\n\nIs football star Jim Brown still alive?\n\nJim Brown is an 81-year-old retired NFL player and film actor. While playing with the Cleveland Browns from 1957 to 1965, he established multiple league records and helped the team win the NFL title in 1964. In 1971, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He had a conversation with Marc Myers.\n\nHere are some other facts about Jim Brown:\n\nHe has been married four times and has nine children. His first marriage ended in divorce after only one year. His second marriage also ended in divorce. His third marriage lasted from 1980 to 1990 and produced two children. His fourth marriage ended in 2001 and he has been dating Linda Pace since then.\n\nHe owns a restaurant called The Big O's Steak House in New Carlisle, Ohio. The building was formerly an ice cream parlor that opened in 1952.\n\nBrown made his movie debut in 1950's Two Guys from Milwaukee. He played both parts in the movie. The next year, he appeared in Another Man's Woman as well as A Boy and His Dog. In 1953, he starred in I Love Lucy episodes \"The Show Stoppers\" and \"Superstar\".\n\nIn 1955, he became the first player to be awarded the Heisman Trophy when it was created. The award is given to the nation's best college football player.\n\nHow old was Jim Brown when he retired?\n\nBrown quit after becoming a Hall of Famer at the age of 30 to pursue an acting career. Jim Brown, 30, a Cleveland Browns pro football star, is pictured in a film studio on July 14, 1966, in London, England, when he announced his retirement from pro football at a news conference.\n\nIn the absence of those chances, the only option for a black man to demonstrate his \"manhood\" was through that universal cultural hallmark of male status: the capacity to bed and/or control women. Over the course of his life, Jim Brown has utilized his own declaration of manhood as a bulwark against prejudice.\n\nOne night, the brawl becomes unusually ferocious, prompting neighbors to contact the cops. After the cops battle with Jim to get through the door, they discover blood on the walls and the floor, as well as \"a five-inch patch of hair on a huge rug.\"\n\nWhen did Jim Brown play in the NFL?\n\n1957 Jim Brown (Dates) joined the Cleveland Browns/Syracuse Orange football team in 1954.\n\nBrown played with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League from 1957 through 1965, and he led the league in running yards every year save 1962.\n\nHow old was Bobby Brown when he retired from football?\n\nBut Brown envisioned a future for himself outside of football, and he announced his retirement before the start of the 1966 season, shocking the sports world. Brown wished to devote his post-football life to a film career. He was only 30 years old when he retired from the game.\n\nIn a statement released by his family lawyer, John Taylor, Brown said, \"I have made this decision after much thought and consideration with my family. I want to be clear, though, that I plan to continue to work in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he hoped to act in more serious roles than those typically offered to black actors at the time. \"I feel that there is a need for more positive images of black people on screen,\" he concluded.\n\nBrown's retirement came just a year after the end of the NFL's ban on black players joining white teams. The league allowed this move because it wanted to attract more fans across racial lines. Before Brown retired, no black player had ever been given a chance on a professional football field during the official season.\n\nHowever, there were many other games being played around the country by black colleges that did not count toward winning or losing a team's record. Brown attended Howard University until he reached the age of 27 before quitting to pursue a football career.\n\nWho is Jim Brown and what is his net worth?\n\nJim Brown is a retired professional football player from the United States with a net worth of $50 million. The Cleveland Browns selected him in the first round of the 1956 draft. Jim is both a real estate investor and an actor. New: the top 15 highest-paid footballers in 2021!\n\nHe played for the Browns from 1956 to 1970, when he was traded to the Baltimore Colts. He finished his career with the California Angels in 1971. Brown was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\nAfter his retirement, he had a successful acting career, appearing in such films as I Hate My Life, American Hot Wax, A Soldier's Story, Conan the Barbarian, and Batman & Robin. His last role was that of Mr. Wilson in the 2014 film Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\n\nBrown wrote two books during his playing career: The Jim Brown Report: How to Become Financially Independent at Age 19 - With No Money Down! and What You Should Know About Football.\n\nAfter retiring from football, he started a financial planning company called The Jim Brown Company. Today, it is one of the largest sports marketing companies in the world.\n\nHis net worth increased by $5 million in 2016 after earning $1 million for appearing in the movie Son of God. It dropped down to $45 million the following year after reporting losses of $18 million.\n\nIs Jim Brown still alive in 2021?\n\nJim Brown, who was born on February 17, 1936, is 85 years old as of today, July 17, 2021.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns The 1964 National Football League Championship Game was place on December 27, 1964, at Cleveland Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. It was the 32nd annual championship game."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/07/guardianobituaries.football", "page_content": "The goalkeeper Bill Brown, who has died aged 73, played a major part in Tottenham Hotspur's achievement of the Championship and FA Cup double in 1960-61, the first double of the 20th century. He was also capped 28 times for Scotland.\n\nBorn in Arbroath, he had played forward as a schoolboy, but when he joined the Carnoustie Juveniles club he went into goal and stayed there throughout his career.\n\nIn 1948, he was signed as a \u00a37 a week part-time professional by Dundee, to the displeasure of his dairyman father, who insisted he learn a trade. Brown complied by training as an electrical engineer. His sporting life could have ended prematurely when he broke his nose and jaw and fractured a cheekbone in a trial for the Scotland youth team, but he recovered.\n\nSix-foot-tall Brown established himself as an outstanding goalkeeper with Dundee, giving the lie to the English belief that Scottish keepers were a joke. He was agile, commanding and courageous, never flamboyant. He did his national service in the RAF, and represented it in goal. On demobilisation he became a full time professional at Dundee, much admired by his manager, former Rangers and Scotland centre-forward Willie Thornton. But competition among Scottish goalkeepers was such that Brown was international goalkeeping reserve 25 times.\n\nWith Dundee, he played 215 Scottish League games from 1950 to 1959, winning a League Cup medal in the 1951-52 season. His debut for Scotland could hardly have been more difficult or more impressive. In June 1958, during the World Cup finals in Sweden, he was picked to replace Tommy Younger against France. Scotland lost 2-1, but Brown impressed France's attacking pair, Juste Fontaine and Raymond Kopa. He continued to win caps for Scotland until November 1965.\n\nDundee, needing money for new floodlights, sold him to Tottenham in 1959 for \u00a316,500. He played 222 League games for Spurs, missing just one in their double-winning season. In 1962, he added another FA cup medal when Spurs beat Burnley in the Wembley final.\n\nFinding abundant time on his hands in London, Brown joined the sales staff of a printing company and later opened a printing firm in Soho with a partner. Things at Tottenham began to go wrong, when, early in 1964, at the age of 32, when a keeper might be expected to be in his prime, he was dropped from the team by the manager, Bill Nicholson (obituary, October 25 2004). He never fully regained his place, facing opposition from the young Northern Irishman Pat Jennings.\n\n\"It came as a tremendous shock to us when he was dropped by Spurs,\" said Ian McColl, then team manager of Scotland. \"I regard Brown as the best keeper in Britain.\" Brown angrily announced that he had no intention of playing in Tottenham's reserves. That his form had suffered was proved when he did leave Spurs in 1966 for humble Northampton Town. And there, too, he lost his place, in March 1967.\n\nThe following summer, he flew to Canada to play for the shortlived Toronto Falcons in the \"unofficial\" soccer League which sprang up that year, unsanctioned by FIFA. Because of that he and another British player were banned when he was on the point of joining non-League Hastings United. For Brown this proved a blessing, for he stayed on in Canada, taking a post with the land development section of the Ontario government, from which he retired in 1995.\n\nIn 1988, he had a heart attack which persuaded him to cut out the 40 cigarettes he smoked each day. In 1994 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he survived that, too.\n\nHe leaves his wife Elaine, two daughters and a son.\n\n\u00b7 William (Bill) Dallas Fyfe Brown, footballer, born October 8 1931; died November 30 2004"}, {"url": "https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2018/12/20/18125052/when-paul-brown-resigned-as-head-coach-a-history-on-the-browns-week-16-opponent", "page_content": "Head coach Paul Brown despised one thing above all else \u2013 losing.\n\nIn 41 years of coaching football at the high school, college, military and professional level, he had won seven professional football championships, one college national title and six high school state championships. He had won 501 games against only 126 losses.\n\nBut on December 28, 1975, his Cincinnati Bengals had just lost to the Oakland Raiders 31-28 in the AFC divisional playoffs. That 1975 squad was probably the best team he coached while in Cincinnati and had gone 11-3-0 in the regular season. Two of those losses came at the hands of the powerful Pittsburgh Steelers who were tearing up the National Football League (NFL) in the 1970s.\n\nHe was the Bengals\u2019 head coach, general manager and majority owner. For some reason only known to him, this playoff lose hurt deeply.\n\nFour days later, he telephoned the Bengals public relations director and told him that he was submitting his resignation as head football coach effective immediately. In his resignation, he named Bengals\u2019 offensive line coach Tiger Johnson as the next head coach.\n\nAll of this in a normal world would simply be an everyday occurrence of a coach who had been doing the same job for almost half a century decides that he doesn\u2019t want to go through the rigors of coaching anymore. But with this one resignation, it involved two football genius icons \u2013 one established and another not yet well-known.\n\nAn Offense Like no Other\n\nThe Bengals attack in 1975 was tops in the NFL. QB Ken Anderson led the league in passing yards with 3,169 and was also the highest-ranked QB with a 93.9 rating. WR Isaac Curtis finished second in the receiving category with 934 yards/seven TDs while Charlie Joiner added another 726 yards with five TDs. In addition, Cincinnati\u2019s offense ranked number one that season.\n\nWhich surprised nobody in the league. The franchise had gained notoriety slowly over the years with their offensive attack. From a ranking of 25th in 1968, the offense was ninth in 1972, eighth the following season and fourth in 1974.\n\nYou see, the offense had a genius-in-waiting. And that mastermind outlook just kept improving season after season as the right players were brought into the fold. Gradually, pieces of the puzzle became clear.\n\nThe offensive coordinator was a young buck by the name of Bill Walsh. Coach Walsh had been a position coach for two colleges and then the RB coach for the Oakland Raiders one season. He then took the head coaching position of a regional semi-pro club called the San Jose Apaches of the Continental Football League, an early NFL farm-system entity. All of these teams were located in California.\n\nBack in 1963 Brown had examined whether the NFL would entertain an expansion team in another Ohio city. The state had a long history of pro football with teams in Columbus, Canton, Cincinnati, Akron and Dayton. Cleveland at the time had a populous of over 876,000, so he wanted another large city to start a new team. He focused on either Cincinnati (population 502,000) or Columbus (471,000). The elder league had looked at Cincinnati, but no new franchises were planned until they placed a team in Atlanta in 1966.\n\nBrown\u2019s off-season home was located in California where he mainly played golf while collecting his $82,500 paycheck from the Cleveland Browns who owed him for the balance of his contract after getting fired. So, he was well-aware of who Bill Walsh was. When the American Football League (AFL) wanted to expand in 1968, Brown was contacted as a possible major shareholder in the new club. Since he left the head coaching position with the Browns, he had several offers to coach again but most franchises just wanted a coach; and he wanted total control of all aspects of the team just like he had in Cleveland. After several years he decided it was time to pursue grinding out a new season on the sidelines.\n\nBut Brown thought the AFL was inferior professional football and not even close to par with the NFL. The saving grace for him was the knowledge that the two leagues had agreed to merge beginning in the 1970 season. Coach Brown realized that he could take on the new Cincinnati AFL expansion team and would only have to compete three seasons in that league before his new team would become an NFL club. And that appealed to him. Plus, he was about to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967. This would be a huge plum for the AFL - to actually have a legend either as a head coach or as an owner \u2013 or both.\n\nAFL officials couldn\u2019t be happier to have another team plus a legendary coach. What sealed the deal was the fact that Brown would become primary owner. Part of the agreement was that a suitable stadium would have to be built and ready for the 1970 season which got the wheels rolling to build Riverfront Stadium. On September 26, 1967, Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes held a press conference at the Sheraton Hotel to announce the AFL\u2019s newest member: the Cincinnati Bengals to begin play in 1968. Brown told reporters that he realized that a new team would certainly have to experience some tough times, but he was ready to do what he always loved \u2013 being a head coach.\n\nBut he needed help.\n\nFilling the Voids of a New Team\n\nThe Bengals received 40 veteran players in the AFL allocation draft. With the pending merger, beginning in 1967 the college draft would be a common event instead of separate like in previous years. Cincinnati was awarded the second overall pick in the first-round, and the first pick in each subsequent round throughout the 17-round draft. Their first-ever pick was center Bob Johnson, whose number would eventually be retired. TE Bob Trumpy was taken in the 12th round and would be a key component in the upcoming seasons along with RB Paul Robinson in round three (who became the league\u2019s Rookie-of-the-Year).\n\nBrown hired Walsh to run the offense and gave him almost unlimited rein to develop the passing attack and game plan each week. Through the years in Cincinnati, the offensive line was never good enough to sustain blocks in the passing game and the team\u2019s QB, Virgil Carter, was an accurate passer but did not have great arm strength to push the ball deep. So Walsh developed out of necessity an offense designed for shorter passes with a higher percentage of completions.\n\nBy 1971, Walsh was calling all the plays and had total control over the offense. The Bengals used plenty of man in motion, crossing patterns, short passes to the running back, and misdirection in the rushing attack. All of this was by design developed by Walsh to accommodate his personnel.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1975, Cincinnati had captured the AFC Central Division title twice and had come in second place two of those years with three playoff appearances. The offense was clicking and had great success. The only thing wrong with the Bengals\u2019 11-3-0 1975 season was the Steelers\u2019 12-2-0 record nestled in the same division and the fact that Pittsburgh had defeated them twice that year.\n\nWalsh Exits Cincinnati\n\nBill Walsh wanted to be a head coach one day. He assumed that when Paul Brown would finally hang up his whistle and spend his time strictly as the GM that he would become the next head man.\n\nSo, the news that Brown had resigned as head coach did not surprise Walsh. The fact that the offensive line coach, Tiger Johnson - a man who had only been a position coach his entire pro football coaching career - was named as the next head coach, the update was devastating to him. Walsh had been with the Bengals eight years and was a coordinator. The very year that Coach Brown stepped down was the very season that the offense was ranked number one in the entire league. In addition, Johnson had worked under Walsh.\n\nWalsh decided that he would never become an NFL head coach if he had to wait around more years lingering in Cincinnati. In order to be seriously considered for a head coaching vacancy at some point, he decided to leave the Bengals.\n\nSeveral days after Johnson was given the head job, Walsh told Brown in his office of his intentions to leave. Brown was irate and stated that Walsh could not leave because he was still under contract. Walsh left anyway - visibly upset.\n\nIn the interim, numerous clubs called the Bengals and asked about Walsh\u2019s availability to which Brown gave them all a negative review. Walsh would later learn that the year before several clubs had called Brown and asked to interview the gifted coordinator for their head coaching vacancies, but Brown either said no to the requests or simply did not pass along the messages.\n\nDid you know? The \u201cWest Coast Offense\u201d is a finesse offense that places a greater emphasis on the short passing game than on a run-oriented offense designed to control the ball. The attack was developed by Walsh while working with the Bengals and later installed as head coach with the 49ers during their Super Bowl years. Initially it wasn\u2019t called the West Coast Offense. The term came into being in 1985 from a remark made by then-New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells after they defeated the dominant Niners 17-3 in the playoffs using a stiff run game. Parcells scoffed at the 49ers refined pass-first offense with the outburst, \u201cWhat do you think of that West Coast Offense now?\u201d\n\nBecause Walsh was the offensive coordinator with the Bengals, NFL rules prohibit assistant coaches from making a lateral move to another franchise; so he was named the assistant head coach with the San Diego Chargers for the 1976 season. The following year after his Chargers stint he accepted the head coaching position with Stanford University in which that team went 10-3-0 his first year.\n\nIn 1979, Walsh stayed in California yet again and was named head coach of the San Francisco 49ers and installed his West Coast offense. His coaching was not simply a new way to run an offense, but rather an innovative way to coach a football squad.\n\nTiger Johnson would go 18-15 as head coach of the Bengals before resigning after a 0-5 start in 1978. He would become a position coach for three more teams before retiring in 1990 and never became a head coach again.\n\nAs fate would have it, Walsh\u2019s 49ers would meet Brown\u2019s Bengals in Super Bowl XVI at the conclusion of the 1981 season and defeated his former boss 26-21 for that franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl title.\n\nBill Walsh\u2019s legacy is all around the game of professional football including his influences on modern offensive strategies. His San Francisco 49er teams would capture three Super Bowls and he was named the NFL Coach-of-the-Year twice. He was also named the head coach of the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team. Walsh won 92 games and lost 59 with one tie for a .609 win percentage. In 1993, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 1999 he became the 49ers vice president/GM.\n\nOne can only imagine where the Bengals would have gone if Walsh had been named head coach and stayed all those years plus the championships the City of Cincinnati missed out on.\n\nBarry Shuck is a pro football historical writer and a member of the Professional Football Researcher\u2019s Association."}, {"url": "https://www.mmafighting.com/2023/5/19/23730467/jim-brown-nfl-legend-actor-and-early-ufc-color-commentator-dies-at-87", "page_content": "NFL legend Jim Brown, who retired in the prime of his football career to pursue acting, has died at 87.\n\nBrown\u2019s wife Monique announced the news on Instagram after he passed away quietly at home on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cTo the world, he was an activist, actor, and football star,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo our family, he was a loving husband, father, and grandfather.

''It was a great affair,'' said honorary club president Ronnie Thomson. ''There was even the original picture of the first team on display. The speakers were excellent, and even although most of the older lads have heard Broonie before, it was the way he puts it across that makes him so good.''\n\nPeter Brown had spoken at the centenary dinner in 1974 and sent a message of good will.\n\nYes, 125 years old, and we're not talking about the jokes or the speakers.\n\n''Craigielea started in 1874 as Paisley RFC, then the name changed to Craigielea in the 1890s. In the early years a group broke away from rugby to form a football club and they called it St Mirren,'' says Thomson, ''and this fact is mentioned in St Mirren's 100 years book.''\n\nThe chairman of St Mirren, Stuart Gilmour, was present at the dinner and, rightly, pleased that the football club has done a little better than the rugby one.\n\nCraigielea, by comparison, are nothing like as strong as the football club they spawned. ''We field just the one team at the weekend, but it is a sociable team and we are fighting against the fact that not many schools play rugby,'' Thomson explained.\n\n''In the olden days it was different. On Saturdays the team would travel to away games by train, and our records show Craigielea playing Kilmarnock RFC at football in the morning and then rugby in the afternoon. The original photograph of the team from 1874 is now held in Paisley museum.''\n\nMy own mind goes back to hearing stories about how, although modern players think they train hard, some of the great Glasgow sides of 40 years ago would meet every lunchtime of the week and train at Hughenden, or whatever was their club ground. It's not strictly a modern phenomenon that players train hard.\n\nBill McLaren tells stories of Hawick men who would walk nine miles with their boots over their shoulders to go training. He tells of internationalists, farmers from around Hawick, hitching lifts to Murrayfield to play other countries after walking to the road end.\n\nWell, 60 years ago Craigielea, drawing on the people of Paisley, were at their peak.\n\n''The best years for Craigielea were the early and mid 1930s,'' says Ronnie Thomson. It was in 1921 that the club joined the SRU. ''Craigielea won what was then the Western District championship in the thirties.''\n\nNow Craigielea play at a lower level, but still compete. ''The club now plays at Abbotsinch on pitches belonging to Renfrew Education Department and it costs us #10 to play a game'' says Thomson. ''The beer and the jokes afterwards take place at Ferguslie cricket club, so we help their profit by drinking some beer and both of us benefit.''\n\nLooking back, both St Mirren and Kilmarnock football clubs came out of Craigielea, and Kilmarnock rugby club respectively. As we spoke, Ronnie Thomson had the original minute where Kilmarnock wrote to Craigielea upon the setting up of their football club to invite the Paisley team down for a game of football in the morning, rugby in the afternoon.\n\nIn the 1890s, Craigielea were one of the teams you had to beat in Scotland to claim that you were a great side, and they are one of the oldest clubs in the country, alongside Glasgow Accies and Edinburgh Accies.\n\n''Twenty years ago we fielded four teams,'' says Thomson, ''but comprehensive schools just don't play rugby. The SRU should be right into schools. Getting new players is harder. The game must be in the schools.''\n\nThomson mentions Alex Middleton, the club secretary, Russell Keir, Ian Lawrie, Gary Somerville, and the appropriately named second-rower, Billy Maule, as men who have kept it going. I wanted to know if there was a Jim Punchup, but no, there wasn't.\n\n''We want to keep the traditions of the club going, that's all,'' says Thomson. ''We want to keep putting out a team and playing the game so that people can keep the name of the club alive.'' I hope they do.\n\nHappy birthday Craigielea. They're now so old they might as well release a Christmas single."}, {"url": "https://gomason.com/sports/baseball/roster/coaches/bill-brown/424", "page_content": "Bill Brown enters his 41st season as the head coach of George Mason baseball and his 45th season involved with the Patriots for the 2022 season.\n\nAfter two seasons as a Patriots catcher and two years as an assistant coach, Brown has maintained the success he inherited with the program and lifted it to new heights. George Mason's all-time leader in coaching victories with a 39-year record of 1,060-1,023-7, Brown surpassed the program's founder, Raymond H. \"Hap\" Spuhler, in 1993. Spuhler was 318-169-3 in 12 seasons before George Mason entered the Division I ranks.\n\n\n\nBrown recorded his 1,000th career victory on March 7, 2018 when Mason defeated Towson 14-7 at Spuhler Field. At the time, Brown became one of only 16 active coaches in Division I baseball with at least 1,000 wins.\n\n\n\nThe Patriots finished the 2021 season with a 14-29 overall record. Junior pitcher Jared Lyons was named Atlantic 10 All-Conference First Team starting pitcher, A-10 All-Academic Team and Virginia Sports Information Directors (VaSID) All-State Second Team starting pitcher. Lyons became the first Mason baseball player to earn A-10 First Team and All-Academic honors in the same season since the Patriots joined the league in 2014. He finished the season 6-2 with a 3.73 ERA and among A-10 leaders during the 2021 season, ranked second in lowest opponent batting average (.192), tied for third in wins (6), fourth in both innings pitched (72.1) and strikeouts (76), and eighth in ERA (3.73).\n\n\n\nThe 2020 season was canceled after 15 games due to the Covid-19 virus.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, junior Logan Driscoll was selected Atlantic 10 All-Conference First Team catcher, while senior Brady Acker was named A-10 All-Conference Second Team outfielder.\n\n\n\nDriscoll, who was a semifinalist for the 2019 Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year Award for the second year in a row, became the highest draft pick in Mason baseball history when he was selected by the San Diego Padres in the second round with the 73rd overall pick in the 2019 MLB Draft. Junior right-hander Jared DiCesare was selected in the 17th round by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2019 MLB Draft.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Brown guided Mason to an overall record of 29-27 and finished second in the Atlantic 10 with a record of 16-8, equaling the program record for wins against the conference. The Patriots won six of their eight conference series during the regular season.\n\n\n\nIn the 2018 Atlantic 10 Baseball Championship, Mason won three games to advance to the championship round. The Patriots defeated seventh-seeded George Washington (11-3), third-seeded Fordham (4-0) and the host Colonials for a second time (9-4) to advance to championship Saturday.\n\n\n\nSophomore catcher Logan Driscoll was named to the All-Conference First Team, while senior outfielder Tyler Nelin and junior starting pitcher Zach Mort earned All-Conference Second Team honors. Driscoll was also named All-ECAC First Team and was a semifinalist for the 2018 Johnny Bench Award.\n\n\n\nThe Patriots had three pitchers turn professional. Right-handed starters Zach Mort and Bryce Nightengale were selected in the 2018 Major League Baseball Draft, while right-handed reliever Ryan Ricci signed as a free agent with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\n\n\nMort became the second-highest draft pick in the history of Mason baseball after being selected by the Chicago Cubs in the eighth round of the 2018 MLB Draft on June 5. He finished the season with a 6-3 record and 2.48 ERA in 15 starts for the Patriots. Mort led the Atlantic 10 in innings pitched (105.1), tied for first in complete games (3), ranked second in the A-10 in strikeouts (108) and was sixth in the conference in ERA (2.48).\n\n\n\nNightengale, who ranked second in the A-10 in starts (15) and seventh in the conference in strikeouts (80) in 2018, was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 16th round, becoming the ninth Mason player in program history drafted in the 16th round or higher.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Patriots finished with an overall record of 26-33 and posted a mark of 13-11 in Atlantic 10 play, advancing to the conference tournament as the seventh seed. Mason defeated second-seeded Saint Louis, 9-5, in the opening round.\n\n\n\nThe Patriots finished the 2016 season with an overall record of 26-33 and went 13-11 against Atlantic 10 opponents, earning a spot in the A-10 Championship for the second time in program history. Mason defeated Rhode Island 9-5 in the opening round of the tournament held in St. Louis, Mo.\n\nBrown guided the Patriots through their inaugural Atlantic 10 Conference season in 2014, and before that, left a mark as one of the most decorated coaches in Colonial Athletic Association history. Brown was honored as CAA Coach of the Year a record six times and has guided George Mason to some of its greatest accomplishments. Since 1985, the Patriots have won two CAA titles, finishing second three other times along with the program's first A-10 title in 2014, posting a 34-22 record on the season and playing in the Houston Regional. Brown has now coached to seven appearances in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nGeorge Mason also has posted at least 30 victories in a season 15 times in the last 30 years, including a school-record 42 wins and an at-large berth in the NCAA Tournament in 2009. Mason was nationally-ranked for the first time in school history that year, rising into the top 30 in both the National College Baseball Writer's Association and Collegiate Baseball polls.\n\nTwice in two years, a Mason player was named a finalist for a national award. In 2009, Chris Henderson was a finalist for the Bench Award as the nation's top catcher while in 2010, Ryan Soares was a finalist for the Wallace Award as the nation's top shortstop.\n\nIn 2008, Brown took a team that was young and lost several starters to injury and led it to a 30-25 mark and a third-place finish in the CAA. The Patriots took a pair of wins over nationally-ranked schools and Brown was named CAA Co-Coach of the Year. In 2005, Mason finished the year with a 35-19 record and in 2004, Brown picked up the Coach of the Year award when he led Mason to a 39-19 record and an at-large berth in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Brown was elected to the Washington, D.C. Home Plate Club Sandlot Hall of Fame and to the George C. Marshall High School Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, Brown earned CAA Coach of the Year honors as he guided George Mason to its third conference championship and a school Division I-record for victories with a 39-18 mark. He then saw his squad win for the first time ever in NCAA Tournament action when the Patriots routed Rider in Gainesville, FL. The next season, Brown shared Coach of the Year laurels as he led George Mason to its first-ever at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament and an overall 33-15 record. The Patriots won the CAA regular season championship for the second year in a row and advanced to the CAA Tournament finals.\n\nGeorge Mason won its first conference championship by claiming the ECAC South title in 1985, finishing the year with a 38-23 record. Brown earned his first Coach of the Year honor after leading the Patriots to a 31-23 record in 1987, then he guided them to the CAA crown in 1988 as they finished with a 34-27-1 mark. The Patriots advanced to NCAA Tournament regional play in 1985, 1988, 1992, 1993, 2004, 2009 and 2014.\n\nBrown took the helm of the Patriot program at age 24 in the fall of 1981 and has seen the team move from a field on George Mason's North campus to area high school fields before finally finding a permanent on-campus home with Spuhler Field in 1985.\n\nA native of nearby Vienna, Brown grew up playing baseball and helped lead George C. Marshall High School to the Virginia state finals as a senior in 1975. He came to George Mason as a player in 1978 after spending seasons at the University of Georgia and Allegany Community College. While catching for the Patriots, Brown was selected as the NAIA All-District catcher as the Patriots were 36-17-1 during his junior year.\n\nBrown worked in the George Mason athletic department for the next two years, earning his B.S. degree in government and political science in 1980. He was named the third head coach in George Mason baseball history when Walt Masterson, who was the head coach for two years, retired in 1981.\n\nSince Brown has been the head coach, 32 Patriots have been drafted by major league baseball clubs and several others have been signed as free agents. Six of the drafted players -- Justin Bour, Shawn Camp, Mike Colangelo, Mike Draper, Chris O'Grady and Chris Widger -- have reached the major leagues. Draper, drafted by the New York Yankees in 1988, became the first former Patriot to reach the majors when he played with the New York Mets in 1993, while Widger has played with the Seattle Mariners (1995-96, 2000), the Montreal Expos (1997-2000), the Yankees (2002), the St. Louis Cardinals (2003) and Chicago White Sox (2005). Colangelo was called up by the Anaheim Angels in June 1999 and appeared in one game before being lost to an injury for the rest of the season, but he saw action with the San Diego Padres in 2001 and with the Oakland Athletics in 2002. Camp spent the 2004 season with the Kansas City Royals and he has pitched every year in the majors since. Bour was first called up by the Miami Marlins in 2014 and was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies during the 2018 season.\n\nIn 2005, Widger became the first Patriot to compete in a World Series. He added to that honor by bringing home a World Series ring as he had an RBI in the series for the world champion Chicago White Sox.\n\nOne other former player of Brown's to make a mark in major league baseball is Dayton Moore. The former infielder was named the general manager of the Kansas City Royals in May of 2006 and he brought along former Mason players J.J. Picollo (Assistant GM - Player Personnel), Lonnie Goldberg (Director - Scouting) and Ken Munoz (Regional scout).\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Brown was elected to the Washington, D.C. Home Plate Club Sandlot Hall of Fame and to the George C. Marshall High School Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nKeeping the tradition of the sport and George Mason University, Brown and his staff work closely with the community and local baseball organizations. With both winter and summer player camps, as well as winter coaching clinics, Brown and his staff actively take part in the development and promotion of baseball throughout the Northern Virginia community.\n\nBILL BROWN'S MILESTONE WINS\n\n1: at St. Augustine's (3/14/82)\n\n100: vs. Connecticut (3/12/86)\n\n200: vs. Old Dominion (4/19/89)\n\n300: vs. UNC Wilmington (4/26/92)\n\n319*: vs. Rider (3/31/93)\n\n400: vs. UNC Wilmington (3/23/96)\n\n500: vs. Va.

So if he goes there (St Mirren), I think he'd still be tempted to play.\n\n\"However, it's a completely different role - there's so much on your plate when you're the manager and if you're on the pitch at the same time, that's incredibly difficult.\n\n\"You'd need a strong number two beside you, so that one will be interesting if he gets it, but I do think it'll be something he looks at seriously.\"\n\n\"Every managerial appointment is a gamble of some kind - going for a young manager would be a risk, an untested manager would be a risk, but given they are relatively comfortable in the table, is this perhaps a time where they can afford to make that choice?\n\n\"Scott has done his apprenticeship in the first half of the season at Aberdeen and the influence he had at Celtic Park behind the scenes was huge as well, he knows how to run dressing rooms.\n\n\"Management is a bit different, but he has that about him. So, it's a big call for St Mirren but I think it'll be one that will be popular with the fans.\n\n\"They know how influential Scott Brown has been in Scottish football over the past 10 to 15 years.\""}]}
