Best known for his work in the history of science and medicine and described as \u201cthe dean\u201d of his fields by historian Dorothy Ross, John had a reach that far exceeded his fields of scholarly expertise.\n\nJohn was born on July 14, 1929, in Boulder, Colorado. After graduating from West Seattle High School in Washington state (he was proud of his excellent urban public-school education), he accepted a scholarship to Stanford University, where he took his bachelor\u2019s degree. He went \u201ceast,\u201d as he put it, to the University of Wisconsin for his master\u2019s degree, after which he returned to Stanford for his PhD (1958). John always talked more about his teachers than his schools. After he informed his seminar students that the course descended directly from Frederick Jackson Turner, he went through the lineage of his teachers and theirs. He taught students never to stop asking questions and searching for answers, and he expected deep research, concise writing, and historiographical significance.\n\nJohn\u2019s own work regularly disrupted traditional historiography, and altogether, he created and enjoyed an enviable career that extended far beyond his retirement. He spent most of his academic career at OSU, but he also taught and held prestigious research fellowships at the universities of Sydney, Cambridge, Chicago, and Melbourne; Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities; Bowdoin College; and numerous other institutions. He was president of the American Association for the History of Medicine (AAHM) from 1990 to 1992 and edited the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences from 1997 to 2000. He lectured internationally, and scholars have published anthologies and held special conferences to celebrate the significance of his pioneering work to their fields. John published 10 monographs and nearly a hundred articles over the course of his career. His last book, Health Care in America (2015), is a masterful history of medical practice in the United States that stands as a fitting culmination of his scholarship.\n\nJohn was deadly serious about his work and historical scholarship generally. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he had a tough, often unreadable shell. He was also kind, generous, and concerned about other people\u2019s happiness. Susan Reverby described him as \u201can early supporter of young scholars within the AAHM and wherever we turned up to give papers if he was at the same meetings.\u201d James Gilliam, who studied Chinese history at OSU, was John\u2019s teaching assistant during the early 1980s and said that John was \u201cas much or more responsible for my earning my PhD as anyone on my committee.\u201d John and his wife of 59 years, Marjorie Spencer Burnham, always hosted newcomers to the history department soon after their arrival. In 2001, Marjorie founded a history of medicine lecture series for the OSU Medical Heritage Center and the history department. They were also instrumental in the funding of an endowed lectureship in the medical school. When two colleagues died, John located their manuscripts and found people to finish them; both books won prizes.\n\nAs serious as John was about scholarship, he had a wicked and deadpan sense of humor. He could appreciate being the subject of the joke himself. After he told me about the fabulous prize his book After Freud Left (2012) had just won, I asked, \u201cWhich prize?\u201d He answered that it was for the cover. (The designer really was brilliant.) Although it might not have been a joke (one could not always tell with John), when it came time to talk with one of his children about sex, John presented him with a two-volume work on sex education and insisted that he would answer any questions his son had once he finished reading it.\n\nJohn will long be remembered not only for his contributions to the history of medicine, psychology, psychiatry, science, technology, and culture, but also for all the ways he supported his university, his profession, and countless individuals in and outside the profession.\n\nStephanie J.

The clock strikes the hour twice, first on a low note and then on a much higher one. The tower once stood about 20 yards from where it is now and was moved to its present site when Great Court was laid out.\n\nMany of the buildings that we see today were built through the efforts of Thomas Nevile, who became Master of Trinity in 1593, including the main features of Great Court and a large part of the beautiful, cloistered court on the side of the Hall that faces the river. Nevile\u2019s Court was completed in the late 17th century when the library designed by Sir Christopher Wren was built. The Wren Library contains many treasures, the oldest of which is an 8th century copy of the Epistles of St Paul. New Court and courts on the other side of Trinity Street opposite the Great Gate were erected in the 19th century. In more recent times, much new building has been completed, including Blue Boar Court and Burrell\u2019s Field.\n\nThe College grew rapidly in importance during the century after its foundation and by 1564 it accounted for about a quarter of the total number of resident members of the University."}, {"url": "https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/in-brief/", "page_content": "Many of the University\u2019s customs and unusual terminology can be traced back to the early years of its long history. To better understand the history of Trinity College it is recommended that you refer to the history of the University of Cambridge for some background information.\n\nKing Henry VIII founded the College in 1546 as one of the very last acts of his life. His interest was in establishing an institution that would produce the future leaders of the reformed church and formed Trinity through the amalgamation of two existing Colleges \u2013 King\u2019s Hall and Michaelhouse. King\u2019s Hall had received its charter in 1337 and occupied buildings that are now the northern parts of Trinity\u2019s Great Court. Michaelhouse, founded in 1324 by Hervey de Standon, Chancellor of the Exchequer to Edward II, occupied buildings to the southern parts of Great Court.\n\nFrom the outset Trinity was a much richer society than King\u2019s Hall and Michaelhouse put together. Their joint endowments amounted to less than a quarter of those of Trinity. Most of this endowment was derived from land and endowments that had belonged to dissolved monasteries, but also included small private estates purchased by the King.One of the most notable gifts made by Henry VIII toTrinity was the convent of the Franciscans or Grey Friars, occupying what is now the site of Sidney Sussex College. The stones of the friary were used in the construction of new buildings of Trinity.\n\nSince then, Trinity has received further benefactions from many members and friends wishing to assist its work in education, learning and research, or to help with the preservation and extension of its buildings. It is now the largest college in the University."}, {"url": "https://www.roll-of-honour.com/Cambridgeshire/CambridgeUniversityTinityCollegeWW1.html", "page_content": "CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, TRINITY COLLEGE WORLD WAR 1 WAR MEMORIAL World War 1 - Roll of Honour with detailed information\n\nCompiled and copyright \u00a9 Gill Cannell & Andrew Dishman 2009 The Cambridge University, Trinity College World War 1 memorial is in the form of Trinity College Chapel at the east end of which, either side of the altar, there are oak panels are engraved with the 619 names of those who died in the First World War.

Chairman of Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co, by his wife, the Hon Emma Cecilla (Ida) nee Farrer, only daughter of Thomas Henry, 1st Lord Farrer and grandson of Charles Darwin. Born Cambridge 7-12-1881, educated at Horris Hill and Marlborough (Cotton House) and gained an exhibition for Mathematics at Trinity College,Cambridge. He went up to Trinity in October 1901 and took the mathematical Tripos in his second year being placed among the senior Optimes. Afterwards he took the mechanical sciences Tripos and was placed in the second class in 1905. On leaving Cambridge he went through the shops at Messrs Mather and Platts at Manchester. After this he worked for some little while with the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co., of which he was a director, and then became assistant secretary of Bocklow Vaughan and Co Ltd at Middlesborough. Here he stayed for seven years and at the outbreak of war occupied the postion of secretary to the company. As soon as war broke out he decided to join the army and on 12-9-14 was gazetted 2nd Lieut in the 4th (Territorial) battalion of the Yorkshires, which after training at Darlington and Newcastle crossed to France, as part of the Northumbria division on 17-4-15 and was within a week called upon to take part in the second battle of Ypres. Here these Territorial troops fresh from home and tried at the very outset almost as highly as men could be tried, behaved with a steadiness and coolness which gained for them the congratulations of the generals commanding their division and their army corps. Early on the morning of the 24-4-15 the battalion was ordered to attack the village of Fortuin, close to St Julien where the Germans had broken through. This attack they successfully carried out in the face of terrific shellfire, being ordered to retire at dusk. By driving the enemy back a mile or more they had attained their object which was to prevent a breach in the line, and they hade made good their front with the Canadians and Royal Irish on their right. It was during this advance that Darwin fell, killed instantaneously. His Commanding Officer, Colonel Bell wrote of him \"Loyalty, Courage and Devotion to duty - he had them all .... He died in an attack which gained many compliments to the battalion. He was right in front. It was a mans death\". Corporal Wearmouth, who was in his platoon wrote \"I am a section leader in his platoon and when we got the order to advance he proved himself a hero. He nursed us men, in fact the comment was, you would say we were on a field day. We had got to within twenty yards of our halting place when he turned to our platoon to say something. As he turned he fell, and I am sure he never spoke. As soon as I could I went to him but he was beyond human aid. Our platoon sadly miss him, as he could not do enough for us, and we are all extremely sorry for you, in your great loss\". Private Wood wrote to a friend in Middlesborough \"I would expect you would know poor Mr. Darwin .... I was in his platoon and I can tell you he died a hero. He led us absolutely regardless of the bullets from the German Maxim guns and snipers that whistled all around him\". Just before he left England, when his battalion was under orders for the front, he was summoned to the war office and offered a staff appointment at home in connection with munitions of war. This would have given great scope to his capabilities. \"It would have been interesting and important work\" he wrote \"but of course there are plenty of older men who can do it just as well as I can\". He felt that at the moment his place should be with his Regiment and made, in the words of one present at the interview, a fine appeal to be allowed to go with his men. It was granted and he went gladly with no looking back. The Times (30-4-15) said of him \"Erasmus Darwin would, if he had lived, have added fresh distinction to the name of his familyin a walk of life in which it has never before figured. Between Cambridge and a great iron works in the north there is something of a gulf fixed and one who knew Darwin only in his Cambridge home cannot say anything more than that all that met him in business conceived a very high opinion of his grasp of the subject, his acuteness and administrative ability. It was indeed impossibe to know him without realising that he combined with intellectual ability a calm, sound and practical judgement, and a general capacity for doing things well and thoroughly. He had, too, what must have been invaluable to him in his work, a most genuine sympathy with and affection for working men, and this quality, which, amongst so many other things, had made him love his work at Middlesborough, gave him intense pleasure when soldiering came to him as a wholly new and unlooked for esperience. He delighted in the men, and especially in long expeditions across the moors with his scouts. There is one more quality as to which all his friends would agree, namely a conscientiousness that was eminently sane and wide minded and completely unswerving. No one in the world was more certain what to do what he believd to be right. DAVIDSON Norman R [1897] Lieutenant-Col., R.H.A.; G.S.O. D.S.O. and Bar. Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel. M3.

He was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his degree in Science in 1900. At Cambridge he rowed head of the river, was in the trial eights, also fenced for his University against Oxford. He joined the Royal Artillery in May, 1900, and served in both Horse and Field Batteries, retiring in 1909, and, voluntarily joining the Reserve of Officers in August, 1914, in the following month was gazetted to the Special Reserve, Royal Field Artillery, as Lieutenant. His Commanding Officer wrote as follows : \"Lieutenant Donaldson was shot through the head and killed instantaneously in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on the 10th March, 1915, and was buried near the trench in which he fell. At the time of his death he was observing Officer for the battery in the trenches. There was no more gallant, unselfish, indefatigable officer in the Army, and he was loved by all the officers and men who served with him. The battery could not have suffered a greater loss. In order better to follow and report on the progress of the attack, he had shown himself above the parapet, with the regardlessness of personal danger that characterised him, though he was never unnecessarily reckless In this respect. The last messages from him were to say that we had gained the German trenches, and that the fire of our battery was effective.\" He was mentioned in Sir John French's Despatch of 31st May, 1915, and his battery's share in the success of the bombardment was fully recognised in all the orders. Hie married, in 1912, Dorothea, daughter of Mr. J. Freeman, of Shepperton.

Information was received at Rossie Priory yesterday that the Hon.

Lord and Lady Kinnaird are at present in London, where they are spending the winter months, and the sad news was conveyed to them there. Deceased was a captain in the 2d Battalion of the Scots Guards. He was 35 years of age, and was gazetted second lieutenant on 22d May, 1901, lieutenant on 1st February, 1904, and captain on 3d February, 1912. He was the eldest of four brothers, two of whom are at present serving with the colours, Kenneth Fitzgerald, with the Scottish Horse, and Arthur Middleton, with a London Territorial body. Educated at Cambridge. The late Master Kinnaird, who was educated at Cambridge, took a great interest , all military matters. He was busily engaged training recruits until about a month ago, when his battalion was ordered to the front for active service.

These include: the need for a society to understand its own past if it is to guide its future; the philosophically respectable argument that historical knowledge is the only possible type of knowledge; and the enrichment of human culture in the present. In practice most of those who choose History at university do so because they so greatly enjoy it. That is also why we teach it.\n\nAlthough History is not exactly a vocational subject, nearly all employers of graduates are keen to recruit historians. Many areas of the law, government service, media, finance, and industry value good historians at least as highly than graduates who can claim an \u2018expertise\u2019. History provides an intellectual training and a stimulus to the imagination: it enables one to put expertise into its human context. It also teaches the practical skill of absorbing, organising and presenting large amounts of knowledge.\n\nTrinity has a great historical tradition, as the names of T.B. Macaulay, Lord Acton, F.W. Maitland, G.M. Trevelyan, Jack Gallagher, E.H. Carr, Sir John Elliot, Norman Stone, Patrick Collinson, and Dominic Lieven all testify. In particular, Trinity historians have long been at the forefront of the study of imperialism and their aftermaths. From 2019, the College has five teaching Fellows in the subject: Peter Sarris, who works on Roman, medieval European, Byzantine, and Islamic history; Samita Sen, who works on global economic history and the history of modern South Asian; Richard Serjeantson, who studies European history between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment; Daniel Larsen, who works on international and intelligence history in the early twentieth century in the US and UK; and Damian Valdez, who is an intellectual and political historian of Germany in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Other historians in the College who may also teach you include Boyd Hilton (eighteenth- and ninteenth-century British history), Sachiko Kusukawa (sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European history and history of science), and Tessa Webber (medieval British history). The College is thus unrivalled in Cambridge in terms of the chronological span and geographical range covered by its historians. This makes for an exciting and diverse learning environment.\n\nThe History Tripos offers a very wide range of options and in spite of the range of expertise available at Trinity, no single college can provide specialist teaching in all its corners. Inevitably, therefore, most of our students will from time to time be sent outside Trinity for supervisions, but we have excellent reciprocal relationships with other colleges and can promise expert tuition in all fields. We are also keen to foster our students\u2019 linguistic skills, and will arrange teaching for those wishing to improve their command of a foreign language or acquire a new one.\n\nWe expect our undergraduates to work hard. But we also think that History is fun, and don\u2019t want our students to be solemn about it. With an undergraduate intake of about 12 a year, as well as several graduate students working for a PhD, historians are an important presence in the College. The Historical Society is one of the College\u2019s most active academic societies and its meetings even attract students who are not themselves historians. Trinity\u2019s library facilities are the best of any college in the University, and we actively encourage our undergraduates to help us develop the collection to meet the requirements of the papers they are taking.\n\nTrinity also has a wide range of awards and grants available to its historians. There is the Lapsley Fund for Medieval Studies; the Crawford Travelling Scholarship; the Projects Fund; and a number of language bursaries. There are also exchange schemes to the Ecole Normale Superieur in Paris and to the Universities of Chicago and Rice in the United States. These generous funds provide unmatched opportunities for students to travel for pleasure, profit, and historical inquiry, whether to Byzantium, Bayeux, Bangladesh, or the local County Records Office. There are also a number of generous History Prizes. The Bowen, Greaves, and James Webb (History of Ideas) prizes are awarded on the basis of essays; the Earl of Derby and Louisa Oriel prizes are also awarded to historians who distinguish themselves in Tripos examinations. The Robson History Prize is intended to encourage ambitious and talented Year 12 or Lower Sixth students who may be considering applying to university to read History or a related discipline. At the same time students will, of course, be able to take advantage of the extraordinarily high quality of accommodation and general facilities that the College offers."}, {"url": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/university/student/trinity-college-cambridge", "page_content": "Trinity College is the largest of the Cambridge Colleges, having around 200 undergraduate students in each intake and some 700 undergraduates altogether.\n\nTrinity College Established: 1546 University: University of Cambridge Address: Trinity Street, Cambridge, CB2 1TQ Telephone: +44 1223 338400 Website: http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk Student Union/JCR website: http://www.tcsu.net Graduate/MCR website: http://basociety.net/ Admittance: undergraduates and postgraduates\n\nStudent Statistics\n\nSee: Cambridge University Student Number Statistics\n\nTrinity Application Statistics See College applications and admissions statistics and Numbers applying to Trinity College\n\nTrinity Application Statistics per subject See Appplication Statistics\n\nLocation\n\nThe central area of the College (Great Court, New Court, Neville's Court, Angel Court, The Chapel, Bar, Hall and the Library) is located in the middle of town on Trinity Lane, just north of Market Square and Kings Parade, with Great Gate (the main entrance) set back slightly from Trinity Street. The south section of College, Whewell's Court, Blue Boar Court, the Winstanley lecture theater and the Wolfson Building opposite Great Gate. The north section of the College, Burrell's Field is reached by crossing out the back of the College and over Queen's Road, about a five minute walk from Great Gate.\n\nAccommodation\n\nSee:\n\nTrinity aims to provide accommodation in College for all new students, whether you are starting an undergraduate or a graduate course. Most first years are accommodated in either Angel Court, the Wolfson Building or in Blue Boar Court, all of which are good by Cambridge standards. Expect a room with a bed (funny old thing), wardrobe, bookcase, desk &chair and a sink. A kitchenette (known for archaic Cambridge reasons as a Gyp Room) will be shared between around 5 or 6 of you, though the facilities vary depending on the court you're assigned. The vast majority of rooms in the Wolfson building, which houses 90 first years, are en suite and large by Cambridge standards, even if they can seem a bit industrial. Several staircases in Angel and Blue Boar are home to some of the largest rooms (they really can be pretty huge). Of course, there are also some more moderately sized (though still pretty good) rooms, which are very reasonably priced.\n\nA student writes: Trinity accommodation seemed good. The room I stayed in (Angel Court) for interview was enormous, but didn't have lots of storage (had a lot of desk area, though, and the sink was in a very small ante-room). A friend stayed in Wolfson for his interview, and I had a test there - the building's ugly from the outside, but was very modern (lots of glass, things on the walls, clearly fairly recently painted) and well-looking inside. He said the room was good.\n\nAccommodation in following years is assigned by a ballot system, and the ballot is reversed so that those who are at the bottom in second year are at the top in third year (though scholars get bumped above everyone else). Once the third years have picked, second-year students are generally left with rooms in New Court, Pearce Hostel, Bishop's Hostel, some rooms in Whewell's Court and most of the rooms in the slightly further afield Burrell's Field to choose from. New Court contains a number of very spacious sets which you might be able to choose if you're nearer the top of the ballot, and those rooms and other rooms in Whewell's, New Court and Bishop's have the advantage of being located in the main part of college. However, if you're after facilities and don't mind living a little bit further away from town, then you could choose Burrell's Field. The rooms here come in three general forms -- the modern tower-style rooms (built in 1996, very nice), the older 1980s rooms in staircases A-F (still quite pleasant), or the houses, which have all been refurbished in recent years - G, X and W on Grange Road and V slightly further into the grounds.\n\nThird years have the best choice of accommodation, with only Senior Scholars choosing before them. This means that, as well as the Whewell's and New Court, future third years can pick some rooms in Great Court, rooms on the 'Blue Boar Podium' which are pretty modern, 4a Bridge Street has an abundance of access to bathrooms and well-equipped kitchens and a few rooms in Nevile's Court for the very lucky.\n\nIn both second and third years, students can also choose to live in a double - usually 2 bedrooms and a living area, with a bathroom in some cases (as in the doubles in Burrell's Field). These generally work out as cheaper than an equivalent single room and the living areas are generally large.\n\nTrinity has possibly the best bedmakers in Cambridge. Every day, bedmakers make beds, empty rubbish bins, and clean the toilet; every other day, they additionally hoover and dust. Furthermore, they change bed linen weekly.\n\nSocial Spaces\n\nLots. The Wolfson Party Room (WPR, pronounced whuper) is a subterranean, troglodytian hole somewhere beneath the Wolfson Building. Generally home to the TCSU-organised Ents. There's also the Butler House Party Room in Burrell's Field, where TCSU lay on a Freshers' Ent.\n\nGardens\n\nTrinity is lucky to have the Backs, and a glorious Fellows' Garden (which, despite the name, is open to students) The South Paddock is one of the few bits of hallowed turf they let students on, and is usually home in the summer to hoards of us. The Fellows' Garden, between Burrell's and the main college site, is great on a sunny day to sit in with a book and forget that you're meant to be working.\n\nDining/Hall\n\nHall is cheap, edible and plentiful. Opinions among Trinity students on Hall's quality are divided. Certain friends from other colleges have commended it highly, though I would certainly say the quality varies. Most would agree that Trinity does very good steaks and roasts, and one culinary art College definitely excels at is pudding/dessert/afters. Supposedly, Trinity invented Creme Brulee, and the Brown Bread Ice Cream is to die for. Seriously lush. Trinity also offers a very good brunch on Sunday, with everything you could want, including waffles and pancakes!\n\nFormal\n\nTrinity formals are particularly formal by Cambridge standards. They happen on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday for undergraduates, and B.A formal is on Friday. Dress standards are notionally suit, tie, and a gown for everybody (not just College members, as is common at most other Cambridge colleges), with female equivalent.\n\nBar\n\nThe bar is usually heaving before and after formal dinners, but fairly quiet at other times. It is located in Angel Ct, but you can get to it through the passageway between I Great Ct and Angel.\n\nJCR\n\nThere are two JCRs, which are both above the bar. The lower JCR has papers, several board games, tables and comfy seating, and the upper JCR has Sky TV, a DVD player a PS3, comfy seating etc.\n\nLibrary and Computing\n\nLibrary\n\nIt's big, with everything you could want (e.g. free ear plugs, book stands, etc). During exam term you can work in the beautiful Wren library, too. Fines have recently been reduced and borrowing restrictions relaxed.\n\nComputer rooms\n\nThe College has several computer rooms -- one in the library, one in I Great Court with 5 PCs and a Mac with loads of software on, two scanners (one on the mac and one on one PC) , and one black and white printer, one colour printer. Another computer room is located next to the JCR, another by Green Street gate and another in Burrell's Field Porters' Lodge. Read More: Trinity Computing Pages\n\nRoom Internet Connection\n\nEvery college room has at least one ethernet network point and eventually they'll all have WiFi. Everyone is given an ethernet cable when they come to college for the first time. One of the only things the college makes a big fuss about in terms of how you choose to use the internet is peer to peer (p2p) sharing software, which is banned in Trinity. The data usage allowance was increased in 2012 and is now several gigs a day. You shouldn't have any problems unless you spend hours skyping, streaming films and TV from your computer. Eduroam wifi is also available in most places.\n\nAcademic Performance\n\nTrinity has in recent years been dominating the Tompkins Table (which ranks colleges by their Tripos exam results) by huge margins, ranking 1st (2015), 1st (2014), 1st (2013), 1st (2012), 1st (2011), 2nd (2010), 1st (2009), 3rd (2008), 6th (2007), 5th (2006), 3rd (2005), 3rd (2004), 8th (2003), 6th (2002), 3rd (2001), 2nd (2000).\n\nAtmosphere\n\nTrinity is a damn nice place to live, generally. Although it's the largest college in Cambridge, you'll soon make a group of friends, especially given the way the first years are accommodated. Living in the centre of town is a definite advantage, as if it all gets too much for you there's plenty of spaces to escape to in town. Really, with most colleges, you make them into what you want. It's the people that count, and thankfully Trinity has a lower quotient of numpties and irritating characters than some other colleges do.\n\nSports and Gym\n\nAt Old Field, a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Great Gate, Trinity has its own facilities for football, rugby, cricket, and netball. Four squash courts, a badminton court, and nine all-weather tennis courts can be booked free of charge. The hockey pitches are at another site a short distance from the College. All sports clubs at Trinity bar rowing are part of the Field Club, Trinity\u2019s main sports society.

The three chaplains recommended that all candidates, including those being prepared by the Reverend Featherstone Lake Osler in Tecumseth, should be sent to Cobourg to be instructed by Bethune.\n\n1841: November 21. Bishop Strachan announces that he has appointed Bethune, who had studied under Strachan at Cornwall and later at York, Professor of Theology in the Diocese of Toronto and that, in the future, candidates for Holy Orders will be required to take \u201cRegular prescribed courses of theological study\u201d and to be examined by one of the Bishop\u2019s Chaplains before admission.\n\n1842: January 10. First lecture given at the Diocesan Theological Institution at Cobourg, two students being present to hear the lecture. Further support requested from SPG. Eight students were enrolled by the start of the next term and thirteen by midsummer. By January 1852, when the work was transferred to Toronto to become the Faculty of Divinity in the new Trinity College, sixty-nine of the Cobourg Institution\u2019s seventy-seven students had been admitted to Holy Orders. The Debating Society, precursor of the Trinity College Literary Institute, founded in Cobourg and brought to Toronto by the continuing students. The theological course lasted three years and included the Greek Testament, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, Evidences of Christianity, Old Testament History, Liturgics, Church Government, Ecclesiastical History, and the Greek and Latin Fathers. Students were required to write sermons, which were read by the other students and commented on by Mr. Bethune, and to undertake mission work in the parishes.\n\n1843: First lectures given at King\u2019s College in Toronto, Bishop Strachan President until 1848. A few of its graduates were ordained. King\u2019s was secularized in 1850 by the government of the Province of Canada and was renamed the University of Toronto.\n\n1851: August 2.

The Divinity course required two years, or six complete terms, in addition to three years in Arts. Among other things, students were required to master one book of the New Testament in Greek, Scripture History, Paley\u2019s Hora Paulinae, Blunt\u2019s Undesigned Coincidences, St. Augustine\u2019s City of God, Book X and Proctor\u2019s History of the Book of Common Prayer.\n\n1877: Foundation of the Protestant Episcopal Divinity School at St. James Cathedral Schoolhouse, which became Wycliffe College in 1882, and moved to the University of Toronto campus.\n\n1881-1994: Charles W.E.

Feilding, Acting Dean then Dean of the Faculty of Divinity. During this period, Faculty of Divinity becomes involved in clinical pastoral education, with Emmanuel College and McMaster Divinity, one of the first theological faculties in Canada to do so. In 1944, the theological program was extended to three years.\n\n1951: The curriculum in Divinity is revised and expanded, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Sacred Theology (S.T.B.).\n\n1954: Blanche Murphy Donovan, Helen Milton and Mary D. Rendell the first women to obtain a divinity degree from Trinity. From 1942, students at the Anglican Women\u2019s Training College had pursued theological studies at Trinity College.
