Gilles Paradis explains: \"It's a matter of discipline and cohesiveness between the troops. Imagine, for instance, you send 10 soldiers in the field on patrol, and it's a very dangerous mission. The [commanding officer] is a a sergeant and he has a relationship with one his female soldiers, and he has to send someone ahead on a dangerous path where you could find some explosive device, and he never chooses that person.

The subordinate involved has been sent home, according to a military spokesman.\n\nBrigadier-General Jonathan Vance, Gen. M\u00e9nard's predecessor, will be returning to Kandahar this week to assume command less than a year after he left, arriving as coalition troops are poised to launch a major operation in Kandahar in June that is cast as the defining moment of the war.\n\nWhile Canadian military commanders in Afghanistan sought to down play the controversy as a personal ordeal, military observers and former officers said Gen. M\u00e9nard's dismissal could be damaging to the morale of the troops on the ground, and possibly taint Canadians' image of the armed forces.\n\nIt will certainly \"take away some of the glitter\" that was associated with Canadian soldiers' performance in Afghanistan, said Michel Drapeau, a professor of military law and a former armed forces colonel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is particularly unfortunate that it comes so soon after Colonel Russell Williams, the former base commander at CFB Trenton, was charged with multiple murders and sexual assaults, he said. While the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are in no way similar, they will add to the public's concern about the quality of leadership in the armed forces and raise worries within the Forces as well, he said. \"People in the military [will say]'Here we go again,'\"\n\nHowever, the greatest impact, Mr. Drapeau said, will be on the morale of troops in Afghanistan who served under Gen. M\u00e9nard. \"It's devastating,\" he said. \"They [put]all of their trust and respect in him, and they were prepared to follow him into battle ... Their sense of confidence in leadership will take a hit.\"\n\nMilitary historian Jack Granatstein said it is important to note that the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are \"infinitely less serious\" than those against Col. Williams. If proven, they will primarily demonstrate \"stupidity on the part of a commanding officer who's job it is to set an example.\"\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard commanded 2,800 Canadian soldiers in southern Afghanistan, as well as a contingent of American troops serving under Canadian command.\n\nThe allegations against him caused military command to \"lose confidence\" in his \"capacity to command,\" the military said in a brief statement. Military rules strictly forbid any kind of intimacy on deployments, including relationships of an emotional, romantic or sexual nature.\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard, is 42 and married with two children. Major Daryl Morrell, senior public affairs officer with Joint Task Force Afghanistan, said it was \"too early to speculate on the charges\" Gen. M\u00e9nard could face, because they won't be known until the military completes its investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLieutenant-General Marc Lessard, commander of Canadian forces overseas, made a brief visit to Afghanistan several weeks ago, before Gen. M\u00e9nard went on a three-week leave, from which he has just returned. However, reporters at Kandahar Air Field were told the allegations were only revealed to Gen. Lessard on Saturday. Lt.-Gen. Lessard acted immediately to replace Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nColonel Simon Hetherington, previously Brig.-Gen. M\u00e9nard's second-in-command, is now acting commander until Gen. Vance arrives. He sought to down play any consequences the allegations could have on the military's reputation.\n\n\"The allegations against Brig-Gen. M\u00e9nard are that - they're allegations,\" Col. Hetherington said. \"It's a personal thing, so I don't see that as any sort of mark against the institution at all,\" he added.\n\nDefence Minister Peter MacKay declined to comment on the case while it was under investigation by the military.\n\nMichael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that while it is clearly discouraging for troops to see a senior officer accused of breaking the rules, it also tells the public that those rules are being applied at all levels.\n\n\"I'm encouraged by the fact that M\u00e9nard was removed from his post, since it suggests that the Forces are taking the rules, and the rights and interests of female soldiers, seriously,\" Prof. Byers said.\n\nRetired major-general Lewis Mackenzie said the fact that Gen. M\u00e9nard was the commander in Afghanistan raises the situation above a minor issue, because he would be the one to make final decisions in other cases of inappropriate behaviour. \"He's the last level of authority in the theatre in disciplinary matters.\"\n\nDouglas Bland, the chair of defence management studies at the Queen's University School of Policy Studies, said the military has moved quickly to deal with leadership issues since the Somalia inquiry, when problems in command were linked to the fatal beating of a teenager by two Canadian soldiers during a humanitarian mission in Somalia. \"That is a sign of their sensitivity and seriousness about maintaining good order and discipline across the forces,\" he said.\n\nBut Prof. Bland said the rules prohibiting personal relationships are essential, especially in combat zones, \"where the integrity of the unit is supreme,\" and must be followed, particularly, by the highest-ranking soldiers.\n\nThis is not the first time controversy has dogged Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nLast week he was fined $3,500 for accidentally firing his rifle at Kandahar Air Field in March. He had failed to switch is C8 carbine rifle to the \"safe\" position before departing in a helicopter with his boss, General Walter Natynczyk.\n\nNobody was injured, but the incident qualifies as an offence under the National Defence Act, with a maximum penalty of dismissal from the military. At a military hearing into the incident, Gen. M\u00e9nard's defence lawyer argued for leniency, noting the commander reported the mishap to investigators and discussed the incident openly with his soldiers.\n\nBrig.-Gen M\u00e9nard joined the Canadian forces in 1984 and was posted to the Royal 22nd Regiment where initially served as a platoon commander.\n\nHe rose quickly through the ranks, serving in Great Britain, Berlin, Germany and Bosnia. He assumed command of Task Force Kandahar in November.\n\nWith a report from Erin Anderssen in Ottawa"}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/01/29/former_canadian_brigadiergeneral_daniel_menard_in_afghan_jail.html", "page_content": "MONTREAL\u2014Former Canadian brigadier-general Daniel M\u00e9nard, who was fined and demoted for having a sexual relationship with a female subordinate, has been sitting in an Afghan jail for nearly three weeks, the Toronto Star has learned.\n\nThe former head of Canadian forces in the country, who now works for private security firm GardaWorld, was detained on or about Jan. 12.

In fact, Bell says he once even reported to M\u00e9nard during a stint in Kandahar province.\n\nAfghanistan's rules for private security contractors were toughened significantly several years ago.\n\n\"This was for licensing purposes and for generating revenue for the Afghanistan government,\" Bell said. \"It was also a way of tying a weapon to an individual if that weapon was ever used illegally.\"\n\nIt's happened to a lot of companies. - Alan Bell, security consultant\n\nThat Afghan system's rules require security companies to keep accurate, detailed records of all military equipment uses in Afghanistan including rifles, radios, ballistic helmets and other gear. Bell says those records are sent to Afghanistan's Interior Ministry along with licence fees.\n\nAfghan officials frequently audit security companies to ensure they only have the weapons they have licences to support.\n\nBell says these audits can frequently cause trouble for security companies in Afghanistan, in part because the requirements are onerous, but also because the Afghan system frequently doesn't operate with the same business ethics that Western companies are used to.\n\n\"It's happened to a lot of companies. These people turn up out of the blue and try to audit their weapons and what they have what they don't have,\" Bell said. \"When there is an audit and they find you've got X amount of weapons that haven't been listed or licensed, they take that very seriously.\n\n\"If you get caught, then you have a problem. They will arrest usually the country manager because is the one that is on the ground all the time,\" Bell said.\n\n\"They've arrested a lot of [expatriates] over the years and they fine then, they fine the company. They usually confiscate the equipment that wasn't registered with them, and then you carry on business as normal.\n\n\"Then [Interior Ministry officials] go on to another company and do the same things.\"\n\nIt appears it's a situation similar to this that has M\u00e9nard spending time in jail. GardaWorld does lots of work in Afghanistan, including, at times, for the Canadian government.\n\nIt's also had more than one rules run-in with Afghan authorities.\n\nGardaWorld faced similar problem in 2012\n\nIn 2012, two British employees of GardaWorld were arrested by Afghan authorities and faced similar accusations after being found with 30 allegedly unlicensed AK-47s. At the time, GardaWorld maintained its employees were planning to buy the weapons but wanted to test their functionality on a range first.\n\nGardaWorld also faced a forced shutdown of its operations as a result of those arrests.\n\nThat dispute occurred in the early days of an Afghan government plan to take over and \"Afghanize\" most of the work undertaken by private security contractors in the war-torn country.\n\nBell says these latest accusations levelled against GardaWorld and M\u00e9nard remind him of that 2012 dispute.\n\n\"This is down to hard cash at the end of the day and whether Garda did have equipment that wasn't registered or not,\" Bell said. \"[Garda] obviously had their reason for doing that, now they've been found out so consequently they will have to pay the fines and then it will be business as usual and next week it will be another company.\n\n\"This has happened so many times with so many companies. It isn't rare.\"\n\nCanada's Foreign Affairs Department said it is aware of the arrest, and that \"consular services are being provided to a Canadian citizen who has been detained in Afghanistan.\""}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2010/05/30/canadas_top_soldier_in_afghanistan_ousted.html", "page_content": "The top Canadian soldier in Afghanistan, Brig.-Gen. Daniel M\u00e9nard, has been relieved of duty and ordered home immediately, accused of having an inappropriate personal relationship with a female soldier.\n\nAn investigation has been launched into the conduct of M\u00e9nard, who is married. Until next week, the forces in Afghanistan will be commanded by Col. Simon Hetherington, the deputy-commander of Canada's 2,800 soldiers in the country.\n\nAn official in Defence Minister Peter MacKay's office said the allegations against M\u00e9nard involve a member of his staff.\n\nHetherington told reporters at Kandahar Airfield that Lt.-Gen. Marc Lessard, commander of Canadian military stationed overseas, decided to relieve M\u00e9nard of his duties after he lost confidence in his capacity to command.Hetherington declined to comment on specifics of the allegations.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Lt.-Gen. Lessard was made aware of the allegations, which was the 29th of May, he did the proper assessment and made the decision to have him relieved,\u201d Hetherington said.\n\nM\u00e9nard received the news Sunday morning in Afghanistan.\n\nThe military has a strict non-fraternization policy for deployed troops, forbidding personal relationships of an emotional, romantic or sexual nature.\n\nNational Defence spokesperson Lt.-Col. Chris Lemay told the Star by phone from Ottawa Saturday night that the female soldier might also face reprimand after an investigation is complete. \u201cMeasures will be taken,\u201d he said.\n\nThe news came only days after M\u00e9nard faced a court martial in Canada, where he pleaded guilty to accidentally firing his weapon twice at the Kandahar airbase in March.\n\nThe incident occurred as M\u00e9nard walked with Canada's chief of defence staff, Gen. Walter Natynczyk, on his way to a helicopter.\n\nHis fine, imposed by a military judge in Gatineau, Que., was $3,500 \u2014 the stiffest fine handed down for mishandling a weapon.\n\nBrig.-Gen. John Vance will take over the mission.\n\nWhile M\u00e9nard's sudden removal will have no impact on the service of Canadian troops in Afghanistan, a defence expert said, it could permanently damage M\u00e9nard's career.\n\n\u201cFor all intents and purposes, it's a career stopper,\u201d said Stuart Hendin of the University of Ottawa.\n\nTo show there is no double standard in terms of intimate relationships, M\u00e9nard would most likely face a \u201charsher penalty\u201d than a rank-and-file soldier, Hendin noted.\n\n\u201cThere might be a feeling of \u2018If the top can act like this, why can't we do it at the bottom?'\u201d he said.\n\nHendin stressed that the allegations against M\u00e9nard have not been proven.\n\nHendin doesn't' believe the dismissal will affect the Afghan mission as a whole.\n\n\u201cOperations don't rest on one person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt will probably cause him to be the subject of substantial ridicule within the ranks, but what effect it will have on the actual operating ability of Task Force Afghanistan is probably minimal. They're entering the fighting season, the plan is already in place.\u201d\n\nM\u00e9nard is the second high-ranking Canadian military officer to be relieved of his command in recent months.\n\nCol. Russell Williams, former commander of CFB Trenton, faces charges in the deaths of two women, the sexual assault of two others and dozens of break-ins.\n\nWith files from Star wire services\n\nSHARE:"}]}
