He plays shooting guard or point guard in the National Basketball Association. Brogdon entered the NBA in 2016 when he was picked by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2016 NBA draft. Currently, he is playing for the Boston Celtics. Malcolm played college basketball for the Virginia Cavaliers. In 2016, he won the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. Brogdon also won NBA Rookie of the Year and NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon Early Life\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon took birth in a family of studious people on December 11, 1992. He belongs to the Christian community and African-American ethnicity. His father, Mitchell Gino Brogdon, is a lawyer and mediator. Malcolm\u2019s mother, Dr. Jann Adams, is a former chairperson in the psychology department of Morehouse college. Malcolm Brogdon attended Greater Atlanta Christian School and later moved to Virginia to play college basketball under Tony Bennett. Brogdon was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year along with the Defensive Player of the Year in the same season.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon NBA Journey\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was picked by the NBA franchise Milwaukee Bucks on June 23, 2016 in the 2016 NBA draft. He signed an agreement with the team on July 30. On October 26, 2016, Malcolm witnessed his debut game in the NBA and for the Bucks in the season opener. He attained 8 points and 5 assists in a game against the Charlotte Hornets. Brogdon recorded his first career triple-double with 15 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists on December 31, 2016 in a win against the Chicago Bulls. In January 2017, Malcolm was included in the US Team for the 2017 Rising Stars Challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, Malcolm registered 19 points in a win over the Celtics in the Bucks\u2019 season opener on October 18, 2017. On April 9, 2018, Malcolm returned to action after overcoming injury issues and scored two points in his team\u2019s success against the Orlando Magic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2018-19 season, Malcom scored 24 points in 29 minutes against the Chicago Bulls on November 28, 2018. It was the best shooting year for the athlete and one of the most efficient in NBA history as well. Brogdon became just the 8th NBA player to achieve the feat of a 50-40-90 season. Malcolm Brogdon moved to the Indiana Pacers and signed a contract with the Pacers on July 6, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe scored 33 points and 7 assists on January 2, 2021 in a losing game against the New York Knicks. He proceeded to record 21 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in an overtime win over the New Orleans Pelicans. He put up a career-high 35 points and 7 assists in a win (114-107) over the Houston Rockets. Incredibly, Brogdon improved his career-high to 36 points on January 25 in a win against the Toronto Raptors. Later, he missed 41 games from December to April due to Achilles pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow was the time for the athlete to leave the Pacers and join the Boston Celtics. The Celtics traded him in exchange for Daniel Theis, Malik Fitts, Juwan Morgan and Aaron Nesmith. He scored 16 points off the bench in his debut for the Celtics in a win over the 76ers. He also gained a season-high 30 points against the Charlotte Hornets. During the time of his involvement in the Celtics, Malcolm was given the choice of Toronto Raptors and the Celtics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon Education\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon joined Greater Atlanta Christian in Georgia. After that, she chose to join Virginia to play college basketball. He selected Virginia among other (Georgia, Notre Dame, and Arkansas) options. During his college career, Malcolm accomplished plenty of awards, honors and prominence on the court. He was a Consensus First-Team All-American, Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrogdon redshirted his sophomore year after sustaining a serious foot injury. With 12.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game in the 2013-14 season, Brogdon was admired as one of the top contributors to the team\u2019s success. He was also named to the 35-man midseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy as a senior at Virginia in 2015-16.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon Championship\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter observing successful years at the college level, Malcolm Brogdon got the chance to play in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the 2016 NBA draft. He came under an agreement with the franchise on July 30, 2016. Malcolm played his debut NBA game against the Charlotte Hornets on October 26. In 2019, Malcolm Brogdon shifted to the Indiana Pacers and signed a four-year contract worth 85 million US dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed with the new franchise till 2022 before joining the Boston Celtics in July 2022. Meanwhile, Malcolm also represented the United States national team at the 2015 Pan American Games. He went on to acquire a bronze medal at the competition. Since his enrollment in the NBA, Malcolm Brogdon is yet to become an NBA champion, however.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Brogdon Awards and Achievements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game of basketball has earned multiple awards, honors and achievements for Malcolm Brogdon. He was named Defensive Player of the Year and Atlanta Coast Conference Player of the Year in the same year.

It is the signature shoe of his former superstar teammate\u2019s brand.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/4434987/2023/04/21/celtics-malcolm-brogdon-sixth-man-year/", "page_content": "Malcolm Brogdon came to the Celtics with one mission in mind. After several up-and-down years running a middling Pacers team, he was ready to take a step back for his career to move forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to win a championship, that\u2019s actually it,\u201d Brogdon told The Athletic the day he was traded. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve worried about stats and numbers and all that. I\u2019m going to Boston and not worrying about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrogdon must have been playing a little reverse psychology with fate because he ended up having the best shooting season of his career on one of the best teams in the NBA.\n\nNow he is the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nYet when The Athletic asked Brogdon about the prospect of winning the award on Tuesday, he did exactly what he pledged to do at the beginning of the year and make it all about the team.\n\n\u201cIt would be huge. All these awards are team awards,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cIt takes a team for anybody to get an award because there\u2019s always five guys on the floor. It would be great for the organization, the Celtics, to have me win the award.\u201d\n\nThis is an organization synonymous with the award. Red Auerbach pioneered the role having Hall of Famer John Havlicek come off the bench during the \u201960s title years, then Kevin McHale won the award twice before ascending to the starting lineup and eventually the Hall of Fame. The last Celtic to win the award was Hall of Famer Bill Walton, who moved to the bench on the fabled \u201986 title team.\n\nThere\u2019s a persistent theme in Boston that this role belongs to someone who is willing to truly sacrifice. The award\u2019s trophy is named after Havlicek, after all.\n\nJoe Mazzulla describes his sixth man as having patience, humility and understanding. It was the tone Brogdon set when he arrived, making it clear that fitting into a bigger picture was exactly what he was seeking out.\n\nIt was telling that after saying his award would be great for the organization, he went on to endorse Derrick White for the All-Defensive team, as well as Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for All-NBA. Brogdon has been willing to open up a bit about his own journey at times, but he tends to turn it back to lifting his teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Mazzulla was asked Thursday what it meant for Brogdon to win the award, he saw it as a reflection of the entire locker room.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot. I tell all our guys, each guy has had to sacrifice or put something aside for the betterment of this team and when you have the depth and the talent that we have, you can\u2019t be in the position that we are without it,\u201d Mazzulla said. \u201cI thought Malcolm, taking on the identity of the second unit, dealing with the patience of sometimes finishing halves, sometimes not, sometimes finishing games, not finishing games, I thought he just handled it with an open mind.\u201d\n\nBrogdon\u2019s experience in Indiana made him realize he wasn\u2019t a number one option on a winning franchise, but he was still capable of carrying a large responsibility in a more ambitious program.\n\nBut that required putting aside his pride in the moments when he is used to taking charge.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of egos. Even on a team full of good guys, there\u2019s ego,\u201d Brogdon said earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought into Joe being our coach, we\u2019ve bought into the game plan every night throughout the season, and we\u2019ve bought into embracing each other. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to pay off at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nThe top of the roster has always been supportive of Mazzulla, but it\u2019s the guys on the fringes who could express frustration. Brogdon is the odd man out in closing games most of the time. Mazzulla praised him for being the spearhead of the second unit, but even being the face of the backups still puts you in a tough position at times.\n\n\u201cHe handled it with a humility, regardless of what his sub pattern was or what he was doing,\u201d Mazzulla said. \u201cHe just played and we\u2019re grateful for that.\u201d\n\nThe thing Mazzulla appreciated the most was how Brogdon fit in defensively. Coming from a defensive scheme in Indiana that just feeds ballhandler into the center, Brogdon has to take on a greater variety of responsibilities in Boston. That was rarely an issue and his effort in transition and on the boards has shined in the playoffs so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe defensive system we play can be unique, Mazzulla said. \u201cIt can be different than what most players have seen on other teams. So when they come here, it just takes some getting used to. It\u2019s just his ability to adjust to our defensive scheme and really make an impact on that end of the floor has helped us.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Tatum cited Brogdon as that extra ingredient that has given the team an edge over last season. There were so many moments when the Celtics just needed someone to come off the bench and just get into the defense to create some shots, but it rarely came.\n\nBut Mazzulla has been able to put the ball in Brogdon\u2019s hands for five minutes in the middle of a half and tell him to wreak havoc. Brogdon set the tone earlier in the season as he got deep dribble penetration to free up the bench shooters, helping guys like Sam Hauser and Al Horford put up big shooting numbers.\n\nOver time, he became the isolation scorer the second unit needed when one of the Jays was getting swarmed. He was a spot-up maestro on the wings and even became a knockdown pick-and-roll scorer for the first time in years. He ended up averaging 14.9 points per game off the bench and shooting 44.4 percent from deep, a career-high and fourth-best in the NBA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough coming off the bench, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s been a process for him,\u201d Brown said in early April. \u201cI think this is probably the first time he\u2019s ever been asked or ever had to come off the bench in his career, and he\u2019s accepted that role and he\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nBrogdon finished with 408 voting points and 60 of the 100 first-place votes, 26 first-place votes ahead of New York Knicks guard Immanuel Quickley. The Knicks guard\u2019s 38-point performance in a Knicks win in Boston in early March catapulted him into a tight race with Brogdon for the award, but Quickley\u2019s 24 starts \u2014 which led to a lot of his biggest games later in the season \u2014 appeared to weigh against him as Brogdon never started this year. Milwaukee\u2019s Bobby Portis finished a distant third with 97 voting points.\n\nIt was apparent in this year\u2019s finalists that playing a key role on a winner was the paramount qualification for the award. Quickley helped the Knicks reinvent themselves midseason. Portis was a persistent contributor on the league\u2019s top team as he stepped up with Giannis Antetokounmpo missing 19 games. Brogdon was more the icing on the cake for this Celtics team, but he was a big reason their lulls never turned into anything bigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow through all the grand ups and moderate downs they faced all year, the Celtics are up 2-0 in the first round and looking as good as ever. So winning this award now is a treat for Brogdon, but it\u2019s not why he came to Boston.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) definitely another great award, another accolade to add on to this year,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cHopefully we can get the big accolade at the end of the year.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images)"}]}
