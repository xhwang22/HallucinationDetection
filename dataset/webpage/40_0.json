He inspired his colleagues with his talent, his work ethic, his personality and his devotion to his daughters. (14:52)\n\nStuart Scott, a longtime anchor at ESPN, died Sunday morning at the age of 49.\n\nAmong the features of the new ESPN studio in Bristol is a wall of catchphrases made famous by on-air talent over the years. An amazing nine of them belong to one man -- from his signature \"Boo-Yah!\" to \"As cool as the other side of the pillow\" to \"He must be the bus driver cuz he was takin' him to school.\"\n\nThat man is Stuart Scott, and his contributions to the sports lexicon are writ large. But they are only one aspect of his legacy. When he passed away, he left behind so much more. He inspired his colleagues with his sheer talent, his work ethic and his devotion to his daughters, Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15. He defied convention and criticism to help bring this network into a new century. He spoke to the very athletes he was talking about with a flair and a style that ESPN president John Skipper says, \"changed everything.\"\n\n\"He didn't just push the envelope,\" says sports radio host and former ESPN anchor Dan Patrick. \"He bulldozed the envelope.\"\n\nScott was remembered through an outpouring of tributes by athletes, colleagues and fans on Twitter and statements from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina, which said that \"his legacy will live on in many ways -- as a friend, a son, a father, a professional and forever, a Tar Heel,\" and President Barack Obama.\n\n\"I will miss Stuart Scott. Twenty years ago, Stu helped usher in a new way to talk about our favorite teams and the day's best plays. For much of those twenty years, public service and campaigns have kept me from my family -- but wherever I went, I could flip on the TV and Stu and his colleagues on SportsCenter were there. Over the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us -- with courage and love. Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his family, friends, and colleagues,\" the president said.\n\nMoments of silence were held at sporting events around the United States on Sunday, including the NFL wild-card games between the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Indianapolis Colts and Detroit Lions vs. Dallas Cowboys; the Mavericks-Cavaliers NBA game in Cleveland and at several college basketball games.\n\nScott saved his best for his last year on the air. At the ESPYS on July 16, shortly before his 49th birthday and following another round of cancer surgery, Stuart accepted the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance with strength, humor, grace and these eloquent words: \"When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\"\n\nStuart Scott made famous the catchphrases \"Boo-Yah!\" and \"As cool as the other side of the pillow.\" Rich Arden/ESPN Images\n\nSo while the grief is deep at ESPN over the death of Stuart Scott, so is our gratitude. He was as popular on campus as he was in the airports he passed through and on the sidelines he worked over the last 22 years. He brought so much to the party, and he will continue to do so, through the people he inspired, and the language that he liberated, and the audience that will remember him.\n\nSteve Levy, who came to ESPN shortly before Stuart in August 1993 and served as his co-host for the first \"SportsCenter\" from the new studio last June, put it this way: \"I think the audience recognized that when Stuart was on, there was going to be something special. And to his credit, he brought something special every night he was on.\"\n\n\"SportsCenter\" anchor Jay Harris, who grew up watching -- and hoping to be -- Stuart, says, \"Think about that phrase, 'As cool as the other side of the pillow.' It's a hot, stifling night. You're having trouble sleeping. But then you think to turn the pillow over, and, wow, it's cool, and it feels so good.\n\n\"Well, that's who Stuart is. He is 'the other side of pillow,' the man who made sportscasting cool. God bless whoever it was who thought to rearrange the bedding at ESPN.\"\n\nStuart was born in Chicago, but he, along with two sisters and a brother, spent his formative years in North Carolina, where their father was a postal inspector who always had time to play after work. Stuart went to R.J. Reynolds High in Winston-Salem and then the University of North Carolina, where he played wide receiver and defensive back on the club football team, joined Alpha Phi Alpha and worked at the student radio station, WXYC. After graduating in 1987 with a degree in speech communication, Stuart was hired by WPDE-TV in Florence, South Carolina. He says that's where he first came up with the pillow metaphor. \"People say I stole it from a movie,\" he told an interviewer in 1998, \"but I first thought of that and said it on my first job ... I just liked it.\"\n\nStuart Scott was diagnosed with cancer in November 2007 and dealt with recurring bouts of the disease. Courtesy ESPN\n\nHis career path took him from Florence to Raleigh, North Carolina, to Orlando, Florida, and in his pre-ESPN clips, you can feel his energy, hear his music and sense his on-camera charisma. At WESH, the NBC affiliate in Orlando, he first met ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, who was beginning his own career. Says Ramsey, \"You knew the second he walked in the door that it was a pit stop, and that he was gonna be this big star somewhere someday. He went out and did a piece on the rodeo, and he nailed it just like he would nail the NBA Finals for ESPN.\"\n\nHe first met ESPN anchor Chris Berman in Tampa, Florida. \"He stuck out his hand and said, 'One day I look forward to working with you,'\" Berman said. \"And I said, 'Well, I tell you what, we'll save you a seat.' And I'm really thrilled that he was right on. [Later] I said, 'Stu, maybe you were the Swami.'\"\n\nThe person most responsible for bringing Stuart to Bristol was Al Jaffe, ESPN's vice president for talent, who was looking for sportscasters who might appeal to a younger audience for ESPN2. \"One of the producers on a story we were doing on the Orlando Magic told me about this young guy he really liked. I followed up and found out that Stuart's contract was up soon. He sent me a tape, and even then, he had an amazing presence -- I felt the viewer would sit up and take notice when he was on the air.\"\n\nHis first real ESPN assignments were for \"SportsSmash,\" a short sportscast twice an hour on ESPN2's \"SportsNight\" program. When Keith Olbermann graduated from \"SportsNight\" to ESPN's \"SportsCenter,\" Stuart took his place in the anchor chair. \"He was like a ball of fire walking in the door,\" says ESPN senior vice president Mark Gross, a coordinating producer at the time. \"I had never met anybody like Stuart Scott.\""}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/stuart-scott-49535.php", "page_content": "While in college, he played wide receiver and defensive back on the club football team, joined Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and became a part of the student radio station, WXYC.\n\nWhile in high school, he took interest in athletics and ran tracks along with playing football.

He was 49 years old. The sportscaster has been part of the ESPN family for 21 years, and over the course of his career, became one of the most recognizable and influential individuals in the industry, making phrases like his trademark \"Boo-ya\" and \"As cool as the other side of the pillow\" common household remarks. In a statement, ESPN president John Skipper said, \"ESPN and everyone in the sports world have lost a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure in Stuart Scott.\"\n\nSince joining ESPN in 1993, Scott quickly moved up the ranks on the sports channel, anchoring the network's signature 11 pm edition of SportsCenter, and becoming the very face of late night sportscasting. His talent and dedication soon landed him a bevy of coverage opportunities with the NFL and NBA, and has covered effectively every single major sporting event, including the NBA Finals, Super Bowl, Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series, and the NCAA Final Four. Scott redefined sports coverage, especially as an African American anchor in the early '90s, and as ESPN director of news Vince Doria said, \"There were successful African-American sportscasters at the time, but Stuart spoke a much different language... that appealed to a young demographic, particularly a young African-American demographic.\"\n\nIsaac Brekken/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nESPN senior vice president Mark Gross said, \"I had never met anybody like Stuart Scott.\"\n\nNot only was his presence inside the studio and as a host positively magnetic, his ability to take a few hits and make fun of himself also endeared him to audiences across the country. There was the time he was hit in the eye while attempting to catch a pass at a New York Jets mini-camp, which ended up requiring surgery that put him out of commission for a few months. And there were also his duets with co-host Rich Eisen on the 1 am edition of SportsCenter. Eisen, who now anchors the NFL Network, told ESPN,\n\nWho would have thought the perfect guy for me, a Jewish kid from Staten Island, would be an African-American guy with North Carolina roots? Sometimes neither one of us knew who the other was talking about, but it worked. It was always a trip doing a 'SportsCenter' with Stuart.\n\nBut most important of all, perhaps, was Scott's tangible survivor spirit, the one that allowed him to carry on even after an emergency appendectomy during his November 26, 2007 coverage of a \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Steelers and the Dolphins first revealed a cancerous mass that would require further surgery. His lengthy battle with cancer has played out in the public eye for the last eight years, and Scott has remained a beacon of hope and inspiration for survivors everywhere.\n\nLeon Bennett/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nAs of March 2014, Scott had undergone 58 infusions of chemotherapy, none of which had fully eradicated the cancer that first struck in 2007. And even as the disease progressed, Scott never allowed it to interrupt his career or his life. Speaking with the New York Times, Scott said,\n\nI never ask what stage I\u2019m in. I haven\u2019t wanted to know. It won\u2019t change anything to me. All I know is that it would cause more worry and a higher degree of freakout. Stage 1, 2 or 8, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m trying to fight it the best I can.\n\nScott expressed these sentiments in his phenomenal ESPYs award speech just six months before he died, speaking words of wisdom that have echoed throughout a multiplicity of communities. Said Scott,\n\nWhen you die it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live \u2026 Fight like hell. And when you get too tired to fight, then lay down and rest and let somebody else fight for you \u2026 I can\u2019t do this \u2018Don\u2019t Give Up\u2019 thing all by myself.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nKey to his fight were his daughters Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 14, who Scott described as his two crowning achievements. During his ESPYs speech, the anchor said, \"The best thing I have ever done, the best thing I will ever do, is be a dad to Taelor and Sydni. Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing here on this stage tonight because of you.\"\n\nThe sports world has lost one of its most incredible sportscasters, and the world has lost one of its most inspiring souls with the passage of Mr. Scott.\n\nImages: Getty Images (3)"}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/espn-anchor-stuart-scotts-rare-cancer/", "page_content": "ESPN sportscaster Stuart Scott was known for his charismatic coverage of the NFL and NBA. But even while keeping millions of sports fans happy, Scott was battling a rare and often deadly type of cancer.\n\nOn Sunday, Scott lost a long battle with appendiceal cancer. Cancer of the appendix is so rare that the American Cancer Society doesn't currently put out estimates on how often it happens and death rates for the disease.\n\nThe appendix is a small tube-shaped organ that measures about four inches and is attached to the intestines. Because the appendix is attached the colon it is classified as a type of colorectal cancer. According to some estimates, fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed each year with this type of cancer.\n\nAccording to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database program of the National Cancer Institute, incidence rates of this type of cancer have doubled since the mid-1990s, but this may be due to improved detection and earlier diagnosis of patients.\n\nIn 2007, Scott began experiencing stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital, where he underwent an emergency appendectomy and was diagnosed with the disease. Frequently, a ruptured appendix is one of the first symptoms patients with this type of cancer experience. Scott also had surgery to remove a portion of his colon and several lymph nodes. His treatment appeared to be a success, but the cancer returned in 2011, and then again in 2013.\n\n\"It recently came back a third time,\" Scott told Men's Health magazine in 2013. \"To be honest, I'm scared. I've always been afraid of cancer, but this time feels different. My confidence is shaken. I'm a little more vulnerable, a little more aware of my mortality, a little more uncertain about my future.\"\n\nAlthough Scott never disclosed his exact diagnosis, he did share that he was on a type of chemotherapy known as Fluorouracil or 5-FU, which is typically used to treat appendiceal adenocarinoma. This type of tumor arises from the epithelial cells of the appendix, according to the PMP Research Foundation.\n\nIf caught early, appendiceal cancer is often highly treatable. According to MD Anderson Cancer Center, 85 percent of patients with carcinoid tumors of the appendix have a five-year survival rate. The prognosis of a patient depends largely on the size of the tumor, as well as whether the cancer has spread. Appendix tumors that are two centimeters or smaller in diameter are less likely to spread than those larger than two and a half centimeters, which require more aggressive treatment.\n\nTreatment for this type of cancer includes removal of small carcinoids, a type of slow-growing neuroendocrine tumor. Sometimes doctors will remove all organs surrounding the appendix, a procedure known as debulking surgery, to prevent the cancer from returning. This is typically recommended for patients in the later stage of the disease. In many instances, doctors will also infuse chemotherapy directly into the space that separates the organs in the abdominal cavity from the abdominal wall. A patient is likely to also receive additional chemotherapy over a longer course of time.\n\nResearchers don't know what factors may put a person at higher risk for appendiceal cancer. Most likely, in most cases it is simply a bad hand of genetics.\n\nStuart is not the first public figure to be lost to this disease. In 1993, beloved actress Audrey Hepburn died at age 63 after a battle with appendiceal cancer."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/news-who-stuart-scott-late-sportscaster-ufc-paid-tribute-espn-s-v-week", "page_content": "Stuart Scott was an American sportscaster who tragically passed away on January 4, 2015, due to appendiceal cancer.

But even while keeping millions of sports fans happy, Scott was battling a rare and often deadly type of cancer.\n\nOn Sunday, Scott lost a long battle with appendiceal cancer. Cancer of the appendix is so rare that the American Cancer Society doesn't currently put out estimates on how often it happens and death rates for the disease.\n\nThe appendix is a small tube-shaped organ that measures about four inches and is attached to the intestines. Because the appendix is attached the colon it is classified as a type of colorectal cancer. According to some estimates, fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed each year with this type of cancer.\n\nAccording to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database program of the National Cancer Institute, incidence rates of this type of cancer have doubled since the mid-1990s, but this may be due to improved detection and earlier diagnosis of patients.\n\nIn 2007, Scott began experiencing stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital, where he underwent an emergency appendectomy and was diagnosed with the disease. Frequently, a ruptured appendix is one of the first symptoms patients with this type of cancer experience. Scott also had surgery to remove a portion of his colon and several lymph nodes. His treatment appeared to be a success, but the cancer returned in 2011, and then again in 2013.\n\n\"It recently came back a third time,\" Scott told Men's Health magazine in 2013. \"To be honest, I'm scared. I've always been afraid of cancer, but this time feels different. My confidence is shaken. I'm a little more vulnerable, a little more aware of my mortality, a little more uncertain about my future.\"\n\nAlthough Scott never disclosed his exact diagnosis, he did share that he was on a type of chemotherapy known as Fluorouracil or 5-FU, which is typically used to treat appendiceal adenocarinoma. This type of tumor arises from the epithelial cells of the appendix, according to the PMP Research Foundation.\n\nIf caught early, appendiceal cancer is often highly treatable. According to MD Anderson Cancer Center, 85 percent of patients with carcinoid tumors of the appendix have a five-year survival rate. The prognosis of a patient depends largely on the size of the tumor, as well as whether the cancer has spread. Appendix tumors that are two centimeters or smaller in diameter are less likely to spread than those larger than two and a half centimeters, which require more aggressive treatment.\n\nTreatment for this type of cancer includes removal of small carcinoids, a type of slow-growing neuroendocrine tumor. Sometimes doctors will remove all organs surrounding the appendix, a procedure known as debulking surgery, to prevent the cancer from returning. This is typically recommended for patients in the later stage of the disease. In many instances, doctors will also infuse chemotherapy directly into the space that separates the organs in the abdominal cavity from the abdominal wall. A patient is likely to also receive additional chemotherapy over a longer course of time.\n\nResearchers don't know what factors may put a person at higher risk for appendiceal cancer. Most likely, in most cases it is simply a bad hand of genetics.\n\nStuart is not the first public figure to be lost to this disease. In 1993, beloved actress Audrey Hepburn died at age 63 after a battle with appendiceal cancer."}, {"url": "https://www.eonline.com/news/611028/stuart-scott-dies-espn-anchor-was-49-battled-cancer", "page_content": "Popular ESPN anchor Stuart Scott has died at age 49 following a long battle with cancer.\n\nThe Chicago-born sports personality passed away on Sunday morning, the cable channel announced.\n\nScott is survived by his parents, a brother and two sisters, girlfriend Kristin Spodobalski, ex-wife Kim Scott and daughters Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15.\n\n\"The best thing I have ever done, the best thing I will ever do, is be a dad to Taelor and Sydni,\" he said last July at the 2014 ESPYS, where he was given the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance. \"I can't ever give up because I can't leave my daughters.\"\n\n\"Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express,\" he said. \"You two are my heartbeat.
