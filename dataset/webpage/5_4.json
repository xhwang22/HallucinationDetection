Dananjaya is the latest one in that list. Having not played a first class game, Dananjaya was picked for the 2012 T20 WC. Mahela Jayawardene was so impressed by the youngsters control of the googly, carrom ball, leg-break, doosra and off-spinner, that he convinced the selectors to fast track him to the national side. Dananjaya did not disappoint as he played 4 games and picked up 7 wickets at an average of 13 and an economy under 7.\n\n\n\nHowever, he only played one more game before being dropped. He was also overlooked for the 2014 T20 WC in Bangladesh. With the success in the T20 WC, Dananjaya was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings during the 2013 edition for $20,000.\n\n\n\nRevolving doors of Sri Lankan cricket meant that Dhananjaya could never settle himself in the national team. Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans. It wasn't an one-off achievement, two days after his marriage, he claimed six for 54 against India, thereby cementing his place for the immediate future."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/52710904", "page_content": "The Indian Premier League is the richest and most glamorous tournament in world cricket.\n\nBut who are the best Twenty20 cricketers to have played in the IPL since it launched in 2008?\n\nBBC Sport and The Doosra podcast asked you to pick your all-time IPL XI.\n\nAlmost 25,000 of you voted - and the results are in.

By the time I reached the end of my article, he had registered a six-wicket haul in the match. If that does not describe the voodoo Dananjaya hid in his Arsenal, I don't know what will.\n\n2nd ODI, second innings, and countless surprises...Sri Lanka finally served their revenge dish to their guests.\n\nIt all looked fine for the Men in Blue in the beginning. Repetitive may be the right word but Dananjaya carried a magic wand to change the fortunes of this match. His six-wicket haul snatched the match away from the plates of the Indian team while the latter struggled to recover from Dananjaya's bowling assault.\n\nFirst, he hunted Rohit Sharma who looked in form after a long time. He scored 54 runs after which he was sent back to the pavilion by Dananjaya. He was cruising, was Rohit, and for some reason decided to get down low to a full ball in order to sweep only to miss the ball which crashed into his pads.\n\nSharma was quite confident about not being out and he went for a review upon Dhawan's insistence. Little did they know that the ball that Sharma's tried to sweep had landed him in deep trouble. Wicket number 1...India's opening partnership had been snapped for 109, a Sri Lankan bowler had picked the first wicket of this series. No worries India thought, we have the belief, Dananjaya retorted!\n\nIn the sixteenth over, Shikhar Dhawan was dismissed for 49 by Siriwardana and Dananjaya returned with the ball in the next over.\n\nWith Kedhar Jadhav on strike in the 17th over and Dananjaya on a roll, he delivered a googly which skidded across the surface, kissed the inside edge of his bat and was headed for the middle stump. Bamboozled, Jadhav had a puzzling look and meandered back... not the match, it came roaring back to life.\n\nIndian fans' eyebrows were not yet furrowed, but drips of sweat were forming!\n\nAs Virat Kohli walked in to bat, he smashed Dananjaya's first ball for a splendid boundary. Yeah, normalcy folks, the king of chases is in, calm down. Just when everyone thought the captain will let the hosts know who dominates the game, Dananjaya decided to make up for his previous ball.\n\nHe delivered a googly which was fullish, Kohli moved his front foot out of the way to play his whiplash cover drive, the ball deviated, missed that broad bat and smashed the stumps. Boom... the crowd were baying for Kohli's blood, Kohli himself was baying for the solace of the dressing room. He stood there perplexed, seeking answers from KL Rahul as the Sri Lankan team came together for a wild celebration. Energy simmering all over the place, the ghosts of the series slowly fading away!\n\nIt was Rahul's turn next. Another googly and another batsman bowled. The ball tricked Rahul as it gently touched the inside edge and went past the pads to hit the wickets.\n\nHardik Pandya looked confident at the crease being well accompanied by MS Dhoni. Unfortunately, Pandya was out for a duck today. As he advanced to hit the ball, it betrayed him smartly after brushing against his bat and landing directly in Niroshan Dickwella's hands.\n\nAs Pandya started to walk back, Dhoni was seen contemplating the measures to revive team India. Axar Patel walked in to bat.\n\nDananjaya delivered a fantastic ball and Patel misjudged it. No one was even surprised, not anymore. He moved forward to defend but the ball sneaked its way around his bat and went straight to the stumps. There was no way to cancel out that splendid dismissal.\n\nTeam India is determined to make a comeback in this match while they hope to veil the over-confidence they bore ahead of this encounter. As Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are struggling to calculate their moves, faces look grieved in the Indian dressing room. Sri Lankan fans are seen dancing to the rhythm of their heartbeat and the hosts are hailing their new hero.\n\nFun fact, Dananjaya got married yesterday. I was even prepared to flood my social media articles with his pictures but I guess that will be possible once I recover from this spell. In my defence, I wasn't prepared for this just like the other 1.3 billion Indian fans (and probably the entire island of Sri Lanka).\n\nDespite the results of this match, one cannot overlook the spell that left the entire cricket world spellbound.\n\nAkila Dananjaya, take a bow, he also took the man of the match, some solace after all!\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.statista.com/statistics/822635/india-players-with-most-wickets-in-ipl/", "page_content": "Strategy and business building for the data-driven economy:\n\nThe best of the best: the portal for top lists & rankings:\n\nGet quick analyses with our professional research service\n\nDirectly accessible data for 170 industries from 50 countries and over 1 million facts:\n\nDetailed information for 35,000+ online stores and marketplaces\n\nBusiness information on 70m+ public and private companies\n\nInsights on consumer attitudes and behavior worldwide\n\nMarket forecast and expert KPIs for 1000+ markets in 190+ countries & territories\n\nAll key figures about countries and regions\n\nDetailed information about political and social topics\n\nConsumer and brand insights and preferences in various industries\n\nKey figures and rankings about companies and products\n\nIndustry and market insights and forecasts\n\nOverview and forecasts on trending topics\n\nSporting goods industry in the U.S. - statistics & facts\n\nAverage ticket price in the NFL by team 2021\n\nMost Super Bowl wins by NFL team 1967-2023\n\nPlease create an employee account to be able to mark statistics as favorites.

In keeping with the prevalent conditions in the continent, spinners dominate the list, with Lasith Malinga the only fast-bowler in the top five. While no Indian figures even in the top 10, Ravindra Jadeja is ninth on the list with 22 wickets.\n\nLasith Malinga (33 wickets)\n\nFormer Sri Lanka pacer Lasith Malinga is the leading wicket-taker in the Asia Cup with 33 wickets in 15 innings. His staggering numbers include two four-fers and three five-wicket hauls. His best figures of five for 34 came against Pakistan in the 2010 edition. His two other five-wicket hauls were also against Pakistan, both in the 2014 tournament where he picked 11 wickets in four matches to help Sri Lanka clinch the title.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 15 33 4.70 18.84 5/34 2/3\n\nMuttiah Muralitharan (30 wickets)\n\nLegendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is hot on the heels of his compatriot Malinga with 30 wickets in 24 innings at the continental event. His most successful outing was in 2008, when he scalped 11 wickets in five matches, which included a five for 31 against Bangladesh. However, Muralitharan has had limited success against stronger oppositions such as India and Pakistan, picking a combined 10 wickets in 16 matches against the two teams.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 24 30 3.75 28.83 5/31 1/1\n\nAjantha Mendis (26 wickets)\n\nThird on the list is yet another Sri Lankan Ajantha Mendis, with a staggering haul of 26 wickets in just eight matches in the Asia Cup. The wily off-spinner turned heads when he wrecked India in the 2008 Asia Cup final in Karachi with figures of six for 13. The Men in Blue had no response to the then 23-year-old\u2019s mystery and capitulated for 173 in response to 273. Earlier in the tournament, Mendis had tormented UAE and Pakistan with figures of five for 22 and four for 47, respectively and ended the 2008 edition with 17 wickets in five matches at an astounding average of 8.52.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 8 26 3.98 10.42 6/13 2/2\n\nSaeed Ajmal (25 wickets)\n\nYet another off-spinner, Saeed Ajmal, makes it to the list of the top wicket-takers at the Asia Cup. With 25 wickets in 12 innings under his belt, Ajmal is Pakistan\u2019s most successful bowler in the tournament. He had a dream run in the 2014 edition, where he scalped 11 wickets in five matches in Pakistan\u2019s march to the final. Ajmal also helped Pakistan clinch the title in 2012, contributing with eight wickets in four matches.\n\nInnings Wickets Economy Rate Average Best 4/5 12 25 4.21 19.40 3/26 0/0\n\nShakib Al Hasan (24 wickets)\n\nAll-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who will lead Bangladesh in Asia Cup 2022, is also his country\u2019s highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 24 scalps in 18 innings. His most fruitful outing was at the last edition in 2018, where he picked seven wickets in four matches, including four for 42 against Afghanistan in the group stage. Other than topping the bowling charts for Bangladesh, Shakib is also third on the list of the highest run-scorers for the Tigers in the tournament with 479 runs at an average of 28.17."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/leading-wicket-takers-during-each-cycle-after-mega-auctions-in-ipl", "page_content": "The Indian Premier League has completed a decade and has established itself as a big brand. There have been several spectacular performances from the players, be it a 17-year old Washington Sundar in 2017 or a veteran like Pravin Tambe who came into limelight making his IPL debut at the age of 41 and bagging a hat-trick in 2014 edition. The domestic players have benefitted immensely playing with and against the stalwarts of the game in front of big crowds at every venue.\n\nThe slam-bang nature of the T20 format made the experts, as well as the audience, speculate that the batsmen will be the only bosses. However, the bowlers have managed to carve their own niche with their different variations and a great control over their skills. In this article, let us have a look at the leading wicket-takers during each cycle after the mega auctions in 2008, 2011 and 2014.\n\n#1 Season one to Season three: Rudra Pratap Singh\n\nRudra Pratap Singh was the leading wicket-taker during the first three seasons of the Indian Premier League. He picked 51 wickets during the period with an average of 24.09 and a good strike rate of 18.00. The left-arm pacer had a decent economy rate of 8.03 despite bowling prominently in the Powerplay and the slog phase of the game.\n\nRP contributed immensely to the Deccan Chargers\u2019 triumph in the 2009 edition of the tournament winning the Purple Cap with 23 wickets at an impressive economy rate of 6.98 and an average of just 18.13. The spell of 4/22 against Kolkata Knight Riders and an economical spell of 4-0-16-1 in the final while defending a low score were his noteworthy performances. His wicket tally during the three seasons was 15, 23 and 13 respectively. The great show in the 2009 season enabled RP Singh to make a comeback to the Indian squad for the World T20 that followed.\n\nTop 5 wicket-takers during the season 1 to season 3 of the IPL\n\n#2 Season four to Season six: Lasith Malinga\n\nLasith Malinga is the leading wicket-taker of the league currently\n\nLasith Malinga was the highest wicket-taker in the next three seasons of the Indian Premier League with 70 wickets in just 47 matches at an impressive average of just 17.04. He had a great strike rate of 15.75 to go along with an economy rate of just 6.48 thus proving to be a very reliable bowler for the Mumbai Indians team.\n\nMalinga was particularly at his best during the 2011 season winning the Purple Cap with 28 wickets at an average of 13.39 and a miserly economy rate of just 5.95. He bowled most dot balls during the season with 183 dot deliveries. Malinga\u2019s wicket tally during the three seasons was 28, 22 and 20 respectively. The Sri Lankan pacer delivered some stupendous performances like 5/13 against Delhi Daredevils in 2011 and spells of 3/9 and 4/16 against Deccan Chargers in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In the final of the 2013 season, while defending a low total, he picked the important wickets of Michael Hussey and Suresh Raina in the first over of the innings to set the foundation of Mumbai\u2019s victory.\n\nTop 5 wicket-takers during the season 4 to season 6 of the IPL\n\n#3 Season seven to Season ten: Bhuvneshwar Kumar\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar won the Purple Cap for two consecutive seasons in 2016 and 2017\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar topped the wicket-tally during the next four seasons of the Indian Premier League. The Sunrisers Hyderabad pacer snared 87 wickets at an impressive average of 18.62 and a strike rate of just 15.39. Bhuvi\u2019s economy rate of 7.25 was also pretty exemplary considering that he operated mostly during the initial overs and during the slog phase. He won the Purple Cap for the two consecutive seasons in 2016 and 2017 and was instrumental in Sunrisers Hyderabad winning the title in 2016. He had a high dot ball percentage of 41.15 during the four editions and bowled the most dots in 2016, with 156 dot deliveries.\n\nBhuvneshwar\u2019s wicket tally during the four seasons was 20, 18, 23 and 26 respectively. The spells of 4/14 against Rajasthan Royals in 2014, 4/29 against Gujarat Lions in 2016 and 5/19 against Kings XI Punjab in 2017 were his best performances. The great bowling efforts in the tournament have enabled him to establish himself as a premier bowler for India across all formats.\n\nTop 5 wicket-takers during the season 7 to season 10 of the IPL\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ipl/ipl-news/bravo-most-wickets-in-ipl-history-malinga-indian-premier-league-2022-cricket-news/article38464603.ece", "page_content": "West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo became the leading wicket-taker in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) with his 171st scalp against Lucknow Super Giants at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday.\n\nHe reached the landmark with the wicket of Deepapk Hooda.
