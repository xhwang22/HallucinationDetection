Unfortunately, when she was unexpectedly cast in the real-life role of jilted girlfriend of NFL heartthrob Tom Brady, Moynahan found her professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 overshadowed by cheap tabloid gossip. A natural beauty, she began her career as a model, appearing in a number of fashion magazines before making the transition to acting. Following her debut on \"Sex and the City\" Moynahan found herself dancing on a bar in \"Coyote Ugly\" (2000), before moving on to a series of high-profile but unchallenging roles - usually as the girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e/wife of the film's lead - in vehicles like \"Serendipity\" (2001), \"The Sum of All Fears\" (2002) and \"Lord of War\" (2005). With the news that football hero Brady had left her for supermodel Gisele Bundchen, followed by the revelation that the now single actress was pregnant with Brady's child, Moynahan found herself struggling to maintain a private life and a professional career in the midst of media firestorm. Although the press continued to feed on the scandal whenever the opportunity arose, Moynahan gradually began to refocus on her work again, with respectable turns in films like \"Ramona and Beezus\" (2010), as a cast member on the police procedural \"Blue Bloods\" (CBS, 2010- ), and a starring role in the apocalyptic science fiction action adventure \"Battle: Los Angeles\" (2011).
