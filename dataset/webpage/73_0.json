Loder (7 April 1946 \u2013 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of EXIT and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue.[1] He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass and Crass Records, and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\".[2]\n\nQuick facts: John Loder, Born, Died, Occupation(s)... \u25bc\n\nMusical artist\n\nLoder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970 he had joined EXIT, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilising a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of EXIT in 1974.[1] Loder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted.[1]\n\nWhen Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records, Loder set up Southern Records.[1]\n\nLoder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them the Jesus and Mary Chain (for whom he engineered the recordings of the Psychocandy album), Big Black (Songs About Fucking), PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi (mastering the vinyl edition of 2001's The Argument), Ministry and Shellac (mastering 2000's 1000 Hurts). American musician and recording engineer Steve Albini (member of Big Black and Shellac), has spoken highly of Loder and described him as a critical influence:\n\nWhen I was in Big Black we did a session with him, and I thought he was a terrific engineer. He showed me the potential for getting the most out of the equipment without making the equipment the focus of attention. He knew how to do things quickly and with great sensitivity to the band, and had a complete working knowledge of his equipment. In any situation he could snap his fingers and do the right thing, because he knew exactly how things worked and what to do. [3]\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show Snub TV, which after first being syndicated nationwide in the US, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries.\n\nLoder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting.\n\nLoder died of a brain tumour on 12 August 2005, aged 59.[4][2]"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/19/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "page_content": "I first met the sound engineer and record producer John Loder in about 1968. He was on an acid trip and seemed to be talking out of the top of his head. The next time I met him he was straight and made a lot more sense. We soon found that we shared. a common interest in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane, and KarlHeinz Stockhausen. When we got bored with them, we would play birdsong forwards and Bach backwards.\n\nBy 1970 John, who has died aged 59, and I were working together in Exit, an avant-garde outfit. I was the percussionist, playing an amplified bicycle wheel, and he was using an ancient one-track tape-recorder discovered in a friend's attic; primitive, but it was the beginning of what was to become John's lifework.\n\nFinanced by a brief spell as a mini-cab driver, by 1972 John had cobbled together an innovatory multi-track sound system, first used as a part of the wildly ambitious avant-garde International Carnival of Experimental Sound (ICES 72). By the time Exit disbanded in 1974, John had accumulated enough equipment to build a recording studio in the small garage of his north London home.\n\nDuring the next three years we lost touch, but by 1977 he was recording advertising jingles - which he didn't enjoy - and I had cofounded the band Crass, which I enjoyed thoroughly. From then on the ball started to rock and roll. As \"the ninth member of the band\", John became our recording engineer and financial manager: the music was bad and so was the money, but it was fun.\n\nWithin a couple of years Crass albums were dominating the alternative charts, and John's garage had become Southern Studios. In 1979 we created Crass Records and, despite marketing our first single for 45p against John's warning that every copy would lose us 3p, we made money.\n\nWe were in business, and from the outset it was clear that the music industry was not well pleased; John was a maverick, a DIY champion who didn't play the game. In his philosophy, beautiful came before big: to the last he drove a wreck of an old van, and never considered moving his garage studio to a more \"desirable\" location.\n\nLikewise, attempts to buy him out failed, just as media attempts to denigrate Crass had no effect on its growing popularity. Crass Records became the label that every aspiring punk band looked to, Southern Studios their destination, and John their engineer of choice.\n\nThroughout that time, with scores of bands being released on the label, no contract was ever signed and no paperwork ever thrust in faces. It was all done on trust, a principle that John held dear throughout his life. And it was John's managerial, production and engineering skills which were to assist the likes of Crass, Bjork, Chumbawamba, Fugazi, Shellac, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Slint and Babes In Toyland into the public domain,\n\nBorn near Plymouth, educated at a boarding school that he didn't like, John studied electrical engineering at London's City University. Details of his early history are brief because he didn't like talking about himself. John was one of those people who appears to have been born on their 20th birthday.\n\nFor every band that made it on to Crass Records, 10 were turned away. Crass's ideology was uncompromising and, as John felt, many good bands were losing the chance of public exposure. As a response, in partnership with his artist wife Sue, he created several labels and Southern Distribution, to ensure that they found a market. Aided by a small team to whom John was devoted, Southern grew into the international force that it is today.\n\nJohn resisted many attempts over the years to rein him in; as other independents collapsed, Southern survived, as majors conglomerated and became increasingly bland, Southern remained a vibrant voice in the wilderness. When bands got too big for their boots or managers began to burn his ears, John would suggest they go elsewhere. In the truest sense, Southern was a cottage industry, it placed people before profit.\n\nMedia requests for interviews with John always drew a blank, he displayed a reticence which extended even to his closest friends. For that reason very few people were aware that during the last 18 months he had been battling with a brain tumour which finally killed him.\n\nBut just as John's studio has become legendary, so has his insistence that quality of product should come before quantity: his angle, small is beautiful, was the big idea.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, and daughter, Natasha.\n\n\u00b7 John Loder, record producer, born April 7 1946; died August 12 2005."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-loder-mn0000238526/biography", "page_content": "Producer and engineer John Loder founded the landmark Southern Studios and its accompanying record label and distribution network, all potent forces in the emergence and continued longevity of post-punk. Born April 7, 1946, outside of Plymouth, England, Loder briefly studied electrical engineering at London's City University, but music was his obsession -- in particular experimental and avant-garde recordings -- and in 1970 he began collaborating with the avant outfit Exit. With earnings saved from a short tenure driving a taxi, by 1972 Loder had assembled his own multi-track sound system, and two years later opened a recording studio in the garage of his North London home.\n\nHe spent the mid-'70s writing and recording advertising jingles, but in 1977 crossed paths with fellow Exit alum Penny Rimbaud, who in the interim co-founded the punk group Crass. Soon Loder was installed as the band's recording engineer and financial adviser, and with a few additional improvements his garage was officially opened as Southern Studios. With Rimbaud, he also founded Crass Records, and the staunch D.I.Y. ethics of studio and label alike -- no contracts or paperwork, just handshake deals and mutual trust -- earned enormous respect from punk artists and fans.\n\nOver the years to follow, Loder created several additional labels and also Southern Distribution to ensure a home and retail channels for worthy bands that might otherwise go unnoticed. His production and managerial portfolio ultimately swelled to include a who's who of underground acts including Bj\u00f6rk, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Fugazi, Shellac, and Slint, and despite the music industry's trend towards consolidation, the Southern empire remained as fiercely independent as its owner.
