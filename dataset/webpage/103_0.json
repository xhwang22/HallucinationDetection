A prolific session musician, he is probably best known for playing with The Who (following the death of founding member John Entwistle[2]) from 2002 to 2016, D'angelo from 1996 to present, and the John Mayer Trio from 2005 to present.\n\nPalladino plays a late-1970s, fretless, Music Man StingRay bass guitar, a fretted Fender Precision, and a Jaguar bass. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Cardiff to an Italian father from Campobasso and a Welsh mother,[4] Palladino began playing electric guitar at age 14 and bass guitar at 17. He bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae with a rock and roll backbeat.[5]\n\nCareer\n\nPalladino was drawn to Motown and jazz at an early age. He attended Catholic school and took classical guitar lessons. He liked Led Zeppelin and Yes and started a rock band.[6]\n\nIn 1982, Palladino recorded with Gary Numan on the album I, Assassin. The producer of the album asked him to contribute to Paul Young's debut album. Young's cover version of \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\" by Marvin Gaye became a hit in Europe,and subsequently joined Young's band the Royal family and Palladino received offers to record with Joan Armatrading, Go West, and David Gilmour. He cites as early influences James Jamerson, Danny Thompson, and Norman Watt-Roy and also admires Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins, Larry Graham, Michael Henderson, Anthony Jackson, Marcus Miller, and Rocco Prestia.[7]\n\nIn 1983, he joined The Law with Paul Rodgers, formerly of Bad Company, and drummer Kenney Jones, who succeeded Keith Moon in The Who after Moon died, and recorded the album The Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino alternated between fretless bass and fretted and 4-string and 6-string bass. He played with Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Elton John, and Eric Clapton.\n\nHe played on Mike Lindup's first solo album, Changes with Dominic Miller on guitar and Manu Katch\u00e9 on drums.[8]\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft of The Verve on Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody.[9]\n\nThe Who's bassist John Entwistle died the night before the start of their first tour in two years. Palladino became the band's bass guitarist on tour. In 2006, he joined the remaining band members on their first album in twenty-four years, Endless Wire. He played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show in 2010 with Simon Townshend on guitar, Zak Starkey on drums, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick on keyboards. In 2012, he toured with The Who on their Quadrophenia revival.\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session musicians, which blossomed into a friendship. Jordan credits Palladino's apparent ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an embrace of genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he had planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January 2005 to perform Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope for victims of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix song \"Bold as Love\", the three found a chemistry together. They recorded an album and toured as a trio.[10]\n\nThey released the album Try!, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover versions of \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" by Jimi Hendrix and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's album Heavier Things, and new songs by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs: \"Good Love Is on the Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\".[3] Palladino appeared on Mayer's third album Continuum, fourth album Battle Studies and seventh album The Search for Everything.\n\nIn March and April 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck and played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido. In 2009, he formed a trio with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips.\n\nHe played with Simon and Garfunkel on their Old Friends reunion tour.[10]\n\nIn January 2011, he entered the studio with D'Angelo to finish recording Black Messiah.[11]\n\nIn 2013 he played on the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks and was a member of the touring band.\n\nTechnique\n\nPalladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass on many 1980s albums. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\", Palladino preferred a different sound, combining fretless tone with an octaver effect, and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines, and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument. Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's Wherever I Lay My Hat. His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nSignature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modelled after two of Palladino's Fender Precision Basses. The body features faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint, based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass, while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fretboard are based on his 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.[12]\n\nPersonal life\n\nPino married Marilyn (Maz) Roberts, a former backing singer with the Fabulous Wealthy Tarts, in 1992 in Wales. They have three children: Fabiana, Giancarla and Rocco, who are all involved in the music industry.[13]\n\nSelect discography\n\nWith Paul Young\n\n1983 No Parlez (Columbia)\n\n(Columbia) 1985 The Secret of Association (Columbia)\n\n(Columbia) 1990 Other Voices (Columbia)\n\nWith David Knopfler\n\n1983 Release (Peach Tree)\n\n(Peach Tree) 1985 Behind the Lines (Paris)\n\n(Paris) 1987 Cut the Wire (Paris)\n\nWith Don Henley\n\n1984 Building the Perfect Beast (Geffen)\n\n(Geffen) 1989 The End of the Innocence (Geffen)\n\nWith Go West\n\n1985 Go West (Chrysalis)\n\n(Chrysalis) 1987 Dancing on the Couch (Chrysalis)\n\nWith Elton John\n\n1985 Ice on Fire (Rocket/Geffen)\n\n(Rocket/Geffen) 1992 The One (Rocket/MCA)\n\nWith John Mayer\n\n2005 Try!\n\n2006 Continuum\n\n2017 The Search for Everything\n\nWith Jeff Beck\n\n1999 Who Else!

He gained fame for playing primarily rock and roll, blues rock, and rhythm and blues music, although he has been lauded for his ability to play most genres of popular music, including jazz, neo soul, and funk.\n\nHis career has spanned several ensembles, including the John Mayer Trio and The RH Factor, which he formed with jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove. He was also Pete Townshend's and Roger Daltrey's first choice to fill the position left by John Entwistle as the bassist for The Who. More recently he has recorded and toured with D'Angelo and The Vanguard.\n\nHe has played on a large number of recordings. He is known for playing a late 1970s fretless Music Man StingRay bass guitar and, later in his career, fretted Fender Precision and Jaguar basses. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.[2]\n\nCareer\n\nBorn in Cardiff to an Italian father from Campobasso,[3] Umberto Palladino and Welsh mother Ann Hazard,[4] Palladino began playing the electric guitar at age 14. By 17 he decided to play the bass guitar, and bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae within a rock and roll backbeat.[5] His first professional gig, at age 20, was at a local television station in Cardiff, where he began playing in 1978. That same year he joined Jools Holland's band and is credited on Holland's album, Jools Holland and His Millionaires. Touring with Holland to support the album gave him the opportunity to purchase his own Music Man StingRay Fretless Bass.[5] While Holland was touring with another new band, the Q-Tips, its frontman, Paul Young became acquainted with Palladino and a year later offered him a place in Paul Young's own backing band.\n\nPalladino was featured on Gary Numan's 1982 album I, Assassin, in which his fretless bass playing made a prominent contribution to the overall sound of the album. He went on to play fretless bass with a healthy number of high-profile artists that include David Gilmour, Tears for Fears, Pete Townshend, Peter Gabriel, Go West, Joan Armatrading, Phil Collins, Chaka Khan and Don Henley.[5][6]\n\nAfter Paul Young landed his own solo contract in 1982, Palladino was brought in as part of his backing band \"The Royal Family\" resulting in noticeable chart success with the No Parlez album,[5] and major hit singles both in the UK and Europe. Examples of Paul Young's newfound success were the band's cover of the Marvin Gaye classic Wherever I Lay My Hat, which reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart for three weeks in summer of 1983, and Love of the Common People. Palladino toured extensively at this time with Paul Young, remaining in the band for five years. 1983 additionally proved to be the year of another ensemble featuring Palladino, Paul Rodgers (formerly of Bad Company), drummer Kenney Jones, along with a rotating cast of other celebrity performers. The band only released one album through Atlantic, The Law, although there were enough out-takes that another bootleg-styled album followed in 1991. Sales were unremarkable, despite the names of those who recorded on the album.[2]\n\nThroughout the 1980s Palladino was noted for his R&B roots on the fretless bass, even when supporting pop and rock heavy performers. One reviewer from Bass Player magazine points to Paul Young's cover of the Bobby Womack/ Rufus tune Stop on By (on 1990s Other Voices), with its \"pre-hip-hop, swung funk groove\" as the precursor to Palladino's later neo-soul focus.[7]\n\n1990s\n\nChanges in instrument\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino began to alternate between the sounds achieved in playing the fretless bass to one with frets, as well as the 4-string and 6-string bass. At the time, he was well known within the industry for his fretless bass sound. However, now, depending on which artist he was supporting, and the song to be played, he began gravitating towards fretted bass. He was maturing as a musician, and played with artists as diverse as Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Elton John and Eric Clapton. Also in 1991 he joined Paul Rodgers (of Free, Queen + Paul Rodgers, and Bad Company fame) to form the band The Law. In the mid-1990s, Palladino played bass for The London Metropolitan orchestra during their recording of An American Symphony, soundtrack for the movie Mr Holland's Opus.\n\nIn 1990 Palladino joined Mike Lindup (founding member of Level 42) to feature on Lindup's first solo album Changes, a song album with Dominic Miller on guitar, who later went onto work with Sting; and Manu Katch\u00e9 on drums.[8]\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, he joined Manu Katch\u00e9 to form Stephan Eicher's rhythm section on three albums : Engelberg (1991), Carcassonne (1993) and 1000 vies (1996).\n\nPalladino supported Phil Collins, as a member of the house band for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, which played with Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett, among other notable performers. He later wrote that he felt privileged to have been amongst the others on stage in such an event.\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft, of The Verve, during the recording sessions of Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody.[9] Richard proved to be mightily impressed by Palladino's natural bass playing ability;[10]\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" />\n\nThis Pino Palladino, I can say a Meters record and he can play me the bass line. He can play anything. He's one of the only people in the world who can totally replicate that kind of Beach Boys/scratch/Walker Brothers bass. You can get that sound if you want it, dead on. So it was very liberating working with him.\n\nPalladino also joined Ashcroft's touring band for the singer's first major solo outing throughout 2000.[11]\n\nNeo soul\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Palladino had established himself as a busy, highly desirable bassist and a studio worker in many genres, but finally became visible to those artists who played largely left of center, and demand for his session playing grew within a different quarter. Palladino began moving from blues-rock toward neo soul projects. Palladino and Steve Jordan found themselves performing on the same session for B.B. King's 1997 duets CD Deuces Wild. It was the first time soul singer D'Angelo first heard Palladino, who had just switched from a signature sound fretless bass sound to that of performing with fretted basses. The result was an invitation to \"use Pino's big, behind-the-beat bass to help cast a neo-soul spell on his Grammy Award-winning Voodoo album\".[12] It would not be his only uncredited Grammy performance.\n\nAs the word spread throughout the genre, Palladino found an increasing demand. Examples of his bass work in this genre (in addition to D'Angelo) include much of the Soulquarians' production discography, such as Mama's Gun, and Penitentiary Philosophy found on Erykah Badu's 2000 CD.[7] Other albums using Palladino's sound include 1st Born Second for Bilal, Like Water for Chocolate and Electric Circus for Common. Palladino has been described by Steve Jordan, who got his own professional start playing the drums for Stevie Wonder, as having a \"deep funk\" side and a \"melodic\" side. Palladino admits that \"Of all my influences, I would say what's always in the back of my mind is early Stevie Wonder, like Talking Book and Innervisions; that music is really in my blood.\"[13]\n\n2000s\n\nThe Who\n\nFollowing the death of The Who's bassist John Entwistle the night before the band were to kick off their first tour in two years, Palladino was their first choice to become the band's full-time touring bass guitarist, and by 2006, he was invited to join the remaining original band members in recording their first album in twenty-four years. Pete Townshend, the band's composer, recorded the bassline on the majority of the songs to get the effect he himself wanted, with Palladino doing so on the other six of them. Released in October 2006, the album was named Endless Wire.\n\nPalladino also played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show, in February 2010, alongside other backing artists: Simon Townshend on guitar, Zak Starkey, drums and percussion, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, on keyboard instruments.\n\nPaul Simon\n\nIn 2003, Palladino intended to go down to see his old friend Paul Simon and meet Brian Eno for the first time. He was asked to record with them, and had to borrow a bass guitar to play. The result was that he played with Simon and Garfunkel on their Old Friends reunion tour and in an interview with Bass Player Magazine he mentions drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Jamey Haddad \"had laid down some great grooves for me to add bass\". He had kept the recordings, and by the time that he appeared on the Old Friends: Live on Stage CD and DVD from the tour, he was able to use some of the material.[13] He played on Paul Simon's 2006 release, Surprise.\n\nOther appearances\n\nPalladino has toured in the backing band for Joe Walsh. In 2004, he appeared to be playing with Gary Moore at the Wembley Arena. He also contributed to the recording process of Nine Inch Nails' 2013 release Hesitation Marks, and also began touring with the band for their Tension 2013 tour. Trent Reznor said he is \"probably the best bass player in the world.\"[14]\n\nEmergence of the John Mayer Trio\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session players on many occasions, which blossomed into a friendship. Jordan credits Palladino's apparent ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an embrace of genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he'd planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January 2005 to perform a benefit concert on a NBC sponsored telethon Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope to raise funds and public awareness benefiting victims in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work, and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix classic, \"Bold as Love\", the three found a chemistry together and set about their schedules to record a CD and a tour as a power trio.[13] They released the album Try!, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover songs, such as Jimi Hendrix's \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's release Heavier Things, as well as new songs written by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs on the album: \"Good Love Is On The Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\".[2] Along with John Mayer on guitar and vocals, and Steve Jordan on drums, Palladino rounded out the outfit, touring and recording as the bass guitarist of the John Mayer Trio, and on Mayer's third album Continuum.\n\nInfluences on bass guitar\n\nInfluences for Palladino for bass guitar include The Shadows Jet Harris; Motown bassist James Jamerson; Stevie Wonder's keyboard-bass, jazz innovator Nathan Watts; British folk/rock upright bassist Danny Thompson; Norman Watt-Roy (of Ian Dury & the Blockheads); Larry Graham; Michael Henderson; Bootsy Collins; Jaco Pastorius; Paul Jackson; Anthony Jackson; Doug Rauch (of Carly Simon and Santana), and Billy Cobham.[13]\n\nTechnique\n\nPalladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass in many 1980s chart records. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\" Palladino preferred a different sound (combining fretless tone with an octaver effect) and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument as opposed to simply the aforementioned \"low notes\". Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's biggest chart hits, in particular his playing on Wherever I Lay My Hat. His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nPino Palladino signature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modelled after two of Palladino's Fender Precision Basses. The body featuring faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint is based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fret board are based on Pino's 1963 sunburst Precision Bass. He has also been known to prefer Thomastik-Infeld flat-wound bass strings.[15] Although as instruments change depending on the desired result (the Fender Japan Jaguar has featured on many stage and recordings since about 2006), strings brands and type ( round/flat/semi) may change too.\n\nAfter 2005\n\nIn spring of 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck. He also played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido, alongside other notable musicians, including Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston. It was to be Preston's last work before he died only days afterward. Palladino joined Eric Clapton's touring band for 11 dates in the Eastern US and Canada in May 2008.\n\nIn 2008 he recorded 3 tracks for London's The Herbaliser for their album \"Same As It Never Was\" released on k7! in 2009\n\nIn 2009, Palladino joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips to form an instrumental trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, an instrumental progressive jazz/funk rock ensemble, which have toured Europe through 2009 into 2010, playing songs that spotlight the talents of each performer, in the manner of many jazz outfits. He has also worked on an album with Clapton and Robbie Robertson, and played on Amos Lee's third album, Last Days at the Lodge. He appears on Jeff Beck's 2010 album, Emotion & Commotion. As of August 2010, Palladino has been touring with Herbie Hancock.\n\nPalladino also appears on Manu Katch\u00e9's third jazz album, Third Round. Both had already played together several times, particularly on Paul Young's Other Voices, as Stephan Eicher's rhythm section in the first half of the 1990s, and on stage with Manu Katch\u00e9's jazz band The Tweeters. Currently in the studio recording with Steve Gadd; Edie Brickell; Andy Fairweather Low; who have formed a group the Gaddabouts.\n\nIn January 2011, he entered the studio with D'Angelo to finish recording the long overdue follow up to Voodoo.[16]\n\nIn January 2011, Palladino played on the second album of Adele: 21, while in May in the same year he played on the last EP of Revolver, Parallel Lives.\n\nIn January and February 2012, he joined D'Angelo's live band for a short European tour, alongside drummer Chris 'Daddy' Dave and guitarist Jesse Johnson. The tour included performances at London's Brixton Academy.\n\nIn late 2012, he toured with the Who on their Quadrophenia \"revival\" tour and in 2013 he played on several tracks from the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks as well as being a member of the Nine Inch Nails live touring band.\n\nDiscography (selected)"}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/pino-palladino-person_lyyyfy", "page_content": "Pino Palladino\n\nWelsh bassist \u2013 Pino Palladino was born in Cardiff (capital city of Wales) on October 17th, 1957 and is 65 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Pino Palladino? 65 Pino Palladino is 65 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nPino Palladino\n\nBirthday When was Pino Palladino born?

Pino Palladino (born 17 October 1957) is a Welsh bass guitarist who gained fame playing primarily rock and roll, blues rock, and rhythm and blues music, although he has been lauded for his ability to play most genres of popular music, including jazz, neo soul, and funk. His career has spanned several ensembles, including the John Mayer Trio and The RH Factor, a band mixing elements of soul, jazz and R&B, which he formed with jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove. He was also Pete Townshend's and Roger Daltrey's first choice to fill the position left by John Entwistle as the bassist for The Who. Adding to an eclectic grasp and melodic approach on his instrument, he has become one of the most sought-after session players on the bass and has played on a large number of recordings by some of the world's most successful entertainers, in part, by mastering a variety of techniques on both his late 1970s fretless Music Man StingRay bass guitar and, later in his career, adding fretted Fender Precision and Jaguar basses.

It\u2019s hard not to blanche when you consider the sheer number of records that have been sold featuring his work. He played on not one but two of the biggest selling albums of the 21st century: Adele\u2019s 21 and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide, as well as with Rod Stewart, Elton John, Bryan Ferry, Simon and Garfunkel and Keith Richards. They\u2019re the biggest names in a startlingly diverse back catalogue of collaborations: Palladino\u2019s playing is the thread that links Perfume Genius with Phil Collins, Harry Styles with Chris de Burgh, and Nine Inch Nails with De La Soul. Indeed, his versatility and omnipresence is a running joke within the music industry. When another fabled bass player, Pink Floyd\u2019s Guy Pratt, got married, he opened his groom\u2019s speech with the words: \u201cI\u2019m only here today because Pino couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nFor a musician who seems to have turned up everywhere over the last 40 years, Palladino has remained a remarkably anonymous figure outside of musicians\u2019 circles. Indeed, he somehow contrived to spend 14 years as a member of the Who without really losing what he calls an \u201cinvisible stance\u201d. He certainly stands out in photographs of the Soulquarians, the experimental collective assembled by D\u2019Angelo for his legendary album Voodoo, the solitary lanky Welshman among a crowd of African-American musicians including Questlove and the late J Dilla \u2013 but you would still struggle to recognise him in the street.\n\nCardiff\u2019s finest \u2026 Palladino in 1985. Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nThis is presumably how Palladino likes it. He\u2019s drily funny and self-deprecating \u2013 he says his default setting when working with a new artist is \u201cdo not fucking spoil it\u201d \u2013 but doesn\u2019t seem terribly frustrated by life in the background. Which makes it all the more surprising that he\u2019s releasing an album on which he shares billing with Blake Mills: Notes With Attachments, a fascinating, head-turning collection of experimental instrumentals that sits somewhere between jazz, global music and ambient. He and Mills, who has produced for Fiona Apple and Laura Marling, met while working on a John Legend album. \u201cWe hit it off and the next thing you know, he\u2019s saying to me \u2018Have you thought about a solo album?\u2019 Well, I\u2019ve thought about it, obviously,\u201d he laughs. \u201cFor 40 years I\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019ve never really had an idea how I could do it.\u201d\n\nStudded with guest appearances \u2013 from avant-garde saxophonist Sam Gendel and jazz drummer Chris Dave, among others \u2013 Notes With Attachments foregrounds the sound that made Palladino\u2019s name: the none-more-80s sprrroing of the fretless bass put through a chorus pedal. He first used it while working with Gary Numan, but it was Paul Young\u2019s 1983 hit Wherever I Lay My Hat that introduced it to a mass audience: pushed up in the mix, the bass effectively became a lead instrument. It was so striking that Palladino suddenly found himself playing with everyone from Go West and Don Henley to Tears for Fears: he turned up on Top of the Pops with alarming regularity, the musical equivalent of a hip item of designer clothing. \u201cThere was a lot of it around in those days,\u201d he says of the sound. \u201cI was so lucky \u2013 it resonated with people, captured their imagination and it took on a life of its own. It did get to the point where I was getting booked for sessions and feeling like a performing monkey: \u2018Yeah, bring your fretless, make that funny sound and maybe we\u2019ll get a hit out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also found himself becoming the sideman of choice for the rock aristocracy. \u201cThe first call I got like that was from David Gilmour. I could not believe it: am I going to the studio with this guy and pretend I actually belong there? I was nervous as fuck, but the drummer on the session was Jeff Porcaro [famed for playing with Toto and on Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller album], and he was really sweet: \u2018Come on, man, chill out, have a smoke on this.\u2019 So I did, and that seemed to work for me. I just had to keep that attitude through all of that period: phone calls from Elton John and Phil Collins \u2013 you have to keep that headspace that you belong, even if you think you\u2019re going to be found out any minute.\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll have to play louder!\u2019 \u2026 performing with the Who at the 2016 Desert Trip festival in California. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nHe says another phone call, this time from D\u2019Angelo \u2013 who had heard his playing on a BB King album \u2013 changed his life. \u201cMy roots are in Motown, reggae, R&B. I didn\u2019t get much of an opportunity to express that side of music and then I met the don \u2013 how lucky was that? D\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone. When I was in the studio with D and Questlove, James Poyser, all those guys, I don\u2019t even have to think about what I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played. From a personal satisfaction point of view, it was as good as it ever got, probably will get.\n\n\u201cIt took people 10 years, 20, to really get the first album we made, Voodoo, but I absolutely knew it was unique and really special \u2013 I was probably more aware of it than the rest of them, because I\u2019d been working for a long time. I knew this kind of thing didn\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nThe Soulquarians went on to record with Erykah Badu, Mos Def and Talib Kweli; the influence of their loose approach can be heard on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s epochal 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly. They had just wrapped up a session with Common when Palladino learned that the Who\u2019s bassist, John Entwistle, had died \u2013 and that the band had declined to cancel their forthcoming tour and wanted Palladino to replace him \u2026 on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, in two days.\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs. Pete Townshend was waiting for me at the hotel, with a big stack of CDs. \u2018You don\u2019t know much of the catalogue? Fair enough. You\u2019re going to know it tonight, then, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 At the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino says he\u2019s \u201cnot exactly crazy about touring any more\u201d \u2013 he stopped playing live with the Who in 2016 \u2013 but is considering doing some gigs around Notes With Attachments, pandemic permitting. Until then, there are still sessions to attend to in LA, with Covid tests in the car park for anyone taking part. \u201cFilm and music studios are considered essential to the economy here \u2013 you\u2019ve got to love that, right?\u201d he laughs. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s better than Britain telling you if you\u2019re a musician or an artist you might have to look for a new job.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/in-a-rare-interview-bass-legend-pino-palladino-reflects-on-replacing-the-whos-john-entwistle-on-two-days-notice", "page_content": "Welsh bass virtuoso Pino Palladino has enjoyed a prolific career as a session musician, recording with pop superstars such as Adele and Ed Sheeran, playing bass in The Who after John Entwistle's death, and collaborating with the likes of D'Angelo, John Mayer, Elton John and many more.\n\nWhat Palladino isn't is a prolific interviewee, preferring to let his bass guitar do the talking.

A prolific session musician, he is probably best known for playing with The Who (following the death of founding member John Entwistle[2]) from 2002 to 2016, D'angelo from 1996 to present, and the John Mayer Trio from 2005 to present.\n\nPalladino plays a late-1970s, fretless, Music Man StingRay bass guitar, a fretted Fender Precision, and a Jaguar bass. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Cardiff to an Italian father from Campobasso and a Welsh mother,[4] Palladino began playing electric guitar at age 14 and bass guitar at 17. He bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae with a rock and roll backbeat.[5]\n\nCareer\n\nPalladino was drawn to Motown and jazz at an early age. He attended Catholic school and took classical guitar lessons. He liked Led Zeppelin and Yes and started a rock band.[6]\n\nIn 1982, Palladino recorded with Gary Numan on the album I, Assassin. The producer of the album asked him to contribute to Paul Young's debut album. Young's cover version of \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\" by Marvin Gaye became a hit in Europe,and subsequently joined Young's band the Royal family and Palladino received offers to record with Joan Armatrading, Go West, and David Gilmour. He cites as early influences James Jamerson, Danny Thompson, and Norman Watt-Roy and also admires Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins, Larry Graham, Michael Henderson, Anthony Jackson, Marcus Miller, and Rocco Prestia.[7]\n\nIn 1983, he joined The Law with Paul Rodgers, formerly of Bad Company, and drummer Kenney Jones, who succeeded Keith Moon in The Who after Moon died, and recorded the album The Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino alternated between fretless bass and fretted and 4-string and 6-string bass. He played with Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Elton John, and Eric Clapton.\n\nHe played on Mike Lindup's first solo album, Changes with Dominic Miller on guitar and Manu Katch\u00e9 on drums.[8]\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft of The Verve on Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody.[9]\n\nThe Who's bassist John Entwistle died the night before the start of their first tour in two years. Palladino became the band's bass guitarist on tour. In 2006, he joined the remaining band members on their first album in twenty-four years, Endless Wire. He played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show in 2010 with Simon Townshend on guitar, Zak Starkey on drums, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick on keyboards. In 2012, he toured with The Who on their Quadrophenia revival.\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session musicians, which blossomed into a friendship. Jordan credits Palladino's apparent ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an embrace of genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he had planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January 2005 to perform Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope for victims of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix song \"Bold as Love\", the three found a chemistry together. They recorded an album and toured as a trio.[10]\n\nThey released the album Try!, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover versions of \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" by Jimi Hendrix and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's album Heavier Things, and new songs by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs: \"Good Love Is on the Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\".[3] Palladino appeared on Mayer's third album Continuum, fourth album Battle Studies and seventh album The Search for Everything.\n\nIn March and April 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck and played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido. In 2009, he formed a trio with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips.\n\nHe played with Simon and Garfunkel on their Old Friends reunion tour.[10]\n\nIn January 2011, he entered the studio with D'Angelo to finish recording Black Messiah.[11]\n\nIn 2013 he played on the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks and was a member of the touring band.\n\nTechnique\n\nPalladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass on many 1980s albums. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\", Palladino preferred a different sound, combining fretless tone with an octaver effect, and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines, and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument. Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's Wherever I Lay My Hat. His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nSignature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modelled after two of Palladino's Fender Precision Basses. The body features faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint, based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass, while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fretboard are based on his 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.[12]\n\nPersonal life\n\nPino married Marilyn (Maz) Roberts, a former backing singer with the Fabulous Wealthy Tarts, in 1992 in Wales.

It was a typically massive understatement from the quietly affable Welsh bassist, among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry. In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it. That\u2019s really nice to hear.\n\nListen to Pino Palladino and Blake Mills\u2019 Notes with Attachments here."}, {"url": "https://allstarbio.com/pino-palladino-biography-net-worth-birthday-height-weight-ethnicity-girlfriend-wife-affair-married-fact/", "page_content": "Quick Facts of Pino Palladino Full Name Pino Palladino\n\nNet Worth $40 million\n\nDate of Birth 17 October, 1957\n\nMarital Status Married\n\nBirthplace Cardiff, Wales\n\nEthnicity Mixed\n\nProfession Bassist\n\nNationality British, Italian\n\nEye colour Dark Brown\n\nHair colour Dark Brown\n\nBuild Athletic\n\nSpouse Fabulous Wealthy Tarts Marilyn (Maz) Roberts\n\nHeight 6 feet 8 inches\n\nEducation Catholic school\n\nOnline Presence Twitter, Facebook\n\nChildren 3\n\nHoroscope Libra\n\nShort Description of Pino Palladino:\n\nPino Palladino is a well-known bassist from Welsh, who played with The Who from 2002 to 2016.

Holland was touring with another new band; the Q-Tips, whose frontman, Paul Young made acquaintance with Palladino whilst they were on tour, who would, a year later offer Pino a place in his own backing band.\n\nPalladino has joined several bands and ensembles through which he is most visible. He joined jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove in forming The RH Factor, a band that mixes elements of soul, jazz, and R&B. He is a member of the John Mayer Trio, and was the first choice by Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey to fill the position left by John Entwistle as the current bassist for The Who.\n\nPino Palladino (17 October 1957 in Cardiff, Wales, UK) is a Welsh bass guitarist of Italian ancestry. Palladino rose to public notice playing primarily rock and roll, blues rock, and rhythm and blues music, although he has been lauded for his ability to play most genres of popular music, including jazz, neo soul, and funk. Adding to his eclectic grasp and melodic approach on his instrument, he has become one of the most sought-after session players on the bass in the music industry. He has played on a large number of recordings by some of the world's most successful entertainers, in part, by mastering a variety of techniques on both his late 1970s fretless Music Man StingRay bass guitar and later in his career, adding fretted Fender Precision and Jaguar basses. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.\n\nAfter vocalist Paul Young landed his own solo contract, Palladino was brought in as part of his backing band \"The Royal Family\" in 1983 with noticeable chart success with the No Parlez album, and major hit singles both in the UK and Europe. Examples of Young's new found success were the band's cover of the Marvin Gaye classic \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\", which reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart for three weeks in the summer of 1983, and \"Love of the Common People\". Palladino toured extensively at this time with Paul Young, remaining in the band for five years. 1983 additionally proved to be the year of another ensemble featuring Palladino, Paul Rodgers (formerly of Bad Company, drummer Kenney Jones, along with a rotating cast of other celebrity performers. The band only released one album through Atlantic; The Law, although there were enough out-takes that another bootleg-styled album followed in 1991. Sales were unremarkable, despite the names of those who recorded on the album.\n\nThroughout the 1980s Palladino was noted for his R&B roots on the fretless bass, even when supporting pop and rock heavy performers. One reviewer from Bass Player magazine points to Paul Young\u2019s cover of the Bobby Womack/Rufus tune \"Stop On By\" (on 1990\u2019s Other Voices), with its \"pre-hip-hop, swung funk groove\" as the precursor to Palladino's later neo-soul focus.\n\n1990s Changes in instrument\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino began to alternate between the sounds achieved in playing the fretless bass to one with frets, as well as the 4-string and 6-string bass. At the time, he was well known within the industry for his fretless bass sound. However, now, depending on which artist he was supporting, and the song to be played, he began gravitating towards fretted bass. He was maturing as a musician, and played with artists as diverse as Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Sir Elton John and Eric Clapton. Also in 1991 he joined Paul Rodgers (of Free, Queen+ Paul Rodgers, and Bad Company fame) to form the band The Law. In the mid 1990's, Palladino played bass for The London Metropolitan orchestra during their recording of \"An American Symphony\", soundtrack for the movie Mr Hollands Opus.\n\nPalladino supported Phil Collins, as a member of the house band for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, which played with Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett, among other notable performers. He later wrote that he felt privileged to have been amongst the others on stage in such an event.\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft, of The Verve, during the recording sessions of Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody. Richard proved to be mightily impressed by Pino's natural bass playing ability;\n\nThis Pino Palladino, I can say a Meters record and he can play me the bass line. He can play anything. He's one of the only people in the world who can totally replicate that kind of Beach Boys/scratch/Walker Brothers bass. You can get that sound if you want it, dead on. So it was very liberating working with him.\n\nPino also joined Ashcroft's touring band for the singer's first major solo outing throughout 2000.\n\nNeo Soul\n\nBy the mid- 1990s, Palladino had established himself as a busy, highly desirable bassist and a studio worker in many genres, but finally became visible to those artists who played largely left of center, and demand for his session playing grew within a different quarter. Palladino began moving from blues-rock toward neo soul projects. Palladino and Steve Jordan found themselves performing on the same session for B.B. King\u2019s 1997 duets CD Deuces Wild. It was the first time soul singer D'Angelo first heard Palladino, who had just switched from a signature sound fretless bass sound to that of performing with fretted basses. The result was an invitation to \"use Pino\u2019s big, behind-the-beat bass to help cast a neo-soul spell on his Grammy Award-winning Voodoo album\". It would not be his first uncredited Grammy performance.\n\nAs the word spread throughout the genre, Palladino found an increasing demand within the neo-soul genre. Examples of his bass work in this genre (in addition to D'Angelo) includes Mama's Gun, and \"Penitentiary Philosophy\" found on Erykah Badu\u2019s 2000 CD. Other albums using Pino's sound include 1st Born Second for Bilal, Like Water for Chocolate and Electric Circus for Common. Palladino has been described by Steve Jordan, who got his own professional start playing the drums for Stevie Wonder as having a \"deep funk\" side and a \"melodic\" side. Palladino admits, that \"Of all my influences, I would say what\u2019s always in the back of my mind is early Stevie Wonder, like Talking Book and Innervisions; that music is really in my blood.\"\n\n2000s\n\nFollowing the death of The Who's bassist John Entwistle in 2002, the eve before the band were to kick off their first world tour in years, Palladino was their first choice to become the band's full-time touring bass guitarist, and by 2006, he was invited to join the remaining original band members in recording their first album in twenty-four years. Pete Townshend, the band's composer, recorded the bassline on the majority of the songs to get the effect he himself wanted, with Palladino doing so on the other six of them. Released in October 2006, the album was named Endless Wire.\n\nPalladino also recently played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show, in February, 2010, alongside other backing artists: Simon Townsend on guitar, Zak Starkey, drums and percussion, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, on keyboard instruments.\n\nPaul Simon\n\nIn 2003, Palladino intended to go down to see his old friend Paul Simon and meet Brian Eno for the first time. He was asked to record with them, and had to borrow a bass guitar to play. The result was that he played with Simon and Garfunkel on their \"Old Friends\" reunion tour and in an interview with Bass Player Magazine he mentions drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Jamey Haddad \"had laid down some great grooves for me to add bass\". He had kept the recordings, and by the time that he appeared on the Old Friends: Live on Stage CD and DVD from the tour, he was able to use some of the material. He played on Paul Simon's 2006 release, Surprise.\n\nOther appearances\n\nPalladino has toured in the backing band for Joe Walsh. In 2004 he appeared to be playing with Gary Moore at the Wembley Arena.\n\nEmergence of the John Mayer Trio\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session players on many occasions, which blossomed into a friendship. When their work brought them to the same place, they would meet, usually jam together, and introduce other musicians to one another, forming friendships which sometimes blossomed into good working relationships. Jordan has remained keen about Pino since he met him, and only grows more enthusiastic about his talents, which he describes partly as his love for, and ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an amazing connection with genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he'd planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January, 2005 to perform a benefit concert on a NBC sponsored telethon Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope to raise funds and public awareness benefiting victims in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work, and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix classic, \"Bold as Love\", the three all agreed that they experienced such chemistry that they began talking right away about arranging their schedules to record a CD and a tour. The trio released the album Try!, on November 22, 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover songs, such as Jimi Hendrix's \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's release Heavier Things, as well as new songs written by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan wrote three songs on the album: \"Good Love Is On The Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\". Along with John Mayer on guitar and vocals, and Steve Jordan on drums, Palladino has toured and recorded as a member of the John Mayer Trio, and on Mayer's third album Continuum.\n\nRecent tours\n\nIn spring of 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck. He also played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido, alongside other notable musicians, including Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston. It was to be Preston's last work before he died only days afterward.\n\nInfluences on bass guitar\n\nInfluences for Palladino for bass guitar include Motown bassist James Jamerson; Stevie Wonder\u2019s keyboard-bass, jazz innovator Jaco Pastorius; British folk/rock upright bassist Danny Thompson; Norman Watt-Roy (of Ian Dury & the Blockheads); Larry Graham; Michael Henderson; Bootsy Collins; Paul Jackson; Anthony Jackson; Doug Rauch (of Carly Simon and Santana), and Billy Cobham.\n\nTechnique\n\nPino Palladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass in many 1980s chart records. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\" Palladino preferred a different sound (combining fretless tone with an octave effect) and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument as opposed to simply the aforementioned \"low notes\". Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's biggest chart hits, in particular his bass solo on \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\". His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nPino Palladino signature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modeled after two of Pino's Fender Precision Basses. The body featuring faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint is based on Pino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fret board are based on Pino's 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.\n\nRecent projects\n\nPalladino joined Eric Clapton's touring band for 11 dates in the Eastern U.S. and Canada in May 2008. Current work has included work on an with Clapton and Robbie Robertson, and Palladino guested on bass for Amos Lee on his third album, Last Days at the Lodge.\n\nIn 2009, Palladino joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips to form an instrumental trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, an instrumental jazz/funk rock ensemble, which have toured Europe through 2009 into 2010, playing songs that spotlight the talents of each performer, in the manner of many jazz outfits.

In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it. That\u2019s really nice to hear.\n\nListen to Pino Palladino and Blake Mills\u2019 Notes with Attachments here."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/06/pino-palladino-pop-greatest-bassist-adele-elton-the-who", "page_content": "By his own admission, Pino Palladino is not a man much accustomed to giving interviews. \u201cVery reticent,\u201d he nods during a Zoom call, his accent speaking noticeably louder of his childhood in Cardiff than his current home in LA. \u201cYou know, there was a time when I was featured in all sorts of musicians\u2019 magazines, and then I just thought to myself, \u2018Move over, there\u2019s people out there that actually need the publicity.\u2019 Not to blow smoke up my own arse,\u201d he adds hurriedly, \u201cbut really I just didn\u2019t want to see or hear from myself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a remark in keeping with the astonishing career of one of the most celebrated bass players in the world. It\u2019s hard not to blanche when you consider the sheer number of records that have been sold featuring his work. He played on not one but two of the biggest selling albums of the 21st century: Adele\u2019s 21 and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide, as well as with Rod Stewart, Elton John, Bryan Ferry, Simon and Garfunkel and Keith Richards. They\u2019re the biggest names in a startlingly diverse back catalogue of collaborations: Palladino\u2019s playing is the thread that links Perfume Genius with Phil Collins, Harry Styles with Chris de Burgh, and Nine Inch Nails with De La Soul. Indeed, his versatility and omnipresence is a running joke within the music industry. When another fabled bass player, Pink Floyd\u2019s Guy Pratt, got married, he opened his groom\u2019s speech with the words: \u201cI\u2019m only here today because Pino couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nFor a musician who seems to have turned up everywhere over the last 40 years, Palladino has remained a remarkably anonymous figure outside of musicians\u2019 circles. Indeed, he somehow contrived to spend 14 years as a member of the Who without really losing what he calls an \u201cinvisible stance\u201d. He certainly stands out in photographs of the Soulquarians, the experimental collective assembled by D\u2019Angelo for his legendary album Voodoo, the solitary lanky Welshman among a crowd of African-American musicians including Questlove and the late J Dilla \u2013 but you would still struggle to recognise him in the street.\n\nCardiff\u2019s finest \u2026 Palladino in 1985. Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nThis is presumably how Palladino likes it. He\u2019s drily funny and self-deprecating \u2013 he says his default setting when working with a new artist is \u201cdo not fucking spoil it\u201d \u2013 but doesn\u2019t seem terribly frustrated by life in the background. Which makes it all the more surprising that he\u2019s releasing an album on which he shares billing with Blake Mills: Notes With Attachments, a fascinating, head-turning collection of experimental instrumentals that sits somewhere between jazz, global music and ambient. He and Mills, who has produced for Fiona Apple and Laura Marling, met while working on a John Legend album. \u201cWe hit it off and the next thing you know, he\u2019s saying to me \u2018Have you thought about a solo album?\u2019 Well, I\u2019ve thought about it, obviously,\u201d he laughs. \u201cFor 40 years I\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019ve never really had an idea how I could do it.\u201d\n\nStudded with guest appearances \u2013 from avant-garde saxophonist Sam Gendel and jazz drummer Chris Dave, among others \u2013 Notes With Attachments foregrounds the sound that made Palladino\u2019s name: the none-more-80s sprrroing of the fretless bass put through a chorus pedal. He first used it while working with Gary Numan, but it was Paul Young\u2019s 1983 hit Wherever I Lay My Hat that introduced it to a mass audience: pushed up in the mix, the bass effectively became a lead instrument. It was so striking that Palladino suddenly found himself playing with everyone from Go West and Don Henley to Tears for Fears: he turned up on Top of the Pops with alarming regularity, the musical equivalent of a hip item of designer clothing. \u201cThere was a lot of it around in those days,\u201d he says of the sound. \u201cI was so lucky \u2013 it resonated with people, captured their imagination and it took on a life of its own. It did get to the point where I was getting booked for sessions and feeling like a performing monkey: \u2018Yeah, bring your fretless, make that funny sound and maybe we\u2019ll get a hit out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also found himself becoming the sideman of choice for the rock aristocracy. \u201cThe first call I got like that was from David Gilmour. I could not believe it: am I going to the studio with this guy and pretend I actually belong there? I was nervous as fuck, but the drummer on the session was Jeff Porcaro [famed for playing with Toto and on Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller album], and he was really sweet: \u2018Come on, man, chill out, have a smoke on this.\u2019 So I did, and that seemed to work for me. I just had to keep that attitude through all of that period: phone calls from Elton John and Phil Collins \u2013 you have to keep that headspace that you belong, even if you think you\u2019re going to be found out any minute.\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll have to play louder!\u2019 \u2026 performing with the Who at the 2016 Desert Trip festival in California. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nHe says another phone call, this time from D\u2019Angelo \u2013 who had heard his playing on a BB King album \u2013 changed his life. \u201cMy roots are in Motown, reggae, R&B. I didn\u2019t get much of an opportunity to express that side of music and then I met the don \u2013 how lucky was that? D\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone. When I was in the studio with D and Questlove, James Poyser, all those guys, I don\u2019t even have to think about what I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played. From a personal satisfaction point of view, it was as good as it ever got, probably will get.\n\n\u201cIt took people 10 years, 20, to really get the first album we made, Voodoo, but I absolutely knew it was unique and really special \u2013 I was probably more aware of it than the rest of them, because I\u2019d been working for a long time. I knew this kind of thing didn\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nThe Soulquarians went on to record with Erykah Badu, Mos Def and Talib Kweli; the influence of their loose approach can be heard on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s epochal 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly. They had just wrapped up a session with Common when Palladino learned that the Who\u2019s bassist, John Entwistle, had died \u2013 and that the band had declined to cancel their forthcoming tour and wanted Palladino to replace him \u2026 on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, in two days.\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs. Pete Townshend was waiting for me at the hotel, with a big stack of CDs. \u2018You don\u2019t know much of the catalogue? Fair enough. You\u2019re going to know it tonight, then, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 At the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino says he\u2019s \u201cnot exactly crazy about touring any more\u201d \u2013 he stopped playing live with the Who in 2016 \u2013 but is considering doing some gigs around Notes With Attachments, pandemic permitting. Until then, there are still sessions to attend to in LA, with Covid tests in the car park for anyone taking part. \u201cFilm and music studios are considered essential to the economy here \u2013 you\u2019ve got to love that, right?\u201d he laughs. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s better than Britain telling you if you\u2019re a musician or an artist you might have to look for a new job.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/in-a-rare-interview-bass-legend-pino-palladino-reflects-on-replacing-the-whos-john-entwistle-on-two-days-notice", "page_content": "Welsh bass virtuoso Pino Palladino has enjoyed a prolific career as a session musician, recording with pop superstars such as Adele and Ed Sheeran, playing bass in The Who after John Entwistle's death, and collaborating with the likes of D'Angelo, John Mayer, Elton John and many more.\n\nWhat Palladino isn't is a prolific interviewee, preferring to let his bass guitar do the talking. But in an interview published today in The Guardian, he has spoken of the moment in 2002 when Pete Townshend called. John Entwistle had passed away: would Palladino fill in on the tour?\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs,\u201c said Palladino.

But in a career that saw him play on some of the top-selling albums of all time, Palladino considers his collaboration with neo soul pioneer D'Angelo, as bassist of the Soulquarians, the personal highlight.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone,\u201c said Palladino. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played.\u201c\n\nPalladino has just released Notes With Attachments with the Californian guitarist and composer Blake Mills, available now through New Deal Records.

He went on to play fretless bass with a healthy number of high-profile artists that include (on the short list), David Gilmour, Tears for Fears, Pete Townshend, Peter Gabriel, Joan Armatrading, Phil Collins, Chaka Khan and Don Henley.\n\nPalladino began playing the electric guitar at age 14. By age 17 he decided to play the bass guitar, and bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae within a rock and roll backbeat. His first professional gig was at a local television station in Cardiff, where he began playing in 1978. That same year, at age 20, he joined Jools Holland's band and recorded with Holland on his album entitled, Jools Holland and His Millionaires. Palladino toured with Jools to support the album, which gave him the opportunity to purchase his own Music Man StingRay Fretless Bass. Holland was touring with another new band; the Q-Tips, whose frontman, Paul Young made acquaintance with Palladino whilst they were on tour, who would, a year later offer Pino a place in his own backing band.\n\nPalladino has joined several bands and ensembles through which he is most visible. He joined jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove in forming The RH Factor, a band that mixes elements of soul, jazz, and R&B. He is a member of the John Mayer Trio, and was the first choice by Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey to fill the position left by John Entwistle as the current bassist for The Who.\n\nPino Palladino (17 October 1957 in Cardiff, Wales, UK) is a Welsh bass guitarist of Italian ancestry. Palladino rose to public notice playing primarily rock and roll, blues rock, and rhythm and blues music, although he has been lauded for his ability to play most genres of popular music, including jazz, neo soul, and funk. Adding to his eclectic grasp and melodic approach on his instrument, he has become one of the most sought-after session players on the bass in the music industry. He has played on a large number of recordings by some of the world's most successful entertainers, in part, by mastering a variety of techniques on both his late 1970s fretless Music Man StingRay bass guitar and later in his career, adding fretted Fender Precision and Jaguar basses. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.\n\nAfter vocalist Paul Young landed his own solo contract, Palladino was brought in as part of his backing band \"The Royal Family\" in 1983 with noticeable chart success with the No Parlez album, and major hit singles both in the UK and Europe. Examples of Young's new found success were the band's cover of the Marvin Gaye classic \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\", which reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart for three weeks in the summer of 1983, and \"Love of the Common People\". Palladino toured extensively at this time with Paul Young, remaining in the band for five years. 1983 additionally proved to be the year of another ensemble featuring Palladino, Paul Rodgers (formerly of Bad Company, drummer Kenney Jones, along with a rotating cast of other celebrity performers. The band only released one album through Atlantic; The Law, although there were enough out-takes that another bootleg-styled album followed in 1991. Sales were unremarkable, despite the names of those who recorded on the album.\n\nThroughout the 1980s Palladino was noted for his R&B roots on the fretless bass, even when supporting pop and rock heavy performers. One reviewer from Bass Player magazine points to Paul Young\u2019s cover of the Bobby Womack/Rufus tune \"Stop On By\" (on 1990\u2019s Other Voices), with its \"pre-hip-hop, swung funk groove\" as the precursor to Palladino's later neo-soul focus.\n\n1990s Changes in instrument\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino began to alternate between the sounds achieved in playing the fretless bass to one with frets, as well as the 4-string and 6-string bass. At the time, he was well known within the industry for his fretless bass sound. However, now, depending on which artist he was supporting, and the song to be played, he began gravitating towards fretted bass. He was maturing as a musician, and played with artists as diverse as Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Sir Elton John and Eric Clapton. Also in 1991 he joined Paul Rodgers (of Free, Queen+ Paul Rodgers, and Bad Company fame) to form the band The Law. In the mid 1990's, Palladino played bass for The London Metropolitan orchestra during their recording of \"An American Symphony\", soundtrack for the movie Mr Hollands Opus.\n\nPalladino supported Phil Collins, as a member of the house band for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, which played with Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett, among other notable performers. He later wrote that he felt privileged to have been amongst the others on stage in such an event.\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft, of The Verve, during the recording sessions of Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody. Richard proved to be mightily impressed by Pino's natural bass playing ability;\n\nThis Pino Palladino, I can say a Meters record and he can play me the bass line. He can play anything. He's one of the only people in the world who can totally replicate that kind of Beach Boys/scratch/Walker Brothers bass. You can get that sound if you want it, dead on. So it was very liberating working with him.\n\nPino also joined Ashcroft's touring band for the singer's first major solo outing throughout 2000.\n\nNeo Soul\n\nBy the mid- 1990s, Palladino had established himself as a busy, highly desirable bassist and a studio worker in many genres, but finally became visible to those artists who played largely left of center, and demand for his session playing grew within a different quarter. Palladino began moving from blues-rock toward neo soul projects. Palladino and Steve Jordan found themselves performing on the same session for B.B. King\u2019s 1997 duets CD Deuces Wild. It was the first time soul singer D'Angelo first heard Palladino, who had just switched from a signature sound fretless bass sound to that of performing with fretted basses. The result was an invitation to \"use Pino\u2019s big, behind-the-beat bass to help cast a neo-soul spell on his Grammy Award-winning Voodoo album\". It would not be his first uncredited Grammy performance.\n\nAs the word spread throughout the genre, Palladino found an increasing demand within the neo-soul genre. Examples of his bass work in this genre (in addition to D'Angelo) includes Mama's Gun, and \"Penitentiary Philosophy\" found on Erykah Badu\u2019s 2000 CD. Other albums using Pino's sound include 1st Born Second for Bilal, Like Water for Chocolate and Electric Circus for Common. Palladino has been described by Steve Jordan, who got his own professional start playing the drums for Stevie Wonder as having a \"deep funk\" side and a \"melodic\" side. Palladino admits, that \"Of all my influences, I would say what\u2019s always in the back of my mind is early Stevie Wonder, like Talking Book and Innervisions; that music is really in my blood.\"\n\n2000s\n\nFollowing the death of The Who's bassist John Entwistle in 2002, the eve before the band were to kick off their first world tour in years, Palladino was their first choice to become the band's full-time touring bass guitarist, and by 2006, he was invited to join the remaining original band members in recording their first album in twenty-four years. Pete Townshend, the band's composer, recorded the bassline on the majority of the songs to get the effect he himself wanted, with Palladino doing so on the other six of them. Released in October 2006, the album was named Endless Wire.\n\nPalladino also recently played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show, in February, 2010, alongside other backing artists: Simon Townsend on guitar, Zak Starkey, drums and percussion, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, on keyboard instruments.\n\nPaul Simon\n\nIn 2003, Palladino intended to go down to see his old friend Paul Simon and meet Brian Eno for the first time. He was asked to record with them, and had to borrow a bass guitar to play. The result was that he played with Simon and Garfunkel on their \"Old Friends\" reunion tour and in an interview with Bass Player Magazine he mentions drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Jamey Haddad \"had laid down some great grooves for me to add bass\". He had kept the recordings, and by the time that he appeared on the Old Friends: Live on Stage CD and DVD from the tour, he was able to use some of the material. He played on Paul Simon's 2006 release, Surprise.\n\nOther appearances\n\nPalladino has toured in the backing band for Joe Walsh. In 2004 he appeared to be playing with Gary Moore at the Wembley Arena.\n\nEmergence of the John Mayer Trio\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session players on many occasions, which blossomed into a friendship. When their work brought them to the same place, they would meet, usually jam together, and introduce other musicians to one another, forming friendships which sometimes blossomed into good working relationships. Jordan has remained keen about Pino since he met him, and only grows more enthusiastic about his talents, which he describes partly as his love for, and ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an amazing connection with genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he'd planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January, 2005 to perform a benefit concert on a NBC sponsored telethon Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope to raise funds and public awareness benefiting victims in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work, and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix classic, \"Bold as Love\", the three all agreed that they experienced such chemistry that they began talking right away about arranging their schedules to record a CD and a tour. The trio released the album Try!, on November 22, 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover songs, such as Jimi Hendrix's \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's release Heavier Things, as well as new songs written by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan wrote three songs on the album: \"Good Love Is On The Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\". Along with John Mayer on guitar and vocals, and Steve Jordan on drums, Palladino has toured and recorded as a member of the John Mayer Trio, and on Mayer's third album Continuum.\n\nRecent tours\n\nIn spring of 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck. He also played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido, alongside other notable musicians, including Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston. It was to be Preston's last work before he died only days afterward.\n\nInfluences on bass guitar\n\nInfluences for Palladino for bass guitar include Motown bassist James Jamerson; Stevie Wonder\u2019s keyboard-bass, jazz innovator Jaco Pastorius; British folk/rock upright bassist Danny Thompson; Norman Watt-Roy (of Ian Dury & the Blockheads); Larry Graham; Michael Henderson; Bootsy Collins; Paul Jackson; Anthony Jackson; Doug Rauch (of Carly Simon and Santana), and Billy Cobham.\n\nTechnique\n\nPino Palladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass in many 1980s chart records. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\" Palladino preferred a different sound (combining fretless tone with an octave effect) and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument as opposed to simply the aforementioned \"low notes\". Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's biggest chart hits, in particular his bass solo on \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\". His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nPino Palladino signature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modeled after two of Pino's Fender Precision Basses. The body featuring faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint is based on Pino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fret board are based on Pino's 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.\n\nRecent projects\n\nPalladino joined Eric Clapton's touring band for 11 dates in the Eastern U.S. and Canada in May 2008. Current work has included work on an with Clapton and Robbie Robertson, and Palladino guested on bass for Amos Lee on his third album, Last Days at the Lodge.\n\nIn 2009, Palladino joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips to form an instrumental trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, an instrumental jazz/funk rock ensemble, which have toured Europe through 2009 into 2010, playing songs that spotlight the talents of each performer, in the manner of many jazz outfits.

This became his signature sound throughout the era, one that he has returned to in the past five years with his trio PSP.\n\nFender American Standard Jaguar Bass\n\nHaving previously played with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey, Palladino was an obvious choice to fill the big shoes left after the sudden passing of The Who bassist John Entwistle in 2002.\n\nAfter initially trying out his Fender Precision and Jazz basses with the band, he eventually settled on the powerful tone and cutting attack of the Fender Jaguar with two thunderbird pickups.\n\n1963 Fender Precision Bass\n\nPalladino made the move to a fretted P-Bass in the 1990s as a conscious decision to move away from his signature fretless sound and embrace a vintage soul and R&B tone, such as that of Motown bassist James Jameson.\n\nHe achieved this with a combination of the 1963 P-Bass with a sunburst finish, custom wound pickups, flatwound La Bella strings, and by keeping the volume turned all the way up and the tone all the way down.\n\nThis configuration can be heard on D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo and Black Messiah albums, on which he played tuned down to DGCF with a dampener.\n\n1961 Fender Precision Bass in Fiesta Red\n\nThis guitar is another of Palladino\u2019s favourites and also used with flatwound strings. It can be heard on Paul Simon\u2019s 2006 album Surprise.\n\nFender Pino Palladino Precision Bass\n\nPalladino was bestowed this signature model by the Fender Custom Shop. Its alder body is based on his \u201961 P-Bass, while the \u2018C\u2019 shape maple neck shape and rosewood fingerboard are based on his \u201963 P-Bass. It is finished in Fiesta Red over Desert Sand and has custom wound pickups.\n\nPalladino himself has used this model whilst on tour with The Who, although he added \u201860\u2019s Gibson Thunderbird pickups.\n\nMoon JJ-4 300B\n\nPalladino played an all-white Moon bass during the Voodoo tour with D\u2019Angelo in March-October 2002, playing tuned down to DGCF as he did on the album. Watch him lay down a groove with the bass in this session with (U)nity below.\n\nAmplifiers\n\nAshdown ABM 900 EVO III head and ABM-810-EVO-IV 8\u00d710 Cabinet\n\nPalladino often uses this combination onstage with The Who as well as with the John Mayer Trio.\n\nPhil Jones M-300/500 Head with 8T/16B Cabinet\n\nPalladino is a big fan of the work of Phil Jones and uses his amps frequently for both recording and touring.\n\nAmpeg B15\n\nUsed on the Voodoo album, recorded from the amp without using a DI.\n\nFender SuperBassman\n\nUsed during The Who\u2019s Quadrophenia tour of 2012/2013.\n\nStrings\n\nThomastik-Infeld Flatwound strings\n\nAs already mentioned, Palladino\u2019s use of flatwound strings has been a major component of his sound and Thomastik-Infeld are his preferred choice.\n\nJamerson La Bella Flatwound strings\n\nUsed on his \u201963 P-Bass on the Voodoo album and tour.\n\nErnie Ball Cobalt\n\nThese were used during The Who Hits 50! Tour of 2016 for extra punch not afforded by his usual flatwound strings.\n\nPedals\n\nBoss OC-2 Octave Pedal\n\nPalladino used this as an integral part of his setup during the 1980\u2019s in combination with his fretless bass playing.\n\nOthers:\n\nPalladino uses as an array of other pedals, some notable units used during recent years with The Who are:\n\nAnalog Alien Alien Bass Station, compressor, distortion, amp emulator and MXR Bass Octave effect.

Pino wasn't the only special guest to appear in the studio: who'd have imagined Lindsay Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac to crop up on a Nine Inch Nails album, let alone the king of the fretless bass? This next clip sees Pino add his slick fretless lines to Reznor\u2019s 1989 track \u2018Sanctified.\u2019\n\nBlake Mills - Notes With Attachments\n\nIn 2021 Pino released the first solo album of his career, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills on an archive of musical ideas. Recorded at Sound City in a series of studio sessions that spanned two and a half years, the album pays homage to his love of classic film soundtracks, cool jazz and Burt Bacharach arrangements.\n\n\n\nWatch Pino Palladino and Blake Mills, along with percussionist Abe Rounds and saxophonist Sam Gendel, perform three tracks from the album on NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk (Home) Concert.\n\nNotes With Attachments is available now on CD, vinyl and as a digital download (iTunes and Amazon MP3)"}, {"url": "https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-bassists-of-all-time-13565/pino-palladino-13579/", "page_content": "From funk masters to prog prodigies and beyond, we count down the players who have shaped our idea of the low-end theory\n\n\u201cThe bass is the foundation,\u201d session legend Carol Kaye once said, \u201cand with the drummer you create the beat. Whatever you play puts a framework around the rest of the music.\u201d\n\nA great bass line, whether it\u2019s Paul McCartney\u2019s hypnotic \u201cCome Together\u201d riff, Bootsy Collins\u2019 sly vamp from James Brown\u2019s \u201cSex Machine,\u201d or Tina Weymouth\u2019s minimal throb on Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cPsycho Killer,\u201d is like a mantra: It sounds like it could go on forever, and it only feels more profound the more you hear it. Guitarists, singers, and horn players tend to claim the flashiest moments in any given song, while drummers channel most of the kinetic energy, but what the bassist brings is something elemental \u2014 the part that loops endlessly in your head long after the music ends.\n\nBassists are often overlooked and undervalued, even within their own bands. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the number-one job,\u201d McCartney once said, reflecting on the fateful moment when he took over the four-string after Stu Sutcliffe exited the Beatles. \u201cNobody wanted to play bass, they wanted to be up front.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the instrument has its own proud tradition in popular music, stretching from the mighty upright work of Jimmy Blanton in Duke Ellington\u2019s orchestra and bebop pioneers like Oscar Pettiford to fellow jazz geniuses like Charles Mingus and Ron Carter; studio champs like Kaye and James Jamerson; rock warriors like Cream\u2019s Jack Bruce and the Who\u2019s John Entwistle; funk masters like Bootsy and Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s Larry Graham; prog prodigies like Yes\u2019 Chris Squire and Rush\u2019s Geddy Lee; fusion gods like Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius; and punk and postpunk masters like Weymouth and the Minutemen\u2019s Mike Watt. The alternative era brought new heroes on the instrument, from Sonic Youth\u2019s intuitive Kim Gordon to Primus\u2019 outlandish Les Claypool, and more recently, a fresh crop of bass icons \u2014 including Esperanza Spalding and the ubiquitous Thundercat \u2014 have placed the low end at the center of their musical universes.\n\nAs with our 100 Greatest Drummers list, this rundown of the 50 greatest bassists of all time celebrates that entire spectrum. It\u2019s emphatically not intended as a ranking of objective skill; nor does it assign any one set of criteria as a measure of greatness. Instead it\u2019s an inventory of the bassists who have had the most direct and visible impact on creating, to borrow Kaye\u2019s term, the very foundation of popular music \u2014 from rock to funk to country to R&B to disco to hip-hop, and beyond \u2014 during the past half-century or so. You\u2019ll find obvious virtuosos here, but also musicians whose more minimal concept of their instrument\u2019s role elevated everything that was going on around them.\n\n\u201cYou grab it, slide around on it, and feel it with your hands,\u201d Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Flea once said of his signature instrument. \u201cYou slap, pull, thump, pluck, and pop, and you get yourself into this hypnotic state, if you\u2019re lucky, beyond thought, where you\u2019re not thinking because you\u2019re just a conduit for this rhythm, from wherever it comes from, from God to you and this instrument, through a cord and a speaker.\u201d\n\nHere we pay tribute to 50 musicians who have found that same exalted state via the bass, and changed the world in the process."}, {"url": "https://bassguitarshack.com/pino-palladino-bass-superman/", "page_content": "One of the most respected and admired bass players in music today, Pino Palladino has such an array of amazing bass chops and feel that it\u2019s almost ridiculous. Pino\u2019s ability to fit his unique style into any type of music and not only make it work but make it sound great is a rare skill indeed. It\u2019s the combination of these qualities that make Pino Palladino a bass superman.\n\nThe complete package, Pino can make it funky, melodic, and anything in between all the while serving the song perfectly. Never getting in the way of the other musicians, Pino always adds just the right feel to the track.\n\nPino Palladino\u2019s early years\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales on October 17, 1957, Palladino originally started on guitar, but at age 16 he picked up a friend\u2019s bass and realized that this was the instrument for him. Soon after, he bought a Fender Precision. Not long after that, he begins his journey as a professional bass player.\n\nHeavily influenced by James Jamerson , Stevie Wonder, Michael Henderson, Jaco Pastorius, and Paul Jackson, Pino begins to develop his own personal style and technique. After playing for a local Cardiff television station, Pino moves to London in 1980 to join a band led by Jools Holland of Squeeze. As Pino began to make a name for himself in London, he soon became a highly sought after session player.\n\nIt was around this time that Pino began using a fretless Music Man Stingray (another company started by Leo Fender). His highly expressive lead fretless bass line for Paul Young\u2019s cover of \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat (That\u2019s My Home)\u201d became an instant classic. Pino also worked with Gary Numan on his album I, Assassin. Numan has stated that he was blown away by Palladino\u2019s amazing bass playing. He\u2019s also said that his unusual fretless tone defined the album with its atmospheric and dreamy quality.\n\nPino leaves the fretless behind and meets D\u2019Angelo\n\nIn the early 1990s, Pino switched from his fretless Musicman Stingray to a fretted sunburst 1963 Fender Precision bass with La Bella flatwound strings. The change was both a musical and personal decision. Pino had grown tired of the lead fretless sound, and he also felt the need to return to his love of the old R&B and soul bass sound.\n\nAfter recording an album with Tom Jones and B.B. King, Pino caught the attention of neo-soul artist D\u2019Angelo who was looking for a certain bass sound for his new album, Voodoo. Palladino\u2019s greasy, fat, laid-back grooves on his \u201963 P-Bass gave the recording an old-school vibe that had a large impact not only on bassists but on entire rhythm sections in general. This led to many more session jobs in the neo-soul style for the now very in-demand bassist.\n\nPino\u2019s uncanny ability to adapt to any style and make it his own is what truly sets him apart from the ordinary session bassist. His amazing feel and intuition allow him to be both expressive and tasteful with his bass lines. Pino has stated that he has something he calls \u201ctrust chops,\u201d instincts that help him figure out what to play through difficult sections.\n\nNew Directions with The Who\n\nAfter the untimely 2002 death of the great bassist John Entwistle, the surviving members of The Who asked Palladino to play bass for the remainder of their tour. He\u2019s now their permanent bassist. Having played with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey previously made this very daunting task a little easier for him, Palladino also personally knew Entwistle.\n\nFor The Who gig, Pino started with both Fender Precision and Jazz basses, finally settling on Fender Jaguar basses, which he likes for their powerful cutting tone. He has said many times that playing with The Who is like a dream come true, and sometimes he can hardly believe that he\u2019s on stage with them.\n\nPino has stated that Pete Townshend had given him full freedom with the bass lines, although he tries to keep them as faithful to John\u2019s original lines as possible. In 2003, Pino started working with Paul Simon for his tour and recorded an album with him in 2006. For this gig, he used his fiesta red 1961 Fender Precision with flatwound strings.\n\nPino\u2019s recent work \u2013 and into the future\n\nPino Palladino\u2019s signature Precision Bass\n\nPalladino has also had the great honor of having Fender issue a signature bass in his name. The Fender Pino Palladino Precision Bass is a Custom Shop creation featuring a body modeled after his \u201961 Precision and the neck shape after his \u201963 P-Bass. The bass is finished in fiesta red over desert sand and given the relic treatment by the Custom Shop craftsmen.\n\nThe John Mayer Trio and many others\n\nDuring the Tsunami Aid benefit concert in 2005, Pino met guitarist John Mayer through drummer Steve Jordan. After original bassist Willie Weeks was unable to perform, Pino was asked to fill in for the concert. The three hit it off well in the studio. Pino later stated that there was instant chemistry between the three musicians. They later decided to form a power trio and set up some tour dates. The John Mayer Trio was born, and this gave Palladino a new opportunity to add creatively in a band context.\n\nIn 2006, Pino joined Jeff Beck for a tour and also worked with Eric Clapton, J.J. Cale, Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston on an album. He\u2019s also played with Robbie Robertson and Herbie Hancock and worked on a follow up to the Voodoo album with D\u2019Angelo entitled Black Messiah.\n\nAs clear evidence of Palladino\u2019s vast range and versatility, in 2013 he played on the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks and toured with the band as well.\n\nPino Palladino is probably the most sought after bassist in music today and for good reason. His bass chops, great tone, and musical instincts are unparalleled in the industry. We look forward to more great work from Pino for many years to come."}]}
