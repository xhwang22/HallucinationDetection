During the expedition against Persia, he served sometimes as a military commander, but he was probably a better organizer.\n\nYouth\n\nHephaestion\n\nAccording to a document that is included in Arrian of Nicomedia's Indik\u00ea,note[Quoted here.] Hephaestion was born in the capital of ancient Macedonia, Pella. His father Amyntor must have been an important man, because his son was educated at the court of king Philip (360-336). The Greek name of Hephaestion's father suggests that he was one of the Greek mercenary leaders or intellectuals who came to Macedonia and received an honorable treatment. (The father of Alexander's admiral and friend Nearchus is another example.)\n\nMieza, nymphaeum\n\nWhen he was still young, Hephaestion met the crown prince Alexander. Although an explicit connection between Hephaestion and the famous Macedonian scientist and philosopher Aristotle of Stagira is not mentioned in our best sources, we may assume that Hephaestion, like Alexander, was educated by Aristotle, whose school in the Nymphaeum of Mieza (below modern Naousa) was situated in one of the most beautiful and green parts of Macedonia. If we are to believe Diogenes Laertius, the author of several entertaining Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Aristotle published a collection of letters to Hephaestion,note[Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers 5.1.27.] which suggests that the two wrote to each other during Alexander's Persian campaign. However, Diogenes is not always a reliable author.\n\nAnatolia\n\nHephaestion is first mentioned at the very beginning of the histories of Alexander's Persian campaign, when the invaders reached Troy (May 334). He is never introduced as 'a friend' or 'a companion' of the king; he is simply mentioned, which suggests that the historians assumed that everybody knew Hephaestion's position as Alexander's lover. (We don't have to introduce Juliet once Romeo is on the stage.)\n\nAt Troy, Alexander venerated the ancient heroes. It is said that he went to the tomb of his legendary ancestor Achilles and that Hephaestion sacrificed to Achilles' friend Patroclus. Again, this suggests that Hephaestion was Alexander's lover, because in the fourth century, it was widely believed that the two legendary heroes had been lovers. (Homer states that they used to spend the night separately - a remark that is only meaningful when it was already taken for granted that the two were lovers.)\n\nIf the parallel between Achilles and Patroclus on the one hand and Alexander and Hephaestion on the other hand was really perfect, Hephaestion was - like Patroclus - older than his lover. Since Alexander was born in the summer of 356, we may assume that his friend was born in, say, 357.\n\nAfter the visit to Troy, Hephaestion disappears for some time from our sources. This suggests that he was with Alexander and did not occupy commands worth mentioning. It is only after the battle of Issus (November 333) that we reencounter Hephaestion in our sources, in a famous anecdote. After the Macedonian victory, queen Statira was captured. She went to Alexander and kneeled down in front of Hephaestion, thinking that he was the king. Alexander saved her face by saying \"Don't worry, mother. Everywhere, he is Alexander too\".\n\nDetail of the Alexander sarcophagus, probably Hephaestion\n\nIt is possible that Hephaestion is depicted on the Alexander sarcophagus. If the identification is correct, Hephaestion fought on horseback during the battle of Issus.\n\nThe Levant\n\nAlexander was now twenty-three and Hephaestion may have been twenty-four or older. According to the Macedonian and Greek ideas about love and sexuality, the time for homosexual affairs was over. The young men had to marry. Hephaestion could no longer be Alexander's lover, and had to find a new role, especially since the king accepted a Persian mistress, Barsine. However, the friendship between the two men remained very close.\n\nHephaestion was sent on a diplomatic mission to Sidon, where he had to appoint a new king. He chose a man named Abdalonymus. This was not a very important task, but it should be noted that he had not had earlier assignments. During the next year, he commanded the navy of the Phoenician towns that had sided with the conquerors; this meant that he had to supply the main force. This was a more important job. (It should be noted that these assignments are not mentioned in our most important source, Arrian.)\n\nDuring Alexander's stay in Egypt (first half 331), Hephaestion was approached by a friend of the Athenian politician Demosthenes, an enemy of the Macedonians. The envoy said that he hoped that Hephaestion would put in a good word for Demosthenes with Alexander. It is unclear whether Hephaestion was persuaded, or, if he was, what was the result.\n\nOn October 31, 331, the Macedonians and Persians fought a large battle at Gaugamela in northern Mesopotamia. Hephaestion was now one of the members of Alexander's bodyguard, the somatophylakes. (In fact, these seven men were not real bodyguards but adjutants.) During this bloody battle, he was wounded in an arm.\n\nThe Philotas Affair\n\nAgain, Hephaestion disappears from our sources for some time, except for an undated assignment as guard and protector of Persian captives. He becomes \"visible\" again in October 330, when several soldiers conspired against Alexander. Almost immediately, it became clear that the commander of the Companion cavalry (the best soldiers in the Macedonian army), Philotas, had known of the plans and had not reported his discovery.\n\nAt first, Alexander forgave Philotas, but the next day, the accusations were renewed by the phalanx commanders Craterus and Coenus, Philotas' brother-in-law. It is not known whether they had a secret agenda, but we may be suspicious, as we see two infantry commanders accusing the leading cavalry commander. During the night, Philotas was arrested.\n\nAs the army exercised capital jurisdiction in Macedonia, Alexander organized a trial. He accused Philotas and the court found him guilty of conspiracy. However, the precise nature of the conspiracy was unclear. Hephaestion, Craterus and Coenus declared that torture should be employed to force the truth out of Philotas. He confessed that he and his father had wanted to kill Alexander to become kings themselves. After this confession, the commander of the Companions was executed.\n\nWhat to make of this story? No one doubts that the first conspiracy was a fact, but the existence of the conspiracy of Philotas and Parmenion is another matter. The confession of the tortured man can, of course, not be taken as proof. On the other hand, it is strange that Philotas did not report the first conspiracy. It is possible that he wanted to see what happened: if the soldiers' attempt failed, nothing was lost, if it were successful, the army would chose him as its commander and king. He had much to gain, but the fact that he had a motive does not mean that he really did what he was accused of. We will never known what really happened.\n\nThe consequences of the murder were clear. In the first place, the execution of Philotas made the murder of his father Armenian inevitable - and in fact, he was killed. In the second place, the Companion cavalry was placed under two men: a safety measure against too powerful officers. The new commanders were Clitus, a trusted senior officer, and Hephaestion, who was still inexperienced.\n\nSogdia\n\nThe years 329, 328 and 327 saw fighting in Bactria and Sogdia, satrapies in the northeast of the Achaemenid Empire. Since most of the fighting was done on horseback, we would expect the commander of the Companion cavalry to be prominent in our sources, but Hephaestion is conspicuously absent. The reason is that the unit of Hephaestion and Clitus was too large for the guerilla warfare in Sogdia. It was divided into smaller units, and Hephaestion commanded only one of them. (It should be noted that Alexander killed Clitus, which would have made Hephaestion the senior commander of the Companions, an assignment that was probably still above his powers.)\n\nSo, Alexander was skeptical about Hephaestion's capacities as commander, but this did not mean that his friend was out of favor. He is mentioned as the official who had to secure provisions during the winter, an important task. Moreover, Hephaestion acted as Alexander's best man when he married with the native princess Roxane (text). But Hephaestion rarely served as commander during a fight; when he commanded an army that was to see battle, he was always sharing the command with a more experienced officer (e.g., Clitus, Artabazus, Perdiccas)."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Hephaestion/6000000011739086951", "page_content": "About Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion (Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Hephaistion; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"... by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\" This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion and Alexander\n\nAlexander had the reputation for being handsome and stood out among his peers by being clean shaven. Many portraits and sculptures were made in his lifetime, so we can be fairly convinced of his appearance. He was a prodigious athlete and loved strenuous exercise. He loved to show off by jumping off and back onto a chariot moving at full speed. Alexander was rather short and stocky, with one blue and one brown eye. His male lover Hephaestion was taller and even more handsome, so much so that the Persian queen bowed to Hephaestion instead of Alexander when she was presented to them. Alexander said to the mortified queen \"Never mind, Hephaestion is also Alexander\".\n\nAt the time Alexander lived, it was common for Greek men to have wives as well as lovers of either gender; wives were merely for procreation. Alexander, who had become King of Macedonia at the age of twenty when his father was assassinated, did not marry and produce an heir before he set out from Macedonia to conquer the Persians. He was not known to show much interest in women. Even at the height of his power, historians recount that he used his harem \u201csparingly.\u201d However, Alexander loved his boyhood friend, Hephaestion. Both brilliant adolescents, they were tutored by Aristotle by arrangement with Alexander\u2019s father. Aristotle instilled in the lads a great desire for knowledge and a love for philosophy. Thus Alexander became an avid reader. Hephaestion started off as a regular cavalry soldier and rose through the ranks on merit, carrying out important military and administrative assignments. Later, Alexander also took as a lover a male courtier from the conquered Persian court, scandalous not because the courtier was male, but because he was Persian, since most Greeks thought that all other people were barbarians.\n\nHephaestion and Alexander wanted their children to be cousins, so Hephaestion married the sister of Alexander\u2019s new wife, who was the daughter of the defeated Persian emperor Darius III (a purely political marriage).\n\nGreece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquests, which helped stimulate the economy and increased trade between the new areas of his empire.\n\nHowever, soon after Hephaestion and Alexander conquered Asia, Hephaestion died suddenly of typhus. Alexander's grief was boundless and devastating. He ordered an official observance of public mourning for his lover. It was recorded that for two days Alexander neither ate nor drank, cut his hair short and ordered that the horses in his army should have their manes cropped, as well. Alexander resolved that his lover should begin his life in the Unseen World with unstinted wealth, and the precious things he ordered stacked upon Hephaestion\u2019s funeral pile represented a sum of nearly two million and a half pounds sterling. Alexander declared publically that his relationship with Hephaestion was like that of Achilles to Patroclus, male lovers and bothers-at-arms mentioned in the Iliad \u2013 Hephaestion and Alexander had been inspired by them in their youthful studies with Aristotle. Alexander asked the Oracles of Egypt if Hephaestion was a god, because in those days a person could become a god through achievements. Alexander was told that Hephaestion was indeed a hero, albeit a lesser type of god. Alexander, who had no doubt about his own divinity, then knew that he would meet his beloved again in the Blessed Realm, where gods and heroes lived in eternity.\n\nWithin eight months of Hephaestion's death, Alexander died in Babylon, twelve days after contracting a fever. Historians propose that his death was the result of poisoned wine or contaminated water. In any event, he had yet to realize a series of campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia and the eventual conquering of the entire Mediterranean basin and all of Africa. It was his desire to conquer the entirety of the known world. He was 32 years old at the time of his death, and never defeated in battle.\n\nAlexander's lasting legacy was not his reign, but the cultural diffusion his conquests afforded. His establishment of Greek colonies (among them Kandahar in Afghanistan) and culture in the conquered lands resulted in a new Hellenistic culture, which was still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire until the mid 15th century. Alexander became the measure against which generals, even to this day, compare themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactical exploits.\n\nhttps://gayinfluence.blogspot.com/search/label/Alexander%20the%20Great"}, {"url": "http://artandpopularculture.com/Hephaestion", "page_content": "From The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia\n\nHephaestion (Greek: Template:Polytonic, alternative spelling: \"Hephaistion\"; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great.

It lies in what was once the ancient city of Amphipolis, conquered by Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, in 357 BC, and dates back to the fourth century B.C. The tomb, measuring 500 metres (1,640 feet) in circumference, was found to contain sculptures of caryatids, an ornate mosaic, and coins featuring the face of Alexander the Great.\n\nHead archaeologist Katerina Peristeri long suggested that the tomb may have been commissioned for a general in Alexander the Great\u2019s army. However, the discovery of rosettes painted in blue, red, and yellow, which are similar to those found on the coffin from the tomb believed to belong to Philip II, Alexander the Great\u2019s father, suggested that the tomb at Amphipolis may have instead belonged to a Macedonian royal, with the most popular theory pointing to Olympias, Alexander\u2019s mother.\n\nAmphipolis Tomb by Greektoys.org (update) on Sketchfab.\n\nNew inscriptions found\n\nGreek news site Ekathimerini reports that new evidence has emerged that may finally solve the mystery of the tomb\u2019s original owner.\n\nDuring a conference in Thessaloniki, Peristeri and her head architect Michalis Lefantzis announced that they found three inscriptions within the Amphipolis tomb with the monogram of Hephaestion, a general, and the closest friend of Alexander the Great. The inscriptions are project contracts for the construction of the monument.\n\nAccording to the Greek Reporter , the inscriptions suggest that the monument was commissioned by a powerful individual of that era, and Peristeri maintains that individual may have been Alexander himself.\n\nThe monogram of Hephaestion found in three separate inscriptions within the Amphipolis tomb.

He was entrusted with many important roles, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements.\n\nWhen Hephaestion died suddenly in Ecbatana, Iran, in 324 BC, Alexander petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant him divine status, and organized an elaborate funeral at Babylon, in which Hephaestion was said to have been cremated in the presence of the entire army.

During the expedition against Persia, he served sometimes as a military commander, but he was probably a better organizer.\n\nHephaestion\n\nWith Perdiccas, Hephaestion led an army along the river Kabul and across the Khyber pass into the Punjab (Spring 326). Here, they captured a town named Peucelaotis Indian Puskal\u0101vat\u012b, north of Peshawar). They continued to the Indus, where they built a bridge near Hund and negotiated with king Omphis (Ambhi) of Taxila, an ally of the Macedonians.\n\nHephaestion's cavalry unit took part in the battle on the banks of the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum; May 326), where king Porus (Puru) of Pauravas was defeated. After his surrender, Alexander reappointed him as ruler of his own kingdom. However, one of his relatives, also called Porus, continued the struggle and Hephaestion was sent out against him. This time, his fellow-commander was one Demetrius.\n\nHydaspes, possible location of the battlefield\n\nAlexander wanted to attack the Indian kingdom Magadha in the Ganges valley, but the Macedonian soldiers refused to go any further. They were far away from home in a country where it seemed to be raining continuously (it was the monsoon season). Shortly before Alexander's thirtieth birthday, an open revolt broke out. The king understood that he had to return. Hephaestion was ordered to built a garrison town on the banks of the river Acesines (modern Chenab), where veteran mercenaries were left behind.\n\nThe Macedonian army was now divided into three columns. Alexander took charge of the main force, which was transported on ships and moved slowly to the south. Craterus commanded the second column (on the west bank of the river), and Hephaestion was responsible for the third one. No fighting was expected, and therefore, this could be Hephaestion's first sole command.\n\nAlexander\n\nThis also meant that Craterus and Hephaestion operated as far apart as possible. There are several indications that Alexander's best commander and his best friend were not on speaking terms. The difference between them was summarized as follows: Hephaestion was philalexandros (a lover of Alexander), Craterus a philobasileus (a lover of the king). The details of their rivalry are, however, poorly understood. In June 325, Alexander put an end to the quarrel by ordering Craterus' army to go to the west.\n\nWhen the two remaining army columns reached the delta of the Indus river, Hephaestion was ordered to build a new city, Patala. This is what the Greek sources tell us, but it is probably better to say that he rebuilt an existing settlement, because P\u00e2t\u00e2la is the Indian word for Ship's camp. Here, Nearchus (another personal friend of Alexander) built a large fleet, which was to transport a large part of the army to Babylonia.\n\nIn August, Alexander and some 33,000 men left Patala and started for Carmania. During their march, they built a large grain store, where Nearchus and the 33,000 men under his command could resupply themselves. Alexander's men first defeated the Oreitans, the native population, and Hephaestion, who commanded the baggage train, was ordered to build a new city, Rhambaceia (modern Las Bela). Leonnatus was left behind to defend the region; after all, Nearchus still had to pass along the shore and the grain store had to be kept intact.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexander and the main part of the army moved to the west. They had to march through the Gedrosian desert, which is more or less equivalent to the south of modern Beluchistan. The Macedonians knew that this country could only be crossed in the weeks after the monsoons rains; they would arrive in Carmania when the harvest was ready. To profit from this favorable conditions, Alexander had to hurry.\n\nThe journey through the Gedrosian desert was a disaster. For sixty days, the army was marching through the desert, and the blazing heat and the lack of water caused innumerable casualties. Baggage animals had to be butchered. Probably the army itself remained relatively intact, but the concubines of the soldiers, the merchants and other noncombatants suffered terribly form hunger and thirst (text). Since Hephaestion followed after Alexander, the misery of his men must have been worse: after all, the vanguard had seized all food they it find.\n\nIn December 325, the armies of Alexander, Hephaestion, Nearchus and Craterus reunited in Carmania. This was a time for celebration. Alexander dressed himself as the god of ecstasy, Dionysus, his mythological ancestor, and the rest of the army followed suit - everybody being in a state of drunken exaltation for seven days (text.)\n\nWreath or diadem\n\nThe army continued its march to the west and reached Susa, where Alexander, his officers and his men had a holiday. There were festivities and valiant soldiers were decorated. Some received purple tunics, and there were golden diadems for Nearchus, for Leonnatus (who had defeated the Oreitans), for Peucestas (who had saved Alexander's life in India), and for Hephaestion. Nobody objected to the coronation, which comes as a surprise, because six years before, many had considered it outrageous that Alexander started to wear a diadem.\n\nThe greatest of the festivities in Susa was a marriage ceremony that lasted five days. Since Alexander had conquered Babylonia, Elam and Persia proper in 331/330, many Persian princesses had had a Greek education; now they were ready to marry Macedonian officers. Dancers, actors and musicians had come all the way from Greece to add glamor to the event.\n\nAlexander himself married Achaemenid princesses from two dynastic lines: Barsine, a daughter Darius III Codomannus, and Parysatis, a daughter of Artaxerxes III Ochus. Hephaestion married another daughter of Darius III, Drypetis. Other commanders married princesses of lesser rank (text).\n\nPharnaces (central relief of the North Stairs of the Apadana, Persepolis)\n\nIn these days, Hephaestion was also appointed as chiliarchos, \"vizier\", and Ptolemy became Alexander's edeatros, \"taster\": both were Greek names for old Persian court functions. According to the Persian customs, Hephaestion was entitled to a walking stick and golden earrings, as can be seen on the picture of Pharnaces, who had been vizier (hazarapati\u0161) almost two centuries earlier.\n\nIn the summer of 324, Alexander and Hephaestion commanded army groups in Elam and the south of Babylonia: not for fighting, but to find out the course of the main rivers and the coasts. Alexander's next plan was a naval expedition to Arabia, and it was imperative to control the coastal area. Besides, there were many recruits from Iran, who needed to be trained.\n\nAs vizier, Hephaestion was responsible for many things, and his decisions about the royal correspondence may have been the cause of a conflict with Eumenes, the secretary of Alexander. However, our sources are silent about the details of their rivalry. The only thing we know for certain is that Alexander ordered them a reconciliation.\n\nLate in the summer, Alexander went to the north, to visit Ecbatana, one of the capitals of his empire. He was received by Atropates, the satrap of Media. As usual, there was a drinking party, but this time it had a sad consequence: Hephaestion fell ill and died (October 324). Drypetis and Alexander were shocked, and Eumenes - seizing the opportunity to get into Alexander's good books - proposed to give divine honors to the dead hero, who was cremated in Babylon.\n\nLion hunt mosaic\n\nPlutarch of Chaeronea writes that Alexander once remarked that without him, Hephaestion would be nothing. This was true. Hephaestion was a competent officer, but was lacking the brilliance of rival commanders like Parmenion and Craterus. He was a skilled diplomat and a great organizer, but he did not speak his foreign languages like Peucestas and did not write as beautiful as Eumenes. However, he was closer to the king's heart, and this must have made his position very, very difficult: all court officials envied him. This made him an isolated man, who was completely dependent on the king. Therefore, Alexander could completely rely on Hephaestion."}], "Hephaestion was a general in the army of Alexander the Great.": [{"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/Hephaestion/", "page_content": "Hephaestion was a member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard and the Macedonian king's closest and lifelong friend and advisor. So much so, Hephaestion's death would bring the young king to tears. From 334 to 323 BCE Alexander the Great conquered much of the known world. He led his army on a ten-year odyssey across Asia Minor and into Persia, Egypt and India. Eventually, after his defeat of Darius III, he became the self-proclaimed King of Asia. Of course, he could not have done this without the support of his loyal army and staff of skilled officers \u2013 Ptolemy I, Perdiccas, and Craterus, but above all others, Hephaestion.\n\nEarly Life\n\nThe son of Amyntas, Hephaestion was raised in the Macedonian capital of Pella and according to most sources born in 356 BCE, the same year as the king. Being from an aristocratic family, as were many of the staff officers who would follow Alexander into Asia, he became a student, alongside Alexander, of the philosopher Aristotle at Mieza, a city west of Pella. His intelligence impressed the Athenian academic, and, like the king, they would correspond with each other during the long Persian campaign.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHephaestion was Alexander's closest & most loyal companion throughout the great king's military campaigns.\n\nHephaestion was considered handsome by many, and Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon, regarded him as an excellent influence on his son. Shortly after Philip married Cleopatra, the future king became concerned about his position as successor. A disagreement erupted between Philip and Alexander, a dispute fueled by his friends. Because of this, many of Alexander's friends were sent into exile; however, because of Philip's respect for Hephaestion, he was spared this humiliation.\n\nOn Campaign\n\nIn 334 BCE, after regaining the loyalties of many of the Greek city-states \u2013 especially following the razing of Thebes \u2013 Alexander and his army crossed the Hellespont on the first leg of their conquest of Persia. However, before clashing with the Persian army at River Granicus, Alexander chose to visit the tomb of his hero (and supposed ancestor) Achilles at Troy (a small village at the time of Alexander). Such was his fascination with the hero, the king always slept with a copy of Homer's Iliad under his pillow. With him at Troy, of course, was, among others, Hephaestion who laid a wreath at the tomb of Achilles' friend Patroclus. Indeed, many saw the relationship of Alexander and Hephaestion to be akin to that of Achilles and Patroclus. Later, the two men stood side-by-side as Alexander severed the Gordian Knot. Because of this unique closeness, many officers grew extremely jealous. Oddly enough, this jealousy was not limited to the staff for Olympias, Alexander's overly-protective mother, also resented the relationship.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHephaestion's friendship with Alexander would eventually enable him to be appointed chiliarch or second-in-command. Although there is considerable disagreement among contemporary sources, many within the army did not believe Hephaestion to have the necessary leadership or military skills; in fact, some fail to mention any active participation in several of the major battles (although he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Gaugamela); however, luckily for Alexander, he demonstrated a talent for organization. Alexander would leave much of the campaign's logistics to Hephaestion \u2013 the supply and transportation of equipment, bridge building and even the establishment and planning of new settlements.\n\nAlexander the Great (Facial Reconstruction) Arienne King (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nRivalry & Special Position\n\nOne officer, Craterus, grew to deeply resent Hephaestion (the feeling was mutual), and Alexander had to separate the two on more than one occasion. At one point in India, they had actually drawn swords. Alexander was forced to reprimand them both, scolding Hephaestion and telling him he would be nothing without Alexander. (Historians disagree on the meaning of this statement.) It was often said that Craterus was a friend of the king, but Hephaestion was a friend of Alexander. In his Greek Lives historian Plutarch wrote:\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\n\u2026 he (Alexander) loved Hephaestion best, but respected Craterus most, he was constantly saying that in his opinion while Hephaestion was loyal to Alexander, Craterus was loyal to the king. This helps to explain why there was bad feeling festering between the two of them, so that they often clashed.\n\nLater, Plutarch said that the king brought the two together and made them friends again but gave each a warning \u2013 he would kill both of them if he ever found them quarrelling again. In the end, Craterus would return to Macedonia, eventually dying in 321 BCE during the Wars of the Diadochi after Alexander's death.\n\nThis intimate relationship between Hephaestion and Alexander can also be seen in an incident after the Battle of Issus and the defeat of Darius III. The Persian king ran from the field of battle and escaped capture, leaving his army to suffer a devastating rout. Unfortunately for his mother, wife, and daughters, they were left behind along with abundant riches; Darius would eventually appeal unsuccessfully for their safe return. Realizing the fate of most prisoners of war, especially women, and expecting the worse, Darius' mother, Sisygambis, feared for their safety, and as Alexander and Hephaestion entered the tent, she threw herself before the taller and more handsome Hephaestion, begging for her life. In his The Campaigns of Alexander historian Arrian related the story.\n\n\u2026 Darius' mother, in doubt owing to the similarity of their dress, which of the two was the King, prostrated herself before Hephaestion because he was taller than his companion. Hephaestion stepped back, and one of the Queen's attendant's rectified her mistake by pointing to Alexander; the Queen withdrew in profound embarrassment, but Alexander merely remarked that her error was of no account, for Hephaestion, too, was an Alexander.\n\nArrian added that whether or not the incident was true, the young king should be admired for his respect and confidence in a friend \u2013 but it also speaks for the nature of Alexander's character.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nNaval Command\n\nAfter Issus, Hephaestion was placed in charge of Alexander's naval reinforcements, ordered to follow the army's progress along the Mediterranean coast from Gaza to the city Pelusium on the Egyptian delta \u2013 the latter's governor surrendered both the city and its entire treasury without a fight. In another test of Alexander's confidence in Hephaestion, the king placed him in charge of replacing the old, deposed Persian ruler of the newly seized port city of Sidon with another governor. A member of the old royal family Abdalorymus was quickly found and given the governorship. Next, Hephaestion led the fleet up the Nile River to the Egyptian capital of Memphis where he, Ptolemy, Craterus and Alexander studied Egyptian law and customs. Prior to the final battle against Darius at Gaugamela, Alexander placed Hephaestion in charge of a squadron to scout the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and build a bridge. Wisely, he did not complete the bridge until the arrival of Alexander, fearing that the Persians would destroy it. Aside from the mention of his wound received, sources do not mention Hephaestion again until the conspiracy trial of Philotas.\n\nCities Named Alexandria by Alexander the Great Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nLoyalty to Alexander\n\nBefore marching into India and prior to their expedition into Bactria, there was major unrest within the army. The veterans were weary and wanted to return home to Macedonia and their families. Also, many staff officers disagreed with the king on many of his atypical decisions \u2013 his adoption of Persian customs and attire as well as his wish that they prostrate themselves before him and kiss his ring. They especially resented both the addition of Persians into the army and being asked to take Persian wives. However, unlike many others, Hephaestion always supported Alexander's decisions even with the idea of taking a Persian wife and he was given one of the daughters of Darius, Drypatis, while Alexander chose the other daughter, Barsine, as his mistress.\n\nHowever, Hephaestion's loyalty to Alexander was best demonstrated during the would-be mutiny against Alexander. In 330 BCE Hephaestion, along with Craterus, spoke against Philotas, the suspected ringleader of the plot, convincing the king that he and the other conspirators should be tortured and executed - this execution also included Parmenio, Philotas' father and the long-time commander from the court of Philip. Afterwards, Alexander rewarded Hephaestion by splitting the command of the Companions between him and Cleitus.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nPortraits of Alexander and a Youth (Hephaestion?) Caroline Cervera (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nDuring the campaign in India, Hephaestion led a large force through the Khyber Pass subduing any rebellious Indian tribes. Next, Perdiccas and he took half the Companions, the mercenary cavalry, the baggage train and several Indian engineers to build a bridge across the Indus (this same bridge would be used to ford the Hydaspes). When lines of communication were secured, they rejoined Alexander and prepared to cross the Indus and face King Porus \u2013 at the Hydaspes Hephaestion would be placed in command of one squadron. After the victory against Porus, Hephaestion split with Alexander reconnecting later and battling against the Mallians \u2013 it was here that Alexander was injured and near death. Finally, he could go no farther; Alexander succumbed to the wishes of his troops and decided to return northward to Babylon.\n\nDeath\n\nThey spent the summer and fall at Ecbatana where, after a night of heavy drinking, Hephaestion developed a high fever \u2013 Alexander would remain by his friend's side until he showed signs of recovery. Unfortunately, Hephaestion soon relapsed, and in October of 324 BCE, he died (any possibility of poisoning has been dismissed). Alexander would die himself eight months later. The king spent the next two days in tears, grieving for the death of his friend. Besides cutting off his own hair, he ordered the manes and tails of all the horses cut off as well. A state of mourning was declared, sacrifices were made, and sacred fires were lit. Unfortunately, it was a sad day for Hephaestion's doctor, Glaucius, who was executed for his failure to keep his patient alive. Hephaestion's body would eventually be sent to Babylon where a giant pyre was built. Alexander sent an envoy to Siwa to request Hephaestion be declared a god, but the request was refused; he would only be honored as a divine hero. Plutarch wrote:\n\n\u2026he (Alexander) had the wretched doctor impaled on a stake and banned playing the pipes and all music in the camp for a considerable period of time, until he received an oracle from Ammon, telling him to worship Hephaestion as a hero and to institute sacrificial rituals in his honour.\n\nAlthough some sources claim that Hephaestion and Alexander were more than just good friends, most agree that their relationship was unique and strengthened both men. Throughout his life, Hephaestion remained close to the king, serving both as a valuable advisor and friend. Whether or not he was a capable commander is irrelevant, his abilities in logistics assisted in the defeat of the Persians and their king Darius III."}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/what-was-real-relationship-between-alexander-great-and-hephaestion-006263", "page_content": "Alexander the Great was known as a womanizer \u2013 his list of romances quite extensive. However, some researchers suggest that he also fell in love with at least two men, one of them being Hephaestion, a General in Alexander\u2019s Army.\n\nResearchers cannot make empirical studies to be sure about the thoughts and feelings of the people who lived in the times of Alexander the Great. At most, they can only make deductions from the historical records that are available. All that really exists is a puzzle, which researchers try to interpret and put together.\n\nThe companion of brothers\n\nHephaestion was born, like Alexander, in around 365 BC. He was a son of Amyntor, a noble man of Macedonia. Hephaestion was a friend, companion and a general in the army of Alexander. According to the ancient resources, he had a special bond with the king. He was described as his dearest friend, the person who was witness to the most significant moments in Alexander's life, but also the one with whom the king shared his most personal secrets.\n\nHead of Hephaistion sculpted in marble. Statue is at the Getty Museum in California. ( Public Domain )\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion spent time with each other nearly their whole lives, until the death of Hephaestion in 324 BC. They traveled, fought in battlefields and experienced many adventures together. Alexander is said to have felt a strong bond with him also due to his sensitivity, love of literature and intelligence. When Hephaestion died, Alexander\u2019s life collapsed. As a ruler, he didn't have too many people who he could trust. It seems that he believed in the loyalty his mother Olympias, Hephaestion, and his friend Ptolemy, future pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter. According to some later writings, Alexander felt extreme loneliness after the death of his dear friend, and he himself died just a few months after the burial of Hephaestion.\n\nFriends or Lovers?\n\nThroughout history, the Greek male friendship may be considered somewhat unique. Greek men could love their best friends like brothers and like family, and their way of treating each other could often be misinterpreted.\n\nAt the same time, Ancient Greek military forces (for example, the Spartans), believed that homosexual sex made bonds between the soldiers stronger. This same-sex interaction was a very popular topic to many ancient authors. The great philosopher Plato in his work Symposium wrote that the interlocutor Phaedrus made a comment on the importance of sexual relationships between men, which improves the brotherhood and bravery on the battlefield. Many researchers interpreted his interest in this topic as confirmation that he was in such a relationship with Socrates, although there is no evidence to support this theory.\n\nThe Warren Cup, portraying a mature bearded man and a youth on its \"Greek\" side ( Public Domain )\n\nAccording to the Paul Cartledge, a Professor of Greek History in the University of Cambridge, who described his theory of Alexander the Great: The Hunt for a New Past:\n\n''The question of Alexander's sexuality--his predominant sexual orientation--has enlivened, or bedeviled, much Alexander scholarship. That he loved at least two men there can be little doubt. The first was the Macedonian noble Hephaestion, a friend from boyhood, whom he looked on--and may actually have referred to--as his alter ego. The Persian queen mother, it was said, once mistook the taller Hephaestion for Alexander, who graciously excused her blushes by murmuring that 'he too is Alexander'. Whether Alexander's relationship with the slightly older Hephaestion was ever of the sort that once dared not speak its name is not certain, but it is likely enough that it was. At any rate, Macedonian and Greek mores would have favored an actively sexual component rather than inhibiting or censoring it. Like hunting, homosexuality was thought to foster masculine, especially martial, bravery.''\n\nIf we follow this way of thinking, there was at least one more man who could have been the male lover of Alexander. His name was Bagoas and he was a Persian eunuch. However, it is impossible to really know the truth of their relationship as there is no direct information about the sexual preferences of Alexander.\n\n'Bagoas pleads on behalf of Nabarzanes' ( Public Domain )\n\nSearching for the truth\n\nHomosexuality was a norm in the ancient times, but in the case of Alexander the Great and Hephaestion, it is hard to rationally conclude what the true relationship was between them. Even if they were lovers, the beliefs and perceptions about homosexual relationships was definitely different than the way it is considered today. However, the author of this article doubts the theory that Alexander and Hephaestion were in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving. ( Public Domain )\n\nAfter the death of Hephaestion, Alexander decided to build an impressive monument in his memory in Macedonia. Currently it is suggested that the Amphipolis tomb could have been built in memory of Hephaestion. It is also possible that the ashes of the great friend of Alexander were brought there from the desert in Persia. The answer to the question of what was between Alexander and Hephaestion remains buried in their graves.\n\nTop image: A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes. ( Public Domain )\n\nBy Natalia Klimczak"}, {"url": "https://totallyhistory.com/alexander-and-hephaestion/", "page_content": "Battle of the Hydaspes by Charles Le Brun, with Alexander in a blue cloak and Hephaestionin in a red cloak\n\nHephaestion was a general in Alexander the Great\u2019s army and was the closest friend of the famous conqueror. He was born around 356 B.C., in Pella, to a general in Philip II\u2019s army. Hephaestion was believed to be the same age as Alexander.\n\nBeginnings of the Friendship\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion grew up together and became good friends. When the time came that Alexander had to be removed from his maternal uncle\u2019s care and given over to the philosopher Aristotle for his education, Hephaestion came along with him. For three years, the two boys, along with other sons of prominent people, studied logic, morals, religion, art, and philosophy. These three years of studying had impressed themselves on the mind of the young Macedonian, and later, he would designate his childhood friends as his officers in his army\u2019s elite cavalry, called the Companions. Of all his officers, though, he chose Hephaestion as the leader.\n\nIn 340 B.C, when Alexander was just sixteen years old, his father, Philip II, had to march his troops to fight in Byzantium. Philip called for his son to head home to Pella and serve as regent. Alexander thus had to stop his education under Aristotle and head home. Philip\u2019s absence emboldened the nearby Maedi tribe to rise up in revolt, and Alexander\u2019s leadership and combat skills were tested. This test turned out to be an early indication of Alexander\u2019s capability as a commander, as he easily defeated the rebels and chased them off from their homeland. He ordered a new city built on the defeated tribe\u2019s land and named it Alexandroupolis.\n\nHephaestion\u2019s Presence in Alexander\u2019s Campaigns\n\nWhen Alexander set foot in the city of Troy, he paid homage to the tomb of his cherished childhood hero, Achilles. Aristotle had taught him well about Homer\u2019s Iliad, and so now, Alexander placed a wreath on Achilles\u2019 tomb. Meanwhile, Hephaestion placed a wreath on top of Patroclus\u2019 tomb. After this, the two ran a race while naked as a form of worship for their heroes. In Homer\u2019s epic poem, the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is non-sexual, but in later times, such as that of Alexander, the relationship was taken to be sexual. Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s act of placing wreaths on the two heroes could have been their way of flaunting to the public their romantic relationship.\n\nThe family of Darius in front of Alexander, Hephaestion pointing out Alexander\n\nWhen Alexander crushed the army of King Darius III of Persia, the Persian king fled, leaving not only his harem behind but also his mother, Sisygambis. Sisygambis then acknowledged the conquerors by bowing before Hephaestion, thinking that he was Alexander the Great. She begged for him to spare the women\u2019s lives, and the Companions started to laugh at the situation. Alexander gestured to the Companions to stop, then took Sisygambis\u2019 hand and helped her up. He said to her that she had not made a mistake after all, because Hephaestion was Alexander too. Sisygambis\u2019 mistake was most probably due to Hephaestion\u2019s good looks. She must have thought that a conquering king should look strikingly good. And Hephaestion was \u2014 he was not only taller than Alexander but also more attractive. The latter did not have the dashing good looks that one might expect to see on a king. He was broad and relatively short, with a thin beard. His skin color was reddish, one of his eyes was blue, and the other was brown.\n\nAlexander soon planned to march into India and arrive at the Ganges River. However, it had been eight years since his army had been on the move, and he had badly wanted to return home and rest. His veteran soldiers eventually launched a revolt at the Hyphasis River, and Alexander was forced to obey his men\u2019s will and march towards Susa, east of the Tigris. When they arrived in the city, Alexander offered to pay his veterans and send them back home. The veterans felt they were being dismissed, so they criticized Alexander for letting many Persians fight along with them in the Macedonian army. The argumentation went on for three days before Alexander decided to relieve his veterans of their military titles and give them to his Persian men. This move shocked the Macedonian soldiers and put a stop to their protestations. Alexander eventually threw a feast for all his men, where they settled their differences. At this feast, Alexander had Hephaestion and his men marry Persian women of nobility.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Lack of Interest in Women\n\nAlexander had two wives, Roxana, a Bactrian princess, and Stateira II, daughter of Darius III. While his marriage to Stateira may have been a political move, his marriage to Roxana must have been out of love, if only because it had no great political use. However, people did not fail to notice that Alexander only had both women pregnant much later, near his death. Also, Alexander was observed to not have been enthusiastic about the enormous harem he inherited from Darius. On top of all this, he was apparently fond of a eunuch slave named Bagoas, whom he kissed in front of people. The Roman historian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, commented that Alexander disliked pleasures that females offered and that as a result, his mother worried about having no heir to the throne. Even Diogenes the Cynic once commented that Alexander had only been defeated by Hephaestion\u2019s thighs.\n\nThe Death of Hephaestion\n\nWhen Alexander left the feast and headed for the city of Ecbatana, Hephaestion grew weak and developed a fever. Alexander rushed back to see his friend, but Hephaestion stayed in bed, frail for seven days and being taken care of by doctors. Later, it looked like Hephaestion started to recover, and he even had a meal, the first he had in days. This improvement in Hephaestion\u2019s condition made Alexander think his friend would eventually regain his strength. He left his friend\u2019s bedside and headed over to the games being held in the city. But Hephaestion\u2019s condition became worse than before he took the meal. Alexander was informed about the situation, and he rushed back to his friend, only to see him already dead when he arrived. During that time, people suspected that Hephaestion\u2019s meal was laced with poison. They believed that when he started to regain his strength, there was no reason he should fall ill again. However, some scholars have offered the possibility that Hephaestion must have suffered from typhoid, which must have left painful ulcers in his intestines. The food he ate probably caused these ulcers to burst, causing him to bleed from the inside.\n\nDespite this possibility, some still believe that Hephaestion died of poisoning. Like all powerful men, Alexander was surrounded by people with secret agendas, and these people knew that Hephaestion was very dear to him. Therefore, if anyone wanted to make Alexander suffer, they could do it by killing his closest friend. Moreover, some people criticized Alexander for why he allowed Hephaestion to peek at his personal letters while he was reading them.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Grief\n\nWhatever caused Hephaestion\u2019s death, the Greek historian Plutarch wrote that Alexander suffered from uncontrollable grief. Another Greek historian, Arrian, wrote that Alexander laid on top of his dead friend\u2019s body and cried all day. He added that Alexander did not eat for two days following Hephaestion\u2019s death. Then, Alexander ordered all music to be stopped and all horses\u2019 tails and hair be cut off. He even had Hephaestion\u2019s doctors crucified for their failure. Like his beloved hero, Achilles, who placed some strands of his hair on Patroclus\u2019 hand before the cremation, Alexander cut some of his hair and placed it on Hephaestion\u2019s hands.\n\nAlexander decreed a period of grieving across his whole kingdom and sought to have his friend proclaimed as a god. Ancient people believed that after a person died, he would go to a certain place. Alexander must have reasoned that since he considered himself a god and would undoubtedly be proclaimed a god after his death, it should only be appropriate that his friend be proclaimed a god too. In his mind, this would ensure that when he died, he would surely go to the place where Hephaestion was and see him again. However, the Oracle said that Hephaestion was only a divine hero and could not be declared a god. Alexander accepted this and immediately ordered the construction of temples in his friend\u2019s memory. It was only then that Hephaestion\u2019s funeral commenced, with Alexander preparing in his mind a magnificent and expensive funeral for Hephaestion.\n\nHephaestion\u2019s Funeral\n\nHephaestion\u2019s body was mummified and placed in a coffin. Alexander then ordered the architect Stasicrates to design a funeral pyre so elaborate that it took the architect six months to build it. The structure stood 60 meters high and covered 200 square meters, made up of enormous wooden pillars and rising up to seven floors. The sarcophagus of Hephaestion sat at the top of the structure. On the day of the funeral, soldiers, family, and friends came together in front of the magnificent structure that was to be burned down in a matter of minutes. It was at sunrise when Alexander touched the foot of the structure with his torch and set it on fire. The blaze was accompanied by the voices of singers singing songs of lamentation for Alexander\u2019s most precious friend.\n\nAround twelve months after Hephaestion died, Alexander started to weaken with a fever, which may have been caused by typhoid, malaria, or poison. He grew weaker over the following two weeks and eventually died."}, {"url": "https://brewminate.com/hephaestion-closest-companion-to-alexander-the-great/", "page_content": "Hephaestion marble head. / Photo courtesy Getty Museum, Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhen Hephaestion died suddenly at Ecbatana, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief.\n\nCurated/Reviewed by Matthew A. McIntosh\n\nPublic Historian\n\nBrewminate\n\nIntroduction\n\nHephaestion (c.356 BCE \u2013 October 324 BCE), son of Amyntor, was an ancient Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \u201cby far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\u201d[3] This relationship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nHis military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander\u2019s ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia.\n\nWhen he died suddenly at Ecbatana[4] around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon.[5] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion\u2019s memory.\n\nYouth and Education\n\nThe emblema of the Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic, along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander\u2019s companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[7] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201cone day when Alexander was 15 years old \u2026 sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa \u2026 and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[8] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[9] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[10] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his alleged pupil to send letters throughout Alexander\u2019s expanding empire to converse with him.\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[11] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[12] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.\n\nCareer\n\nOverview\n\nSharing Alexander\u2019s upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II\u2019s Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander\u2019s Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander\u2019s other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\nWars in Persia\n\nThe Battle of Issus by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1529. / Photo courtesy Alte Pinakothek, Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \u201cauthorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office\u201d.[13] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion\u2019s choice.\n\nAfter the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[14] Hephaestion\u2019s task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.\n\nPlutarch, while writing about Alexander\u2019s correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[15] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens\u2019 inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \u201cIf he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\u201d[15]\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander\u2019s governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \u201cIt is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus\u2019 reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\u201d[16]\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion\u2019s rank. He is called the \u201ccommander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes)\u201d.[17] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[18][19]\n\nAfter Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \u201cThe following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\u201d[20] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion\u2019s tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[21]\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas\u2019 former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander\u2019s policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip\u2019s older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[22] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[23]\n\nExpedition into India\n\nA painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes. / Photo courtesy The Pipe Organ Project, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion\u2019s orders were to \u201ctake over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing\u201d.[24] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[25]\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion\u2019s, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[26] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[27] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[28] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \u201chonorary trierarchs\u201d, indicating his leading position at this time.[29] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion\u2019s section marched \u201cfive days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which \u2026 might be rapidly moving forward\u201d.[30] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[31] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[32]\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[33] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[34] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander\u2019s de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \u201cto command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held\u201d.[35]\n\nRelationships\n\nAlexander\n\nThe family of Darius in front of Alexander with Hephaestion behind him, by Justus Sustermans and preserved in the Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer. In this picture we can see Hephaestion point out Alexander. / Photo courtesy Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer, Wikimedia Commons\n\nLittle is known of Hephaestion\u2019s personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[3] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander\u2019s becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages.\n\nTheir tutor Aristotle described friendship in general as \u201cone soul abiding in two bodies\u201d.[36] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the Battle of Issus. Diodorus,[37] Arrian[38] and Curtius[39] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying \u201cYou were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\u201d[39] Their affection for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander\u2019s mother, Olympias, said \u201cyou know that Alexander means more to us than anything\u201d.[40] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion\u2019s death, described him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life\u201d.[41] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \u201cAlexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\u201d[42]\n\nAside from their strong personal bond, theirs was also a working partnership in that all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. It is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion\u2019s career, of Alexander\u2019s constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[43] a lack of sympathy with Alexander\u2019s aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[44] and of sheer incompetence.[45] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.\n\nHephaestion played a full part in Alexander\u2019s regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes, and plans. Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets;[46] and Plutarch describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented.[47] According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander\u2019s first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch-bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander\u2019s policies as Alexander\u2019s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one among the Macedonians.\n\nBy the time they returned to Persia, Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander\u2019s second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship as follows: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\u201d,[48] and \u201cAt the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\u201d[49]\n\nBusts of Alexander (left) and Hephaestion (right). / Photo courtesy Getty Museum, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers, though hardly any of Alexander\u2019s extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refers to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander\u2019s friend,[51][52] consistent with Hephaestion\u2019s epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[53] It has been observed, however, that the ancient Greek word for friend \u201c\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\u201d (Philos) was also applied to lovers in the homo-erotic or sexual sense. [54]\n\nFurthermore, Arrian and Plutarch describe the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with the Homeric figures of Achilles and Patroclus. At the onset of the campaign in Asia, Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland and Hephaestion did the same with the tomb of Patroclus,[55] and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes.[56] Arrian and Plutarch draw no conclusions from this; however, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being in a homosexual relationship as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and Patroclus had sexual relations. Martin and Blackwell further suggest this concept was theorized by unspecified \u201clater authors\u201d,[51] who include, however, such eminent writers as Aeschylus[57] and Plato[58] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s time. Attic orator Aeschines, who was contemporary with them (albeit somewhat older), explicitly addressed the question in these terms: \u201c\u2026Homer, though he often speaks of Patroclus and Achilles, is silent about love and gives no name to their friendship; he thinks that the remarkable strength of their affection is obvious to the cultivated among his audience.\u201d[59] Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn from Martin and Blackwell\u2019s: \u201cIt was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion\u2019s first mention in Alexander\u2019s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander\u2019s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\u201d[60]\n\nHephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time in which, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of htheir time.[51] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others[61] show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. For the Greeks \u201chomosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\u201d.[62] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes), and the other was the beloved (eromenos).\n\nThe former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \u201cRumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\u201d[63] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \u201cAlexander laid a garland on Achilles\u2019 tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus\u2019, indicating that he was Alexander\u2019s eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\u201d[64]\n\nHowever, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \u201cdescendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry\u201d.[65] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[66] Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue, describes an occasion when Hephaestion\u2019s conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander\u2019s tent all night,[67] and Plutarch describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander\u2019s letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion\u2019s lips.[68] There also exists a letter, spuriously attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, heavily hinting at Alexander\u2019s yielding to \u201cHephaestion\u2019s thighs\u201d.[69]\n\nNo other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. As Andrew Chugg says, \u201cit is surely incredible that Alexander\u2019s reaction to Hephaestion\u2019s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable\u201d.[70] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cflung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions\u201d.[71]\n\nOthers\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAmong Alexander\u2019s other officers, it is possible that Hephaestion was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander\u2019s effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[72] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[73]\n\nHowever, outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command, he was not universally admired. This is clear from Arrian\u2019s comment about Alexander\u2019s grief: \u201cAll writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\u201d[74]\n\nYet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the Western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[75] mentions a quarrel with Alexander\u2019s secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[76] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion\u2019s even greater closeness.\n\nIn only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander\u2019s policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \u201cFor this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows \u2026\u201d[77] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander\u2019s wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander\u2019s own second wife Stateira.[2] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death, eight months after Hephaestion\u2019s, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[78]\n\nFor Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cwanted to be uncle to Hephaestion\u2019s children\u201d.[79] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[79]\n\nDeath and Funeral\n\nDeath\n\nIn spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[80] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice: As soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast, consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[81]\n\nPiecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion\u2019s fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \u201cThis sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\u201d[82] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.\n\nFollowing Hephaestion\u2019s death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[83][84] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion; this was later done.[84]\n\nHephaestion\u2019s death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says that \u201cAlexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable\u201d and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[85] Besides the account reported in a previous section about the immediate manifestations of despair by Alexander on his friend\u2019s body, Arrian also relates that \u201cuntil the third day after Hephaestion\u2019s death, Alexander neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning,\u201d and that he had the doctor, Glaucias, hanged for his lack of care.[86] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[87] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[88] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles\u2019 last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre:Thus o\u2019er Patroclus while the hero prayed,on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:And now the sun had set upon their woe.[89]\n\nAnother hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion, and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit with Achilles\u2019 killing of \u201ctwelve high-born youths\u201d beside Patroclus\u2019 funeral pyre.[85]\n\nAlexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire and \u201cmany of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man\u201d.[90] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion\u2019s place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \u201cwished Hephaestion\u2019s name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion\u2019s Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion\u2019s image continued to be carried before it\u201d.[91]\n\nMessengers were sent to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \u201cfrom that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero\u2019s rites\u201d.[92] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion\u2019s memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \u201cTo the Hero Hephaestion\u201d.[93][94]\n\nFuneral\n\nHephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents, about $200,000,000 or $ 240,000,000 in the early 21st century\u2019s money.[95] Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion\u2019s friend Perdiccas.[87] At Babylon, funeral games were held in Hephaestion\u2019s honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[96] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \u201cas this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation\u201d, to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[97]\n\nThe pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[98] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death.[99]\n\nOne final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[100]\n\nBased on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb in northern Greece, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325\u2013300 BC.[101]\n\nAppendix\n\nEndnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nOriginally published by Wikipedia, 03.30.2003, under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}, {"url": "https://brewminate.com/hephaestion-alexander-the-greats-personal-bodyguard-and-closest-friend/", "page_content": "Detail of the Alexander sarcophagus, probably Hephaestion / Photo by Marco Prins, Istanbul Museum, Creative Commons\n\nThroughout his life, Hephaestion remained close to Alexander, serving both as a valuable advisor and friend.\n\nBy Donald L. Wasson\n\nProfessor of Ancient/Medieval History\n\nLincoln College\n\nIntroduction\n\nHephaestion was a member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard and the Macedonian king\u2019s closest and lifelong friend and advisor. So much so, Hephaestion\u2019s death would bring the young king to tears. From 334 to 323 BCE Alexander the Great conquered much of the known world. He led his army on a ten-year odyssey across Asia Minor and into Persia, Egypt and India. Eventually, after his defeat of Darius III, he became the self-proclaimed King of Asia. Of course, he could not have done this without the support of his loyal army and staff of skilled officers \u2013 Ptolemy, Perdiccos, and Craterus, but above all others, Hephaestion.\n\nEarly Life\n\nThe son of Amyntas, Hephaestion was raised in the Macedonian capital of Pella and according to most sources born in 356 BCE, the same year as the king. Being from an aristocratic family, as were many of the staff officers who would follow Alexander into Asia, he became a student, alongside Alexander, of the philosopher Aristotle at Mieza, a city west of Pella. His intelligence impressed the Athenian academic, and, like the king, they would correspond with each other during the long Persian campaign. Hephaestion was considered handsome by many, and Alexander\u2019s father, Philip II, regarded him an excellent influence on his son. Shortly after Philip married Cleopatra, the future king became concerned about his position as successor. A disagreement erupted between Philip and Alexander, a dispute fueled by his friends. Because of this, many of Alexander\u2019s friends were sent into exile; however, because of Philip\u2019s respect for Hephaestion, he was spared this humiliation.\n\nOn Campaign\n\nThe Alexander Sarcophagus is a late 4th century BCE stone sarcophagus adorned with bas-relief carvings of Alexander the Great. The Alexander Sarcophagus is one of four massive carved sarcophagi, forming two pairs, that were discovered during the excavations conducted by Osman Hamdi Bey at the necropolis near Sidon, Lebanon in 1887 CE. The central figure may represent Hephaestion, one of Alexander\u2019s key commanders.

However, before clashing with the Persian army at River Granicus, Alexander chose to visit the tomb of his hero (and supposed ancestor) Achilles at Troy (a small village at the time of Alexander). Such was his fascination with the hero, the king always slept with a copy of Homer\u2019s Iliad under his pillow. With him at Troy, of course, was, among others, Hephaestion who laid a wreath at the tomb of Achilles\u2019 friend Patrocles. Indeed, many saw the relationship of Alexander and Hephaestion to be akin to that of Achilles and Patrocles. Later, the two men stood side-by-side as Alexander severed the Gordian Knot. Because of this unique closeness, many officers grew extremely jealous. Oddly enough, this jealousy was not limited to the staff for Olympias, Alexander\u2019s overly-protective mother, also resented the relationship.\n\nHephaestion\u2019s friendship with Alexander would eventually enable him to be appointed chiliarch or second-in-command. Although there is considerable disagreement among contemporary sources, many within the army did not believe Hephaestion to have the necessary leadership or military skills; in fact, some fail to mention any active participation in several of the major battles (although he was seriously wounded at Gaugamela); however, luckily for Alexander, he demonstrated a talent for organization. Alexander would leave much of the campaign\u2019s logistics to Hephaestion \u2013 the supply and transportation of equipment, bridge building and even the establishment and planning of new settlements.\n\nRivalry and Special Position\n\nOne officer, Craterus, grew to deeply resent Hephaestion (the feeling was mutual), and Alexander had to separate the two on more than one occasion. At one point in India they had actually drawn swords. Alexander was forced to reprimand them both, scolding Hephaestion and telling him he would be nothing without Alexander. (Historians disagree on the meaning of this statement.) It was often said that Craterus was a friend of the king, but Hephaestion was a friend of Alexander. In his Greek Lives historian Plutarch wrote,\n\n\u2026 he (Alexander) loved Hephaestion best, but respected Craterus most, he was constantly saying that in his opinion while Hephaestion was loyal to Alexander, Craterus was loyal to the king. This helps to explain why there was bad feeling festering between the two of them, so that they often clashed.\n\nLater, Plutarch said that the king brought the two together and made them friends again but gave each a warning \u2013 he would kill both of them if he ever found them quarrelling again. In the end, Craterus would return to Macedonia, eventually dying in 321 BCE during the Successor Wars after Alexander\u2019s death.\n\nA map showing the route that Alexander the Great took to conquer Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Bactria / U.S. Military Academy, Public Domain\n\nThis intimate relationship between Hephaestion and Alexander can also be seen in an incident after the Battle of Issus and the defeat of Darius III. The Persian king ran from the field of battle and escaped capture, leaving his army to suffer a devastating rout. Unfortunately for his mother, wife, and daughters, they were left behind along with abundant riches; Darius would eventually appeal unsuccessfully for their safe return. Realizing the fate of most prisoners of war, especially women, and expecting the worse, Darius\u2019 mother, Sisygambis, feared for their safety, and as Alexander and Hephaestion entered the tent, she threw herself before the taller and more handsome Hephaestion, begging for her life. In his The Campaigns of Alexander historian Arrian related the story.\n\n\u2026 Darius\u2019 mother, in doubt owing to the similarity of their dress, which of the two was the King, prostrated herself before Hephaestion because he was taller than his companion. Hephaestion stepped back, and one of the Queen\u2019s attendant\u2019s rectified her mistake by pointing to Alexander; the Queen withdrew in profound embarrassment, but Alexander merely remarked that her error was of no account, for Hephaestion, too, was an Alexander.\n\nArrian added that whether or not the incident was true, the young king should be admired for his respect and confidence in a friend \u2013 but it also speaks for the nature of Alexander\u2019s character.\n\nNaval Command\n\nAfter Issus, Hephaestion was placed in charge of Alexander\u2019s naval reinforcements, ordered to follow the army\u2019s progress along the Mediterranean coast from Gaza to the city Pelusium on the Egyptian delta \u2013 the latter\u2019s governor surrendered both the city and its entire treasury without a fight. In another test of Alexander\u2019s confidence in Hephaestion, the king placed him in charge of replacing the old, deposed Persian ruler of the newly seized port city of Sidon with another governor. A member of the old royal family Abdalorymus was quickly found and given the governorship. Next, Hephaestion led the fleet up the Nile River to the Egyptian capital of Memphis where he, Ptolemy, Craterus and Alexander studied Egyptian law and customs. Prior to the final battle against Darius at Gaugamela, Alexander placed Hephaestion in charge of a squadron to scout the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and build a bridge. Wisely, he did not complete the bridge until the arrival of Alexander, fearing that the Persians would destroy it. Aside for the mention of his wound received, sources don\u2019t mention Hephaestion again until the conspiracy trial of Philotas.\n\nLoyalty to Alexander\n\nBefore marching into India and prior to their expedition into Bactria, there was major unrest within the army. The veterans were weary and wanted to return home to Macedonia and their families. Also, many staff officers disagreed with the king on many of his atypical decisions \u2013 his adoption of Persian customs and attire as well as his wish that they prostrate themselves before him and kiss his ring. They especially resented both the addition of Persians into the army and being asked to take Persian wives. However, unlike many others, Hephaestion always supported Alexander\u2019s decisions even with the idea of taking a Persian wife and he was given one of the daughters of Darius, Drypatis, while Alexander chose the other daughter, Barsine, as his mistress.\n\nHowever, Hephaestion\u2019s loyalty to Alexander was best demonstrated during the would-be mutiny against Alexander. In 330 BCE Hephaestion, along with Craterus, spoke against Philotas, the suspected ringleader of the plot, convincing the king that he and the other conspirators should be tortured and executed \u2013 this execution also included Parmenio, Philotas\u2019 father and the long-time commander from the court of Philip. Afterwards, Alexander rewarded Hephaestion by splitting the command of the Companions between him and Cleitus.\n\nDuring the campaign in India, Hephaestion led a large force through the Khyber Pass subduing any rebellious Indian tribes. Next, Perdiccos and he took half the Companions, the mercenary cavalry, the baggage train and several Indian engineers to build a bridge across the Indus (this same bridge would be used to ford the Hydaspes). When lines of communication were secured, they rejoined Alexander and prepared to cross the Indus and face King Porus \u2013 at the Hydaspes Hephaestion would be placed in command of one squadron. After the victory against Porus, Hephaestion split with Alexander reconnecting later and battling against the Mallians \u2013 it was here that Alexander was injured and near death. Finally, he could go no farther; Alexander succumbed to the wishes of his troops and decided to return northward to Babylon.\n\nDeath\n\nThey spent the summer and fall at Ecbatana where, after a night of heavy drinking, Hephaestion developed a high fever \u2013 Alexander would remain by his friend\u2019s side until he showed signs of recovery. Unfortunately, Hephaestion soon relapsed, and in October of 324 BCE, he died (any possibility of poisoning has been dismissed). Alexander would die himself eight months later. The king spent the next two days in tears, grieving for the death of his friend. Besides cutting off his own hair, he ordered the manes and tails of all the horses cut off as well. A state of mourning was declared, sacrifices were made, and sacred fires lit. Unfortunately, it was a sad day for Hephaestion\u2019s doctor, Glaucius, who was executed for his failure to keep his patient alive. Hephaestion\u2019s body would eventually be sent to Babylon where a giant pyre was built. Alexander sent an envoy to Siwa to request Hephaestion be declared a god, but the request was refused; he would only be honored as a divine hero. Plutarch wrote,\n\n\u2026he (Alexander) had the wretched doctor impaled on a stake and banned playing the pipes and all music in the camp for a considerable period of time, until he received an oracle from Ammon, telling him to worship Hephaestion as a hero and to institute sacrificial rituals in his honour.\n\nAlthough some sources claim that Hephaestion and Alexander were more than just good friends, most agree that their relationship was unique and strengthened both men. Throughout his life, Hephaestion remained close to the king, serving both as a valuable advisor and friend. Whether or not he was a capable commander is irrelevant, his abilities in logistics assisted in the defeat of the Persians and their king Darius III.\n\nBibliography\n\nOriginally published by the Ancient History Encyclopedia, 05.20.2014, under a Creative Commons: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/ancient-amphipolis-tomb-was-commissioned-alexander-great-his-closest-friend-020551", "page_content": "New evidence has emerged that the massive underground tomb in Amphipolis, Greece, which was hailed last year as the archaeological discovery of the decade, was commissioned by Alexander the Great for his close companion and general in his army, Hephaestion.\n\nThe Amphipolis Tomb , which lies within the Kasta Hill burial mound, approximately 100 kilometres east of Thessaloniki in Greece, captured worldwide attention last year when two marble sphinxes were found guarding its entrance.

To be successful he needs the support of a well-trained army who will follow him regardless of the cost whether it be a stunning victory or hopeless defeat. One need only read of Leonidas as he bravely led his 300 Spartans to inevitable defeat at Thermopylae. History has had its share of skilled leaders - Julius Caesar, Hannibal, and later Napoleon. However, all three of these men must pay homage to a single individual and his army. Alexander the Great conquered most of the known world of his time. From his father King Philip of Macedonia he inherited a versatile, well-trained army unlike anything that had ever existed. United in a single purpose, they fought as one. Alexander recognized this and is quoted as saying, \u201cRemember upon the conduct of each depends the fate of all.\u201d\n\nAlexander the Great in Combat Warner Brothers (Copyright, fair use)\n\nAlthough he owes much of his success to his father's foresight, the young king's achievements in battle can be traced back to the origin of the hoplite phalanx of early Greece. Around 700 BCE the cities of Corinth, Sparta, and Argos created a close-ordered battle formation that became known as the phalanx. The reason for this development was due in part to a changing Greece. Greece was emerging from a dark period in its history - the troubling times of the poet Homer. There was the emergence of the polis or city-state and the expansion of colonies founded as near as Ionia and as far away as Sicily. With trade and the Greek world expanding, for political and economic reasons, each city had to learn to defend itself.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nEarlier Greek Warfare\n\nTwo powerful city-states rose to dominate Greece. While Athens would become a naval power, Sparta easily emerged as the atypical military city, initiating a strict code of conduct with intense military training for every male citizen. It was the birth of the citizen-warrior. Every citizen was required to defend the city in the event of war. Although a Spartan boy learned enough to be literate, more importantly, he learned how to endure pain and to conquer in battle, in essence to fight as a unit not as an individual. The city itself was like an armed camp. This intense training became evident when Greece was invaded by the Persians under the command of Darius I and later his son Xerxes.\n\nGreek Hoplite Johnny Shumate (Public Domain)\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe new soldier was a hoplite, named for the hoplon, his shield. For additional protection he wore a helmet (most often the Corinthian style), covering most of his face except for a t-shaped opening that exposed his eyes, nose and mouth (unfortunately, it did not allow for peripheral vision); Philip would replace this with a Phrygian helmet that allowed for better hearing and visibility. The hoplite wore greaves to cover his calves, a molded cuirass that shielded his torso as well as a long, pleated tunic that protected his abdomen and groin. For a weapon he carried a thrusting spear of five to eight feet in length. The army marched in a close-ordered formation or phalanx where each hoplite carried his shield in a manner that protected his left side and his neighbor's right. This new style of fighting was primarily offensive, advancing in a line into the center of the opposing enemy.\n\nPhilip increased the size of the army from 10,000 to 24,000, & enlarged the cavalry from 600 to 3,500.\n\nA Disciplined & Organized Army\n\nWhen Philip II became king of Macedonia in 359 BCE, he inherited an army that was relatively ineffective. He immediately initiated a series of military reforms. Together, Alexander and his father would create an army unlike anything the ancient world had even seen. Previous wars such as the Persian and Peloponnesian War had demonstrated that the old ways were no longer dependable. Philip took a poorly disciplined group of men and turned them into a formidable army. Most historians believed Philip developed his ideas while a hostage in Thebes, observing their notorious Sacred Band. To begin with, he increased the size of the army from 10,000 to 24,000, and enlarged the cavalry from 600 to 3,500; this was no longer an army of citizen-warriors. In addition, he created a corp of engineers to develop siege weaponry such as towers and catapults. Later, Alexander would use these siege towers with devastating effect at Tyre (6,000 would be killed and 30,000 enslaved).\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nThe very nature of the phalanx required constant drilling, and both men demanded strict obedience; punishments would be meted out for those who disobeyed. Like Alexander after him, Philip required an oath of swearing allegiance to the king. They provided uniforms - a simple idea that gave each man a sense of unity and solidarity. Besides the obvious, there was logic behind what they did; each soldier would no longer be loyal to a particular province or town as now he would be loyal only to the king. The battle-hardened men who fought for Philip and Alexander had to remain dedicated to his king and the glory of Macedonia. This loyalty and restructuring became evident at Philip's victory over Athens and Thebes (with the help of an eighteen year old Alexander) at the Battle of Chaeronea; a battle that demonstrated the power and authority of Macedonia.\n\nBattle of Chaeronia US Military Academy (Public Domain)\n\nPhilip completely restructured the army. The first order of business was the reorganization of the phalanx, providing each individual unit with its own commander - thereby allowing for better communication. The fundamental fighting unit became the taxes which usually comprised 1,540 men and commanded by a taxiarch. Every taxis was broken into distinct subdivisions. A taxis was composed of three lochoi (each commanded by a lochagos) or 512 men apiece. 32 dekas (a line of ten men \u2013 later sixteen) made up each lochoi. Each man occupied only two cubits of space until actual battle, when he used only one cubit.\n\nWeapons & Tactics\n\nNext, Philip changed the principal weaponry from the hoplite spear to the sarissa - an 18-20 feet pike; it had the advantage of reaching over the much shorter spears of the opposition. Obviously, the length of the sarissa made it difficult to handle, demanding both strength and dexterity. The hoplite now became a pezhetairoi or foot companion. Like his predecessor, he, too, carried a shield or aspis - similar to the hoplon, but due to the size of the sarissa (one had to use both hands); it was carried by a sling over the shoulder. Besides the sarissa, each man possessed a smaller double-edge sword or xiphos for close-in-hand fighting.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThere was only one drawback to the phalanx - it worked best on flat, unbroken country; however, despite this disadvantage, Alexander used it with amazing success. In almost every campaign the formation of Alexander's army remained the same; however, due to the nature of the field of battle, some changes were made at Hydaspes where archers led the field against Porus' elephants. The pezhetairoi were in the center; the hypaspists were to their right with the cavalry on either flank. Archers and additional lighter infantry served on outer flanks and in the rear. The pezhetairoi were indoctrinated to maintain ranks in all circumstances, although they were able to break smoothly when necessary; this was evident at Gaugamela against Darius' scythed chariots. In battle, the five front ranks lowered their sarissa parallel to the ground while the rear ranks (usually wearing broad-brimmed a straw hat or kausia instead of helmets) carried theirs upright.\n\nHypaspist Johnny Shumate (Public Domain)\n\nAs indicated earlier, to the right of these pezhetairoi were the far more mobile hypaspists also called shield-bearers. Although not as heavily armed - carrying only a shorter spear or javelin - they served a special role in both Philip and Alexander's army. They were recruited for their skill and physique, requiring a special level of training. They were mostly from the peasantry of Macedon and, thereby, had no tribal or regional affiliation meaning they loyal only to the king himself. There were three distinct classes of hypaspists - the \u201croyal\u201d who served as the bodyguards of the king as well as guards at banquets and official events, an elite force known as the argyraspids, and finally the actual hypaspists corp. A special band of veterans within the hypaspists would become known as the Silver Shields.\n\nCavalry\n\nOn both the right and left flanks were the cavalry. The cavalry was the army's main strike force and would make the decisive breakthrough of the enemy lines - this was evident at the battles of Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela. There were two divisions of the cavalry - the Companion and the prodromoi - the latter was the more flexible and versatile Balkan cavalry which was used primarily as scouts. The Companion Cavalry was the more important division and was commanded at first by Philotas and later by Cleitus and Hephaestion. They were divided into eight squadrons of 200 men each and each man carried a nine-foot lance but wore little armor. Due to the extreme value of the cavalry - 1,000 horses would die at Gaugamela - a steady supply of extra horses was kept at all times. Of course, the most important of these squadrons was that of Alexander. Alexander and his Royal Companions always fought on the right while Parmenio commanded the Thessalian Cavalry on the left flank. Tactics remained simple - the pezhetairoi would hit the center of the opposing army in an oblique angle while the cavalry would attack and punch holes on the flanks. As with the previously abandoned hoplite phalanx, the new army was designed to attack and remained a purely offensive weapon. While well-trained soldiers are always essential for success, an army needs capable leadership, and besides Alexander, the force that crossed the Hellespont had several capable officers, namely Parmenio, Perdiccas, Coenus, Cleitus, Ptolemy, and Hephaestion.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nAlexander ran his army from the royal tent where his war counsel would meet in a large pavilion. The tent also contained a vestibule, an armory and the king's personal apartment. The tent was guarded at all times by a special detachment of hypaspists. Although he would always listen to the suggestions of his command staff, Alexander's decision was final. This was most evident before the battle at Gaugamela when Parmenio and a number of other officers suggested Alexander attack Darius at night which Alexander, of course, flatly refused: \u201cI will not steal a victory.\u201d\n\nMap of Alexander the Great's Conquests US Military Academy (Public Domain)\n\nCrossing the Hellespont\n\nWhen he entered Asia, the young king brought with him 12,000 phalangists - 9,000 pezhetairoi and 3,000 hypaspists. He also brought with him over 7,000 Greek infantry, most of which would be used to maintain conquered lands as garrison troops. While the army that crossed the Hellespont in 334 BCE was mostly Macedonian, there were others from all over Greece: Agrianians, Triballians, Paeonians, and Illyrians. Since Alexander was also the head of the Legion of Corinth, a number of Greek states provided additional infantry, cavalry and warships. Many of these mercenaries spoke a variety of dialects and came from provinces with a long history of ethnic tension. Luckily, this tension was kept to a minimum. After the defeat of Darius III at Gaugamela in 331 BCE, Alexander realized it was necessary to replace his force's depleted numbers, welcoming new recruits into his army among which were a number of Persians whilst some of his veterans were sent home. All new recruits, whether those arriving from Macedonia or others recruited from local provinces, were trained in the Macedonian style of fighting.\n\nAlexander's Leadership\n\nHowever, an army - even one that was as well-trained as that from Macedonia - could not have functioned as well without the capable leadership of Alexander. In his book Masters of Command: Alexander, Hannibal and Caesar, author Barry Strauss composed a list of traits necessary for good leadership and among them are judgment, audacity, agility, strategy, and terror. Alexander displayed all of these qualities. Although he would show respect for his enemy, as demonstrated after Issus, he was afraid of no one. He is quoted as saying, \u201cI am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.\u201d One of his remarkable abilities was to anticipate the strategy of his opponent, often drawing him onto the terrain of his choosing, once again, this is most visible at Gaugamela. Throughout his conquest of Persia, Alexander didn't necessarily want to bring Darius to his knees; he only wanted to conquer.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nAlexander the Great, Bronze Head Mark Cartwright (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nAlexander had the respect of his men and never betrayed their trust as he fought next to them, ate with them, and refused to drink water when there wasn't enough for all. Quite simply, he set the example. As was evident at Gaugamela, he was able to rally his men to fight with him. Plutarch in his Life of Alexander the Great wrote,\n\n\u2026he made a very long speech to the Thessalians and the other Greeks and when he saw that they encouraged him with shouts to lead them against the Barbarians, he shifted his lance into his left hand, and with his right appealed to the gods\u2026praying them, if he was really sprung from Zeus, to defend and strengthen the Greeks\u2026and after mutual encouragement and exhortations the cavalry charged at full speed upon the enemy\u2026\n\nIn his The Campaigns of Alexander Arrian quoted Alexander as he addressed his troops:\n\n\u2026we of Macedon for generations past have been trained in the hard school of danger and war. [The king compared the two armies - that of Macedon and that of Persia] \u2026and what, finally, of the two men in supreme command? You have Alexander, they Darius.\n\nBefore Philip and Alexander, the Persians under Darius I and Xerxes had been repelled by a smaller force - these men of Greece fought unlike anyone and anything the Persians had ever experienced. By the time of Alexander, the fighting force that took him across both Greece and Persia had been perfected. He crossed Asia into India, often fighting a force that outnumbered him. His use of the phalanx and cavalry, combined with an innate sense of command, put his enemy on the defensive, enabling him to never lose a battle. His memory would live on and his determination brought the Hellenic culture to Asia. He built great cities and changed forever the customs of a people."}, {"url": "https://studymoose.com/the-relationship-between-alexander-and-the-great-general-hephaestion-essay", "page_content": "Alexander III of Macedon, or better known as Alexander the Great was king of Macedon, a state in northern Ancient Greece.

In all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side making their friendship a working partnership. They worked well together making Alexander trust him and rely on him. When Alexander had to divide his forces he trusted Hephaestion with half of his men knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty, who understood and sympathised with his aims, and above all, who got the job done.\n\nGet to Know The Price Estimate For Your Paper Topic Number of pages Email Invalid email By clicking \u201cCheck Writers\u2019 Offers\u201d, you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy.

Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets. At Alexander\u2019s first wedding Hephaestion was the torch bearer (best man). This showed not only their friendship but also Hephaestion\u2019s support for Alexander\u2019s policies, as Alexander\u2019s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one. When they returned to Persia Hephaestion was officially titled Alexander\u2019s second in command.\n\nHammond sums up their public relationship well: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\u201d, and \u201cAt the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzans under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals. It has been said that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers. It cannot be proved that they were lovers as none of the ancient sources states this in so many words. However, Arrian describes the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with Achilles and Patroclus, who were acknowledged, by Plato and Aeschylus among others, to have been lovers. It happened at the begging of the campaign in Asia when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy.\n\nHe laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus, and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Robin Lane Fox, writing in 1973, says: \u201cIt was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion\u2019s first mention in Alexander\u2019s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander\u2019s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer had never directly mentioned.\n\nNothing shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. As Andrew Chugg says, \u201c\u2026 it is surely incredible that Alexander\u2019s reaction to Hephaestion\u2019s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable. \u201d Arrian says that Alexander \u201c\u2026 flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force of his companions. Arrian also said that Alexander, after Hephaestion\u2019s death, described him as \u201c\u2026 the friend I valued as my own life. \u201d\n\nIn conclusion Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s relationship was extremely close. They may or may not have been lovers but the friendship they shared was one of a kind. Their tutor, Aristotle, described such a friendship as \u201c\u2026 one soul abiding in two bodies\u201d. Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \u201cAlexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego. \u201d They truly were soul mates and had one of the strongest relationships in history."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Hephaestion/6000000011739086951", "page_content": "About Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion (Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Hephaistion; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"... by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\" This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion and Alexander\n\nAlexander had the reputation for being handsome and stood out among his peers by being clean shaven. Many portraits and sculptures were made in his lifetime, so we can be fairly convinced of his appearance. He was a prodigious athlete and loved strenuous exercise. He loved to show off by jumping off and back onto a chariot moving at full speed. Alexander was rather short and stocky, with one blue and one brown eye. His male lover Hephaestion was taller and even more handsome, so much so that the Persian queen bowed to Hephaestion instead of Alexander when she was presented to them. Alexander said to the mortified queen \"Never mind, Hephaestion is also Alexander\".\n\nAt the time Alexander lived, it was common for Greek men to have wives as well as lovers of either gender; wives were merely for procreation. Alexander, who had become King of Macedonia at the age of twenty when his father was assassinated, did not marry and produce an heir before he set out from Macedonia to conquer the Persians. He was not known to show much interest in women. Even at the height of his power, historians recount that he used his harem \u201csparingly.\u201d However, Alexander loved his boyhood friend, Hephaestion. Both brilliant adolescents, they were tutored by Aristotle by arrangement with Alexander\u2019s father. Aristotle instilled in the lads a great desire for knowledge and a love for philosophy. Thus Alexander became an avid reader. Hephaestion started off as a regular cavalry soldier and rose through the ranks on merit, carrying out important military and administrative assignments. Later, Alexander also took as a lover a male courtier from the conquered Persian court, scandalous not because the courtier was male, but because he was Persian, since most Greeks thought that all other people were barbarians.\n\nHephaestion and Alexander wanted their children to be cousins, so Hephaestion married the sister of Alexander\u2019s new wife, who was the daughter of the defeated Persian emperor Darius III (a purely political marriage).\n\nGreece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquests, which helped stimulate the economy and increased trade between the new areas of his empire.\n\nHowever, soon after Hephaestion and Alexander conquered Asia, Hephaestion died suddenly of typhus. Alexander's grief was boundless and devastating. He ordered an official observance of public mourning for his lover. It was recorded that for two days Alexander neither ate nor drank, cut his hair short and ordered that the horses in his army should have their manes cropped, as well. Alexander resolved that his lover should begin his life in the Unseen World with unstinted wealth, and the precious things he ordered stacked upon Hephaestion\u2019s funeral pile represented a sum of nearly two million and a half pounds sterling. Alexander declared publically that his relationship with Hephaestion was like that of Achilles to Patroclus, male lovers and bothers-at-arms mentioned in the Iliad \u2013 Hephaestion and Alexander had been inspired by them in their youthful studies with Aristotle. Alexander asked the Oracles of Egypt if Hephaestion was a god, because in those days a person could become a god through achievements. Alexander was told that Hephaestion was indeed a hero, albeit a lesser type of god. Alexander, who had no doubt about his own divinity, then knew that he would meet his beloved again in the Blessed Realm, where gods and heroes lived in eternity.\n\nWithin eight months of Hephaestion's death, Alexander died in Babylon, twelve days after contracting a fever. Historians propose that his death was the result of poisoned wine or contaminated water. In any event, he had yet to realize a series of campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia and the eventual conquering of the entire Mediterranean basin and all of Africa. It was his desire to conquer the entirety of the known world. He was 32 years old at the time of his death, and never defeated in battle.\n\nAlexander's lasting legacy was not his reign, but the cultural diffusion his conquests afforded. His establishment of Greek colonies (among them Kandahar in Afghanistan) and culture in the conquered lands resulted in a new Hellenistic culture, which was still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire until the mid 15th century. Alexander became the measure against which generals, even to this day, compare themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactical exploits.\n\nhttps://gayinfluence.blogspot.com/search/label/Alexander%20the%20Great"}], "Hephaestion was son of Amyntor": [{"url": "https://www.livius.org/articles/person/hephaestion/", "page_content": "Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion (c.357-324): Macedonian nobleman, closest friend and lover of king Alexander the Great. During the expedition against Persia, he served sometimes as a military commander, but he was probably a better organizer.\n\nYouth\n\nHephaestion\n\nAccording to a document that is included in Arrian of Nicomedia's Indik\u00ea,note[Quoted here.] Hephaestion was born in the capital of ancient Macedonia, Pella. His father Amyntor must have been an important man, because his son was educated at the court of king Philip (360-336). The Greek name of Hephaestion's father suggests that he was one of the Greek mercenary leaders or intellectuals who came to Macedonia and received an honorable treatment. (The father of Alexander's admiral and friend Nearchus is another example.)\n\nMieza, nymphaeum\n\nWhen he was still young, Hephaestion met the crown prince Alexander. Although an explicit connection between Hephaestion and the famous Macedonian scientist and philosopher Aristotle of Stagira is not mentioned in our best sources, we may assume that Hephaestion, like Alexander, was educated by Aristotle, whose school in the Nymphaeum of Mieza (below modern Naousa) was situated in one of the most beautiful and green parts of Macedonia. If we are to believe Diogenes Laertius, the author of several entertaining Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Aristotle published a collection of letters to Hephaestion,note[Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers 5.1.27.] which suggests that the two wrote to each other during Alexander's Persian campaign. However, Diogenes is not always a reliable author.\n\nAnatolia\n\nHephaestion is first mentioned at the very beginning of the histories of Alexander's Persian campaign, when the invaders reached Troy (May 334). He is never introduced as 'a friend' or 'a companion' of the king; he is simply mentioned, which suggests that the historians assumed that everybody knew Hephaestion's position as Alexander's lover. (We don't have to introduce Juliet once Romeo is on the stage.)\n\nAt Troy, Alexander venerated the ancient heroes. It is said that he went to the tomb of his legendary ancestor Achilles and that Hephaestion sacrificed to Achilles' friend Patroclus. Again, this suggests that Hephaestion was Alexander's lover, because in the fourth century, it was widely believed that the two legendary heroes had been lovers. (Homer states that they used to spend the night separately - a remark that is only meaningful when it was already taken for granted that the two were lovers.)\n\nIf the parallel between Achilles and Patroclus on the one hand and Alexander and Hephaestion on the other hand was really perfect, Hephaestion was - like Patroclus - older than his lover. Since Alexander was born in the summer of 356, we may assume that his friend was born in, say, 357.\n\nAfter the visit to Troy, Hephaestion disappears for some time from our sources. This suggests that he was with Alexander and did not occupy commands worth mentioning. It is only after the battle of Issus (November 333) that we reencounter Hephaestion in our sources, in a famous anecdote. After the Macedonian victory, queen Statira was captured. She went to Alexander and kneeled down in front of Hephaestion, thinking that he was the king. Alexander saved her face by saying \"Don't worry, mother. Everywhere, he is Alexander too\".\n\nDetail of the Alexander sarcophagus, probably Hephaestion\n\nIt is possible that Hephaestion is depicted on the Alexander sarcophagus. If the identification is correct, Hephaestion fought on horseback during the battle of Issus.\n\nThe Levant\n\nAlexander was now twenty-three and Hephaestion may have been twenty-four or older. According to the Macedonian and Greek ideas about love and sexuality, the time for homosexual affairs was over. The young men had to marry. Hephaestion could no longer be Alexander's lover, and had to find a new role, especially since the king accepted a Persian mistress, Barsine. However, the friendship between the two men remained very close.\n\nHephaestion was sent on a diplomatic mission to Sidon, where he had to appoint a new king. He chose a man named Abdalonymus. This was not a very important task, but it should be noted that he had not had earlier assignments. During the next year, he commanded the navy of the Phoenician towns that had sided with the conquerors; this meant that he had to supply the main force. This was a more important job. (It should be noted that these assignments are not mentioned in our most important source, Arrian.)\n\nDuring Alexander's stay in Egypt (first half 331), Hephaestion was approached by a friend of the Athenian politician Demosthenes, an enemy of the Macedonians. The envoy said that he hoped that Hephaestion would put in a good word for Demosthenes with Alexander. It is unclear whether Hephaestion was persuaded, or, if he was, what was the result.\n\nOn October 31, 331, the Macedonians and Persians fought a large battle at Gaugamela in northern Mesopotamia. Hephaestion was now one of the members of Alexander's bodyguard, the somatophylakes. (In fact, these seven men were not real bodyguards but adjutants.) During this bloody battle, he was wounded in an arm.\n\nThe Philotas Affair\n\nAgain, Hephaestion disappears from our sources for some time, except for an undated assignment as guard and protector of Persian captives. He becomes \"visible\" again in October 330, when several soldiers conspired against Alexander. Almost immediately, it became clear that the commander of the Companion cavalry (the best soldiers in the Macedonian army), Philotas, had known of the plans and had not reported his discovery.\n\nAt first, Alexander forgave Philotas, but the next day, the accusations were renewed by the phalanx commanders Craterus and Coenus, Philotas' brother-in-law. It is not known whether they had a secret agenda, but we may be suspicious, as we see two infantry commanders accusing the leading cavalry commander. During the night, Philotas was arrested.\n\nAs the army exercised capital jurisdiction in Macedonia, Alexander organized a trial. He accused Philotas and the court found him guilty of conspiracy. However, the precise nature of the conspiracy was unclear. Hephaestion, Craterus and Coenus declared that torture should be employed to force the truth out of Philotas. He confessed that he and his father had wanted to kill Alexander to become kings themselves. After this confession, the commander of the Companions was executed.\n\nWhat to make of this story? No one doubts that the first conspiracy was a fact, but the existence of the conspiracy of Philotas and Parmenion is another matter. The confession of the tortured man can, of course, not be taken as proof. On the other hand, it is strange that Philotas did not report the first conspiracy. It is possible that he wanted to see what happened: if the soldiers' attempt failed, nothing was lost, if it were successful, the army would chose him as its commander and king. He had much to gain, but the fact that he had a motive does not mean that he really did what he was accused of. We will never known what really happened.\n\nThe consequences of the murder were clear. In the first place, the execution of Philotas made the murder of his father Armenian inevitable - and in fact, he was killed. In the second place, the Companion cavalry was placed under two men: a safety measure against too powerful officers. The new commanders were Clitus, a trusted senior officer, and Hephaestion, who was still inexperienced.\n\nSogdia\n\nThe years 329, 328 and 327 saw fighting in Bactria and Sogdia, satrapies in the northeast of the Achaemenid Empire. Since most of the fighting was done on horseback, we would expect the commander of the Companion cavalry to be prominent in our sources, but Hephaestion is conspicuously absent. The reason is that the unit of Hephaestion and Clitus was too large for the guerilla warfare in Sogdia. It was divided into smaller units, and Hephaestion commanded only one of them. (It should be noted that Alexander killed Clitus, which would have made Hephaestion the senior commander of the Companions, an assignment that was probably still above his powers.)\n\nSo, Alexander was skeptical about Hephaestion's capacities as commander, but this did not mean that his friend was out of favor. He is mentioned as the official who had to secure provisions during the winter, an important task. Moreover, Hephaestion acted as Alexander's best man when he married with the native princess Roxane (text). But Hephaestion rarely served as commander during a fight; when he commanded an army that was to see battle, he was always sharing the command with a more experienced officer (e.g., Clitus, Artabazus, Perdiccas)."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Hephaestion/6000000011739086951", "page_content": "About Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion (Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Hephaistion; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great.

A native of Pella (Arrian Indica 18), he shared Alexander\u2019s education and upbringing (Curtius 3.12.16), and probably served in the army from an early age. He was commander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes) at Gaugamela (Diodorus 17.61.3), where he was wounded, and was later appointed joint commander, with Cleitus, of the Companion Cavalry (Arrian 3.27.4). At the end of the Persian campaign, he was decorated for bravery and leadership (Arrian 7.5.6).\n\nBy the time of his death he was Chiliarch of the empire, Alexander\u2019s second-in-command in both military and political spheres (Photius 92).\n\nHis distinguished military career included various special missions. Some were diplomatic, such as the occasion when he selected a new king for Sidon (Curtius 4.1.16), and others related to engineering, such as when he and Perdiccas bridged the Indus (Arrian 4.23.59), or the construction of the new fort and harbour at Pattala (Arrian 6.18.1, 6.20.1).\n\nHephaestion\u2019s interests were not limited to the military and technical; he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates, (Diogenes Laertius, Aristotle 5) and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate Greeks and Persians (Plutarch Alexander 55.1).\n\nIn all that Alexander undertook, Hephaistion was at his side, a man he trusted completely and one upon whom he increasingly relied. Towards the end of the Bactrian campaign, when Alexander had cause to divide his forces, it was Hephaistion to whom half were entrusted when the objectives were not clear-cut, and Alexander needed someone who would be able to do what he would have done himself (Arrian 4.22.58).\n\nSuch was Alexander\u2019s regard for Hephaestion, that when he and his officers took Persian brides, Hephaestion was given Drypetis, daughter of the former king Darius, and sister to Alexander\u2019s own bride, Stateira. Alexander stated that he wished for their children to be cousins (Arrian 7.4.29).\n\nTheir working partnership was strong, and there is evidence that Alexander saw Hephaestion as an alter ego. He was free to speak his mind to the king, and Alexander, for his part, trusted Hephaestion with his secrets (Curtius 3.12.17).\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely likely that they were lovers. None of the extant sources says so in so many words, but by the time those were written down, such a love was already being frowned upon (Horace Epistles 2, 1, 156). Nevertheless, several well-attested incidents suggest that this was indeed the case. For example, Alexander and Hephaestion publicly honoured their dead heroes, Achilles and Patroclus, at Troy (Arrian 1.12.1). Even more telling is Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. He had to be dragged away from the body (Arrian 7.14.6), and he ordered the sacred fires extinguished, a thing which was normally only done on the death of the Great King himself (Diodorus 17.114.4).\n\nHephaestion died at Ecbatana in October 324, of a fever which had similarities to typhoid (Plutarch Alexander 72.2). His funeral was probably the most expensive in history (Arrian 7.15.5), and with the permission of the oracle at Siwa, he was honoured as a divine hero (Arrian 7.23.8). Many of the splendid monuments in his memory went uncompleted. Alexander was still planning them at the time of his own death, just eight months later (Arrian 7.23.10)."}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/what-was-real-relationship-between-alexander-great-and-hephaestion-006263", "page_content": "Alexander the Great was known as a womanizer \u2013 his list of romances quite extensive. However, some researchers suggest that he also fell in love with at least two men, one of them being Hephaestion, a General in Alexander\u2019s Army.\n\nResearchers cannot make empirical studies to be sure about the thoughts and feelings of the people who lived in the times of Alexander the Great. At most, they can only make deductions from the historical records that are available. All that really exists is a puzzle, which researchers try to interpret and put together.\n\nThe companion of brothers\n\nHephaestion was born, like Alexander, in around 365 BC. He was a son of Amyntor, a noble man of Macedonia. Hephaestion was a friend, companion and a general in the army of Alexander. According to the ancient resources, he had a special bond with the king. He was described as his dearest friend, the person who was witness to the most significant moments in Alexander's life, but also the one with whom the king shared his most personal secrets.\n\nHead of Hephaistion sculpted in marble.

They traveled, fought in battlefields and experienced many adventures together. Alexander is said to have felt a strong bond with him also due to his sensitivity, love of literature and intelligence. When Hephaestion died, Alexander\u2019s life collapsed. As a ruler, he didn't have too many people who he could trust. It seems that he believed in the loyalty his mother Olympias, Hephaestion, and his friend Ptolemy, future pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter. According to some later writings, Alexander felt extreme loneliness after the death of his dear friend, and he himself died just a few months after the burial of Hephaestion.\n\nFriends or Lovers?\n\nThroughout history, the Greek male friendship may be considered somewhat unique. Greek men could love their best friends like brothers and like family, and their way of treating each other could often be misinterpreted.\n\nAt the same time, Ancient Greek military forces (for example, the Spartans), believed that homosexual sex made bonds between the soldiers stronger. This same-sex interaction was a very popular topic to many ancient authors. The great philosopher Plato in his work Symposium wrote that the interlocutor Phaedrus made a comment on the importance of sexual relationships between men, which improves the brotherhood and bravery on the battlefield. Many researchers interpreted his interest in this topic as confirmation that he was in such a relationship with Socrates, although there is no evidence to support this theory.\n\nThe Warren Cup, portraying a mature bearded man and a youth on its \"Greek\" side ( Public Domain )\n\nAccording to the Paul Cartledge, a Professor of Greek History in the University of Cambridge, who described his theory of Alexander the Great: The Hunt for a New Past:\n\n''The question of Alexander's sexuality--his predominant sexual orientation--has enlivened, or bedeviled, much Alexander scholarship. That he loved at least two men there can be little doubt. The first was the Macedonian noble Hephaestion, a friend from boyhood, whom he looked on--and may actually have referred to--as his alter ego. The Persian queen mother, it was said, once mistook the taller Hephaestion for Alexander, who graciously excused her blushes by murmuring that 'he too is Alexander'. Whether Alexander's relationship with the slightly older Hephaestion was ever of the sort that once dared not speak its name is not certain, but it is likely enough that it was. At any rate, Macedonian and Greek mores would have favored an actively sexual component rather than inhibiting or censoring it. Like hunting, homosexuality was thought to foster masculine, especially martial, bravery.''\n\nIf we follow this way of thinking, there was at least one more man who could have been the male lover of Alexander. His name was Bagoas and he was a Persian eunuch. However, it is impossible to really know the truth of their relationship as there is no direct information about the sexual preferences of Alexander.\n\n'Bagoas pleads on behalf of Nabarzanes' ( Public Domain )\n\nSearching for the truth\n\nHomosexuality was a norm in the ancient times, but in the case of Alexander the Great and Hephaestion, it is hard to rationally conclude what the true relationship was between them. Even if they were lovers, the beliefs and perceptions about homosexual relationships was definitely different than the way it is considered today. However, the author of this article doubts the theory that Alexander and Hephaestion were in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left).

Currently it is suggested that the Amphipolis tomb could have been built in memory of Hephaestion. It is also possible that the ashes of the great friend of Alexander were brought there from the desert in Persia. The answer to the question of what was between Alexander and Hephaestion remains buried in their graves.\n\nTop image: A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes.

He was \u201cby far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\u201d[3] This relationship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nHis military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander\u2019s ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia.\n\nWhen he died suddenly at Ecbatana[4] around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon.[5] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion\u2019s memory.\n\nYouth and Education\n\nThe emblema of the Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic, along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander\u2019s companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[7] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201cone day when Alexander was 15 years old \u2026 sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa \u2026 and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[8] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[9] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[10] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his alleged pupil to send letters throughout Alexander\u2019s expanding empire to converse with him.\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[11] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[12] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.\n\nCareer\n\nOverview\n\nSharing Alexander\u2019s upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II\u2019s Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander\u2019s Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander\u2019s other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\nWars in Persia\n\nThe Battle of Issus by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1529. / Photo courtesy Alte Pinakothek, Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \u201cauthorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office\u201d.[13] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion\u2019s choice.\n\nAfter the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[14] Hephaestion\u2019s task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.\n\nPlutarch, while writing about Alexander\u2019s correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[15] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens\u2019 inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \u201cIf he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\u201d[15]\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander\u2019s governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \u201cIt is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus\u2019 reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\u201d[16]\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion\u2019s rank. He is called the \u201ccommander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes)\u201d.[17] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[18][19]\n\nAfter Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \u201cThe following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\u201d[20] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion\u2019s tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[21]\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas\u2019 former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander\u2019s policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip\u2019s older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[22] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[23]\n\nExpedition into India\n\nA painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes. / Photo courtesy The Pipe Organ Project, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion\u2019s orders were to \u201ctake over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing\u201d.[24] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[25]\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion\u2019s, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[26] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[27] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[28] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \u201chonorary trierarchs\u201d, indicating his leading position at this time.[29] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion\u2019s section marched \u201cfive days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which \u2026 might be rapidly moving forward\u201d.[30] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[31] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[32]\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[33] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[34] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander\u2019s de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \u201cto command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held\u201d.[35]\n\nRelationships\n\nAlexander\n\nThe family of Darius in front of Alexander with Hephaestion behind him, by Justus Sustermans and preserved in the Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer. In this picture we can see Hephaestion point out Alexander. / Photo courtesy Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer, Wikimedia Commons\n\nLittle is known of Hephaestion\u2019s personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[3] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander\u2019s becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages.\n\nTheir tutor Aristotle described friendship in general as \u201cone soul abiding in two bodies\u201d.[36] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the Battle of Issus. Diodorus,[37] Arrian[38] and Curtius[39] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying \u201cYou were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\u201d[39] Their affection for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander\u2019s mother, Olympias, said \u201cyou know that Alexander means more to us than anything\u201d.[40] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion\u2019s death, described him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life\u201d.[41] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \u201cAlexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\u201d[42]\n\nAside from their strong personal bond, theirs was also a working partnership in that all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. It is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion\u2019s career, of Alexander\u2019s constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[43] a lack of sympathy with Alexander\u2019s aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[44] and of sheer incompetence.[45] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.\n\nHephaestion played a full part in Alexander\u2019s regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes, and plans. Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets;[46] and Plutarch describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented.[47] According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander\u2019s first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch-bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander\u2019s policies as Alexander\u2019s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one among the Macedonians.\n\nBy the time they returned to Persia, Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander\u2019s second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship as follows: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\u201d,[48] and \u201cAt the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\u201d[49]\n\nBusts of Alexander (left) and Hephaestion (right). / Photo courtesy Getty Museum, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers, though hardly any of Alexander\u2019s extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refers to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander\u2019s friend,[51][52] consistent with Hephaestion\u2019s epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[53] It has been observed, however, that the ancient Greek word for friend \u201c\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\u201d (Philos) was also applied to lovers in the homo-erotic or sexual sense. [54]\n\nFurthermore, Arrian and Plutarch describe the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with the Homeric figures of Achilles and Patroclus. At the onset of the campaign in Asia, Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland and Hephaestion did the same with the tomb of Patroclus,[55] and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes.[56] Arrian and Plutarch draw no conclusions from this; however, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being in a homosexual relationship as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and Patroclus had sexual relations. Martin and Blackwell further suggest this concept was theorized by unspecified \u201clater authors\u201d,[51] who include, however, such eminent writers as Aeschylus[57] and Plato[58] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s time. Attic orator Aeschines, who was contemporary with them (albeit somewhat older), explicitly addressed the question in these terms: \u201c\u2026Homer, though he often speaks of Patroclus and Achilles, is silent about love and gives no name to their friendship; he thinks that the remarkable strength of their affection is obvious to the cultivated among his audience.\u201d[59] Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn from Martin and Blackwell\u2019s: \u201cIt was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion\u2019s first mention in Alexander\u2019s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander\u2019s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\u201d[60]\n\nHephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time in which, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of htheir time.[51] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others[61] show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. For the Greeks \u201chomosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\u201d.[62] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes), and the other was the beloved (eromenos).\n\nThe former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \u201cRumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\u201d[63] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \u201cAlexander laid a garland on Achilles\u2019 tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus\u2019, indicating that he was Alexander\u2019s eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\u201d[64]\n\nHowever, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \u201cdescendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry\u201d.[65] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[66] Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue, describes an occasion when Hephaestion\u2019s conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander\u2019s tent all night,[67] and Plutarch describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander\u2019s letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion\u2019s lips.[68] There also exists a letter, spuriously attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, heavily hinting at Alexander\u2019s yielding to \u201cHephaestion\u2019s thighs\u201d.[69]\n\nNo other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. As Andrew Chugg says, \u201cit is surely incredible that Alexander\u2019s reaction to Hephaestion\u2019s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable\u201d.[70] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cflung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions\u201d.[71]\n\nOthers\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAmong Alexander\u2019s other officers, it is possible that Hephaestion was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander\u2019s effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[72] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[73]\n\nHowever, outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command, he was not universally admired. This is clear from Arrian\u2019s comment about Alexander\u2019s grief: \u201cAll writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\u201d[74]\n\nYet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the Western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[75] mentions a quarrel with Alexander\u2019s secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[76] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion\u2019s even greater closeness.\n\nIn only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander\u2019s policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \u201cFor this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows \u2026\u201d[77] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander\u2019s wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander\u2019s own second wife Stateira.[2] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death, eight months after Hephaestion\u2019s, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[78]\n\nFor Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cwanted to be uncle to Hephaestion\u2019s children\u201d.[79] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[79]\n\nDeath and Funeral\n\nDeath\n\nIn spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[80] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice: As soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast, consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[81]\n\nPiecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion\u2019s fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \u201cThis sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\u201d[82] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.\n\nFollowing Hephaestion\u2019s death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[83][84] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion; this was later done.[84]\n\nHephaestion\u2019s death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says that \u201cAlexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable\u201d and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[85] Besides the account reported in a previous section about the immediate manifestations of despair by Alexander on his friend\u2019s body, Arrian also relates that \u201cuntil the third day after Hephaestion\u2019s death, Alexander neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning,\u201d and that he had the doctor, Glaucias, hanged for his lack of care.[86] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[87] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[88] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles\u2019 last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre:Thus o\u2019er Patroclus while the hero prayed,on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:And now the sun had set upon their woe.[89]\n\nAnother hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion, and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit with Achilles\u2019 killing of \u201ctwelve high-born youths\u201d beside Patroclus\u2019 funeral pyre.[85]\n\nAlexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire and \u201cmany of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man\u201d.[90] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion\u2019s place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \u201cwished Hephaestion\u2019s name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion\u2019s Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion\u2019s image continued to be carried before it\u201d.[91]\n\nMessengers were sent to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \u201cfrom that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero\u2019s rites\u201d.[92] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion\u2019s memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \u201cTo the Hero Hephaestion\u201d.[93][94]\n\nFuneral\n\nHephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents, about $200,000,000 or $ 240,000,000 in the early 21st century\u2019s money.[95] Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion\u2019s friend Perdiccas.[87] At Babylon, funeral games were held in Hephaestion\u2019s honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[96] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \u201cas this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation\u201d, to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[97]\n\nThe pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[98] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death.[99]\n\nOne final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[100]\n\nBased on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb in northern Greece, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325\u2013300 BC.[101]\n\nAppendix\n\nEndnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nOriginally published by Wikipedia, 03.30.2003, under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}, {"url": "https://jeannereames.net/Hephaistion/history.html", "page_content": "\n\nFAMILY: As Alexander the Great's best friend, Hephaistion grew up with the prince, or at least, they met when young and were about the same age. That means Hephaistion was born c.356 BCE . (We don't know if he was born in 356 exactly, though some assume it. I think he was a year or so older than Alexander.) Supposedly he hailed from Pella, but this attribution occurs in a list with others we know weren't from Pella but acquired later land-grants there later, so his family's origin is unclear.\n\nHe and Alexander went to school together, one of several boys who studied at Mieza under Aristotle (at right). Later, Aristotle wrote him letters, as did Xenokrates, head of Plato's school in Athens. So he might have been an intellectual, or liked people to think so. He turned out to be better at logistics and diplomacy than military combat, and Curtius calls him the king's counselor. All that suggests more brain than brawn. If raised and educated with the prince, his father may have been one of the king's Hetairoi, or Companions, so he was born to a wealthy family. If his father was a Companion, he probably numbered among the king's Pages as a teenager. If called \" Pages\" in most modern texts, the Greek term translates as \"King's Boys ,\" with duties more akin to squires . We don't know his mother's name, or the names of any other relatives , although his grandfather may have been named Demetrios ( IG II\u00b2 405) .\n\nAbout the only other detail of interest is his father's name. Amyntor and Amyntas are dialectical variations, like Stephen and Stefano or Mary and Maria. AmynTAS was the usual version in Macedonia, but AmynTOR in Greece. Furthermore, the name Hephaistion is virtually unknown in Macedonia--our Hephaistion is the only one identified to date--and worship of the god Hephaistos is equally unusual there. Yet like Amyntor, the name Hephaistion is found in Greece. What this means is unclear, but the family may well have had Greek ties of some sort .\n\nA recently published 4th century curse tablet from Pydna names an \"Amyntor\" among the associates of the one directly cursed (Curbera and Jordan, GRBS 43, 2002/3). It is tempting to identify that Amyntor as the father of Hephaistion, but such remains pure speculation. At most, we can say Pydna was a Greek foundation that had been under Macedonian control, off and on, since the reign of Alexandros I. It is possible (possible only) that Hephaistion was the son of a leader of the Macedonian faction in the city, given special honor for support during Philip's reconquest of the town in 357 (the year before Alexander was born)...or alternatively, the son of someone from the opposing faction, taken as a hostage for his father's good behavior (as many of the \"King's Boys\" were).\n\n\n\nLIFE & CAREER: The first time we hear anything of Hephaistion in the histories of Alexander, it's at Troy, where the army made landfall in Asia. There, Alexander did a lot of symbolic things, among them sacrificing at the tomb of Achilles. Hephaistion supposedly sacrificed at the tomb of Patroklos, Achilles's best friend, a nice allusion to their own friendship. Alexander liked those sorts of dramatic gestures, and the Macedonians (not just Alexander) took the Iliad very seriously. It wasn't just a story. They lived it. After that, Alexander marched off to meet the regional Persian army at the Battle of the Granikos. He won, but almost got himself killed in the process. It wasn't Hephaistion who saved him but Kleitos, baby brother to his childhood nurse. In fact, we don't hear of Hephaistion again until the second big battle at Issos. There's a peculiar story in Plutarch that, on the morning before battle, Alexander's officers had come to his tent to receive last minute orders when Hephaistion showed up, saying, \"Health to you,\" instead of \"Joy to you.\" That's like saying, \"Good bye\" or \"Good evening\" instead of \"Hello\" or \"Good morning.\" The officers interpreted it as a bad omen, fearing that Alexander would die. But Alexander re-interpreted it, saying that wishing him health meant he'd live. Quick thinking. But the odd thing about the story is that Hephaistion acted embarrassed rather than alarmed by his slip of the tongue. My own take is that he was leaving the king's tent, not arriving. (Get your minds out of the gutter. Maybe Alexander needed his best friend's company the night before the Big Battle. I doubt he slept much.)\n\nWhere Hephaistion fought at Issos, the histories don't say, but the Alexander Sarcophagus (Istanbul Museum) shows him on horseback. We hear about him again after the battle. Alexander won (of course), and Darius fled the field, leaving behind his treasury, personal effects, and his family. The Greeks thought this meant Darius hadn't taken Alexander seriously, but Persians kings typically traveled with their entire court. So Alexander wound up with all Darius' stuff -- a fancy tent, big bath, huge bed, lots of gold ... and his wife, daughters, and mother. Well, the ladies expected what usually happens to captured women in war: rape. But Alexander sent to them, saying they wouldn't be harmed. They didn't believe it. So he went to tell them in person, Hephaistion with him. As Hephaistion was the taller and more impressive-looking, the queen mother thought he was Alexander and bowed to him. When a eunuch warned her of her mistake, she tried to bow again to the right guy, but Alexander stopped her, saying, \"Never mind, mother. He's Alexander, too.\" Pretty typical of Alexander's chivalry, when in the mood. Although Arrian doesn't quite believe it, the story was popular in antiquity (and with Renaissance painters, as so LeBrun above) . Maybe it happened, maybe it didn't. Even if it didn't, it must have seemed likely or people wouldn't have kept repeating it. In any case, it's while telling this story that Curtius writes the longest description of Hephaistion found in any of the Alexander histories: Hephaistion was by far the dearest of all the king's friends, educated together with him and the counselor of all his secrets. No one had more freedom to admonish Alexander, but he used it in such a way that it seemed granted by the king rather than taken by himself. And although he was around the king's same age, he was of a larger physique. (book 3, chapter 12, trans. mine) After Issos, Hephaistion got his first big command. Alexander decided not to go after Darius, but to continue marching down the coast to cripple the Persian fleet by conquering all their ports. He couldn't leave the fleet behind him, or it might have cut off his own supply lines. One of those ports was at Sidon, and after taking control of the city, Alexander told Hephaistion to find the town a new king. Hephaistion asked his hosts for help, and eventually named Abdalonymos from the old royal line. Supposedly, the guy was a poor farmer as honest as the day is long. The tale of Hephaistion-and-hosts discovering him out weeding his garden is a little too precious, but choosing him proved to be wise, as Abdalonymos reigned a while. The famous Alexander Sarcophagus is really Abdalonymos's sarcophagus, so it's no surprise if Hephaistion was honored by being placed at the middle of the frieze along one side. (The picture on this site's index page is Hephaistion from that sarcophagus.) After Sidon, Hephaistion was put in charge of Alexander's fleet (which w ere recommissioned ships from the Persian fleet) for the seige of Tyre. And later, as the army marched south through harsh terrain towards Egypt, this same fleet sailed along the coast dropping supply magazines. As Napoleon said, an army marches on its stomach and Hephaistion couldn't afford to botch it or he might starve the army, so it was an important command. In Egypt, Alexander was welcomed with open arms. At some point, Hephaistion was sent off on an errand of some kind, perhaps to secure more supplies. He was also visited by a friend of Demosthenes of Athens, who asked him to put in a good word for Demosthenes with the king. One of Alexander's father's arch-rivals, Demosthenes now feared Alexander's success. We're not told if Hephaistion did speak for Demosthenes, but he must've been considered influential for Demosthenes to request his help. It's also in Egypt that Alexander made his famous hike out through what's today the Libyan desert to the oasis of Siwah in order to visit the oracle of Ammon and ask some questions. He took a relatively small group with him , one of whom was Ptolemy, later founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt . It's likely that Hephaistion was another. According to the histories, Alexander kept Ammon's answers to himself but I have to wonder if he did confide in Hephaistion, \"the counselor of all his secrets.\" Hephaistion then disappears from our record until the battle of Gaugamela (or Arbela if you prefer) . This was the last of the three big battles with the Persians, and once again, Darius turned around and ran when he saw Alexander headed for him. Before that battle, Hephaistion may have been in charge of taking some troops to scout across the Tigris, but in the battle, he fought among the Hypaspists, apparently in the front line, and was wounded in the arm from a spear. This brings up an important point. While Hephaistion apparently wasn't much of a tactician or strategist, it shouldn't be assumed he couldn't fight. They're two different skills. Not all good fighters are good strategists, and not all great generals are good fighters. Following this battle, we once again hear nothing of him until Alexander reached Baktria, chasing down Bessus, the man who'd killed Darius and claimed the title of Great King. By this point, Alexander was styling himself Great King and didn't like the competition , though he also claimed to be avenging Darius' murder . In Baktria, Hephaistion received more supply assignments, until being promoted to command of half the Companion Cavalry. Among the plum assignments in the army, the position was open only because of the death of its former commander: Philotas, son of Parmenion. The fall of Philotas came as the result of a conspiracy against Alexander's life. Some (Badian) have doubted there was a conspiracy, and believe Alexander made it all up in order to destroy the family of Parmenion, the man who'd been Philip's best general, good friend, and still had great power and prestige in the Macedonian army.\n\nWhile doubting the conspiracy itself is a bit too skeptical (it makes the Macedonian court sound more like the CIA ), Philotas probably wasn't part of the conspiracy itself, even if accused of -- and killed for -- his supposed participation. Instead, Philotas was guilty of stupidity. One doesn't hear about a conspiracy against the king and not report it. Because Philotas was the eldest son of such a powerful man, Alexander knew he couldn't leave Parmenion alive, as Parmenion had part of the army behind him (at Ekbatana), sitting on his supply lines. So Alexander had Parmenion assassinated. A very practical decision, but not a pretty story, however you slice it. How did Hephaistion fit into all this? Before arresting Philotas, Alexander had called a counsel of his closest advisers and friends. The king's own inclination was to let Philotas off the hook, but the rest of them -- especially Krateros -- talked him out of that. Maybe they did believe Philotas in on the conspiracy. People don't always think straight in the midst of crisis, but once things were in motion, it was too late to pull back. They decided Philotas should be tortured to make him confess, and name others involved. Hephaistion was among the three torturers, along with Krateros and Koenos (Philotas' brother-in-law).\n\nWhat were the motivations of these three? Well, Krateros had been Parmenion's understudy at least since Gaugamela. Next to Alexander himself, he was arguably the most talented younger officer in the army, so Krateros was Philotas's rival. Plutarch says that as far back as Egypt, Krateros had been digging up dirt on Philotas; at the time, Alexander had dismissed it. So it looks as if Krateros had been gunning for Philotas and now seized his chance. Remember, the Macedonian court was highly competitive. Nice guys finished last, if they survived at all. As for the brother-in-law ... well, he didn't want to go under with the ship. He had to separate himself from Philotas's family, or risk his career and maybe his life.\n\nLast, there's Hephaistion. He doesn't have an obvious political motive like Krateros's or Koenos's. That's made some think he went after Philotas for pure meanness or spite, or in order to get Philotas's command. Yet the latter is 20/20 hindsight; at the time, there was no reason for him to assume he would get the command. Krateros had a much better shot, and maybe that's why Alexander didn't give it to him: he suspected Krateros's motives. Yet Hephaistion did have a motive -- the most obvious one of all. Protective revenge. Even if he didn't believe Philotas involved in the conspiracy, by choosing not to report the plot, Philotas could have got Alexander killed. As Alexander's best friend, of course Hephaistion would be hopping mad. Still not something to admire or excuse, but comprehensible as more than innate meanness. After Philotas was executed, Alexander divided command of the Companions between Kleitos (the same guy who saved him at Granikos) and Hephaistion. He didn't want any single officer to have that much power again, even his best friend. But he probably also did it because the troops knew and trusted Kleitos, while Hephaistion remained too green. In fact, Hephaistion never actually commanded his half of the Companions. Not long after, the whole unit was divided up again into several Hipparchies. Hephaistion got one, but his fellow Hipparchs were theoretically his equals. Nonetheless, his star was rising, even if not as a battle commander. He excelled at logistics: getting army supplies, scouting new terrain, and overseeing the construction of towns, forts, and bridges. He also conducted diplomacy. In fact, his first independent assignment of any kind had been to appoint that new king for Sidon, recounted above. Remember that Curtius said he was good at finessing his status at court, making it seem granted by Alexander instead of assumed by him. In another place, Curtius called him \"charming.\" In short, he knew how to manage people, or at least how to manage most people. Apparently, it was Hephaistion who set up the private supper party first introducing proskynesis (the Persian court bow) to Macedonians in a (probable) attempt to unify court procedure. Despite Kallisthenes's refusal to perform the bow, the party was mostly a success, but when they tried to spring proskynesis on the larger court, it failed, and the idea was abandoned. Hephaistion was also used by Alexander in negotiation with Persian aristocrats and Indian rajas.\n\nThe upshot of all this? With Philotas out of the way, Krateros began to get jealous of him. The two repeatedly crossed verbal swords, and once, in India, actually came to blows, each with his own supporters. That must have been one nasty brawl. Alexander was alerted and hurried to separate them, warning them that even though he loved them both, the next time he caught them fighting, he'd kill them, or at least the one who started it. They never fought again, never even said a word against each other. But when the king had first pulled them apart, he'd made a catty remark to Hephaistion right in public. He told him, \"Without me, you're nothing.\" Sometimes his words are interpreted to mean that Hephaistion really was nothing, and only got ahead at court as Alexander's friend. Yet as we've seen, Hephaistion had proven quite successful at his logistical duties, so he wasn't nothing without Alexander. Why, then, would Alexander say so? Well, Alexander was angry. His two top generals were acting like a pair of boys on the play yard, yelling the adult equivalent of, \"Mine is bigger than yours.\" And when angry, especially at those we love best, we can say really awful things. We don't necessarily mean them. But, of course, sometimes we do mean them -- and I think this was a case of both at once. Alexander knew perfectly well what Hephaistion was good at. He repeatedly assigned him the same sorts of jobs. But what Hephaistion did best -- logistics and diplomacy -- wasn't well-regarded by his fellow officers. It was combat skill that men admired in antiquity. Ancient historians never had much to say about logistics unless something went wrong. (Boy, then we hear about it!) And if Alexander knew Hephaistion's strengths, he also recognized that his friend was no combat commander. Every time Hephaistion had to command in battle, he was co-assigned with another officer, apparently to help (Perdi kk as, Demetrios, Peithon, or Alexander himself) . That protected Hephaistion's honor, but also kept him from making poor choices that might leave him looking a fool (or dead). Hephaistion commands alone only when unlikely to see combat. In fact, Hephaistion himself may not have had a very high opinion of his own talents; children (and adults) learn what they live, and he was raised in a culture that admired warfare. Alexander had many skills, both strategic and logistical. So his culture's bias in favor of combat over more peaceful pursuits perhaps reared its head here. I think Alexander meant that without his affection which led to recognition, Hephaistion's talents would never have got him so high in the army. After all, he was \"just\" a logistics officer. Never mind that, after Parmenion's murder, he was chief logistics officer.\n\nYet in the end, being chief logistics officer would net him the highest position in the empire after Alexander's own. Following Hephaistion and Krateros's big fight, they were kept carefully apart. Eventually, Krateros would be sent back to Macedonia to take over as regent. It was the highest assignment he could receive that wasn't at Alexander's own side, and also wasn't in spitting distance of Hephaistion . Meanwhile, Hephaistion's assignments in India were more of the same: logistics and supply. For instance, while Alexander was getting himself shot at in Mallia, Hephaistion was sent south to make a base camp with Nearkhos, while Krateros was to meet them with non-combatants, spare troops, and elephants. Apparently, both men were still in the dog house. Hephaistion fortified a port, and then followed Alexander into the Gedrosian desert disaster while Krateros went north with the slower-moving troops. (Gedrosia wasn't as stupid a move as it's sometimes made out to be; had the supply plans worked, things would have been fine. Instead, there was a little problem called rebellion behind them in India that delayed the launch of Near k h o s's fleet.) Hephaistion was also in Karmania for that infamous Dionysian revel after they emerged from Gedrosia with less than three quarters of the people they'd gone in with. They weren't celebrating the losses; they were celebrating having survived at all. There, Alexander gave out a number of special awards, among them a gold crown for Hephaistion. No ancient historian says what the award was for specifically. Maybe just for putting up with Alexander in a peevish mood. Hephaistion and Alexander are both now in their final year of life, although neither knew it. At this point, Hephaistion probably hit the pinnacle of his career: Alexander named him Chiliarch, or Grand Vizier (in Persian, hazarapatish). This position at the Persian court had been vacant since Darius had executed the infamous Bagoas, who'd killed kings and made new ones with equal enthusiasm. Alexander revived it for Hephaistion. Yet in truth, it was revived for practical purposes and Hephaistion was the ideal man to fill it. The Chiliarch kept court affairs running smoothly, and who better to do that than Hephaistion? It was an administrative office. Unfortunately, he held it only a few months before his death. Still, that was long enough for him to make an enemy of Eumenes, Alexander's chief secretary.\n\nPart of Hephaistion's new job would have been deciding what correspondence and documents should be forwarded to the king. Before that, such decisions would have been Eumenes's, who'd answered directly to Alexander. Now Eumenes had to answer to Hephaistion. Such bureaucracy might be necessary, but few liked it, especially not those demoted to middle management who'd once stood higher in the scheme of things. Perhaps (maybe even probably) Hephaistion did do something to piss off Eumenes, but the larger political context shouldn't be ignored. After Karmania, Alexander moved court to Susa in order to settle his Persian affairs before launching his next big campaign , which, of course, never happened . At Susa, he held a mass wedding for himself and his ranking Macedonian officers, who married aristocratic Persian brides. Once, this was believed to have been an attempt by Alexander to introduce a \"Brotherhood of Mankind\" (so, Tarn). That belief was a product of Nineteenth Century Romanticism, not cold reality. Alexander was tying his top officers to important families in Persia. His own bride was, of course, Darius' elder daughter, and to his best friend -- and new Chiliarch -- Alexander gave Darius's younger daughter, Drypetis. Curiously, Alexander's reason for the match wasn't to honor Hephaistion (or not that only) , but to make his and Hephaistion's children cousins. Sweet. Probably genuine, as well. Alexander was sentimental that way. The story winds to a tragic close soon after. From Susa, Alexander took his court-cum-army north to Ekbatana. And it was at Ekbatana that Hephaistion fell sick with a fever and died, probably in late October.\n\nDEATH: Was Hephaistion poisoned by his enemies? Did Alexander go crazy with grief after his friend's demise? Was there a plot against Alexander's own life, hatched by his chief officers? Popular questions. The answers are no, no, and no. Hephaistion was sick. He died. That happened. That happened a lot in antiquity, even to the rich and famous and apparently healthy. Diseases that we shrug off today could be fatal back then. No one knows exactly what he died of. Maybe typhoid, maybe malaria. There isn't enough (good) information about his illness even to guess. As for the poison theory (whose proponents point to a boiled chicken and some wine that Hephaistion reportedly ate on the morning of his demise) , at a highly suspicious court, if Alexander didn't believe Hephaistion poisoned and subsequently turn out the dogs after the murderer of his closest friend, then I don't think we should assume it, either. Alexander did have the doctor hanged, but that was for malpractice, not fear of conspiracy and murder. Hephaistion died of a fever. Case closed. So did Alexander go crazy with grief? No, he didn't. He reacted just like most people who lose a spouse, a very close friend, or a dear family member. The main difference is that he had enough money (and power) to have his wishes obeyed. If more people knew some of the odd (but perfectly normal under the circumstances) things grieving people do, they wouldn't think Alexander's actions so extreme. Grief of that sort is intense, and doesn't go away overnight, or even in a few weeks or few months. And although grief is something that happens to all of us, unless we're in a job or situation where we deal with grieving people regularly, we often don't recognize normal grieving behavior. Alexander's actions were, in fact, pretty normal, and he was starting to come out of his grief around the time of his own death, eight months later in Babylon ... ... which brings us to Alexander's death. Some consider the nearness in time of his death to Hephaistion's and once more, the old \"It must've been poison!\" theory pops up (in part fueled by ancient accusations of poison leveled against Antipatros's family). But to that, we can just repeat the refrain above: Alexander was sick. Alexander died. That happened. That happened a lot in antiquity, even to the rich and famous and apparently healthy. There's been far more speculation about Alexander's final illness. The current reigning theory is typhoid with complications, although not everyone buys it, and malaria is still a strong favorite among dissenters. Did Alexander's grief over Hephaistion contribute to his death? Maybe so. That's not being sentimental. It's a recognized, medically documented fact that grieving people are at a higher risk for certain illnesses, including communicable illnesses such as typhoid (or malaria). Certainly, the stress of grief didn't help his health and he already suffered from several ill-healed wounds. So while Alexander didn't die of a broken heart (sorry, poets), I think it safe to say that losing Hephaistion did indeed contribute to his own demise.\n\n\n\nAll material on this page is copyrighted to Jeanne Reames, and much has been published in other [more academic] venues.

He was born at an unknown date, but sources refer to him as being of the same age as Alexander, or perhaps a little older. When the two men first met is not certain. However, it is possible that Hephaestion shared Alexander\ufffds education in the village of Mieza with Aristotle as teacher, like other noble boys. The philosopher is known to have dedicated a volume of letters to him, so they must have met.\n\nHephaestion accompanied Alexander\ufffds campaign in Asia from the very beginning, fighting in the Companions Cavalry Unit[?]. Passing through the city of Troy, Alexander and Hephaestion honoured the sacred tombs of the hero Achilles and is close friend Patroclus, assuming in the view of the whole army, the nature of the relation they shared. After the Battle of Issus, Alexander and Hephaestion went to inspect the spoils of war, which included King Darius[?]\ufffds baggage train, family and royal harem. One of the best-known episodes of Hephaestion\ufffds life takes place when they both met Stateira and Sysigambis, Darius\ufffds pregnant wife and mother. Looking at the two men, the queen mother paid her respects first to Hephaestion, who was the tallest and most impressive, by Persian standards, of the two. The king corrected her by saying \ufffdDon\ufffdt worry, he too is Alexander\".\n\nBefore the India invasion and the crossing of the Hindu Kush mountains, in modern Afghanistan , Alexander made Hephaestion a chiliarch and vizier, recognizing him as second in command. During the India campaign Hephaestion again assumed military responsibilities in the vanguard, bridging rivers and leading one Companion squadron in the Battle of Jhelum[?]\n\nBack in Susa, capital of the Persian Empire, Alexander married Darius\ufffds daughter Stateira and gave her younger sister as a wife to Hephaestion, making him his brother-in-law.\n\nIn the autumn of 324 BC, Alexander\ufffds army was stationed in the city of Hamadan for the winter. Hephaestion fell sick during the games that were being held for the court and died a week later. Described symptoms are compatible with typhoid fever, but the possibility of poisoning was never ruled out. As Alexander's favourite and intimate friend, his political enemies must have abounded. Whatever the cause, Alexander is reported to have gone mad with grief, shaving his head, as well as the mares of the army horses, cancelling all the festivities, and, legend says, crucifying the attending doctor. He set immediately to Babylon with the body, where he held fabulous funeral games in his memory. It was determined that Hephaestion should be worshiped as a divine hero. A huge funeral memorial was still being built in Hephaistion\ufffds honour, when Alexander himself died, a few months later.\n\nReferences\n\nPlutarch, Life of Alexander.
