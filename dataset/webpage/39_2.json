She grew up in Johannesburg and went to Witwatersrand University for her undergraduate studies. She received there the B.A. degree in anthropology. In 1932, she came to London, where she studied under the charismatic teacher Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics, where she obtained the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in social anthropology.\n\nIn 1934, she was awarded a grant by the International African Institute of London to study the Swazi. So began her lifelong association with Swaziland and its royal family. Her first books were on the Swazi, An African Aristocracy and The Uniform of Colour, both published in 1947. Her last was a revised edition of The Swazi: A South African Kingdom; published in 1986, it brings the Swazi history up to 1983.\n\nFor almost six decades, she was committed to the study, defense, and illustration of the Swazi traditions as embodied in the social and political vision of King Sobhuza II, a friend from the thirties to the eighties--he died in 1982. In 1970, three years after Swaziland became an independent state, Sobhuza granted her Swazi citizenship. Later he appointed her his official biographer. She wrote the authoritative history of his reign--in fact the history of Swaziland in the twentieth century, as Sobhuza was born in 1899. The book, Sobhuza II, Ngwenyama and King of Swaziland, was published in 1978.\n\nIn 1936, Hilda married Leo Kuper, a South African lawyer who later trained for a Ph.D. in sociology (eventually he became head of the sociology department at the University of Natal and then professor of sociology at UCLA). With him, Hilda was active in political movements;\n\n\u2015 155 \u2015\n\nthe Kupers were among the founding members of the Liberal Party. Convinced that social reform could be achieved through knowledge, she studied the Indian community of Durban (, 1960). During that period she also published two detailed ethnographies,, 1952, and, 1955, faithfully conforming to the famous outline of the Ethnographic Survey of Africa.\n\nHilda Kuper's main career was academic. While in South Africa, she taught at the Universities of Witwatersrand and Natal, and held visiting positions at the Universities of Birmingham and North Carolina. In 1961, harassment of opposition intellectuals having increased in South Africa, the Kupers left the country and settled in the United States.\n\nIn 1963, Hilda Kuper joined the Department of Anthropology at UCLA, where she was an influential and inspirational teacher. Until her retirement in 1977, she offered a variety of courses and seminars on the traditional societies of Africa, and on specialized topics such as British social anthropology, biography in anthropology, and fiction as a means of understanding the thought and affectivity of another culture. Her two works of fiction, a novel, The Bite of Hunger, 1965, and a play, A Witch in my Heart, 1970, are brilliant examples of intuitive communication of deep meanings that complement the knowledge of another culture gained by discursive scholarship. Because of her clear, warm, and convincing teaching style, she was recalled in 1989 to create a new course, Destruction and Survival of Indigenous Societies.\n\nHilda Kuper was awarded the Rivers Memorial Medal for field work by the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1961 and an honorary doctorate of letters by the University of Swaziland in 1990.\n\nHilda Kuper's contributions to anthropology are considerable in substance and interpretation. In substance, she has enriched the body of ethnographic knowledge--still the foundation of anthropology--by her thorough and meticulous descriptions of the Swazi and Shona cultures. In interpretation, she has demonstrated that strict reasoning and sharp argumentation do not preclude insight and empathy, that a generous and fearless advocacy is compatible with an honest and complete presentation of all the facts, and that an appreciation of ancient traditions does not divert from urgent contemporary issues.\n\nHilda Kuper was survived by her husband, Leo, who died in 1994, and two daughters, Jenny and Marry, and three grandchildren.\n\nWolf Leslau Jacques Maquet Charles Nixon"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/hilda-kuper/", "page_content": "Hilda Beemer Kuper, n\u00e9e Beemer (23 August 1911 \u2013 1992), was a social anthropologist most notable for her extensive work on Swazi culture.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn to Lithuanian Jewish and Austrian Jewish parents in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, Kuper moved to South Africa after the death of her father. She studied at the University of the Witwatersrand and, afterwards, at the London School of Economics under Malinowski.\n\nDoctoral fieldwork and anthropological career\n\nIn 1934, Kuper won a fellowship from the International African Institute to study in Swaziland. In July of that year, while at an education conference in Johannesburg, she met Sobhuza II, paramount chief and later king of Swaziland. With assistance from Sobhuza and Malinowski, Kuper moved to the royal village of Lobamba and was introduced to Sobhuza's mother, the queen mother Lomawa. Here Kuper learned siSwati and pursued her fieldwork. This phase of Kuper's researches into Swazi culture culminated in the two-part dissertation, An African Aristocracy: Rank among the Swazi (1947) and The Uniform of Colour: a Study of White\u2013Black Relationships in Swaziland (1947).\n\nIn the early 1950s, Kuper moved to Durban. During that decade, she focused her studies on the Indian community in the Natal region, as summarised in Indian People in Natal (1960). In 1953, Kuper received a senior lectureship at the University of Natal in Durban. In addition to her academic work, together with her husband, Leo Kuper, she helped to found the Liberal Party in Natal\n\nIn 1961 the Kupers moved to Los Angeles, to escape the harassment of liberals that was increasingly prevalent in apartheid South Africa, and to enable Leo to accept a professorship in sociology at UCLA. In 1963 Kuper published The Swazi: a South African Kingdom and was herself appointed professor of anthropology at UCLA. Kuper was a popular teacher, and In 1969 won a Guggenheim fellowship.\n\nIn 1978, Kuper published an extensive, official biography of Sobhuza II, King Sobhuza II, Ngwenyama and King of Swaziland.\n\nAwards\n\nAward Awarding body Year Rivers Memorial Medal Royal Anthropological Institute 1961 Guggenheim Fellowship John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation 1969 Honorary doctorate University of Swaziland 1990\n\nPersonal life\n\nKuper married Leo Kuper in 1936.

More than an intellectual history, it brings to life the personalities and clashes during a time that spawned outsize personalities, moments of brilliance, and several generations of students. Disconcerting initially to some of the protagonists for its clarity of the issues and their positions, the book remains appreciated for the same reason.\"\n\n- Stephen Gudeman, University of Minnesota, USA\n\n\"This new edition incorporates insights and evidence from recent research. However that doesn\u2019t prevent it from being as witty, entertaining, and compulsively readable as before. When the first edition came out, anthropology\u2019s tribal elders reacted with shock and dismay at its irreverent and familiar tone. Kuper is now one of the elders himself, but what hasn\u2019t changed is that neophyte anthropologists and lecturers alike will continue to rely on his book.\"\n\n- David N.

This is formally assessed by the Department. You will normally be upgraded from MRes to PhD registration if your proposal is approved, and if you have achieved the required marks in your coursework. You are then allowed to proceed to fieldwork.\n\nQualitative and Quantitative Methods for Anthropologists\n\nProvides you with insights into the process by which anthropological knowledge is produced, and trains you in the collection and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nEvidence and Arguments in Anthropology and Other Social Sciences\n\nConsiders research practices across a range of social and natural sciences in order to explore methodological issues which are specifically relevant to ethnography.\n\nSupervised Reading Course and Fieldwork Preparation\n\nGives you a detailed knowledge of the regional ethnographic literature relevant to your proposed research project, as well as providing you with a firm grounding in the theoretical literature relevant to your research objectives.\n\nResearch Proposal\n\nPreparation of a formal Research Proposal of 8,000-10,000 words for submission to the Department on or before the deadline in June/August.\n\nSeminar on Anthropological Research\n\nPhD\n\nAfter meeting the progression requirements, you will be upgraded to PhD registration and will commence the fieldwork phase of the programme. Most students carry out fieldwork for approximately 18 months, however the timing and duration of the fieldwork and post-fieldwork stages may vary to some extent between students. During fieldwork \u2013 depending on the practicalities of communication \u2013 you are expected to maintain close contact with your supervisor about the progress of your work.\n\nAfter fieldwork, doctoral candidates begin writing their PhD dissertations under the close guidance of their supervisors. During this period of your studies, you will also attend seminars on: thesis-writing; professional development and our departmental seminar in which external speakers present their latest research. Most students complete their dissertations between one and two years after their fieldwork has ended.\n\nFirst and second year of the PhD (typically 18 months)\n\nFieldwork\n\nSecond to fourth year of the PhD (typically 18 to 24 months)\n\nAdvanced Professional Development in Anthropology\n\nExamines key theoretical concepts and approaches in anthropology at an advanced level that may be relevant to post-fieldwork doctoral candidates.
