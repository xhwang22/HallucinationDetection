In a sense, he knew why. Kelvin is an avid outdoorsman, and even on a stark February day, with snow blanketing the earth and bitter wind whistling through the trees, he was moved by Appalachia\u2019s subtle splendor. He understood why a man might settle there.\n\n\u201cI love West Virginia,\u201d Kelvin had said earlier, on the four-and-a-half-hour drive from his home just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my favorite place on the planet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also full of sorrow.\n\nWhen Pierce\u2019s father bought 346 acres in Mill Point, and relocated there permanently in 1985, he left his family behind. He started building a compound where a new kind of family \u2013 men and women of like mind \u2013 could live off the land and be free of outside influences. He moved into a rambling trailer home, where he lived with a series of wives who weren\u2019t Pierce\u2019s mother. He had divorced her, declaring the split \u201cnecessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\u201d.\n\nNothing was more important to Kelvin\u2019s father than white supremacy. The abandonment and the hate \u2013 the abandonment for hate \u2013 is what Kelvin has spent the better part of his life struggling to understand.\n\nTo family and friends, his dad was Bill. To everyone else, he was William Luther Pierce III, one of America\u2019s most prominent white nationalists.\n\nA physics professor turned neo-Nazi, William Pierce led a hate group called the National Alliance and a business empire that, at the time of his death from cancer in 2002, raked in $1m a year. He published books and magazines, hosted a radio program, and owned a music label, all of which promoted white supremacy. His work galvanized violent gangs, such as the Order and the Aryan Republican Army. Most infamously, it inspired the architect of the Oklahoma City bombing \u2013 Timothy McVeigh designed the attack based in part on Pierce\u2019s 1978 novel The Turner Diaries.\n\nReportedly called \u201cthe bible of the racist right\u201d by the FBI, The Turner Diaries is a fantasy about white militants overthrowing the US government as part of a bloody race war. A 2016 report found that the book had been tied to at least 200 murders, committed in 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes. This year, during the 6 January coup attempt, there were echoes of the novel\u2019s core ideas in insurrectionists\u2019 calls to kill members of Congress, and in a gallows erected near the Capitol.\n\nWilliam Pierce raised Kelvin to hate Jews, Black people, immigrants \u2013 anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Now 60, Kelvin has long rejected his father\u2019s ideology, but only recently has he reached the point where he\u2019s ready to talk about his upbringing, and how his story illuminates the toxic currents roiling America. \u201cIf I can help one other person that felt the way I used to feel, to feel better and to make different choices, then that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cAnd I think I can help more than one person.\u201d\n\nWhen he was little, Kelvin would sneak into his dad\u2019s home office in northern Virginia to look at the bust of Adolf Hitler and the glass paperweight in the shape of a swastika that sat on the desk. Kelvin didn\u2019t know what the items meant, and William Pierce wasn\u2019t interested in explaining. He rarely spent time with Kelvin and his twin brother, Erik, preferring to fraternize with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi party, or to lock himself away writing articles decrying Jewish power and interracial marriage.\n\nKelvin\u2019s strongest memories of his dad involve abuse. Any disobedience or perception of bad behavior led to beatings with whatever was at hand: a belt, a wire hanger, a two-by-four. The violence left Kelvin with bruises and a deep well of self-loathing.\n\nHis mom, Patty, didn\u2019t approve of the cruelty, but she didn\u2019t do much to intervene. She took a similar approach to her husband\u2019s extremism, which he\u2019d nurtured since at least the early 1960s. A math professor and the family breadwinner, because her husband had given up his own academic career to become an ideologue of hate, Patty did all of William Pierce\u2019s accounting and typing. Kelvin said his mom was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d when her husband started a firearms business \u2013 not because he advertised his stock as \u201cNegro control equipment\u201d necessary for \u201cthe coming race war\u201d, but because it prompted newspapers to publish articles about him. Patty worried that someone might come to the house and hurt her family.\n\nFamily photos from the archive of Kelvin Pierce. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWhen her sons told her that neighborhood kids made fun of them by calling them Nazis, she lamented that \u201cit\u2019s a terrible world\u201d and \u201cpeople are awful\u201d. She didn\u2019t answer when Kelvin asked her what a Nazi was, and she didn\u2019t tell her boys that their father was to blame for what was happening to them.\n\nAs a teenager, Kelvin was a bigot because he didn\u2019t know any other way to be. He also hoped it would impress his dad. In high school, he gave a presentation on Hitler\u2019s virtues and used the N-word to talk about Black classmates. By the time he went to college, he was \u201ca mobile advertisement\u201d for his father\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel superior to be part of the white race,\u201d Kelvin later wrote. \u201cYet deep, deep down, something didn\u2019t quite feel right about it either.\u201d\n\nHe began to change when he transferred from a small Christian college to Virginia Tech. He roomed with a young man from South America who was \u201cthoughtful, caring and very intelligent\u201d \u2013 all things that Kelvin\u2019s father insisted people who weren\u2019t white couldn\u2019t be. He took classes with students who saw the world very differently than he did. When Ronald Reagan was elected president and many of his liberal peers were visibly upset \u2013 including his roommate, who drew a dagger and drops of blood on a photo of Reagan \u2013 he wanted to understand why. He started paying attention to politics and watching the evening news, which his dad had always said was worthless because Jews controlled the media. Kelvin wondered if everything he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nHe met a fellow student named Susan when they were both engineering interns with the navy one summer. Kelvin thought she was beautiful, but while his racism was rapidly dissipating, his shame \u2013 the feeling that his dad had abused him for a reason, that he deserved it \u2013 was not. He couldn\u2019t imagine making the first move, but Susan could. \u201cYou know, if you were to ask me out, I would say yes,\u201d she announced one day.\n\nThey were married in 1986. William Pierce came to the wedding. His gift to the bride and groom was a box of 9mm ammunition. \u201cTo keep the wolves away from your door!\u201d his note read. Kelvin didn\u2019t even own a gun.\n\nBy then, William Pierce had divorced Patty, decamped to Mill Point, and curtailed contact with his sons. Kelvin only confronted his dad once, asking why he\u2019d chosen white supremacy over everything else in his life. \u201cIt was the only responsible thing I could do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nFor her part, Susan didn\u2019t think that William Pierce\u2019s worldview mattered. \u201cThank goodness that\u2019s a dying thought process,\u201d she recalled thinking \u2013 an assumption she now sees as optimistic, or perhaps naive. It was also hard for her to fathom the extent of the abuse Kelvin suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, he hit me every day,\u201d he told her once.\n\n\u201cEvery day?\u201d she replied, incredulous.\n\nSusan had grown up in a home where, as she put it, \u201cWe were always hugging each other, and we always said, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Kelvin had kids only because they agreed to adopt them. \u201cI was just terrified of furthering my genes,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cI was so messed up and so damaged as a human being that I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of trying to make another human being.\u201d Their daughters, Mariame and Marieka, are from the country of Georgia. Kelvin vowed to love them like he\u2019d never been loved. He coached their softball teams and took them on camping trips.\n\nKelvin with his daughter Marieka. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWilliam Pierce never met his granddaughters. For seven years prior to his death, he didn\u2019t reply to the letters and photos documenting their childhood that Kelvin sent him. Despite everything, Kelvin kept reaching out. His anger at how he\u2019d been raised collided with yearning for paternal approval. When he first heard of the connection between The Turner Diaries and the Oklahoma City bombing, his kneejerk reaction was a perverse kind of pride that his dad was in the news. He was ashamed his mind went there, but at a loss for how to stop it.\n\nKelvin was battling his demons without armor or weapons. He was also doing it alone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mystery to me,\u201d Susan would tell him sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d\n\nIn July 2002, his uncle called to tell him that his father was dead. Kelvin hadn\u2019t even known he was sick. He surprised himself by crying, then realized what he was really mourning: he had to let go of the futile hope that his father might one day love him. He went to West Virginia for the memorial service, where neo-Nazis offered their condolences and said Kelvin must have admired his father very much.\n\nHow little they know, he thought.\n\nHe looked like his dad \u2013 tall and lanky, with mournful eyes, a long, square jaw, and prominent ears. He shared William Pierce\u2019s introspection and his dislike of being told what to do. But the similarities ended there.\n\nAfter the service, he began to feel something new: he was sad for his father and the life he\u2019d led. It could have been different. But again and again, William Pierce had made the wrong choices, leaving heartache and hate in his wake.\n\nKelvin wanted to start making better choices of his own.\n\nTo Mariame Pierce, her dad\u2019s bookshelf told the story. When she was little, it held volumes about Kelvin\u2019s hobbies \u2013 mountain climbing, for instance. Over time, new titles appeared, ones about self-discovery and philosophy, written by Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra. While she was growing up, her dad was changing too. \u201cHe became more present and thoughtful, more conscious and intentional,\u201d said Mariame, now 25.\n\nKelvin had embarked on a \u201chealing\u201d journey, as he describes it. He read, reflected and prayed. He worked with a counselor to process his childhood trauma, including his father\u2019s belief system. He and Susan, who already ran a successful construction business together, started a charitable foundation to support orphanages in Georgia. When he posted pictures from visits to his daughters\u2019 native country, friends remarked that he looked uncharacteristically happy. \u201cTo make a child feel like at least somebody in the world loves them, it\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nHe told his life story publicly for the first time at his local Rotary Club. He described how, in his youth, he\u2019d fantasized about traveling to Washington with a gun and opening fire on Black people. His teenage dreams now repulsed him. Afterward, audience members came up to thank him. Some of them were crying.\n\nThe more he talked about his experiences, the more people told Kelvin he should write a book. It took a seismic national event for him to decide they were right.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Watching the events unfold, \u201cI was immediately transported back to my childhood,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cThe hatefulness of their energy and what they were saying, the way they were saying it, especially \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 it was just like being an eight- or nine-year-old kid, when my dad took me to an American Nazi party picnic.\u201d\n\nHe started writing what would become Sins of My Father, which he self-published in February 2020. In addition to telling Kelvin\u2019s personal story the book, written with Carole Donoghue, draws on private letters and other archival documents that reveal how perceived grievances, personal disappointment, and twisted self-regard led William Pierce to dedicate his life to white supremacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when his father\u2019s beliefs began to curdle \u2013 stories of radicalization are never so precise \u2013 Kelvin finds seeds of discontent in the years when William Pierce was a new husband, a new father and newly endowed with his physics doctorate. \u201cI think Dad was becoming angry and resentful and was suddenly frightened of the future and the heaviness of it all,\u201d Kelvin writes. \u201cHe hated the idea of working for someone else. He never wanted to have to answer to anyone else, even his wife.\u201d\n\nThis period in William Pierce\u2019s life coincided with the rise of progressive identity politics \u2013 the acceleration of the civil rights movement, for instance, and the dawn of second-wave feminism. He wanted to be a man who mattered, a man people listened to. White nationalism allowed him to be that. His life became one long ideological devolution, nourished by the power and attention he accrued evangelizing about hate.\n\nKelvin Pierce photographed at his home in Vienna. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nIf the story sounds familiar, it is. America is still plagued by the forces of rightwing radicalization. Sins of My Father draws parallels between William Pierce and Donald Trump, who \u201cemboldened white supremacists and mass-shooters by his words and deeds,\u201d as Kelvin writes. \u201cIn many ways, Trump has succeeded where Dad failed. He has taken hate and discrimination mainstream.\u201d\n\nOther evidence of his father\u2019s enduring impact hit closer to home. After Marieka Pierce enrolled in a police academy in Virginia, one day in class, her instructors showed the room a picture of her grandfather, describing him as an example of a homegrown extremist. \u201cMy hand went up,\u201d Marieka later told her mom.\n\nThe instructors were stunned to hear about the family connection. William Pierce was a staple in their curriculum about hate crimes; they\u2019d been teaching recruits about him for as long as they could remember. They asked to meet Kelvin to get a fuller picture of the man who, in obituaries, was remembered as \u201ca cold and calculating racist\u201d and \u201cthe godfather of hate in this country.\u201d\n\nDonny MacMullen has his own take on William Pierce: he thinks Kelvin\u2019s father was a great man.\n\nMacMullen, who is in his 30s, with reddish brown hair, a full beard, and striking blue eyes, moved to Mill Point from Massachusetts a few years ago to help preserve Pierce\u2019s legacy. Today, he\u2019s the caretaker of the National Alliance compound, which amounts to a few scattered buildings and the rocky sprawls of land between them.\n\nThe place is in a state of disrepair, and people rarely visit, but there are reminders of the community Kelvin\u2019s dad was trying to build before he died: an AV facility stocked with equipment that was first-rate in the early aughts; a library that once housed several thousand volumes; stacks of slickly produced magazines promoting racism; a meeting house where William Pierce presided over annual National Alliance conferences. Today, even as Pierce\u2019s ideas continue to find adherents, the organization he started is a shade of its former self.\n\nMacMullen was happy to welcome Kelvin to the compound in February. Indeed, members of the National Alliance had long made clear that William Pierce\u2019s son could visit anytime. For more than 15 years after his father\u2019s death, however, Kelvin stayed away. He wasn\u2019t ready to make peace with it, because he wasn\u2019t at peace with himself.\n\nIt was a steep drive up switchbacks to the heart of the compound, where MacMullen was waiting, wearing a knit cap with a swastika stitched to the front. When Kelvin asked him about the symbol, MacMullen laughed. It just represents love for the white race, he insisted. Kelvin pointed out that it was associated with hate and genocide, and MacMullen shifted gears. If you love something deeply, he said, then you have to hate anything that threatens it.\n\nDonny MacMullen\u2019s office at the West Virginia compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThis was another way of expressing the sentiment of a meme MacMullen once posted on his Facebook page: \u201cI\u2019m white but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist \u2026 I will put my boot in your ass, my knife to your throat, and your body in the dirt if you f**k with me and mine.\u201d\n\nKelvin and MacMullen walked for a while on the property, just the two of them. If it was painful to talk with a man who revered his father \u2013 who saw virtue in a racist who beat him every day of his childhood \u2013 Kelvin didn\u2019t let it show. They talked about their divergent beliefs, and neither man was interested in budging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree,\u201d MacMullen said at one point.\n\nWhen Kelvin recounted the conversation to his best friend, Gil Jullien, who\u2019d come on the trip as moral support, Jullien was furious. \u201cOh, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to disagree!\u201d\n\nJullien was speaking from experience. He was troubled that a close childhood friend had become a vociferous Trump supporter, the sort who regularly posts racist and sexist content on Facebook. Once, when the two men were at a high school reunion talking politics, Jullien\u2019s friend had told him they\u2019d have to agree to disagree. Jullien wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s ruining our country, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he later explained.\n\nKelvin shares Jullien\u2019s moral compass. \u201cAggression and hate and violence are the epitome of cowardice,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t want to feel antagonism or resentment toward anyone, not even white nationalists.\n\nHe prefers to listen and question, not to confront; to offer the possibility of connection rather than writing people off. His approach might not be for everyone, but for Kelvin it\u2019s vital. If he could be redeemed, why not someone like MacMullen?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself out there for people that want help and want change,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nBefore Kelvin left the compound, MacMullen gave him a copy of a book \u2013 a tome, really, at more than 1,000 pages. Written in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist who ran in the same circles as William Pierce, Which Way Western Man? bemoans the supposed decline of white civilization, the rise of feminism and multiculturalism, and the alleged chokehold liberal orthodoxy has on modern society \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of white supremacy\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nMacMullen said the text meant a lot to him. Back home in Virginia, in the spirit of listening and questioning, Kelvin cracked the book and read the first 50 or so pages. \u201cIt kind of boils down to, do you live your life stuck in the rat race, within society\u2019s norms, or do you break out from that and try to live a more authentic life, doing what you want to do, what you feel is right versus what society says is right?\u201d he said.\n\nThe language struck a chord. He heard echoes of his own transformation, of setting a new course for himself. Whereas Kelvin chose a path defined by hope and inclusivity, people who admire his father have let bigotry be their guide. Still, in their journeys\u2019 common origin, Kelvin saw promise \u2013 the possibility of trying again, and getting it right this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as insurmountable a task to start a recovery process as some people think. It does take discipline, but it actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that, right?\u201d\n\nThe trailer where William Luther Pierce once lived lies in disrepair at the National Alliance compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThe last time Kelvin saw his father, he jumped off a mountain.\n\nKelvin had started hang-gliding in his 20s, and during his first visit to the compound in West Virginia \u2013 the only one he took while William Pierce was alive \u2013 his dad had suggested he glide off one of the property\u2019s peaks. No way, Kelvin told him. There weren\u2019t open areas below where he could land. At best he\u2019d come away injured; at worst he could die.\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Kelvin traveled to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, for a series of flights over the Labor Day weekend. He invited his dad to come watch him. He didn\u2019t expect him to show, but as Kelvin was untying his glider from its rack on his truck, he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cYou need a hand with that?\u201d his father asked.\n\n\u201cYou actually came,\u201d Kelvin replied.\n\nWith his father\u2019s help, Kelvin made quick work of maneuvering his 80lb glider to the launch site. Before them was a pleated vista, gentle peaks and valleys thick with late-summer green. Kelvin suited up and pointed to the landing field where his father could meet him. \u201cClear!\u201d he yelled, before taking a few running steps and leaving the earth.\n\nThe flight was perfect. A swell of wind \u2013 a lift, as hang-gliders say \u2013 allowed Kelvin to pilot much higher than he\u2019d planned, rendering his dad a dot on the ground. He stayed in the sky for an hour. The view was majestic: forests and farms and fields stretching beneath him.\n\nHe touched down with ease in a wide field. As he was packing up his gear, he heard the familiar voice again: \u201cWow, Kelvin, that was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Kelvin knew for certain he\u2019d impressed his father.\n\nThey stood in the landing field talking for a bit longer. Then father and son said their goodbyes and went their separate ways: William Pierce to what Kelvin called \u201chis life of hate at the compound\u201d; he to new chapters of his existence. Some, such as parenthood, would be joyous. Wrestling with his past would be torment. But just like he navigated the wind high above the mountains, Kelvin would steer himself to a place where he could land, safe and whole, and invite others to join him, if only they too have the courage to leap.\n\nKelvin Pierce at a park nearby his home in Virginia.

From Pierce's perspective, William Luther Pierce and his followers had two goals: to turn all of America into a \"white-only homeland,\" and to violently overthrow the U.S. government in the name of white nationalism.\n\nThough Pierce\u2019s father died in 2002 and the National Alliance\u2019s position in the white power movement has since faded, the hatred and bigotry behind it all have not. In fact, counterterrorism officials warn that, after years of decline, hate groups are once again proliferating inside the United States \u2013 an unnerving reality mirrored by what Pierce saw that rainy morning on the West Virginia compound.\n\n\u201cIt sat derelict for years, but now they have people working on the property, and they're kind of trying to bring it back to life,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nWhen Pierce first negotiated for permission to tour the property, the new head of the National Alliance, Will Williams, even told Pierce: \u201cEverybody thought we were down and out. But we're back. \u2026 We are definitely back,\u201d Pierce recalled Williams saying.\n\nIn this Aug. 24, 2004, file photo, National Alliance members march on the yard of the Capitol Building along side other racists groups, like skinheads and klansmen during a protest in Washington, DC.

Counseling. Spiritual studies. A lot of reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that's when I started this journey of challenging my thoughts and adopting a more spiritual worldview, and look at human beings,\u201d he said. \"I learned that I did not need to attach myself and my self worth to all of the fearful and hateful thoughts \u2026 That I could choose different thoughts.

We would like peaceful separation.\"\n\n\"But it's not going to be peaceful,\" he warned. \"Our enemies are rabid.\"\n\nPierce said the current state of the white power movement means there has been \"a pretty massive swing of the pendulum in the wrong direction.\"\n\nHe still strongly believes, however, that \"the pendulum is going to swing back in the other direction.\"\n\n\"Have a little hope,\" he said.\n\nABC News' Megan Christie, Alexandra Myers and Emily Ruchalski contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/william-pierce", "page_content": "Pierce was the movement's fiercest anti-Semitic ideologue and he built the Alliance into a money-making machine through its hate music business, Resistance Records.

So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce, quoted in a biography of him called Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, on the power of narrative\n\nBackground\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce's bigoted attitudes toward people of color were inculcated at an early age. He was born in Atlanta into an Old South aristocracy that included his mother and her ancestors. His great-grandfather, he has said, was governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to a fawning biography of Pierce by University of Vermont Professor Robert Griffin, Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce, he grew up in a Southern household during segregation with older relatives who treated a black servant like a virtual slave.\n\nPierce graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. It was during that time that Pierce became concerned by the threat to the white race that he believed was posed by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, and he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing group that once accused President Eisenhower, among many others, of being a communist.\n\nThe John Birch Society, which generally rejected anti-Semitism, turned out to be too namby-pamby for Pierce. In 1966, he quit a job as a senior research scientist at a Connecticut aerospace firm to join George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (1959-67). Upon buying a printing press, Pierce become editor of the party's National Socialist World. After Rockwell was assassinated the following year, Pierce continued to work with the remnants of the group, which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party. In 1968, Pierce became an official of Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting Alabama segregationist and former Gov. George Wallace's bid for the presidency. Willis Carto, already one of America's leading anti-Semitic activists, also joined the Wallace group and in 1970 he and Pierce reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance (NYA). But the two men had a major falling out, and each claimed to be the new group's leader. In 1971, Carto accused Pierce of stealing a mailing list belonging to Carto's anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby organization. Pierce had written to those on the mailing list, attacking the Liberty Lobby's leaders, including Carto. Eventually, Pierce won control of the NYA, which was limited to people under age 30 and focused on activities on college and university campuses.\n\nIn 1974, Pierce dropped the age limit and reorganized the NYA as the National Alliance (NA), which he would lead until his death in 2002. The NA, which aimed to be a vanguard party capable of leading the \"lemmings\" comprising the white masses to revolutionary victory, adopted the slogans \"Free Men Are Not Equal\" and \"Equal Men Are Not Free.\" Effectively a Leninist in terms of tactics, Pierce was not interested in winning his battle through electoral successes. He wanted his vanguard to lead the white masses to power, something that could only come after a period of ethnic cleansing that Pierce referred to as a \"temporary unpleasantness,\" the seizure of state power and creation of all-white nations.\n\nThe text that made Pierce famous, however, was his novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald after first being serialized in the NA publication Attack! The NA boasted that the book was a \"Blueprint,\" a \"Handbook for White Victory.\" Pierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens. Using \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city. The violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children. By the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPierce's novel has inspired many a terrorist. In 1983, the NA's Pacific Northwest leader, Robert Mathews, joined with three other Alliance members and, later, some 20 other people, to create The Order, a white supremacist terrorist group. Based on the group portrayed in The Turner Diaries, Mathews' gang ultimately robbed some $4 million from armored cars. Declaring \"War in '84,\" members of The Order murdered a well-known Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, in Denver. (The first person on their hit list was Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees. They abandoned that attempt due to high levels of security.) Later that year, Mathews was killed in a shootout with the FBI. Pierce hailed his martyred acolyte, saying Mathews \"took us from name-calling to bloodletting.\"\n\nIn 1995, Timothy McVeigh, aided by Army pals Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. The day before, according to officials, McVeigh called an NA recorded message line seven times. When McVeigh was arrested, police found excerpts from The Turner Diaries in his car. After the attack, which was patterned on a similar bombing depicted in The Turner Diaries, Pierce predicted, or maybe hoped, that resentment of Jews, minorities and others would lead to terrorism \"on a scale the world has never seen before.\" In 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\" There are many other cases, as well, where killers were said to be inspired by the novel.\n\nIn 1989, Pierce's publishing arm, National Vanguard Books, printed his second novel, Hunter, depicting the assassination of interracial couples, Jews and politicians. The book was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, convicted of the sniper murders of at least two black men. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, Pierce editorialized that the Nazi leader was \"the greatest man of our era.\" In 1991, Pierce began broadcasting a shortwave radio program, \"American Dissident Voices,\" that was heard worldwide. Within months, it was carried by several AM stations.\n\nIn 1984, after several years in the Arlington, Va., area, Pierce paid $95,000 in cash for a 346-acre tract of land atop a small mountain in West Virginia, where he set up what would become the NA's permanent compound. He would build several structures on the land, including a building for his Cosmotheist Church, which housed the bogus religion conjured up by Pierce primarily as an unsuccessful tax dodge. It was from this compound that Pierce ran an empire that ultimately included sales of books, cassettes, music, and racist paraphernalia. The group created a system of monthly dues and produced a monthly update for its members, the National Alliance Bulletin. At its peak, around the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the NA had more than 1,400 dues-paying members.\n\nThe NA also served as a launching pad for many white supremacist terrorists. Besides the Order members, in 1996 officials arrested NA member Todd Vanbiber in Florida after a pipe bomb he was building exploded in his face. After Vanbiber was sentenced for federal firearms violations, other NA confederates testified that the Vanbiber gang had robbed three banks and donated at least $2,000 to Pierce. A week before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Larry Shoemake opened fire on a black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., killing one person and wounding seven others. Relatives said he was inspired by Pierce's writings.\n\nIn 1999, Pierce made an important business investment, buying white power music label Resistance Records for some $250,000. The deal gave Pierce control of the label's CD catalogue, inventory, mailing list and publishing arm. In the next few years, Resistance came to dominate the white power music scene and also became the biggest moneymaker in the NA empire. Pierce added to that empire in 2000, after \"national socialist black metal\" musician and convicted German murderer Hendrik M\u00f6bus took up residence at the NA headquarters. M\u00f6bus' music label, Cymophane, was then transferred to Pierce's control. Three months after arriving at the compound, M\u00f6bus was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany. Pierce spearheaded a campaign to free M\u00f6bus and raised money to pay for his legal fees. Ultimately, however, M\u00f6bus was deported and jailed in Germany.\n\nIn 2001, in a major break with the past, the NA began to hold rallies and engage in other public activities like leafleting. Organized by Deputy Membership Coordinator Billy Roper, NA members joined, for the first time, with other white supremacists in front of the Israeli Embassy to protest Jewish influence in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce married five times. His first wife was Patricia Jones, whom he met while at the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce was remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, who worked for the NA. The marriage ended in 1985, when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. In Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce talks of preferring immigrant women from Eastern Europe. He married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage that lasted until 1990, when she left Pierce and West Virginia \"for greener pastures in California.\" Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsannah, also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine. Zsuzsannah left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997. He was sharp and condescending toward his last wife, identified only with the pseudonym Irena in Fame, when he was not ignoring her. Irena was miserable living with the savior of the white race.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce made his last public speech at one of the NA's secretive \"leadership conferences\" that were held twice a year at the West Virginia compound. Held on April 20, Hitler's birthday, Pierce emphasized the need to continue building a professional organization while rejecting alliances with other hate groups, whom he derisively mocked. For the 10 days before his unforeseen death from kidney failure and cancer on July 23, 2002, Pierce instructed his subordinates, and worked feverishly to try to assure the survival of the NA. Pierce died an old-fashioned death, appropriate for a man who conceived of himself in decidedly old-fashioned terms \u2014 as a lord among serfs, an elite leader uniquely capable of leading \"his people\" to victory over Jews, \"race traitors,\" and a whole host of other enemies.\n\nPierce's 2002 death came at a critical moment for the NA. A quarter-century after birthing the group, Pierce had finally remade his outfit into a remarkably professional organization. Much of the previous two years had been spent building up a talented staff, learning how to run a profitable business, and intensifying recruiting and propaganda. Just before his death, the NA was bringing in more than $1 million a year, had a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history. Pierce's voice, broadcast via his \"American Dissident Voices\" Internet show, was being heard in Europe and the U.S. In just five days in June 2002, NA members in 20 states distributed 70,000 leaflets.\n\nSix days after Pierce's death, a committee of his key staffers announced that the NA had selected a new leader. Erich Gliebe, the hard-edged former boxer who fought professionally as \"The Aryan Barbarian,\" would be the new chairman, although all agreed that no one could replace Pierce, who was memorialized as \"Our Eternal Chairman,\" comparable to Hitler himself. But Pierce's condescending and harsh words during his final speech doomed the group. His comments that other hate groups were filled with \"freaks and weaklings,\" something first disclosed by the Intelligence Report, seriously undermined the group by driving away its customer base. Within a few months, infighting broke out among the leadership, and splits started to occur. By 2009, the NA had lost nearly all of its members, falling from a high of more than 1,400 to fewer than than 100, Resistance was losing money, and Gliebe was living in the basement of his mother's Cleveland-area home."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/36175", "page_content": "internal conflict white supremacist anti-communist\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, author, and political activist.[1][2] He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\n2. Life and Career\n\n2.1. Early Life and Education\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1307868\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian[3][4][5] family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[6] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America.[7] After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence.[8] Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.;[9] he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942.[10] After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.[11]\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy.[12] As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction.[9] His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.[13]\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman.[14] Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics.[15][16] He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962.[15] He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.[17]\n\n2.2. Early Political Activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962,[18] but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.[11] In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP.\n\nAccording to the American neo-Nazi James Mason, during the first National Socialist World Congress in 1969, when a delegate asked what should be done with \"White race traitors\", Pierce formed with his hand a pistol being fired, rousing the audience to its feet.[19]\n\nIn 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency.[16] In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance.[15] Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.[20]\n\n2.3. National Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices,[21] the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.[22]\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service.[15] Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision.[15] Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.[23]\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.[24]\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash.[15] Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes.[15] In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes.[25] The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS.[26] He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.[27][28]\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes,[29][30] during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\".[29] Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi,[15][16][24][31][31][32][33][34] although he personally rejected this label.[29] When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.[29]\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States.[35] As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn.[15] Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute[24] informational video titled America is a Changing Country,[36] and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.[24]\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002.[37] On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.[38]\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001).[39] The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:[40]\n\nDeyr f\u00e9, deyja fr\u00e6ndr, deyr sj\u00e1lfr et sama; ek veit einn, at aldri deyr: d\u00f3mr um dau\u00f0an hvern. Cattle die, kinsmen die you yourself die; I know one thing which never dies: the judgment of a dead man's life.[41]\n\n3. Novels\n\n3.1. The Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[15] The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization, led by the secret inner circe known as The Order (a reorganized SS).\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters.[15] Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"[42][43]\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order.[15] The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance.[15] The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington (state) , when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.[44]\n\n3.2. Hunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\n4. Religion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian,[3] Pierce became an atheist as a teenager.[4][5] In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".[15][16]\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\n5. Family\n\nPicture of Dr. William Pierce at an official National Alliance meeting in 1999, in Hillsboro, West Virginia. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1136386\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist.[6] The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.[45] Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia.[15] In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce.[45] Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997.[4]\n\n6.

In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer.

Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[8] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America.[9] After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence.[10] Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.;[11] he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942.[12] After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.[13]\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy.[14] As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction.[11] His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.[15]\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman.[16] Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas.

Cattle die, kinsmen die you yourself die; I know one thing which never dies: the judgment of a dead man's life.[43]\n\nNovels\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[17] The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization, led by the secret inner circe known as The Order (a reorganized SS).\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters.[17] Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"[44][45]\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order.[17] The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance.[17] The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington (state) , when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.[46]\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\nReligion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian,[5] Pierce became an atheist as a teenager.[6][7] In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".[17][18]\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\nFamily\n\nPicture of Dr. William Pierce at an official National Alliance meeting in 1999, in Hillsboro, West Virginia.\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist.[8] The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.[47] Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia.[17] In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce.[47] Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997.[6]\n\nWorks\n\nThe following works were published under the pseudonym \"Andrew MacDonald\":\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1993, Pierce wrote the script of the comic book New World Order Comix #1: The Saga of White Will which was illustrated by Daniel \"Rip\" Roush and coloured by William White Williams.[48]\n\nSee also\n\nAsa Earl Carter, a white supremacist who also wrote novels, under the pseudonym Forrest Carter.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nContemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America.

PIERCE to you , be aware"}, {"url": "https://www.unz.com/article/william-pierce-and-me-on-racism/", "page_content": "In 2001, I published a book on the White advocate William Pierce (1933\u20132002) called The Fame of a Dead Man\u2019s Deeds. Given the obsessive concern currently for what is deemed the unimpeachable evil of White racism and the modern-day inquisition against White racists tainted with this sin, I think it would be useful to re-visit what Pierce had to say about this topic in the Fame book two decades ago and see what it brings up for you.\n\n* * *\n\nPierce believes that over the past forty or fifty years [this is 2001, remember] white people have been conditioned to feel guilty about their natural inclinations around race. The media in particular, but also the schools, politicians, and mainstream churches, have waged an all-out campaign to get them to deny their natural\u2014and healthy\u2014impulses.\n\nWhat are these natural racial impulses or inclinations? In order to get at that, Pierce offers that we must examine the way whites thought and behaved before the conditioning program began.\n\nIn times past, most whites accepted the fact that people of a particular race preferred to live and work and play with others like themselves. White people were curious about other races. They would study the lore of the Indians, for example. Indeed, whites found much to admire in other races and cultures\u2014Chinese art for example. Still, they retained a sense of separateness and exclusiveness and pride in their own European heritage, in their own racial characteristics. They didn\u2019t feel it necessary to apologize for teaching the history of their own race to their children, that is to say, European history. They didn\u2019t feel the need to balance things out by giving equal treatment to other races and cultures. They left Japanese and Tibetan history to the scholars in those fields. They certainly didn\u2019t feel a conciliatory obligation to invent a false black history to elevate the self-esteem of blacks or to persuade young whites that blacks were their cultural equals.\n\nDid whites feel their race was superior to other races? In general, yes, they did, says Pierce, which is not to say that they were blind to the fact that other races and cultures could do some things very well, and in some cases were better than whites were at things. But whites valued what they were good at, and so by the standards they set up, they looked very good to themselves. They were confident in their abilities and accomplishments as thinkers and problem solvers and civilization builders. They liked their literature and art best. They valued their way of life\u2014their concept of virtue and morality and their approach to family and work and so on.\n\nBasically, they believed they had a superior culture and superior race. In that sense, they were what today would be called white supremacists. But they were not alone in feeling that way; it is natural for a people to think their ways are the best, that they are the best. The Chinese have historically believed that they are superior to the \u201cforeign devils.\u201d That the Chinese thought that way didn\u2019t bother whites. It didn\u2019t threaten whites\u2019 sense of their worth, their sense of their place in the world.\n\nPierce argues that an outgrowth of people\u2019s natural feelings of racial identification and favoritism is to segregate themselves from other people, to live among their own in the ways they prefer. That is their normal impulse. That way of living has been typical throughout the history of humankind. It may seem a good idea for people to live mixed up with other peoples, but it doesn\u2019t work as well as we have been told that it does, and it isn\u2019t inherently a superior or a more elevated way to live. Living amid so-called diversity is not the only legitimate, morally acceptable, way to live, and hardly an urgent moral imperative. It is only in recent years that whites have been pressured to think in those terms.\n\nWorld War II brought big changes in this pattern of thought and conduct, says Pierce. Those who wanted Germany destroyed painted it as a war for democracy and equality. As the narrative went, the Germans believed in a master race while we believed in the equality of the races. This rationale brought increased stress on an equality theme in American life in contrast to an emphasis on the qualitative differences among individuals and groups. The idea of the equality of whites and blacks went along with that theme. From the assumption that blacks were equal to whites, it followed that if blacks were observed to accomplish less or conduct themselves less admirably, something external to them must be causing it. And that cause was identified\u2014white oppression. Whites must have made blacks the way they were.\n\nWhile white villainy seemed to make sense given the false notion of racial equality, it simply didn\u2019t square with the facts. The vast majority of whites didn\u2019t concern themselves with blacks and wasted no time trying to suppress them. The vast majority of whites didn\u2019t care what blacks did. They simply wanted to go their way and let blacks go theirs. But the facts of the matter aren\u2019t what is important. What is important is to understand that World War II served to heighten the belief that if blacks had any problems at all, they could be laid at the feet of whites.\n\nPierce sees the civil rights revolution of the 1950s and \u201860s as another important element in the development of the \u201cwhites-as-bad-guys\u201d perception that has taken hold. During those years, the media showed us images of inoffensive blacks marching and protesting amid what looked to be white hooligans who were screaming at them, assaulting them, and in some instances killing them. After scores of television clips, news stories, and commentaries that painted this picture, resistance to what the civil rights activists wanted became equated in most people\u2019s minds with KKK types and beefy Southern sheriffs and their German shepherds and water hoses. It is understandable that most white people came to sympathize strongly with the dignified demonstrators and their cause and to be repulsed by their boorish and brutal white attackers and what we were told they represented.\n\nIndeed, there were white working-class people who saw their way of life threatened and acted in an undignified and intemperate and violent way. The media were quick to record it and place it in a context\u2014within a story line\u2014that appealed to what Pierce calls the innate white sense of propriety and fairness. The media transmitted these carefully selected scenes of white resistance to racial integration along with particular interpretations of what was happening over and over and over again. The white people who saw on their television screens and read about what their own people were doing were embarrassed by it and felt guilty over it. The media made the whole idea of resistance to racial integration shame- and guilt-inducing to most white people.\n\nThe media paired up names, labels, for what whites were seeing and hearing and reading and feeling during the civil rights revolution: racism, and racist. The media associated racism with white resistance to the civil rights organizations. Again and again and again, they paired up white resistance to a single idea/explanation\u2014racism. Again and again and again, the media paired the image of the roughneck white opponent of civil rights being portrayed on the screen or in print with the label/identity of racist.\n\nAfter a time, the words themselves\u2014\u201cracism,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d\u2014came to evoke pangs of revulsion and guilt on their own, just as the sound of a dinner bell resulted in Pavlov\u2019s dogs salivating. The media had created a conditioned response to the word racism. Now, all anybody has to do to get whites to turn pale, become apologetic, and give in is call them racist. People don\u2019t have to argue the facts with whites; all they have to do is push the right emotional button. If they ring the \u201cracist bell,\u201d whites\u2014even the most rugged and proudest of whites\u2014will bow their heads and put their tails between their legs and let people have their way with them.\n\nThe media could have worked the conditioning the opposite way if they had wanted to by associating different things with white resistance to the civil rights movement. They could have presented interviews with middle-class whites\u2014professional people, academics, artists and writers, philosophers\u2014who believed in racial and cultural integrity and pointed out the negative impact on countries like Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Portugal when the races were mixed together. The media could have shown what happened to white schools and neighborhoods after an infusion of blacks\u2014the decay and disorder and crime. They could have interviewed white women raped by blacks. They could have presented case studies of white girls who mated with black boys they met in school and shown us their mixed-race children and let us see how we really felt about that. But they didn\u2019t do that. That wasn\u2019t consistent with the program.\n\nDuring this time and since, Pierce points out, the schools joined the campaign of re-shaping white attitudes. The curriculum kept students from understanding the rationale for segregation. Segregation was linked to mindless hatred and oppression. History was de-Europeanized and infused with the real and imaginary accomplishments of non-whites. The churches also got into the act of decrying racism and promoting a multiracial society. White politicians pandered to minority interests and lectured their own people about how they must share their lives with minorities and to give them anything they wanted. The schools, churches, and politicians promoted the idea that anyone opposed to an integrated society was evil and irrational, that is to say, a racist. The only thing that operated against this wave of cultural re-shaping of whites, says Pierce, is the actual physical presence of blacks so that people could experience for themselves the glaring contradictions between the theory of racial equality and the reality of racial differences.\n\nPierce notes that race has become such a hot-button issue that it is very difficult to discuss it rationally at the present time. He says talking about race today must be how it was for Presbyterians to talk about sex a century ago. He says he gets letters and messages from white people who say he ought to be killed for advocating separation of the races and opposing miscegenation.\n\nAs difficult as it is to do, however, whites must think and talk about race rationally and honestly. They must not be embarrassed about it and feel guilty about it. They must be willing to entertain the idea that wanting to live and work among their own people is a natural, healthy feeling they were born with. Nature gave whites that impulse so that they could evolve as a race. Living among their own allows them to develop special characteristics and abilities that set them apart from every other race. Living with their own is essential to their survival as a race. What is irrational and destructive is the very thing that is being pushed upon them\u2014a multiracial, culturally conglomerate society and way of life.\n\nIt is going to take determination for whites to open up their eyes and their minds to reality, and more courage than they have shown in the past to begin to report to the world what they truly believe. But that is what whites must do. Whites are being controlled by their fear of being smeared as racists if they disagree with the orthodoxy about race in this country.\n\nIn a Free Speech [a periodical Pierce published] article entitled \u201cThe Importance of Courage,\u201d Pierce relates how he has dealt with his own fears around being called a racist.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019ve seen that same sort of timidity in myself. When interviewers have asked me whether or not I am a racist, I have responded by asking, \u201cWell, what do you mean by the word \u2018racist\u2019?\u201d I\u2019ve tried to wriggle out of giving a direct answer to the question. I have resolved not to try to wriggle away from saying exactly what I believe when someone asks me whether or not I am a racist because it\u2019s pretty clear what the interviewers have in mind when they ask me whether or not I am a racist. These days anyone is a racist who refuses to deny the abundantly clear evidence that there are inherited differences in behavior, intelligence, and attitudes. A racist is any white person who prefers to live among other whites instead of among non-whites and prefers to send his children to white schools. A racist is any white person who feels a sense of identity with, a sense of belonging to, his own tribe, his own people, his own race, and who shows an interest in his race\u2019s history, heroes, culture, and folkways. A racist is a white person who finds the members of his own race more attractive physically than members of other races and who is instinctively repulsed by the idea of racial intermarriage or by the sight of a white person intimately involved with a non-white. A racist is a white person who is disgusted with the multiracial cesspool that America is becoming. . . . Yes, I\u2019m a racist.\n\n* * *\n\nWilliam Pierce, 2001. A brief footnote from me, 2021:\n\nIndividuals and groups use exaggerated, distorted, and false negative depictions and stories\u2014White racism is a great example\u2013to get attention, power, self-validation, and advantage, and hurt and destroy people.\n\nMy response these days to \u201cYou\u2019re a racist\u201d and \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d is \u201cThat\u2019s your business, not mine. But I\u2019ll say this. I\u2019m not taking any more of your shit."}], "William Luther Pierce III was a vocal advocate of white supremacy.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/william-luther-pierce-white-supremacist-son-kelvin-pierce", "page_content": "From an exposed bluff in Mill Point, West Virginia, Kelvin Pierce surveyed the remote place where his father chose to live and die. In a sense, he knew why. Kelvin is an avid outdoorsman, and even on a stark February day, with snow blanketing the earth and bitter wind whistling through the trees, he was moved by Appalachia\u2019s subtle splendor. He understood why a man might settle there.\n\n\u201cI love West Virginia,\u201d Kelvin had said earlier, on the four-and-a-half-hour drive from his home just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my favorite place on the planet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also full of sorrow.\n\nWhen Pierce\u2019s father bought 346 acres in Mill Point, and relocated there permanently in 1985, he left his family behind. He started building a compound where a new kind of family \u2013 men and women of like mind \u2013 could live off the land and be free of outside influences. He moved into a rambling trailer home, where he lived with a series of wives who weren\u2019t Pierce\u2019s mother. He had divorced her, declaring the split \u201cnecessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\u201d.\n\nNothing was more important to Kelvin\u2019s father than white supremacy. The abandonment and the hate \u2013 the abandonment for hate \u2013 is what Kelvin has spent the better part of his life struggling to understand.\n\nTo family and friends, his dad was Bill. To everyone else, he was William Luther Pierce III, one of America\u2019s most prominent white nationalists.\n\nA physics professor turned neo-Nazi, William Pierce led a hate group called the National Alliance and a business empire that, at the time of his death from cancer in 2002, raked in $1m a year. He published books and magazines, hosted a radio program, and owned a music label, all of which promoted white supremacy. His work galvanized violent gangs, such as the Order and the Aryan Republican Army. Most infamously, it inspired the architect of the Oklahoma City bombing \u2013 Timothy McVeigh designed the attack based in part on Pierce\u2019s 1978 novel The Turner Diaries.\n\nReportedly called \u201cthe bible of the racist right\u201d by the FBI, The Turner Diaries is a fantasy about white militants overthrowing the US government as part of a bloody race war. A 2016 report found that the book had been tied to at least 200 murders, committed in 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes. This year, during the 6 January coup attempt, there were echoes of the novel\u2019s core ideas in insurrectionists\u2019 calls to kill members of Congress, and in a gallows erected near the Capitol.\n\nWilliam Pierce raised Kelvin to hate Jews, Black people, immigrants \u2013 anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Now 60, Kelvin has long rejected his father\u2019s ideology, but only recently has he reached the point where he\u2019s ready to talk about his upbringing, and how his story illuminates the toxic currents roiling America. \u201cIf I can help one other person that felt the way I used to feel, to feel better and to make different choices, then that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cAnd I think I can help more than one person.\u201d\n\nWhen he was little, Kelvin would sneak into his dad\u2019s home office in northern Virginia to look at the bust of Adolf Hitler and the glass paperweight in the shape of a swastika that sat on the desk. Kelvin didn\u2019t know what the items meant, and William Pierce wasn\u2019t interested in explaining. He rarely spent time with Kelvin and his twin brother, Erik, preferring to fraternize with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi party, or to lock himself away writing articles decrying Jewish power and interracial marriage.\n\nKelvin\u2019s strongest memories of his dad involve abuse. Any disobedience or perception of bad behavior led to beatings with whatever was at hand: a belt, a wire hanger, a two-by-four. The violence left Kelvin with bruises and a deep well of self-loathing.\n\nHis mom, Patty, didn\u2019t approve of the cruelty, but she didn\u2019t do much to intervene. She took a similar approach to her husband\u2019s extremism, which he\u2019d nurtured since at least the early 1960s. A math professor and the family breadwinner, because her husband had given up his own academic career to become an ideologue of hate, Patty did all of William Pierce\u2019s accounting and typing. Kelvin said his mom was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d when her husband started a firearms business \u2013 not because he advertised his stock as \u201cNegro control equipment\u201d necessary for \u201cthe coming race war\u201d, but because it prompted newspapers to publish articles about him. Patty worried that someone might come to the house and hurt her family.\n\nFamily photos from the archive of Kelvin Pierce. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWhen her sons told her that neighborhood kids made fun of them by calling them Nazis, she lamented that \u201cit\u2019s a terrible world\u201d and \u201cpeople are awful\u201d. She didn\u2019t answer when Kelvin asked her what a Nazi was, and she didn\u2019t tell her boys that their father was to blame for what was happening to them.\n\nAs a teenager, Kelvin was a bigot because he didn\u2019t know any other way to be. He also hoped it would impress his dad. In high school, he gave a presentation on Hitler\u2019s virtues and used the N-word to talk about Black classmates. By the time he went to college, he was \u201ca mobile advertisement\u201d for his father\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel superior to be part of the white race,\u201d Kelvin later wrote. \u201cYet deep, deep down, something didn\u2019t quite feel right about it either.\u201d\n\nHe began to change when he transferred from a small Christian college to Virginia Tech. He roomed with a young man from South America who was \u201cthoughtful, caring and very intelligent\u201d \u2013 all things that Kelvin\u2019s father insisted people who weren\u2019t white couldn\u2019t be. He took classes with students who saw the world very differently than he did. When Ronald Reagan was elected president and many of his liberal peers were visibly upset \u2013 including his roommate, who drew a dagger and drops of blood on a photo of Reagan \u2013 he wanted to understand why. He started paying attention to politics and watching the evening news, which his dad had always said was worthless because Jews controlled the media. Kelvin wondered if everything he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nHe met a fellow student named Susan when they were both engineering interns with the navy one summer. Kelvin thought she was beautiful, but while his racism was rapidly dissipating, his shame \u2013 the feeling that his dad had abused him for a reason, that he deserved it \u2013 was not. He couldn\u2019t imagine making the first move, but Susan could. \u201cYou know, if you were to ask me out, I would say yes,\u201d she announced one day.\n\nThey were married in 1986. William Pierce came to the wedding. His gift to the bride and groom was a box of 9mm ammunition. \u201cTo keep the wolves away from your door!\u201d his note read. Kelvin didn\u2019t even own a gun.\n\nBy then, William Pierce had divorced Patty, decamped to Mill Point, and curtailed contact with his sons. Kelvin only confronted his dad once, asking why he\u2019d chosen white supremacy over everything else in his life. \u201cIt was the only responsible thing I could do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nFor her part, Susan didn\u2019t think that William Pierce\u2019s worldview mattered. \u201cThank goodness that\u2019s a dying thought process,\u201d she recalled thinking \u2013 an assumption she now sees as optimistic, or perhaps naive. It was also hard for her to fathom the extent of the abuse Kelvin suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, he hit me every day,\u201d he told her once.\n\n\u201cEvery day?\u201d she replied, incredulous.\n\nSusan had grown up in a home where, as she put it, \u201cWe were always hugging each other, and we always said, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Kelvin had kids only because they agreed to adopt them. \u201cI was just terrified of furthering my genes,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cI was so messed up and so damaged as a human being that I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of trying to make another human being.\u201d Their daughters, Mariame and Marieka, are from the country of Georgia. Kelvin vowed to love them like he\u2019d never been loved. He coached their softball teams and took them on camping trips.\n\nKelvin with his daughter Marieka. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWilliam Pierce never met his granddaughters. For seven years prior to his death, he didn\u2019t reply to the letters and photos documenting their childhood that Kelvin sent him. Despite everything, Kelvin kept reaching out. His anger at how he\u2019d been raised collided with yearning for paternal approval. When he first heard of the connection between The Turner Diaries and the Oklahoma City bombing, his kneejerk reaction was a perverse kind of pride that his dad was in the news. He was ashamed his mind went there, but at a loss for how to stop it.\n\nKelvin was battling his demons without armor or weapons. He was also doing it alone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mystery to me,\u201d Susan would tell him sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d\n\nIn July 2002, his uncle called to tell him that his father was dead. Kelvin hadn\u2019t even known he was sick. He surprised himself by crying, then realized what he was really mourning: he had to let go of the futile hope that his father might one day love him. He went to West Virginia for the memorial service, where neo-Nazis offered their condolences and said Kelvin must have admired his father very much.\n\nHow little they know, he thought.\n\nHe looked like his dad \u2013 tall and lanky, with mournful eyes, a long, square jaw, and prominent ears. He shared William Pierce\u2019s introspection and his dislike of being told what to do. But the similarities ended there.\n\nAfter the service, he began to feel something new: he was sad for his father and the life he\u2019d led. It could have been different. But again and again, William Pierce had made the wrong choices, leaving heartache and hate in his wake.\n\nKelvin wanted to start making better choices of his own.\n\nTo Mariame Pierce, her dad\u2019s bookshelf told the story. When she was little, it held volumes about Kelvin\u2019s hobbies \u2013 mountain climbing, for instance. Over time, new titles appeared, ones about self-discovery and philosophy, written by Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra. While she was growing up, her dad was changing too. \u201cHe became more present and thoughtful, more conscious and intentional,\u201d said Mariame, now 25.\n\nKelvin had embarked on a \u201chealing\u201d journey, as he describes it. He read, reflected and prayed. He worked with a counselor to process his childhood trauma, including his father\u2019s belief system. He and Susan, who already ran a successful construction business together, started a charitable foundation to support orphanages in Georgia. When he posted pictures from visits to his daughters\u2019 native country, friends remarked that he looked uncharacteristically happy. \u201cTo make a child feel like at least somebody in the world loves them, it\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nHe told his life story publicly for the first time at his local Rotary Club. He described how, in his youth, he\u2019d fantasized about traveling to Washington with a gun and opening fire on Black people. His teenage dreams now repulsed him. Afterward, audience members came up to thank him. Some of them were crying.\n\nThe more he talked about his experiences, the more people told Kelvin he should write a book. It took a seismic national event for him to decide they were right.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Watching the events unfold, \u201cI was immediately transported back to my childhood,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cThe hatefulness of their energy and what they were saying, the way they were saying it, especially \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 it was just like being an eight- or nine-year-old kid, when my dad took me to an American Nazi party picnic.\u201d\n\nHe started writing what would become Sins of My Father, which he self-published in February 2020. In addition to telling Kelvin\u2019s personal story the book, written with Carole Donoghue, draws on private letters and other archival documents that reveal how perceived grievances, personal disappointment, and twisted self-regard led William Pierce to dedicate his life to white supremacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when his father\u2019s beliefs began to curdle \u2013 stories of radicalization are never so precise \u2013 Kelvin finds seeds of discontent in the years when William Pierce was a new husband, a new father and newly endowed with his physics doctorate. \u201cI think Dad was becoming angry and resentful and was suddenly frightened of the future and the heaviness of it all,\u201d Kelvin writes. \u201cHe hated the idea of working for someone else. He never wanted to have to answer to anyone else, even his wife.\u201d\n\nThis period in William Pierce\u2019s life coincided with the rise of progressive identity politics \u2013 the acceleration of the civil rights movement, for instance, and the dawn of second-wave feminism. He wanted to be a man who mattered, a man people listened to. White nationalism allowed him to be that. His life became one long ideological devolution, nourished by the power and attention he accrued evangelizing about hate.\n\nKelvin Pierce photographed at his home in Vienna. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nIf the story sounds familiar, it is. America is still plagued by the forces of rightwing radicalization. Sins of My Father draws parallels between William Pierce and Donald Trump, who \u201cemboldened white supremacists and mass-shooters by his words and deeds,\u201d as Kelvin writes. \u201cIn many ways, Trump has succeeded where Dad failed. He has taken hate and discrimination mainstream.\u201d\n\nOther evidence of his father\u2019s enduring impact hit closer to home. After Marieka Pierce enrolled in a police academy in Virginia, one day in class, her instructors showed the room a picture of her grandfather, describing him as an example of a homegrown extremist. \u201cMy hand went up,\u201d Marieka later told her mom.\n\nThe instructors were stunned to hear about the family connection. William Pierce was a staple in their curriculum about hate crimes; they\u2019d been teaching recruits about him for as long as they could remember. They asked to meet Kelvin to get a fuller picture of the man who, in obituaries, was remembered as \u201ca cold and calculating racist\u201d and \u201cthe godfather of hate in this country.\u201d\n\nDonny MacMullen has his own take on William Pierce: he thinks Kelvin\u2019s father was a great man.\n\nMacMullen, who is in his 30s, with reddish brown hair, a full beard, and striking blue eyes, moved to Mill Point from Massachusetts a few years ago to help preserve Pierce\u2019s legacy. Today, he\u2019s the caretaker of the National Alliance compound, which amounts to a few scattered buildings and the rocky sprawls of land between them.\n\nThe place is in a state of disrepair, and people rarely visit, but there are reminders of the community Kelvin\u2019s dad was trying to build before he died: an AV facility stocked with equipment that was first-rate in the early aughts; a library that once housed several thousand volumes; stacks of slickly produced magazines promoting racism; a meeting house where William Pierce presided over annual National Alliance conferences. Today, even as Pierce\u2019s ideas continue to find adherents, the organization he started is a shade of its former self.\n\nMacMullen was happy to welcome Kelvin to the compound in February. Indeed, members of the National Alliance had long made clear that William Pierce\u2019s son could visit anytime. For more than 15 years after his father\u2019s death, however, Kelvin stayed away. He wasn\u2019t ready to make peace with it, because he wasn\u2019t at peace with himself.\n\nIt was a steep drive up switchbacks to the heart of the compound, where MacMullen was waiting, wearing a knit cap with a swastika stitched to the front. When Kelvin asked him about the symbol, MacMullen laughed. It just represents love for the white race, he insisted. Kelvin pointed out that it was associated with hate and genocide, and MacMullen shifted gears. If you love something deeply, he said, then you have to hate anything that threatens it.\n\nDonny MacMullen\u2019s office at the West Virginia compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThis was another way of expressing the sentiment of a meme MacMullen once posted on his Facebook page: \u201cI\u2019m white but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist \u2026 I will put my boot in your ass, my knife to your throat, and your body in the dirt if you f**k with me and mine.\u201d\n\nKelvin and MacMullen walked for a while on the property, just the two of them. If it was painful to talk with a man who revered his father \u2013 who saw virtue in a racist who beat him every day of his childhood \u2013 Kelvin didn\u2019t let it show. They talked about their divergent beliefs, and neither man was interested in budging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree,\u201d MacMullen said at one point.\n\nWhen Kelvin recounted the conversation to his best friend, Gil Jullien, who\u2019d come on the trip as moral support, Jullien was furious. \u201cOh, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to disagree!\u201d\n\nJullien was speaking from experience. He was troubled that a close childhood friend had become a vociferous Trump supporter, the sort who regularly posts racist and sexist content on Facebook. Once, when the two men were at a high school reunion talking politics, Jullien\u2019s friend had told him they\u2019d have to agree to disagree. Jullien wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s ruining our country, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he later explained.\n\nKelvin shares Jullien\u2019s moral compass. \u201cAggression and hate and violence are the epitome of cowardice,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t want to feel antagonism or resentment toward anyone, not even white nationalists.\n\nHe prefers to listen and question, not to confront; to offer the possibility of connection rather than writing people off. His approach might not be for everyone, but for Kelvin it\u2019s vital. If he could be redeemed, why not someone like MacMullen?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself out there for people that want help and want change,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nBefore Kelvin left the compound, MacMullen gave him a copy of a book \u2013 a tome, really, at more than 1,000 pages. Written in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist who ran in the same circles as William Pierce, Which Way Western Man? bemoans the supposed decline of white civilization, the rise of feminism and multiculturalism, and the alleged chokehold liberal orthodoxy has on modern society \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of white supremacy\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nMacMullen said the text meant a lot to him. Back home in Virginia, in the spirit of listening and questioning, Kelvin cracked the book and read the first 50 or so pages. \u201cIt kind of boils down to, do you live your life stuck in the rat race, within society\u2019s norms, or do you break out from that and try to live a more authentic life, doing what you want to do, what you feel is right versus what society says is right?\u201d he said.\n\nThe language struck a chord. He heard echoes of his own transformation, of setting a new course for himself. Whereas Kelvin chose a path defined by hope and inclusivity, people who admire his father have let bigotry be their guide. Still, in their journeys\u2019 common origin, Kelvin saw promise \u2013 the possibility of trying again, and getting it right this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as insurmountable a task to start a recovery process as some people think. It does take discipline, but it actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that, right?\u201d\n\nThe trailer where William Luther Pierce once lived lies in disrepair at the National Alliance compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThe last time Kelvin saw his father, he jumped off a mountain.\n\nKelvin had started hang-gliding in his 20s, and during his first visit to the compound in West Virginia \u2013 the only one he took while William Pierce was alive \u2013 his dad had suggested he glide off one of the property\u2019s peaks. No way, Kelvin told him. There weren\u2019t open areas below where he could land. At best he\u2019d come away injured; at worst he could die.\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Kelvin traveled to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, for a series of flights over the Labor Day weekend. He invited his dad to come watch him. He didn\u2019t expect him to show, but as Kelvin was untying his glider from its rack on his truck, he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cYou need a hand with that?\u201d his father asked.\n\n\u201cYou actually came,\u201d Kelvin replied.\n\nWith his father\u2019s help, Kelvin made quick work of maneuvering his 80lb glider to the launch site. Before them was a pleated vista, gentle peaks and valleys thick with late-summer green. Kelvin suited up and pointed to the landing field where his father could meet him. \u201cClear!\u201d he yelled, before taking a few running steps and leaving the earth.\n\nThe flight was perfect. A swell of wind \u2013 a lift, as hang-gliders say \u2013 allowed Kelvin to pilot much higher than he\u2019d planned, rendering his dad a dot on the ground. He stayed in the sky for an hour. The view was majestic: forests and farms and fields stretching beneath him.\n\nHe touched down with ease in a wide field. As he was packing up his gear, he heard the familiar voice again: \u201cWow, Kelvin, that was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Kelvin knew for certain he\u2019d impressed his father.\n\nThey stood in the landing field talking for a bit longer. Then father and son said their goodbyes and went their separate ways: William Pierce to what Kelvin called \u201chis life of hate at the compound\u201d; he to new chapters of his existence. Some, such as parenthood, would be joyous. Wrestling with his past would be torment. But just like he navigated the wind high above the mountains, Kelvin would steer himself to a place where he could land, safe and whole, and invite others to join him, if only they too have the courage to leap.\n\nKelvin Pierce at a park nearby his home in Virginia.

From Pierce's perspective, William Luther Pierce and his followers had two goals: to turn all of America into a \"white-only homeland,\" and to violently overthrow the U.S. government in the name of white nationalism.\n\nThough Pierce\u2019s father died in 2002 and the National Alliance\u2019s position in the white power movement has since faded, the hatred and bigotry behind it all have not. In fact, counterterrorism officials warn that, after years of decline, hate groups are once again proliferating inside the United States \u2013 an unnerving reality mirrored by what Pierce saw that rainy morning on the West Virginia compound.\n\n\u201cIt sat derelict for years, but now they have people working on the property, and they're kind of trying to bring it back to life,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nWhen Pierce first negotiated for permission to tour the property, the new head of the National Alliance, Will Williams, even told Pierce: \u201cEverybody thought we were down and out. But we're back. \u2026 We are definitely back,\u201d Pierce recalled Williams saying.\n\nIn this Aug. 24, 2004, file photo, National Alliance members march on the yard of the Capitol Building along side other racists groups, like skinheads and klansmen during a protest in Washington, DC.

That\u2019s why he brought ABC News with him to West Virginia, opening up about his own racist past, the personal demons that fueled his hate, and the struggle he endured to defeat them.\n\n\u201cThere's hope that is engendered by a story like [mine],\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could overcome that hatred, and that depression, and that feeling of unworthiness, then maybe somebody else could too.\u201d\n\nBorn into bigotry\n\nPierce was raised to be a bigot.\n\nLike so many other American children, when he was young he often dreamed of visiting the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 but his dreams were far different than those of most kids.\n\n\u201cI remember fantasizing about going into Washington, D.C., standing on a street corner holding a machine gun, and mowing down Black people with that machine gun,\u201d Pierce told ABC News in his first TV interview. \u201cI used to actually fantasize about doing that.\u201d\n\nWhen Pierce was nine, his father implemented a new rule for playtime at the community swimming pool: \u201cIf a Black person came and got into the pool, we had to leave,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nIn high school, his father barred him from playing team sports because, Pierce remembers his father telling him, \u201cYou have to shower with Blacks\u201d \u2013 \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t use the word \u2018Blacks.\u2019\"\n\nWhen Pierce was in college, his father published the novel \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d which experts describe as the white power movement\u2019s \u201cbible\u201d with its depictions of a violent campaign against the U.S. government and a global race war that leads to the eradication of Jews, Black people and other non-whites.\n\nIn this Dec. 18, 2006, file photo, a copy of \"The Turner Diaries\" written Dr. William Luther Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald sits on a shelve at the McClintic Library in Marlinton, W.Va.

I wanted him to be proud of me. I wanted him to love me.\u201d\n\nPierce recounted how in one high school history class, he wrote a paper \u201con the virtues of Adolf Hitler.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my futile effort to try to impress him,\u201d according to Pierce, noting that he subsequently \u201cspent a good portion of my life as a hater.\u201d\n\nLooking back on his life, Pierce now believes that he began questioning his own racist beliefs even as far back as college.\n\nKelvin Pierce, 60, looks onto the property that his father bought in 1985 and turned into a white-only compound for the National Alliance. ABC News\n\nFor the first time, as a student at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., he was \u201cstarting to experience people from all over the world \u2026 people from every kind of race and religion that you can think of,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it would take him another two decades to really dig into what had driven him to so much hate.\n\nHe said he had been feeling depressed \u2013 even worthless \u2013 for \u201ca long, long time,\u201d so around 2004 he sought help: \u201cTherapy. Counseling. Spiritual studies. A lot of reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that's when I started this journey of challenging my thoughts and adopting a more spiritual worldview, and look at human beings,\u201d he said. \"I learned that I did not need to attach myself and my self worth to all of the fearful and hateful thoughts \u2026 That I could choose different thoughts.

Many whites will choose to continue living in a multi-racial society. That's all right.\"\n\nAsked whether their efforts could spark violence, Williams said: \"Hopefully not. We would like peaceful separation.\"\n\n\"But it's not going to be peaceful,\" he warned. \"Our enemies are rabid.\"\n\nPierce said the current state of the white power movement means there has been \"a pretty massive swing of the pendulum in the wrong direction.\"\n\nHe still strongly believes, however, that \"the pendulum is going to swing back in the other direction.\"\n\n\"Have a little hope,\" he said.\n\nABC News' Megan Christie, Alexandra Myers and Emily Ruchalski contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/guru-white-hate-william-pierce-timothy-mcveigh-831091/", "page_content": "Up here on his West Virginia Mountain, Dr. William Pierce \u2014 novelist, provocateur, perhaps the world\u2019s most influential white supremacist \u2014 likes to look out and imagine the end of America as we know it.

When they come back up, they will seize control of the smoking ruins and build a new country for whites only.\n\nIn the first few decades of the new America, the land will be racially cleansed. Aryan values will prevail. Young men and women will gather to revel with polkas or waltzes, reels or jigs. They will listen to popular music minus Barry Manilow, stroll through art galleries minus Marc Chagall. There will be no blacks in America \u2014 those who survive the racial holy war will be returned to Africa. Mexicans will be sent back to Mexico, Asians to Asia, and as for the Jews, they will be exterminated, this time for good. People will come to understand that regardless of how many died during the World War II, it was not enough.\n\n\u201cOy vey!\u201d Pierce cries, raising his hands heavenward. \u201cYou can\u2019t even look at these guys crossways and they start smelling the gas!\u201d He is ranging around his office inside a prefab corrugated-steel building on the side of the mountain. Disdainfully, Pierce is dangling an article from the Forward, a weekly Jewish paper, attacking Pat Buchanan for having complimented Hitler on his \u201cextraordinary gifts.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cThis is where the Jews really let their hair down,\u201d he says. He subscribes to nearly all the leading Jewish publications; they take up space on shelves next to copies of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, within sight of a painting inscribed to Pierce by Arno Breker, the Fuhrer\u2019s favorite artist. In nearby rooms, a handful of his followers \u2014 a few of whom also live on the property \u2014 are busily stuffing envelopes with literature and pecking away on computers.\n\nDespite his rant, Pierce gives off an amiable, rumpled impression. A gaunt and gangly six feet four, wearing wire-rim glasses and the same denim jacket, green pants and white socks that he\u2019s had on the last three days, the former physicist looks as if he were up all night scribbling equations on the magnetic effects of solid-state physics, his former specialty.\n\nOn his desk sits the shiny red membership handbook of the National Alliance, the white-supremacist group that Pierce founded in 1974 with the intent of reversing the \u201cthe racially devolutionary course of the last few millennia.\u201d The manual vows, \u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to achieve this White living space and to keep it White. We will not be deterred by the difficulty or temporary unpleasantness involved, because we realize that it is absolutely necessary for our racial survival.\u201d The National Alliance has an estimated 1,500 members in thirty-five chapters \u2014 cells, in the lingo \u2014 from coast to coast, and according to Pierce, it has grown almost fifty percent in the last year. Although the Alliance is small, the Anti-Defamation League calls it \u201cthe single most dangerous organized hate group in the United States today,\u201d largely because of the savvy of its founder.\n\nAt sixty-six, William Pierce is the courtly elder statesman and undisputed intellectual godfather of the white-supremacist movement. He is admired equally by teenage skinheads and such veteran rabble-rousers as David Duke. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant writer, a true political dissident,\u201d Duke says. \u201cWe take turns being named the most dangerous man in America by the Anti-Defamation League.\u201d\n\nPierce is so venerated and feared in part because he is tireless in promoting his vision of white supremacy. To do this, he says, it has been necessary to circumvent \u201cJewish control of the media.\u201d He is methodically establishing beachheads for his racist agenda through independent channels \u2014 on the Internet at natvan.com and nattall.com, over the radio with a weekly half-hour broadcast called American Dissident Voices that reaches more than 100,000 listeners and through his National Vanguard Books.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Alliance\u2019s publishing arm produces a number of its own works and also markets more than 600 other titles, including audiotapes and videocassettes. It sells the expected canon \u2014 Mein Kampf, for instance \u2014 but in an effort to educate its readers in the ways of the enemy, it also distributes Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Bonfire of the Vanities (\u201cA masterful depiction of life in the Great Satan,\u201d reads the catalog blurb. \u201cSure enjoyment\u201d), James B. Stewart\u2019s Den of Thieves (\u201cThe purse-carrying [Ivan] Boesky is the epitome of the Jew\u201d) and Edgar Rice Burrough\u2019s Tarzan of the Apes (\u201cAn Aryan baby is raised by an ape in the jungles of Blackest Africa\u201d), among other well-known books.\n\nBut Pierce says he also wants to reach an audience that \u201cdoesn\u2019t read that much.\u201d To that end, he recently acquired Resistance Records, the premier white-power rock-music label in the world, for $250,000. While Pierce can\u2019t abide rock (\u201cI detest it,\u201d he says, grimacing. \u201cGive me Beethoven or Strauss or Mozart\u201d), he regards whitepower music as the best way to recruit young racists: \u201cI\u2019m going to give skinheads a rationale for their anger.\u201d With the recent purchase of Nordland, a racist Swedish label, Pierce is able to offer customers 250 titles, including records by such popular hatecore bands as Skrewdriver, No Remorse, Bound for Glory, Max Resist, and the Blue Eyed Devils. He\u2019s also become publisher of Resistance, a glossy magazine devoted to white-power music. Resistance Records grossed $300,000 in 1998, Pierce says, and close to $1 million last year. He estimates that the label will rake in $3 million annually within a couple of years.\n\nPierce\u2019s expanding mail-order empire has prompted the Washington Post to describe him as running an \u201cAmazon.com of hate.\u201d But for all his multimedia ambitions, Pierce\u2019s most substantial and abiding legacy will likely be as the author of The Turner Diaries, a novel he self-published in 1978 that gleefully describes the bloody overthrow of the U.S. government by white revolutionaries, the subsequent resettlement of blacks, and the final extermination of Jews and \u201crace traitors.\u201d\n\nAmong the readers who have found inspiration in its apocalyptic vision is Timothy McVeigh, who was known to sleep with a copy under his pillow, pushed the book on friends and sold it at gun shows. Eventually, he emulated the book\u2019s protagonist by exploding a massive truck bomb outside a federal building, killing 168 of people. When police stopped him 75 miles north of Oklahoma City on April 19th, 1995, an envelope in the car contained photocopied passages from the novel. McVeigh had underlined this one: \u201cThe real value of all our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties.\u201d The passage continues, \u201cFor one thing, our efforts against the System gained immeasurably in credibility. More important, though, is what we taught the politicians and the bureaucrats. They learned today that not one of them is beyond our reach.\u201d\n\nInvestigators determined that several days before the bombing, McVeigh phoned the National Alliance hot line seven times. He apparently reached a four-minute recorded message about the Alliance and an answering service. \u201cWhy anyone would call more than once, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cI never had any contact with him.\u201d Federal prosecutors contend that The Turner Diaries was a virtual blueprint for the Oklahoma City bombing, the single most destructive terrorist incident ever on American soil.\n\n\u201cInnocent people get killed in a war,\u201d Pierce says, sighing. \u201cJust think about the Allied carpet-bombing of German cities during World War II. That doesn\u2019t change the strategic or tactical planning behind it. Oklahoma City was sort of inevitable. You can expect more of these things as the population becomes more alienated.\u201d\n\nBut does he feel any responsibility for the bombing? \u201cMcVeigh was upset about Waco,\u201d he parries. \u201cI can\u2019t say what effect my book had on him. Anyway, the Bible has probably gotten people to do more things than The Turner Diaries.\u201d\n\nTo date, The Turner Diaries has sold more than 350,000 copies, according to the Washington Post, primarily through mail order and at gun shows, and, to a very small extent, through bookstores. On a recent day on Amazon.com, the novel held the sales rank of 3,146 out of 2-5 million books, with an average customer evaluation of three and an half stars out of five.\n\nThe book raises an unsettling question: Can a novel be responsible for murder? The Turner Diaries is a true underground classic, graphically reminding readers that before the \u201cunderground\u201d was the spawning place for next season\u2019s fashions and musical tastes, it was the hideout of hardened revolutionaries. As Mao\u2019s Little Red Book inspired the Red Guards to rampage during the Cultural Revolution, as Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin aroused the abolitionists against slavery, so has Pierce\u2019s fiction sparked the white-supremacy, anti-government movement to a firestorm of political violence over the last two decades.\n\nIn its literally incendiary effect, The Turner Diaries presents a curious twist on the notion that novelist Don DeLillo presented in Mao II: that the terrorist is the supreme novelist of the 20th century for having captured the popular mind more completely than any writer. With William Pierce, we may have the more intriguing twenty-first-century case of the novelist as terrorist.\n\n\u201cWilliam Pierce doesn\u2019t build bombs,\u201d says Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group. \u201cHe builds bombers.\u201d\n\nBesides the Oklahoma City bombing, the list of crimes to which the book or the Alliance has been linked is striking, as if some readers decided that the best way to praise the novel they loved was to live it:\n\n1984-1985 In the Pacific Northwest, a group calling itself the Order and the Silent Brotherhood, intent on emulating The Turner Diaries almost chapter by chapter, goes on a two-year crime spree that includes murder, bombings and robberies.\n\n1994-1995 A Midwestern gang known as the Aryan Republican Army commits twenty-two bank robberies across the Midwest. Its members are urged to read The Turner Diaries.\n\nAPRIL 1996 In Jackson, Mississippi, Larry Wayne Shoemake, a devotee of The Turner Diaries, breaks into an abandoned PoFolks Restaurant and goes on a sniping spree, killing one black and injuring seven others before taking his own life. An ex-wife told police that Shoemake wasn\u2019t the same after reading the novel.\n\nAPRIL, 1997 When a bomb being constructed by National Alliance member Todd Vanbiber accidentally explodes in his face, he is arrested in Orlando, Florida. He is sentenced to six and a half years in prison for building and possessing explosives. He once purchased $700 worth of National Alliance literature.\n\nMAY 1998 National Alliance member Brian Pickett and others are arrested in Tampa, Florida, for allegedly planning to explode pipe bombs throughout the state\u2019s central region as a diversion for bank robberies.\n\nThat Pierce might in some way have inspired so much destruction doesn\u2019t exactly sadden him. He won\u2019t debate the nature of his influence so much as quibble legalistically with the details. This afternoon, for instance, he takes exception to the notion that The Turner Diaries is an exact blueprint for the Oklahoma City bombing. \u201cMcVeigh used a bomb in which the two essential ingredients were nitromethane and ammonium nitrate set off by a detonating cord,\u201d he says. \u201cMy bomb was ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, set off with a dynamite initiator.\u201d He detailed these differences to Stephen Jones, McVeigh\u2019s defense attorney, who employed them, to little effect, in the trial.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you couldn\u2019t use Pierce\u2019s novel as a bomb-making manual.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d he readily admits. \u201cYou really could build a bomb from reading the book. Just not the one Timothy McVeigh built.\u201d\n\nPierce says he admires McVeigh as a \u201ctrue patriot and a good soldier.\u201d His sole objection to the Oklahoma City bombing is tactical. \u201cI probably would have gone to Washington, gotten myself a job,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cMaybe made myself a silencer pistol. And then I would have stalked congressmen. I\u2019d have picked them off, maybe two or three of them, before it got too hot.\u201d\n\nThat sounds a lot like the plot of Pierce\u2019s second novel, Hunter, published in 1989, in which a serial killer attempts to rid America of its \u201csickness\u201d by executing interracial couples, Jews and elected officials. Pierce has compared his protagonist to Joseph Paul Franklin, now on death row in Missouri for murder, who is suspected of having shot seventeen other people between 1977 and 1980 in an attempt to start a race war.\n\nGiven the boyish enthusiasm with which Pierce delivers his murderous fantasies, there\u2019s something openly Walter Mitty-ish about him. He seems to view himself as the prince in a fairy tale that might have been written by Joseph Goebbels. And yet, every so often, the real world intrudes. Not long ago, Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center won an $85,000 judgment against Pierce and the National Alliance in a suit tied to the murder of a black man in Florida. The killer had belonged to a racist group that transferred real estate to Pierce in an attempt to avoid losing it in a civil action. Pierce had hoped to live out his old age on the proceeds from the property.\n\n\u201cI try not to be obsessed with how much I dislike Morris Dees,\u201d he says, \u201cand what I would like to do to him if I could ever get him alone.\u201d\n\nDees and Pierce enjoy a perversely symbiotic relationship. Dees raises money for the Southern Poverty Law Center by demonizing Pierce; this in turn confers upon Pierce added credibility among his potential donors. \u201c\u2018This is the most dangerous man in America!\u2019 That\u2019s what Morris Dees says about me,\u201d crows Pierce. \u201cHe says, \u2018I\u2019m gonna put him out of business, if you will help me.\u2019 He raised $10 million on me! And yes, it is flattering to me. I love it!\u201d\n\nThe bad publicity \u2014 and there\u2019s really no such thing for Pierce \u2014 helps attract new recruits to the National Alliance. At least twice a year, Pierce hosts a conference of potential leaders he has selected from among the rank and file of the National Alliance membership, gatherings that the proprietor of a local business refers to as \u201cDr. Pierce\u2019s proms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese fellows show up wearing golf shirts that have the National Alliance symbol on them,\u201d says Pocahontas County Sheriff Jerry Dale, who is Pierce\u2019s official hometown nemesis, and has shadowed him for fifteen years. \u201cLast year they ended up at a local establishment called Huckleberry\u2019s, partying a little. And whenever one of them would run across a hal with blond hair, they\u2019d ask her if she\u2019d like to have an Aryan baby.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance is often described as a neo-Nazi organization, but Pierce, knowing the reflexive connotations of the word Nazi, prefers to use the expression \u201cNational Socialist.\u201d He actually disdains those \u201chobbyists\u201d who dress up in storm-trooper regalia, flex biceps tattooed with swastikas and march around screaming \u201cnigger\u201d this, \u201cJew\u201d that. He wants an Alliance composed of successful professionals, the kind of folks who might otherwise head Boy Scout troops in their spare time \u2014 hence the golf shirts.\n\n\u201cThe general image of racists,\u201d he says, \u201care these 400-pound women and guys who are missing teeth at a Klan rally. The National Alliance has never tried to appeal to those people. We can\u2019t have a howling mob outside the city gates. We need people inside to open the gates! We want CPAs, high school teachers, engineers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for Pierce to drive down the mountain to the post office to pick up the mail and his wife, Sevdalina, who\u2019s just returned via bus from the mall in Lewisburg, an hour away. As Pierce shuts off the computer, his cat, Hadley, a bluepoint Siamese, picks his way across the desk, growling as he goes and starting a landslide of insurrectionary documents. The animal, whose portrait graces the wall in a mini-gallery of cat shots, is the fourth incarnation of a Siamese named Harold, who kept Pierce company during the lonely days when he lived and worked in a cramped apartment, eating supermarket pizzas and writing The Turner Diaries. \u201cI have almost a spiritual communion with cats,\u201d says Pierce, who in 1990 was fined for trying to smuggle a mountain lion from Florida onto his property. \u201cThey\u2019re graceful, they\u2019re beautiful, and they forgive me for everything.\u201d\n\nHe reaches down to stroke Hadley, who arches his back. \u201cGoodbye, son,\u201d Pierce tells the cat. \u201cDaddy\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nWith one hand on the wheel, Pierce casually steers his white Chevy Blazer through the hairpin turns of West Virginia State Highway 219. He seems preoccupied. He\u2019s been married five times. The last three wives have been from Eastern Europe. He sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t really live alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI really do need to have a woman. I mean, I get depressed, I get antsy if I don\u2019t have a woman. But what causes my marriages to break up? It\u2019s because of my work. I\u2019ve never been able to find a true soul mate.\u201d\n\nHe expected the women from Eastern Europe, raised in hardship, to be different. But it turns out they like shopping as much as their American predecessors. \u201cSevdi would like to go out to dinner,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cShe would like to stay in motels. She would like to go to Washington, to the White House. I don\u2019t want to go to the White House \u2014 the god-damned Secret Service would stop me at the front door!\u201d He laughs, his spirits lifting at the thought.\n\nIn the lobby of the tiny post office in Hillsboro, Sevdi is waiting, flipping through a clothing catalog. She\u2019s a pretty woman from Bulgaria who looks decades younger than Pierce. They met via a National Alliance supporter who runs a mail-order-bride business. Most of their two-year marriage has been spent on the side of the mountain, where they live in a trailer that embarrassed Pierce\u2019s previous wife Susan \u2014 who, though Hungarian, knew what mobile homes represent in the eyes of most Americans.\n\n\u201cI had to wait 45 minutes!\u201d Sevdi scolds her husband. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me it was not a quarter to call. It is now thirty-five cents!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have used the postmistress\u2019s phone,\u201d Pierce says, riffling through two boxes of mail. There\u2019s a copy of the Jerusalem Post, a Manila packet from a sympathizer in Zagreb, Croatia, and several stacks of letters, ten or fifteen to a bundle. \u201cIt\u2019s the highlight of my day, seeing the membership applications arrive,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI kept putting the quarter in eight times to try to call, and it wasn\u2019t the possibility,\u201d Sevdi says.\n\nPierce doesn\u2019t seem to hear. While he does a little business with the postmistress, Sevdi reveals the precise distance between her hometown in Bulgaria and her new home. \u201cIt\u2019s 11,000 kilometers exactly, that\u2019s what Bill says.\u201d And then, in a confidential tone, she whispers, \u201cI paint landscapes. I would like to do an exhibition, but my husband does not agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis wives just hang around until they get a green card, and then they\u2019re out of there,\u201d says Jerry Dale. \u201cWomen are just a step above \u2018mud people\u2019 \u2014 blacks, Hispanics and Jews. They\u2019re there to wait on him hand and foot, and call him \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018Dr. Pierce.'\u201d Dale arrested Pierce in 1990 for beating up his volunteer bookkeeper. Charges were later dropped because the woman left the state and did not return to testify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true I was arrested, but I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cWhen this woman talked to the police, she accused me of holding her as a sex slave, beating her up, stealing her purse, threatening her life. She had worked for me only four days. One day we had a big blow-up. I grabbed her purse and just hung it on the doorknob so she would leave. The magistrate didn\u2019t seem very excited about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nThe men of the National Alliance \u201ccannot find women,\u201d says Kirsten Kaiser, the ex-wife of Pierce\u2019s one-time lieutenant, Kevin Alfred Strom. \u201cThey can\u2019t get an American wife. These women come over from Europe, and think they\u2019re going to New York. The guys marry them right away, and then they\u2019re enslaved \u2014 no English, no Social Security card, no driver\u2019s license. These people drove me barking mad, and I\u2019m an American.\u201d She begins to weep over the phone. \u201cThey get you to agree that Hitler was the greatest man who ever lived. I had to name my darling daughter Klara, after Hitler\u2019s mother. Kevin wanted her to grow up and bear an Aryan superman.\u201d Kaiser\u2019s ex-husband calls these allegations \u201cfictional.\u201d\n\nOn the drive back to the mountain, the Pocahontas County landscape spins by. This rural region astride the Allegheny Mountains in southeastern West Virginia is sparsely populated, with just 9,000 residents \u2014 of whom only sixty- eight are minorities, mainly blacks. Pierce moved here in 1985 from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the changing demographics. I decided I had to get out of there or I was going to do something that would get me locked up \u2014 you know, a Benjamin Smith or a Buford Furrow,\u201d he says, chuckling, referring to two white supremacists who went on shooting sprees this past summer. Pierce searched for cheap land up and down the East Coast and finally found the kind of property he was looking for here, outside of Mill Point. West Virginia, for $150 an acre.\n\nHe turns back onto the rutted drive leading up the side of his mountain, Sevdi becoming silent as they near home. At the Alliance headquarters, husband and wife go their separate ways, Sevdi trudging up to the trailer, Pierce shambling back to work, hunched over a carton of mail.\n\nWhen he began writing The Turner Diaries in 1975, William Pierce was a 42-year-old former physicist who had just exiled himself from academia and the aerospace industry. He did so in order to be the self-appointed head of a new racist organization called the National Alliance and the solitary staffer of a neo-Nazi journal called Attack!\n\nHe set up shop in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Crystal City, Virginia, living on fifty dollars a month in his office above a real estate agency. The telephone hardly ever rang. By day, he scrawled his jeremiads. At night, he shared the bed with his epileptic cat, Harold. When not working, Pierce was a soul adrift, wandering through embassy parties at the invitation of a friend who worked in government, blending into the crowd at demonstrations, reading politics and sociology in the Library of Congress. He\u2019d pore over racialist tracts published in the Twenties and Thirties, notice how they\u2019d been checked out once every two decades, and think, \u201cMy God \u2014 is this what I\u2019m going to give up my career for?\u201d He was invisible, unanchored by domestic responsibilities, a spy with subversive ambitions at loose in the grand mansion of history.\n\nAfter almost twenty years of marriage, he was estranged from his first wife, Pat Holmes. She and their two sons were living fifty miles to the south in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where she taught math at Mary Washington College. Pierce\u2019s Nazi activities were becoming embarrassing for Pat, he says. \u201cShe was concerned about things like, \u2018Do we have $400 to buy a new sofa?\u2019 I was concerned about things like, \u2018How can I do what I plan to do this weekend without getting arrested?'\u201d\n\nNot necessarily the sort of question by which Pierce had expected to be troubled. He had grown up in \u2014 as he puts it \u2014 an \u201call-white world\u201d throughout the South: Georgia, Virginia, Alabama and finally Texas. His father, a former merchant marine, sold insurance. He died in a car crash when Pierce was eight. His mother prided herself on being a direct descendant of Thomas Henry Watts, who served in the Confederacy under Jefferson Davis. Watts\u2019 stern face stared down at the Pierce household from a framed twenty-dollar Confederate bill.\n\nIn those years, Pierce revealed no signs of the vitriolic racist he would become. His older brother Sanders remembers him as a \u201cgentle\u201d child: \u201cWhen he was eight and another kid knocked his glasses off, Bill just got up and put them back on.\u201d Pierce disliked it when his fellow cadets at Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas, went \u201ccoon conking\u201d \u2013driving past black pedestrians and knocking them down with a pole.\n\nWhen he arrived at Rice University in 1951, he studied physics and chemistry, a scholarship student among oil-rich frat boys. What he really wanted, however, was to be an astronaut. Growing up in the Thirties and Forties, he had become enamored of space travel even before it was a realistic possibility. He longed to see himself as a storybook hero, an outsider accomplishing great deeds against long odds \u2014 and incidentally winning the girl. As the first step in becoming an astronaut, he inquired about joining the Air Force but was told that his poor vision would prevent him from being a pilot.\n\nSo instead of outer space, the would-be adventurer took off for graduate school \u2014 first to Cal Tech, then to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he often slept in the lab on a folding cot next to the electromagnet. By the time he acquired his Ph.D. in physics in 1962, Pierce could look forward to a solid, even brilliant career as a physicist. He was hired as a junior faculty member by Oregon State that same year. \u201cHe came and gave a collegial talk at the department and bowled us over,\u201d says David Burch, a former colleague.\n\nIn the early Sixties, Corvallis, Oregon, was not an especially diverse place. But in Pierce\u2019s view, he might as well have fallen from a cloud into a smoky Harlem den of jazz and miscegenation. One of his colleagues in the physics department was a young professor named Cliff Fairchild. Having been hired the same year, \u201che and I were naturally thrown together,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cWe invited each other over to our houses. We drank together and so on.\u201d To Pierce, there was only one exceedingly odd fact about Fairchild: He was married to a black woman.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why a white guy would pick a nonwhite woman, because to me they weren\u2019t attractive. Still, my idea at the time was that marriage was a strictly private matter. But then they began having kids, and these kids were horrible-looking things. I said, \u2018Jesus. Why should anybody deliberately have kids like that?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t have told you why I didn\u2019t like this. Some people, they look at a piece of art and they say, \u2018God, that\u2019s ugly.\u2019 But they don\u2019t have a theory to fit the art into.\u201d\n\nHis sense of aesthetics violated, Pierce became intolerant of the Fairchilds\u2019 marriage. \u201cI just slowly withdrew from them,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough self-confidence to say to him, \u2018What are you doing married to a nonwhite woman?'\u201d\n\nNow, thirty-eight years after he joined the faculty with Pierce, Cliff Fairchild is shocked to hear of this virulent reaction to his marriage. \u201cNeither my wife nor I felt any animosity,\u201d he says. \u201cBill Pierce never told a racist joke, and we\u2019ve heard a few in Corvallis. We played bridge together, went camping with our families. There\u2019s a photograph of us on top of a mountain in eastern Oregon with the Pierces, with me carrying my son in a backpack.\u201d Pained by Pierce\u2019s description of his now thirty-seven-year-old child as ugly, Fairchild pauses and then adds, \u201cYou know, our son is very handsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what started it,\u201d Pat Holmes says of her exhusband\u2019s disdain for the Fairchilds\u2019 interracial marriage. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t that way when we married. It happened so suddenly.\u201d\n\nOne night in the mid-Sixties, Pierce watched a speech on television by George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. \u201cAll these Jews and liberal activists in the audience were throwing tomatoes and pop bottles and trying to drown him out,\u201d Pierce says. He was impressed by Rockwell\u2019s cool as he dodged the debris and continued to speak: \u201cHe was facing an early example of political correctness.\u201d He began a correspondence with Rockwell that led to friendship. \u201cRockwell was a very sane guy,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cNo ego problems. Intelligent. An artist.\u201d\n\nPierce was taken as much by Rockwell\u2019s ideas about white power as he was by his manner. It occurred to him that he, too, might like to try his hand at writing about race. He left Oregon State in 1965 after three years on the faculty and moved his wife and sons to the East Coast, accepting a job in North Haven, Connecticut, as senior research scientist for the Pratt and Whitney aerospace laboratory.\n\nIt was an entirely mercenary move. His new, more lucrative position would allow him to set aside enough money so that he could someday write full time. He was staking everything on his conviction that history was with him, that he would become a brave pamphleteer in the footsteps of Thomas Paine prior to the first American Revolution. Eventually, Pierce decided that he would publish a journal of ideas. Rockwell said he had been thinking the same thing. He suggested that Pierce become the editor of such a journal \u2014 The National Socialist World. The position would be unpaid.\n\n\u201cOh, boy, that was a big jump,\u201d Pierce says, \u201cgiving up a paycheck for a leap into the unknown.\u201d He uprooted his family once again, settling in Virginia. When Rockwell was assassinated by one of his own storm troopers in 1967, Pierce asked himself, \u201cWhat am I to do with my life now?\u201d He decided, he says, to devote himself \u201cto the service of the life force, as George Bernard Shaw would have said. Or, as Nietzsche would have said, to help prepare the way for the coming of the Superman.\u201d\n\nBut by the mid-Seventies, Pierce was convinced that the polemics he was publishing in a new journal, Attack!, were having no effect. \u201cI thought what I was saying was profound, earthshaking,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cMy God \u2014 it didn\u2019t even make a ripple.\u201d His dreams of inciting a white uprising seemed about as realistic as his old fantasy of going into space as an astronaut.\n\nHis friend Revilo Oliver, then a classics professor at the University of Illinois \u2014 and a longtime racist \u2014 suggested that he try disseminating his views through fiction, as was done in didactic novels such as Jack London\u2019s The Iron Heel, an account of a working-class revolt against the wealthy.\n\nAnd so, writing in longhand, Pierce began composing the fictional diary of Earl Turner. The novel opens portentously, with an odd echo of vintage leftist rhetoric: \u201cSeptember 16, 1991: Today it finally began! After all these years of talking \u2014 and nothing but talking \u2014 we have finally taken our first action. We are at war with the System, and it is no longer a war of words.\u201d\n\nThe writing came easily. Pierce had finally tapped into perhaps his greatest capacity: his ability to daydream. But the fantasies were vicious. \u201cI wanted to take all the feminist agitators and propagandists and all of the race-mixing fanatics and all of the media bosses and all of the bureaucrats and politicians who were collaborating with them,\u201d Pierce says, \u201cand I wanted to put them up against a wall, in batches of a thousand at a time, and machine-gun them.\u201d\n\nHe portrays the protagonist, Earl Turner, as a soldier in an underground white army called the Organization that is fomenting a race war to bring down the Jewish-controlled federal government. Turner steals gasoline, conducts hit-and-run raids, teaches bomb making, helps establish a white homeland in Southern California and eventually, heroically, sacrifices himself by flying a crop-duster armed with a nuclear warhead into the Pentagon. For his kamikaze attack, Turner is enshrined in the Record of Martyrs, his name memorized by grateful white schoolchildren and his diaries made available to the general public in a special edition issued 100 years after the Great Revolution.\n\nThere\u2019s a pulpy, Hollywood-disaster-movie feel to the novel that Pierce has tagged a \u201chandbook for white victory.\u201d Imagine Armageddon as engineered by middle-management white guys in short sleeves who just can\u2019t take it anymore. From 1975 to 1978, he serialized the narrative in Attack! and its successor, the National Vanguard, both of which he often sold himself for twenty-five cents while walking around suburban shopping centers and the streets of Washington, D.C. Embarrassed by the fact that he wrote nearly everything in the Vanguard, Pierce ran The Turner Diaries under a pseudonym, Andrew Macdonald. \u201cI didn\u2019t want readers to think I was a one-man band,\u201d he says.\n\nTheir response astounded him: \u201cI mean, people would call up the office, desperate. They\u2019d say, \u2018I missed the last issue \u2014 you know, installment fourteen. I gotta have it. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Sorry \u2014 sold out.\u2019 And the guy would be ready to kill himself.\u201d Here\u2019s the sort of thing readers were craving:\n\n\u201cAugust 1, 1993: Today has been the Day of the Rope \u2014 a grim and bloody day, but an unavoidable one. Tonight, for the first time in weeks, it is quiet and totally peaceful throughout all of Southern California. But the night is filled with silent horrors; from tens of thousands of lampposts, power poles and trees throughout this vast metropolitan area, the grisly forms hang. \u2026 The first thing I saw in the moonlight was the placard with its legend in large, block letters: I DEFILED MY RACE. Above the placard leered the horribly bloated, purplish face of a young woman, her eyes wide open and bulging, her mouth agape. \u2026 There are many thousands of hanging female corpses like that in this city tonight, all wearing identical placards around their necks. They are the White women who were married or living with Blacks, with Jews or with other nonWhite males.\u201d\n\nPublished as a 320-page paperback book by the National Alliance in May 1978, The Turner Diaries went out into the world like a ghost telegram from Adolf Hitler, summoning all the disgruntled loners who were watching their lily-white America disappear. The novel thrilled its partisans with an utter disdain for the ethos of tolerance. It offered the sacrilegious spectacle of blacks, Jews, feminists, liberals and the entire country of China being ground under the hobnailed boots of rampaging white guys.\n\nOne of The Turner Diaries\u2019 earliest and most passionate readers was Robert Mathews, a tax resister and discontented zinc miner from Metaline Falls, Washington. As it would other anxious whites, the novel convinced Mathews that a small band of determined fighters could spark an uprising among the white middle class that would result in the overthrow of ZOG, the Zionist Occupation Government. The novel catalyzed his desire to become \u201cthe Robin Hood of the radical right,\u201d as Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt put it in The Silent Brotherhood, a thoroughly reported account of Mathews\u2019 saga. As boyishly romantic as his hero Pierce but far more impetuous, he wanted to turn the Pacific Northwest into a \u201cWhite American Bastion.\u201d Mathews formed an \u201caction group\u201d modeled after the Order, the secret inner sanctum of revolutionaries in The Turner Diaries. At meetings, he discussed the plot of the novel and pushed copies on anyone who hadn\u2019t read it. He even had black robes made for members like those worn during induction ceremonies in the book.\n\nMathews became a favorite of Pierce\u2019s; Pierce still speaks of him with bemused affection. \u201cBob Mathews basically was a real decent guy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe main thing about him, he was serious. Doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t laugh. But he took his responsibilities seriously \u2014 his responsibilities as a member of his race, to his ancestors and to his descendants. If he said to you, \u2018SOB, I\u2019m gonna get you,\u2019 you better make out your will. He was the kinda person I wanted to have in the Alliance.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, at Pierce\u2019s invitation, Mathews delivered a fiery anti-Semitic address at a National Alliance convention in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cMy brothers, my sisters,\u201d Mathews began. \u201cFrom the mist-shrouded, forested valleys and mountains of the Pacific Northwest, I bring you a message of solidarity, a call to action, and a demand for adherence to duty as members of the vanguard of an Aryan resurgence and, ultimately, total Aryan victory.\u201d It ended, \u201cWe have broken the chains of Jewish thought. \u2026 Stand up like men and reclaim our soil! Kinsmen, arise! Look toward the stars, and proclaim our destiny! In Metaline Falls, we have a saying: Defeat, never! Victory, forever!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Pierce \u2014 ever the tactician \u2014 buttonholed Mathews. \u201cI said, \u2018Bob, people were really affected by your talk. But I guess I must disagree with you about the time for revolution being ripe, because I think most people are not ready to respond to a call to arms.\u2019 But Bob disagreed with me. And then shortly after that, he dropped out of the Alliance and began doing his thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing his thing\u201d meant attempting to live out the plot of The Turner Diaries. Mathews obviously did not anticipate ending his days in a rest home. On April 1st, 1984, he attempted to purchase a $50,000 life-insurance policy, naming as beneficiaries William Pierce and John Ireland, another National Alliance official. The policy was rejected by the insurance company.\n\nBy 1984, the Order was a loose confederation of two dozen men devoted to robbery, counterfeiting and murder, all in the interest of inciting and financing a race war. They started small, robbing a porno shop in Spokane, Washington, humiliated by their grand take of $369.10. But Mathews and his band soon graduated to Brinks armored trucks, stealing $3.8 million in cash from one during a daylight robbery on a mountain highway near Ukiah, California, in July 1984. A month before, Mathews and a few others had murdered Denver radio talkshow host Alan Berg, whom they considered a Jewish agitator. The killing inspired Talk Radio, the Eric Bogosian play that was made into a movie by Oliver Stone.\n\n\u201cThe Turner Diaries was their textbook,\u201d says Ron Howen, the state attorney general of Idaho who prosecuted the Order. \u201cThey went chapter by chapter, in an attempt to create a nationwide revolution. Everyone had to read it. In fact, all the FBI agents we had on the case had to read it.\u201d\n\nMathews chose Pierce as one of his pet charities, according to several sources, including a government informant within the Order, and supposedly traveled to Virginia to deliver a bag of cash to his idol in August 1984. Pierce confirms the meeting but denies that any money changed hands. Mathews\u2019 donation, if indeed it took place, would have been one of his last acts of rebellion. In December 1984, he was incinerated alive in his hideout on Whidbey Island, Washington, during a shootout with FBI agents, who mockingly wore baseball caps with ZOG emblazoned on them.\n\nSince his death, Mathews has become a martyr to the racist cause here and in Europe. He is commemorated in songs such as \u201cTrue Heroes,\u201d by the popular hatecore band Nordic Thunder (\u201cHe fought off ZOG, the best he could/For he was the Aryan Robin Hood\u201d).\n\nSoon after his meeting with Mathews in Arlington, Virginia, Pierce purchased 346 acres of property outside Hillsboro, West Virginia, for $95,000 in cash. He claims the money came from an unnamed benefactor. He took up residence there in August 1985.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Pierce says of the charge that the money came from Mathews. \u201cIt seems to me that if the government believed that story, they would have tried to find some evidence that it was true, and I would have been in trouble.\u201d Asked if he ever received money from Mathews, Pierce jokes, \u201cHe paid his dues before be dropped out of the Alliance.\u201d\n\nIn fact, federal prosecutors say that they do believe Mathews gave Pierce the money but that they can\u2019t prove it. Thomas Martinez, an Order member who became a government informant, says he heard Mathews say that he\u2019d given money to Pierce, but this was hearsay testimony and thus inadmissible in a trial. Certainly, the timing of Pierce\u2019s purchase was consistent with that of Mathews\u2019 putative donation.\n\n\u201cThey joked among themselves that the money came from Bob Mathews,\u201d says Kirsten Kaiser. \u201cWho has $95,000 in cash?\u201d\n\nPierce decides to close up shop for the day and ride up to the top of his mountain. It takes a few minutes, the four-wheel drive bucking over the rugged road as dusk comes on. He passes the trailer where Sevdi is waiting with his supper. She called his office not long before. \u201cYes, Sevdi, seven o\u2019clock, as always,\u201d Pierce answered.\n\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t like to live here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like malls, shopping.\u201d\n\nSheriff Dale believes that Pierce selected this property because it is honeycombed with limestone caverns. \u201cMy personal opinion is that the caves were one of his most important criteria,\u201d says Dale. \u201cIt all fits into his philosophy of a race war, and nuclear weapons, and the atmosphere being contaminated. And he and his survivalists, who have been trained, will go underground and live until the atmosphere clears up.\u201d\n\nPierce acknowledges that there are a couple of caves below his land but is evasive about the question of bomb shelters. \u201cIt\u2019s a misallocation of resources,\u201d he says, \u201cto have people out here digging foxholes. You can\u2019t beat the military now. They could come in here with just one of their high-tech jets, drop a bunch of bombs and wipe us out in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nBy the time Pierce reaches the mountaintop, it\u2019s twilight, the air crisp and still. The countryside spreads out below, as homey as a Grandma Moses landscape. A few farmhouse lights gleam in the distance. A roadway winds its blue way across the valley. \u201cYou didn\u2019t used to see lights when I first moved here,\u201d Pierce says.\n\nHe stares out into the valley, sighs. \u201cPeople cannot imagine what it\u2019s gonna be like twenty-five years from now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t imagine how bad it\u2019s gonna be \u2014 groups of five, all armed with machine guns, to get from here to the corner grocery store, where they\u2019ll have to open up a slot to see whether they\u2019ll let you in.\u201d He speaks now like a boy with sci-fi dreams. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something, we\u2019re gonna be gone as a race.\u201d\n\nIn the time he has left, he says, he hopes to \u201cbuild a strong organization of fully committed lifelong revolutionaries.\u201d But he concedes that most whites today have no interest in his cause \u2014 despite the fact that he\u2019s doing it just for them. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly yuppies, couch potatoes,\u201d he says. \u201cJust interested in how much shiny stuff they can buy at the mall.\u201d\n\nHe wants to write a couple of more books. One, he says, will be \u201ca practical guide on how to change the course of history.\u201d\n\nDoes he believe he has changed the course of history?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he admits. \u201cWell, I mean, every sparrow that falls, every blade of grass changes history, but \u2026\u201d He pauses. It\u2019s as if he suddenly sees himself, at this moment, not as a world-historical figure but as an old man atop a mountain, his wife down below in a trailer, waiting for him to come home for supper.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m that Roman soldier who stayed at his post while Mount Vesuvius was erupting,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody came to relieve him, so he just stayed there.\u201d\n\nThen he turns to head back down the mountain."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/36175", "page_content": "internal conflict white supremacist anti-communist\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, author, and political activist.[1][2] He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\n2. Life and Career\n\n2.1. Early Life and Education\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1307868\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian[3][4][5] family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[6] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America.[7] After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence.[8] Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.;[9] he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942.[10] After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.[11]\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy.[12] As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction.[9] His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.[13]\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman.[14] Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics.[15][16] He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962.[15] He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.[17]\n\n2.2. Early Political Activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962,[18] but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.[11] In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP.\n\nAccording to the American neo-Nazi James Mason, during the first National Socialist World Congress in 1969, when a delegate asked what should be done with \"White race traitors\", Pierce formed with his hand a pistol being fired, rousing the audience to its feet.[19]\n\nIn 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency.[16] In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance.[15] Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.[20]\n\n2.3. National Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices,[21] the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.[22]\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service.[15] Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision.[15] Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.[23]\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.[24]\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash.[15] Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes.[15] In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes.[25] The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS.[26] He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.[27][28]\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes,[29][30] during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\".[29] Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi,[15][16][24][31][31][32][33][34] although he personally rejected this label.[29] When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.[29]\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States.[35] As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn.[15] Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute[24] informational video titled America is a Changing Country,[36] and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.[24]\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002.[37] On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.[38]\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001).[39] The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:[40]\n\nDeyr f\u00e9, deyja fr\u00e6ndr, deyr sj\u00e1lfr et sama; ek veit einn, at aldri deyr: d\u00f3mr um dau\u00f0an hvern. Cattle die, kinsmen die you yourself die; I know one thing which never dies: the judgment of a dead man's life.[41]\n\n3. Novels\n\n3.1. The Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[15] The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\".

Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"[42][43]\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order.[15] The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance.[15] The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington (state) , when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.[44]\n\n3.2. Hunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\n4. Religion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian,[3] Pierce became an atheist as a teenager.[4][5] In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".[15][16]\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\n5. Family\n\nPicture of Dr. William Pierce at an official National Alliance meeting in 1999, in Hillsboro, West Virginia. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1136386\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist.[6] The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.[45] Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia.[15] In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce.[45] Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996.

A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nLife and career\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform.\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian[5][6][7] family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[8] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America.[9] After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence.[10] Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.;[11] he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942.[12] After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.[13]\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy.[14] As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction.[11] His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.[15]\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman.[16] Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics.[17][18] He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962.[17] He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.[19]\n\nEarly political activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962,[20] but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.[13] In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP.\n\nAccording to the American neo-Nazi James Mason, during the first National Socialist World Congress in 1969, when a delegate asked what should be done with \"White race traitors\", Pierce formed with his hand a pistol being fired, rousing the audience to its feet.[21]\n\nIn 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency.[18] In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance.[17] Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.[22]\n\nNational Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices,[23] the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.[24]\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service.[17] Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision.[17] Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.[25]\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.[26]\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash.[17] Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes.[17] In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes.[27] The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS.[28] He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.[29][30]\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes,[31][32] during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\".[31] Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi,[17][18][26][33][33][34][35][36] although he personally rejected this label.[31] When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.[31]\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States.[37] As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn.[17] Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute[26] informational video titled America is a Changing Country,[38] and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.[26]\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002.[39] On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.[40]\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001).[41] The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:[42]\n\nDeyr f\u00e9, deyja fr\u00e6ndr, deyr sj\u00e1lfr et sama; ek veit einn, at aldri deyr: d\u00f3mr um dau\u00f0an hvern. Cattle die, kinsmen die you yourself die; I know one thing which never dies: the judgment of a dead man's life.[43]\n\nNovels\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[17] The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization, led by the secret inner circe known as The Order (a reorganized SS).\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters.[17] Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"[44][45]\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order.[17] The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance.[17] The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington (state) , when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.[46]\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.

I hope one or two replacement groups spring up to draw away from us the defectives.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce's final speech, National Alliance leadership conference, April 2002\n\n\"If the protagonist learns something or comes to believe in something, if he changes his ideas, the reader tends to do the same thing, he changes too. So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce, quoted in a biography of him called Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, on the power of narrative\n\nBackground\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce's bigoted attitudes toward people of color were inculcated at an early age. He was born in Atlanta into an Old South aristocracy that included his mother and her ancestors. His great-grandfather, he has said, was governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to a fawning biography of Pierce by University of Vermont Professor Robert Griffin, Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce, he grew up in a Southern household during segregation with older relatives who treated a black servant like a virtual slave.\n\nPierce graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. It was during that time that Pierce became concerned by the threat to the white race that he believed was posed by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, and he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing group that once accused President Eisenhower, among many others, of being a communist.\n\nThe John Birch Society, which generally rejected anti-Semitism, turned out to be too namby-pamby for Pierce. In 1966, he quit a job as a senior research scientist at a Connecticut aerospace firm to join George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (1959-67). Upon buying a printing press, Pierce become editor of the party's National Socialist World. After Rockwell was assassinated the following year, Pierce continued to work with the remnants of the group, which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party. In 1968, Pierce became an official of Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting Alabama segregationist and former Gov. George Wallace's bid for the presidency. Willis Carto, already one of America's leading anti-Semitic activists, also joined the Wallace group and in 1970 he and Pierce reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance (NYA). But the two men had a major falling out, and each claimed to be the new group's leader. In 1971, Carto accused Pierce of stealing a mailing list belonging to Carto's anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby organization. Pierce had written to those on the mailing list, attacking the Liberty Lobby's leaders, including Carto. Eventually, Pierce won control of the NYA, which was limited to people under age 30 and focused on activities on college and university campuses.\n\nIn 1974, Pierce dropped the age limit and reorganized the NYA as the National Alliance (NA), which he would lead until his death in 2002. The NA, which aimed to be a vanguard party capable of leading the \"lemmings\" comprising the white masses to revolutionary victory, adopted the slogans \"Free Men Are Not Equal\" and \"Equal Men Are Not Free.\" Effectively a Leninist in terms of tactics, Pierce was not interested in winning his battle through electoral successes. He wanted his vanguard to lead the white masses to power, something that could only come after a period of ethnic cleansing that Pierce referred to as a \"temporary unpleasantness,\" the seizure of state power and creation of all-white nations.\n\nThe text that made Pierce famous, however, was his novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald after first being serialized in the NA publication Attack! The NA boasted that the book was a \"Blueprint,\" a \"Handbook for White Victory.\" Pierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens. Using \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city. The violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children. By the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPierce's novel has inspired many a terrorist. In 1983, the NA's Pacific Northwest leader, Robert Mathews, joined with three other Alliance members and, later, some 20 other people, to create The Order, a white supremacist terrorist group. Based on the group portrayed in The Turner Diaries, Mathews' gang ultimately robbed some $4 million from armored cars. Declaring \"War in '84,\" members of The Order murdered a well-known Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, in Denver. (The first person on their hit list was Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees. They abandoned that attempt due to high levels of security.) Later that year, Mathews was killed in a shootout with the FBI. Pierce hailed his martyred acolyte, saying Mathews \"took us from name-calling to bloodletting.\"\n\nIn 1995, Timothy McVeigh, aided by Army pals Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. The day before, according to officials, McVeigh called an NA recorded message line seven times. When McVeigh was arrested, police found excerpts from The Turner Diaries in his car. After the attack, which was patterned on a similar bombing depicted in The Turner Diaries, Pierce predicted, or maybe hoped, that resentment of Jews, minorities and others would lead to terrorism \"on a scale the world has never seen before.\" In 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\" There are many other cases, as well, where killers were said to be inspired by the novel.\n\nIn 1989, Pierce's publishing arm, National Vanguard Books, printed his second novel, Hunter, depicting the assassination of interracial couples, Jews and politicians. The book was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, convicted of the sniper murders of at least two black men. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, Pierce editorialized that the Nazi leader was \"the greatest man of our era.\" In 1991, Pierce began broadcasting a shortwave radio program, \"American Dissident Voices,\" that was heard worldwide. Within months, it was carried by several AM stations.\n\nIn 1984, after several years in the Arlington, Va., area, Pierce paid $95,000 in cash for a 346-acre tract of land atop a small mountain in West Virginia, where he set up what would become the NA's permanent compound. He would build several structures on the land, including a building for his Cosmotheist Church, which housed the bogus religion conjured up by Pierce primarily as an unsuccessful tax dodge. It was from this compound that Pierce ran an empire that ultimately included sales of books, cassettes, music, and racist paraphernalia. The group created a system of monthly dues and produced a monthly update for its members, the National Alliance Bulletin. At its peak, around the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the NA had more than 1,400 dues-paying members.\n\nThe NA also served as a launching pad for many white supremacist terrorists. Besides the Order members, in 1996 officials arrested NA member Todd Vanbiber in Florida after a pipe bomb he was building exploded in his face. After Vanbiber was sentenced for federal firearms violations, other NA confederates testified that the Vanbiber gang had robbed three banks and donated at least $2,000 to Pierce. A week before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Larry Shoemake opened fire on a black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., killing one person and wounding seven others. Relatives said he was inspired by Pierce's writings.\n\nIn 1999, Pierce made an important business investment, buying white power music label Resistance Records for some $250,000. The deal gave Pierce control of the label's CD catalogue, inventory, mailing list and publishing arm. In the next few years, Resistance came to dominate the white power music scene and also became the biggest moneymaker in the NA empire. Pierce added to that empire in 2000, after \"national socialist black metal\" musician and convicted German murderer Hendrik M\u00f6bus took up residence at the NA headquarters. M\u00f6bus' music label, Cymophane, was then transferred to Pierce's control. Three months after arriving at the compound, M\u00f6bus was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany. Pierce spearheaded a campaign to free M\u00f6bus and raised money to pay for his legal fees. Ultimately, however, M\u00f6bus was deported and jailed in Germany.\n\nIn 2001, in a major break with the past, the NA began to hold rallies and engage in other public activities like leafleting. Organized by Deputy Membership Coordinator Billy Roper, NA members joined, for the first time, with other white supremacists in front of the Israeli Embassy to protest Jewish influence in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce married five times. His first wife was Patricia Jones, whom he met while at the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce was remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, who worked for the NA. The marriage ended in 1985, when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. In Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce talks of preferring immigrant women from Eastern Europe. He married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage that lasted until 1990, when she left Pierce and West Virginia \"for greener pastures in California.\" Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsannah, also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine. Zsuzsannah left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997. He was sharp and condescending toward his last wife, identified only with the pseudonym Irena in Fame, when he was not ignoring her. Irena was miserable living with the savior of the white race.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce made his last public speech at one of the NA's secretive \"leadership conferences\" that were held twice a year at the West Virginia compound. Held on April 20, Hitler's birthday, Pierce emphasized the need to continue building a professional organization while rejecting alliances with other hate groups, whom he derisively mocked. For the 10 days before his unforeseen death from kidney failure and cancer on July 23, 2002, Pierce instructed his subordinates, and worked feverishly to try to assure the survival of the NA. Pierce died an old-fashioned death, appropriate for a man who conceived of himself in decidedly old-fashioned terms \u2014 as a lord among serfs, an elite leader uniquely capable of leading \"his people\" to victory over Jews, \"race traitors,\" and a whole host of other enemies.\n\nPierce's 2002 death came at a critical moment for the NA. A quarter-century after birthing the group, Pierce had finally remade his outfit into a remarkably professional organization. Much of the previous two years had been spent building up a talented staff, learning how to run a profitable business, and intensifying recruiting and propaganda. Just before his death, the NA was bringing in more than $1 million a year, had a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history. Pierce's voice, broadcast via his \"American Dissident Voices\" Internet show, was being heard in Europe and the U.S. In just five days in June 2002, NA members in 20 states distributed 70,000 leaflets.\n\nSix days after Pierce's death, a committee of his key staffers announced that the NA had selected a new leader. Erich Gliebe, the hard-edged former boxer who fought professionally as \"The Aryan Barbarian,\" would be the new chairman, although all agreed that no one could replace Pierce, who was memorialized as \"Our Eternal Chairman,\" comparable to Hitler himself. But Pierce's condescending and harsh words during his final speech doomed the group. His comments that other hate groups were filled with \"freaks and weaklings,\" something first disclosed by the Intelligence Report, seriously undermined the group by driving away its customer base. Within a few months, infighting broke out among the leadership, and splits started to occur. By 2009, the NA had lost nearly all of its members, falling from a high of more than 1,400 to fewer than than 100, Resistance was losing money, and Gliebe was living in the basement of his mother's Cleveland-area home."}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/american-dissident_voices_wlp_dr._william_luther_pierce", "page_content": "favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite\n\ndoctor william luther pierce prophet of our time great man leader and thinker great quality files all saved and preserved for the future generations thank you\n\n- April 14, 2023good quality audio and truthful word of spiritual teacher and master the venerable DR.

First educated as a physicist, he later worked with George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. Pierce became well known as the author of a novel, The Turner Diaries (1978), written under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. He founded the religion of Cosmotheism, an admixture of panentheism, and promoted White nationalism, and White survival world-views.\n\nBackground and education\n\nWilliam Pierce was born on September 11, 1933 in Atlanta, Georgia. His father William L. Pierce II was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother Marguerite Farrell was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910. Her family were part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas Hill Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. Pierce\u2019s father was an artillery officer in World War I.[1] After the war he served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.\n\nHis father started an insurance agency and moved the family to Norfolk, Virginia when he was four. In 1942, the senior Pierce died suddendly when he was struck by a car after stepping from a street car. After his father\u2019s death the family, which included his younger brother Sanders Pierce, moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform.\n\nWilliam Pierce did well in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent at Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics and reading science fiction.\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He injured himself when a four inch pipe fell on his hand and spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice Institute (later renamed Rice University) in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice Institute in 1955 with a bachelors degree in physics.\n\nHe took an interest in aviation and obtained a private pilot's license in August 1958.[2] He had hopes of one day becoming an astronaut.\n\nHe worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for a few months before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. From July 1965 to June 1966 Pierce was employed as Senior Researcher Associate Physicist for the aircraft division of Pratt and Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut.[3]\n\nAmerican Nazi Party\n\nIt was during this time at Oregon State when Pierce began to notice two social movements on campus that disturbed him: the civil rights and the Vietnam anti-war movements. Pierce saw the Jewish-fueled civil rights movement as a threat to the white race. Also, he believed the anti-war movement to be communist-inspired and led primarily by Jews. He had a brief membership in the John Birch Society in 1962 but eventually resigned because they weren\u2019t critical of Jews.\n\nThat same year Pierce noticed the activities of George Lincoln Rockwell and his fledging American Nazi Party. In March 1962 Rockwell was attacked on stage when he was speaking at San Diego State College in California. Rockwell's talk was cancelled and the brawl was covered on national television. Pierce found Rockwell's address and began a several year correspondence. [4]\n\nIn 1966 Pierce became an associate of Rockwell. During this time he left his research position with Pratt and Whitney and went to work for Rockwell without pay. Pierce soon founded and became the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was assassinated in 1967, Pierce continued to work with the group--this time officially becoming a member and Ideological Officer--which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP).\n\nIn 1968 Pierce received national attention by becoming a Virginia arms dealer creating NS Arms. The venture sold \"Negro control equipment\" consisting of riot guns, handguns, semi-automatic rifles and chemical mace. Pierce advertised and used NSWPP literature with the warning \"Beat the Ban. Stock you home NOW--with weapons for the coming race war!\"[5]\n\nOn April 9, 1970 Pierce spoke before students at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and said that President Nixon should be dragged out of his office and shot.[6]\n\nPierce left the NSWPP in July 1970[7] and took control of the National Youth Alliance in December 1970 which later became the National Alliance, incorporated in Virginia on February 26, 1974.[8] In August 1970 Pierce sent a proposal title Prospectus for a National Front to likeminded National Socialist around the country.\n\nNational Alliance\n\nIn 1973 Pierce testified against Secretary of State nominee Henry Kissinger before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stating Kissinger as a Jew would favor the interests of Israel over America.[9]\n\nThe National Alliance adopted the Life Rune as its symbol and this organization was to be a political vanguard designed ultimately to bring about a \u201cwhite racial redemption\u201d. His Cosmotheist Community Church, which was to be the next step of this plan, was set up in the mid-1970s, alongside Pierce\u2019s political projects; the National Alliance, National Vanguard Books, and the weekly broadcast American Dissident Voices. In 1978 Pierce applied for and was denied tax exemption claiming it from the Internal Revenue Service; he appealed and an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision. In 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a rural area near Mill Point, West Virginia.\n\nWhen Pierce bought the West Virginia land he incorporated it as the \u201cCosmotheist Community Church\u201d and applied for Federal, state and local tax exemptions. However in 1986, the \u201cChurch\u201d lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400 acres) acres and which had to exclusively used for \u201creligious purposes.\u201d The other 340 acres (1.6 km\u00b2) were for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were not ruled tax exempt.\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce came to international public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing. The perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, including a detailed description of the mass hangings of many \u201crace traitors\u201d and of any white women who ever had had sex with any non-Whites and in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the entire city. The book, told through the perspective of Earl Turner \u2013 an active member of the white revolutionary underground \u2013 The Organization-culminates with Turner\u2019s nuclear suicide mission, of which destroyed the military command at The Pentagon, and thus preventing any invasion of the Organization-controlled California.\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an earlier chapter, when the book's main character is put in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters in Washington DC. Some have drawn parallels from the book to the actual bombing strikingly similar to the Oklahoma City bombing that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people in 1995. Although The Turner Diaries was originally only available by mail order and at events such as gun shows, it is still believed to have sold well over three quarters of a million copies.\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s calling themselves the Silent Brotherhood or sometimes simply The Order. The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the National Alliance. The Order\u2019s leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington when the FBI finally firebombed his hideout.\n\nMarriages\n\nPierce married five times. The first was with Patricia Jones whom he met while at California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985 when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage which lasted until 1990. Olga left Pierce and West Virginia \u201cfor greener pastures in California\u201d. Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsanna, who is also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in an Hungarian women\u2019s magazine. Zsuzsanna left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997.\n\nFinal years\n\nPierce spent his final years living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices and oversaw his publishing, National Vanguard magazine, Free Speech and Resistance as well as books published by his book publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc and his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nBefore Pierce died he allowed professor Robert S. Griffin to live with him for a month with the result being Pierce's biography : The Fame of a Dead Man\u2019s Deeds (2001) [1]. William Pierce died of cancer on July 23, 2002 at his home in West Virginia.\n\nWorks\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\n\nPart of this article consists of modified text from Wikipedia, and the article is therefore licensed under GFDL."}], "William Luther Pierce III was a Holocaust denier.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/william-luther-pierce-white-supremacist-son-kelvin-pierce", "page_content": "From an exposed bluff in Mill Point, West Virginia, Kelvin Pierce surveyed the remote place where his father chose to live and die. In a sense, he knew why. Kelvin is an avid outdoorsman, and even on a stark February day, with snow blanketing the earth and bitter wind whistling through the trees, he was moved by Appalachia\u2019s subtle splendor. He understood why a man might settle there.\n\n\u201cI love West Virginia,\u201d Kelvin had said earlier, on the four-and-a-half-hour drive from his home just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my favorite place on the planet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also full of sorrow.\n\nWhen Pierce\u2019s father bought 346 acres in Mill Point, and relocated there permanently in 1985, he left his family behind. He started building a compound where a new kind of family \u2013 men and women of like mind \u2013 could live off the land and be free of outside influences. He moved into a rambling trailer home, where he lived with a series of wives who weren\u2019t Pierce\u2019s mother. He had divorced her, declaring the split \u201cnecessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\u201d.\n\nNothing was more important to Kelvin\u2019s father than white supremacy. The abandonment and the hate \u2013 the abandonment for hate \u2013 is what Kelvin has spent the better part of his life struggling to understand.\n\nTo family and friends, his dad was Bill. To everyone else, he was William Luther Pierce III, one of America\u2019s most prominent white nationalists.\n\nA physics professor turned neo-Nazi, William Pierce led a hate group called the National Alliance and a business empire that, at the time of his death from cancer in 2002, raked in $1m a year. He published books and magazines, hosted a radio program, and owned a music label, all of which promoted white supremacy. His work galvanized violent gangs, such as the Order and the Aryan Republican Army. Most infamously, it inspired the architect of the Oklahoma City bombing \u2013 Timothy McVeigh designed the attack based in part on Pierce\u2019s 1978 novel The Turner Diaries.\n\nReportedly called \u201cthe bible of the racist right\u201d by the FBI, The Turner Diaries is a fantasy about white militants overthrowing the US government as part of a bloody race war. A 2016 report found that the book had been tied to at least 200 murders, committed in 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes. This year, during the 6 January coup attempt, there were echoes of the novel\u2019s core ideas in insurrectionists\u2019 calls to kill members of Congress, and in a gallows erected near the Capitol.\n\nWilliam Pierce raised Kelvin to hate Jews, Black people, immigrants \u2013 anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Now 60, Kelvin has long rejected his father\u2019s ideology, but only recently has he reached the point where he\u2019s ready to talk about his upbringing, and how his story illuminates the toxic currents roiling America. \u201cIf I can help one other person that felt the way I used to feel, to feel better and to make different choices, then that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cAnd I think I can help more than one person.\u201d\n\nWhen he was little, Kelvin would sneak into his dad\u2019s home office in northern Virginia to look at the bust of Adolf Hitler and the glass paperweight in the shape of a swastika that sat on the desk. Kelvin didn\u2019t know what the items meant, and William Pierce wasn\u2019t interested in explaining. He rarely spent time with Kelvin and his twin brother, Erik, preferring to fraternize with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi party, or to lock himself away writing articles decrying Jewish power and interracial marriage.\n\nKelvin\u2019s strongest memories of his dad involve abuse. Any disobedience or perception of bad behavior led to beatings with whatever was at hand: a belt, a wire hanger, a two-by-four. The violence left Kelvin with bruises and a deep well of self-loathing.\n\nHis mom, Patty, didn\u2019t approve of the cruelty, but she didn\u2019t do much to intervene. She took a similar approach to her husband\u2019s extremism, which he\u2019d nurtured since at least the early 1960s. A math professor and the family breadwinner, because her husband had given up his own academic career to become an ideologue of hate, Patty did all of William Pierce\u2019s accounting and typing. Kelvin said his mom was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d when her husband started a firearms business \u2013 not because he advertised his stock as \u201cNegro control equipment\u201d necessary for \u201cthe coming race war\u201d, but because it prompted newspapers to publish articles about him. Patty worried that someone might come to the house and hurt her family.\n\nFamily photos from the archive of Kelvin Pierce. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWhen her sons told her that neighborhood kids made fun of them by calling them Nazis, she lamented that \u201cit\u2019s a terrible world\u201d and \u201cpeople are awful\u201d. She didn\u2019t answer when Kelvin asked her what a Nazi was, and she didn\u2019t tell her boys that their father was to blame for what was happening to them.\n\nAs a teenager, Kelvin was a bigot because he didn\u2019t know any other way to be. He also hoped it would impress his dad. In high school, he gave a presentation on Hitler\u2019s virtues and used the N-word to talk about Black classmates. By the time he went to college, he was \u201ca mobile advertisement\u201d for his father\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel superior to be part of the white race,\u201d Kelvin later wrote. \u201cYet deep, deep down, something didn\u2019t quite feel right about it either.\u201d\n\nHe began to change when he transferred from a small Christian college to Virginia Tech. He roomed with a young man from South America who was \u201cthoughtful, caring and very intelligent\u201d \u2013 all things that Kelvin\u2019s father insisted people who weren\u2019t white couldn\u2019t be. He took classes with students who saw the world very differently than he did. When Ronald Reagan was elected president and many of his liberal peers were visibly upset \u2013 including his roommate, who drew a dagger and drops of blood on a photo of Reagan \u2013 he wanted to understand why. He started paying attention to politics and watching the evening news, which his dad had always said was worthless because Jews controlled the media. Kelvin wondered if everything he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nHe met a fellow student named Susan when they were both engineering interns with the navy one summer. Kelvin thought she was beautiful, but while his racism was rapidly dissipating, his shame \u2013 the feeling that his dad had abused him for a reason, that he deserved it \u2013 was not. He couldn\u2019t imagine making the first move, but Susan could. \u201cYou know, if you were to ask me out, I would say yes,\u201d she announced one day.\n\nThey were married in 1986. William Pierce came to the wedding. His gift to the bride and groom was a box of 9mm ammunition. \u201cTo keep the wolves away from your door!\u201d his note read. Kelvin didn\u2019t even own a gun.\n\nBy then, William Pierce had divorced Patty, decamped to Mill Point, and curtailed contact with his sons. Kelvin only confronted his dad once, asking why he\u2019d chosen white supremacy over everything else in his life. \u201cIt was the only responsible thing I could do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nFor her part, Susan didn\u2019t think that William Pierce\u2019s worldview mattered. \u201cThank goodness that\u2019s a dying thought process,\u201d she recalled thinking \u2013 an assumption she now sees as optimistic, or perhaps naive. It was also hard for her to fathom the extent of the abuse Kelvin suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, he hit me every day,\u201d he told her once.\n\n\u201cEvery day?\u201d she replied, incredulous.\n\nSusan had grown up in a home where, as she put it, \u201cWe were always hugging each other, and we always said, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Kelvin had kids only because they agreed to adopt them. \u201cI was just terrified of furthering my genes,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cI was so messed up and so damaged as a human being that I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of trying to make another human being.\u201d Their daughters, Mariame and Marieka, are from the country of Georgia. Kelvin vowed to love them like he\u2019d never been loved. He coached their softball teams and took them on camping trips.\n\nKelvin with his daughter Marieka. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWilliam Pierce never met his granddaughters. For seven years prior to his death, he didn\u2019t reply to the letters and photos documenting their childhood that Kelvin sent him. Despite everything, Kelvin kept reaching out. His anger at how he\u2019d been raised collided with yearning for paternal approval. When he first heard of the connection between The Turner Diaries and the Oklahoma City bombing, his kneejerk reaction was a perverse kind of pride that his dad was in the news. He was ashamed his mind went there, but at a loss for how to stop it.\n\nKelvin was battling his demons without armor or weapons. He was also doing it alone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mystery to me,\u201d Susan would tell him sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d\n\nIn July 2002, his uncle called to tell him that his father was dead. Kelvin hadn\u2019t even known he was sick. He surprised himself by crying, then realized what he was really mourning: he had to let go of the futile hope that his father might one day love him. He went to West Virginia for the memorial service, where neo-Nazis offered their condolences and said Kelvin must have admired his father very much.\n\nHow little they know, he thought.\n\nHe looked like his dad \u2013 tall and lanky, with mournful eyes, a long, square jaw, and prominent ears. He shared William Pierce\u2019s introspection and his dislike of being told what to do. But the similarities ended there.\n\nAfter the service, he began to feel something new: he was sad for his father and the life he\u2019d led. It could have been different. But again and again, William Pierce had made the wrong choices, leaving heartache and hate in his wake.\n\nKelvin wanted to start making better choices of his own.\n\nTo Mariame Pierce, her dad\u2019s bookshelf told the story. When she was little, it held volumes about Kelvin\u2019s hobbies \u2013 mountain climbing, for instance. Over time, new titles appeared, ones about self-discovery and philosophy, written by Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra. While she was growing up, her dad was changing too. \u201cHe became more present and thoughtful, more conscious and intentional,\u201d said Mariame, now 25.\n\nKelvin had embarked on a \u201chealing\u201d journey, as he describes it. He read, reflected and prayed. He worked with a counselor to process his childhood trauma, including his father\u2019s belief system. He and Susan, who already ran a successful construction business together, started a charitable foundation to support orphanages in Georgia. When he posted pictures from visits to his daughters\u2019 native country, friends remarked that he looked uncharacteristically happy. \u201cTo make a child feel like at least somebody in the world loves them, it\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nHe told his life story publicly for the first time at his local Rotary Club. He described how, in his youth, he\u2019d fantasized about traveling to Washington with a gun and opening fire on Black people. His teenage dreams now repulsed him. Afterward, audience members came up to thank him. Some of them were crying.\n\nThe more he talked about his experiences, the more people told Kelvin he should write a book. It took a seismic national event for him to decide they were right.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Watching the events unfold, \u201cI was immediately transported back to my childhood,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cThe hatefulness of their energy and what they were saying, the way they were saying it, especially \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 it was just like being an eight- or nine-year-old kid, when my dad took me to an American Nazi party picnic.\u201d\n\nHe started writing what would become Sins of My Father, which he self-published in February 2020. In addition to telling Kelvin\u2019s personal story the book, written with Carole Donoghue, draws on private letters and other archival documents that reveal how perceived grievances, personal disappointment, and twisted self-regard led William Pierce to dedicate his life to white supremacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when his father\u2019s beliefs began to curdle \u2013 stories of radicalization are never so precise \u2013 Kelvin finds seeds of discontent in the years when William Pierce was a new husband, a new father and newly endowed with his physics doctorate. \u201cI think Dad was becoming angry and resentful and was suddenly frightened of the future and the heaviness of it all,\u201d Kelvin writes. \u201cHe hated the idea of working for someone else. He never wanted to have to answer to anyone else, even his wife.\u201d\n\nThis period in William Pierce\u2019s life coincided with the rise of progressive identity politics \u2013 the acceleration of the civil rights movement, for instance, and the dawn of second-wave feminism. He wanted to be a man who mattered, a man people listened to. White nationalism allowed him to be that. His life became one long ideological devolution, nourished by the power and attention he accrued evangelizing about hate.\n\nKelvin Pierce photographed at his home in Vienna. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nIf the story sounds familiar, it is. America is still plagued by the forces of rightwing radicalization. Sins of My Father draws parallels between William Pierce and Donald Trump, who \u201cemboldened white supremacists and mass-shooters by his words and deeds,\u201d as Kelvin writes. \u201cIn many ways, Trump has succeeded where Dad failed. He has taken hate and discrimination mainstream.\u201d\n\nOther evidence of his father\u2019s enduring impact hit closer to home. After Marieka Pierce enrolled in a police academy in Virginia, one day in class, her instructors showed the room a picture of her grandfather, describing him as an example of a homegrown extremist. \u201cMy hand went up,\u201d Marieka later told her mom.\n\nThe instructors were stunned to hear about the family connection. William Pierce was a staple in their curriculum about hate crimes; they\u2019d been teaching recruits about him for as long as they could remember. They asked to meet Kelvin to get a fuller picture of the man who, in obituaries, was remembered as \u201ca cold and calculating racist\u201d and \u201cthe godfather of hate in this country.\u201d\n\nDonny MacMullen has his own take on William Pierce: he thinks Kelvin\u2019s father was a great man.\n\nMacMullen, who is in his 30s, with reddish brown hair, a full beard, and striking blue eyes, moved to Mill Point from Massachusetts a few years ago to help preserve Pierce\u2019s legacy. Today, he\u2019s the caretaker of the National Alliance compound, which amounts to a few scattered buildings and the rocky sprawls of land between them.\n\nThe place is in a state of disrepair, and people rarely visit, but there are reminders of the community Kelvin\u2019s dad was trying to build before he died: an AV facility stocked with equipment that was first-rate in the early aughts; a library that once housed several thousand volumes; stacks of slickly produced magazines promoting racism; a meeting house where William Pierce presided over annual National Alliance conferences. Today, even as Pierce\u2019s ideas continue to find adherents, the organization he started is a shade of its former self.\n\nMacMullen was happy to welcome Kelvin to the compound in February. Indeed, members of the National Alliance had long made clear that William Pierce\u2019s son could visit anytime. For more than 15 years after his father\u2019s death, however, Kelvin stayed away. He wasn\u2019t ready to make peace with it, because he wasn\u2019t at peace with himself.\n\nIt was a steep drive up switchbacks to the heart of the compound, where MacMullen was waiting, wearing a knit cap with a swastika stitched to the front. When Kelvin asked him about the symbol, MacMullen laughed. It just represents love for the white race, he insisted. Kelvin pointed out that it was associated with hate and genocide, and MacMullen shifted gears. If you love something deeply, he said, then you have to hate anything that threatens it.\n\nDonny MacMullen\u2019s office at the West Virginia compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThis was another way of expressing the sentiment of a meme MacMullen once posted on his Facebook page: \u201cI\u2019m white but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist \u2026 I will put my boot in your ass, my knife to your throat, and your body in the dirt if you f**k with me and mine.\u201d\n\nKelvin and MacMullen walked for a while on the property, just the two of them. If it was painful to talk with a man who revered his father \u2013 who saw virtue in a racist who beat him every day of his childhood \u2013 Kelvin didn\u2019t let it show. They talked about their divergent beliefs, and neither man was interested in budging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree,\u201d MacMullen said at one point.\n\nWhen Kelvin recounted the conversation to his best friend, Gil Jullien, who\u2019d come on the trip as moral support, Jullien was furious. \u201cOh, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to disagree!\u201d\n\nJullien was speaking from experience. He was troubled that a close childhood friend had become a vociferous Trump supporter, the sort who regularly posts racist and sexist content on Facebook. Once, when the two men were at a high school reunion talking politics, Jullien\u2019s friend had told him they\u2019d have to agree to disagree. Jullien wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s ruining our country, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he later explained.\n\nKelvin shares Jullien\u2019s moral compass. \u201cAggression and hate and violence are the epitome of cowardice,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t want to feel antagonism or resentment toward anyone, not even white nationalists.\n\nHe prefers to listen and question, not to confront; to offer the possibility of connection rather than writing people off. His approach might not be for everyone, but for Kelvin it\u2019s vital. If he could be redeemed, why not someone like MacMullen?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself out there for people that want help and want change,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nBefore Kelvin left the compound, MacMullen gave him a copy of a book \u2013 a tome, really, at more than 1,000 pages. Written in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist who ran in the same circles as William Pierce, Which Way Western Man? bemoans the supposed decline of white civilization, the rise of feminism and multiculturalism, and the alleged chokehold liberal orthodoxy has on modern society \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of white supremacy\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nMacMullen said the text meant a lot to him. Back home in Virginia, in the spirit of listening and questioning, Kelvin cracked the book and read the first 50 or so pages. \u201cIt kind of boils down to, do you live your life stuck in the rat race, within society\u2019s norms, or do you break out from that and try to live a more authentic life, doing what you want to do, what you feel is right versus what society says is right?\u201d he said.\n\nThe language struck a chord. He heard echoes of his own transformation, of setting a new course for himself. Whereas Kelvin chose a path defined by hope and inclusivity, people who admire his father have let bigotry be their guide. Still, in their journeys\u2019 common origin, Kelvin saw promise \u2013 the possibility of trying again, and getting it right this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as insurmountable a task to start a recovery process as some people think. It does take discipline, but it actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that, right?\u201d\n\nThe trailer where William Luther Pierce once lived lies in disrepair at the National Alliance compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThe last time Kelvin saw his father, he jumped off a mountain.\n\nKelvin had started hang-gliding in his 20s, and during his first visit to the compound in West Virginia \u2013 the only one he took while William Pierce was alive \u2013 his dad had suggested he glide off one of the property\u2019s peaks. No way, Kelvin told him. There weren\u2019t open areas below where he could land. At best he\u2019d come away injured; at worst he could die.\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Kelvin traveled to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, for a series of flights over the Labor Day weekend. He invited his dad to come watch him. He didn\u2019t expect him to show, but as Kelvin was untying his glider from its rack on his truck, he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cYou need a hand with that?\u201d his father asked.\n\n\u201cYou actually came,\u201d Kelvin replied.\n\nWith his father\u2019s help, Kelvin made quick work of maneuvering his 80lb glider to the launch site. Before them was a pleated vista, gentle peaks and valleys thick with late-summer green. Kelvin suited up and pointed to the landing field where his father could meet him. \u201cClear!\u201d he yelled, before taking a few running steps and leaving the earth.\n\nThe flight was perfect. A swell of wind \u2013 a lift, as hang-gliders say \u2013 allowed Kelvin to pilot much higher than he\u2019d planned, rendering his dad a dot on the ground. He stayed in the sky for an hour. The view was majestic: forests and farms and fields stretching beneath him.\n\nHe touched down with ease in a wide field. As he was packing up his gear, he heard the familiar voice again: \u201cWow, Kelvin, that was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Kelvin knew for certain he\u2019d impressed his father.\n\nThey stood in the landing field talking for a bit longer. Then father and son said their goodbyes and went their separate ways: William Pierce to what Kelvin called \u201chis life of hate at the compound\u201d; he to new chapters of his existence. Some, such as parenthood, would be joyous. Wrestling with his past would be torment. But just like he navigated the wind high above the mountains, Kelvin would steer himself to a place where he could land, safe and whole, and invite others to join him, if only they too have the courage to leap.\n\nKelvin Pierce at a park nearby his home in Virginia.

So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce, quoted in a biography of him called Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, on the power of narrative\n\nBackground\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce's bigoted attitudes toward people of color were inculcated at an early age. He was born in Atlanta into an Old South aristocracy that included his mother and her ancestors. His great-grandfather, he has said, was governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to a fawning biography of Pierce by University of Vermont Professor Robert Griffin, Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce, he grew up in a Southern household during segregation with older relatives who treated a black servant like a virtual slave.\n\nPierce graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. It was during that time that Pierce became concerned by the threat to the white race that he believed was posed by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, and he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing group that once accused President Eisenhower, among many others, of being a communist.\n\nThe John Birch Society, which generally rejected anti-Semitism, turned out to be too namby-pamby for Pierce. In 1966, he quit a job as a senior research scientist at a Connecticut aerospace firm to join George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (1959-67). Upon buying a printing press, Pierce become editor of the party's National Socialist World. After Rockwell was assassinated the following year, Pierce continued to work with the remnants of the group, which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party. In 1968, Pierce became an official of Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting Alabama segregationist and former Gov. George Wallace's bid for the presidency. Willis Carto, already one of America's leading anti-Semitic activists, also joined the Wallace group and in 1970 he and Pierce reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance (NYA). But the two men had a major falling out, and each claimed to be the new group's leader. In 1971, Carto accused Pierce of stealing a mailing list belonging to Carto's anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby organization. Pierce had written to those on the mailing list, attacking the Liberty Lobby's leaders, including Carto. Eventually, Pierce won control of the NYA, which was limited to people under age 30 and focused on activities on college and university campuses.\n\nIn 1974, Pierce dropped the age limit and reorganized the NYA as the National Alliance (NA), which he would lead until his death in 2002. The NA, which aimed to be a vanguard party capable of leading the \"lemmings\" comprising the white masses to revolutionary victory, adopted the slogans \"Free Men Are Not Equal\" and \"Equal Men Are Not Free.\" Effectively a Leninist in terms of tactics, Pierce was not interested in winning his battle through electoral successes. He wanted his vanguard to lead the white masses to power, something that could only come after a period of ethnic cleansing that Pierce referred to as a \"temporary unpleasantness,\" the seizure of state power and creation of all-white nations.\n\nThe text that made Pierce famous, however, was his novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald after first being serialized in the NA publication Attack! The NA boasted that the book was a \"Blueprint,\" a \"Handbook for White Victory.\" Pierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens. Using \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city. The violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children. By the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPierce's novel has inspired many a terrorist. In 1983, the NA's Pacific Northwest leader, Robert Mathews, joined with three other Alliance members and, later, some 20 other people, to create The Order, a white supremacist terrorist group. Based on the group portrayed in The Turner Diaries, Mathews' gang ultimately robbed some $4 million from armored cars. Declaring \"War in '84,\" members of The Order murdered a well-known Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, in Denver. (The first person on their hit list was Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees. They abandoned that attempt due to high levels of security.) Later that year, Mathews was killed in a shootout with the FBI. Pierce hailed his martyred acolyte, saying Mathews \"took us from name-calling to bloodletting.\"\n\nIn 1995, Timothy McVeigh, aided by Army pals Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. The day before, according to officials, McVeigh called an NA recorded message line seven times. When McVeigh was arrested, police found excerpts from The Turner Diaries in his car. After the attack, which was patterned on a similar bombing depicted in The Turner Diaries, Pierce predicted, or maybe hoped, that resentment of Jews, minorities and others would lead to terrorism \"on a scale the world has never seen before.\" In 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\" There are many other cases, as well, where killers were said to be inspired by the novel.\n\nIn 1989, Pierce's publishing arm, National Vanguard Books, printed his second novel, Hunter, depicting the assassination of interracial couples, Jews and politicians. The book was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, convicted of the sniper murders of at least two black men. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, Pierce editorialized that the Nazi leader was \"the greatest man of our era.\" In 1991, Pierce began broadcasting a shortwave radio program, \"American Dissident Voices,\" that was heard worldwide. Within months, it was carried by several AM stations.\n\nIn 1984, after several years in the Arlington, Va., area, Pierce paid $95,000 in cash for a 346-acre tract of land atop a small mountain in West Virginia, where he set up what would become the NA's permanent compound. He would build several structures on the land, including a building for his Cosmotheist Church, which housed the bogus religion conjured up by Pierce primarily as an unsuccessful tax dodge. It was from this compound that Pierce ran an empire that ultimately included sales of books, cassettes, music, and racist paraphernalia. The group created a system of monthly dues and produced a monthly update for its members, the National Alliance Bulletin. At its peak, around the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the NA had more than 1,400 dues-paying members.\n\nThe NA also served as a launching pad for many white supremacist terrorists. Besides the Order members, in 1996 officials arrested NA member Todd Vanbiber in Florida after a pipe bomb he was building exploded in his face. After Vanbiber was sentenced for federal firearms violations, other NA confederates testified that the Vanbiber gang had robbed three banks and donated at least $2,000 to Pierce. A week before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Larry Shoemake opened fire on a black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., killing one person and wounding seven others. Relatives said he was inspired by Pierce's writings.\n\nIn 1999, Pierce made an important business investment, buying white power music label Resistance Records for some $250,000. The deal gave Pierce control of the label's CD catalogue, inventory, mailing list and publishing arm. In the next few years, Resistance came to dominate the white power music scene and also became the biggest moneymaker in the NA empire. Pierce added to that empire in 2000, after \"national socialist black metal\" musician and convicted German murderer Hendrik M\u00f6bus took up residence at the NA headquarters. M\u00f6bus' music label, Cymophane, was then transferred to Pierce's control. Three months after arriving at the compound, M\u00f6bus was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany. Pierce spearheaded a campaign to free M\u00f6bus and raised money to pay for his legal fees. Ultimately, however, M\u00f6bus was deported and jailed in Germany.\n\nIn 2001, in a major break with the past, the NA began to hold rallies and engage in other public activities like leafleting. Organized by Deputy Membership Coordinator Billy Roper, NA members joined, for the first time, with other white supremacists in front of the Israeli Embassy to protest Jewish influence in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce married five times. His first wife was Patricia Jones, whom he met while at the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce was remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, who worked for the NA. The marriage ended in 1985, when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. In Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce talks of preferring immigrant women from Eastern Europe. He married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage that lasted until 1990, when she left Pierce and West Virginia \"for greener pastures in California.\" Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsannah, also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine. Zsuzsannah left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997. He was sharp and condescending toward his last wife, identified only with the pseudonym Irena in Fame, when he was not ignoring her. Irena was miserable living with the savior of the white race.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce made his last public speech at one of the NA's secretive \"leadership conferences\" that were held twice a year at the West Virginia compound. Held on April 20, Hitler's birthday, Pierce emphasized the need to continue building a professional organization while rejecting alliances with other hate groups, whom he derisively mocked. For the 10 days before his unforeseen death from kidney failure and cancer on July 23, 2002, Pierce instructed his subordinates, and worked feverishly to try to assure the survival of the NA. Pierce died an old-fashioned death, appropriate for a man who conceived of himself in decidedly old-fashioned terms \u2014 as a lord among serfs, an elite leader uniquely capable of leading \"his people\" to victory over Jews, \"race traitors,\" and a whole host of other enemies.\n\nPierce's 2002 death came at a critical moment for the NA. A quarter-century after birthing the group, Pierce had finally remade his outfit into a remarkably professional organization. Much of the previous two years had been spent building up a talented staff, learning how to run a profitable business, and intensifying recruiting and propaganda. Just before his death, the NA was bringing in more than $1 million a year, had a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history. Pierce's voice, broadcast via his \"American Dissident Voices\" Internet show, was being heard in Europe and the U.S. In just five days in June 2002, NA members in 20 states distributed 70,000 leaflets.\n\nSix days after Pierce's death, a committee of his key staffers announced that the NA had selected a new leader. Erich Gliebe, the hard-edged former boxer who fought professionally as \"The Aryan Barbarian,\" would be the new chairman, although all agreed that no one could replace Pierce, who was memorialized as \"Our Eternal Chairman,\" comparable to Hitler himself. But Pierce's condescending and harsh words during his final speech doomed the group.

They would likewise use euphemisms \u2014 for instance, Sonderbehandlung literally meant \u201cspecial treatment\u201d whereas in reality it meant killing \u2014 to conceal the violence they committed.\n\nAnd along with the corpses of those who died in concentration camps, the Nazis attempted to destroy what they did write down before World War II came to an end.\n\nAccording to Heinrich Himmler, this secrecy was by design. In October 1943, the SS police head and \u201cArchitect of the Final Solution\u201d delivered a clandestine speech to Nazi party officials wherein he detailed the fact that the Holocaust was to be conducted in secret, and thus be \u201can unwritten and never-to-be-written page of glory in our history.\u201d\n\nThese speeches, which Himmler delivered in Posen, Poland, came to be known as the Posen speeches. Beyond survivors\u2019 accounts and site remains, they provide some of the most definitive proof that the German government consciously engaged in the systematic slaughter of millions of Jews.\n\nIn one speech, Himmler makes explicit mention of the Jewish genocide \u2014 something which had never been done by a Nazi party representative before:\n\n\u201cI am now referring to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. It\u2019s one of those things that is easily said: \u2018The Jewish people are being exterminated,\u2019 says every party member, \u2018this is very obvious, it\u2019s in our program, elimination of the Jews, extermination, we\u2019re doing it, hah, a small matter.\u2019 And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. They say the others are all swines, but this particular one is a splendid Jew. But none has observed it, endured it. Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person \u2014 with exceptions due to human weaknesses \u2014 has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Holocaust deniers use what appears in those very speeches to buttress their own beliefs.\n\nFirst, they highlight what they view as translation errors \u2014 namely that the word \u201causrottung\u201d in Himmler\u2019s speech does not mean exterminate, but deport. From there, Holocaust deniers say that Himmler did not talk about \u201cexterminating\u201d Jews, but \u201cdeporting\u201d them.\n\nWhile German language experts concede that there is flexibility in the term\u2019s meaning in an abstract sense, when taken in the context of his subsequent remarks, they add that there is no way that Himmler could have meant anything besides extermination."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/us/alt-right-national-socialist-movement-white-supremacy.html", "page_content": "A small but determined political organization in Detroit began to worry that its official symbol was a bit off-putting. With the group\u2019s central philosophy suddenly finding traction in the daily discourse, appearances mattered.\n\nSo in November, as the country\u2019s divisive presidential campaign became ever more jagged, the National Socialist Movement, a leading neo-Nazi group, did away with its swastika. In its stead, the group chose a symbol from a pre-Roman alphabet that was also adopted by the Nazis.\n\nAccording to Jeff Schoep, the movement\u2019s leader, the decision to dispense with the swastika was \u201can attempt to become more integrated and more mainstream.\u201d\n\nLet us pause.

According to the deniers, the Nazis did not murder six million Jews, the notion of homicidal gas chambers is a myth, and any deaths of Jews that did occur under the Nazis were the result of wartime privations, not of systematic persecution and state-organised mass murder. Some even claim that Hitler was the best friend the Jews had in Germany, and that he actively worked to protect them. Deniers dismiss all assertions that the Holocaust took place as conscious fabrications, or as psychotic delusions. Some even claim that Hitler was the best friend the Jews had in Germany, and that he actively worked to protect them. According to deniers, Jews have perpetrated this hoax about the Holocaust on the world in order to gain political and financial advantage, and it was in fact Germany that was the true victim in World War Two. Top\n\nDocumented genocide Holocaust denial is a form of anti-Semitism, positing that Jews have concocted a giant myth for their own ends. It persists despite the fact that the Holocaust is one of the best documented genocides in history, with a wide array of evidence documenting virtually every aspect of it. For example, approximately a million Jews on the Eastern Front were shot during 1941-42, and buried in large pits. This is known partly because the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units that coordinated these massacres, prepared detailed reports on the murders - reports that contained precise death tolls, broken down into men, women and children. These reports were sent to high ranking officials in Berlin, and to army, police and SS officers, as well as diplomats and even prominent industrialists. This wide distribution suggests that the perpetrators felt no shame at what they did. Had these killings not been part of Berlin's policy, the reports would never have been so widely distributed. Deniers argue that evidence such as this was forged, after the end of World War Two, by people working for world Jewry. Deniers argue that evidence such as this was forged, after the end of World War Two, by people working for world Jewry. They claim that forgers created these and other documents - complete with complex internal reference markings, on typewriters that perfectly matched those used by the various German units said to have written the documents - and then planted thousands of these perfect forgeries in numerous different archival collections (in exactly the right file and in precisely the right sequence) all over Europe. Not only is such a scenario fantastically improbable, it fails to explain why these supposedly incredibly talented forgers did not succeed in producing the one piece of paper that deniers demand as 'proof' that genocide took place under the Third Reich - an order from Hitler authorising the destruction of the Jews. Top\n\nConfessions Many perpetrators confessed to what they had done during the war, after it was over. For example, Otto Ohlendorf, commander of one of the Einsatzgruppen units, testified quite openly that between June 1941 and 1942 his Einsatzgruppe murdered 90,000 people. Deniers dismiss confessions by German perpetrators that a 'Final Solution' to the 'Jewish question' was indeed a part of the Nazi programme - by saying the confessions were produced under torture. They say that those who confessed knew their admissions would result in a death sentence, so would not have confessed except under duress - and that their accounts of their wartime activities should thus be disregarded. This, however, ignores the fact that some of the more detailed confessions were written after the perpetrators had been sentenced to death. It also ignores the fact that many of the perpetrators described - sometimes in great detail - what happened, but insisted that they either had nothing to do with it or were forced by their superiors to participate. One must marvel at the power of those supposed to be responsible for this hoax. Thus this argument fails to take into account the statements of Nazis such as the Commandant of Birkenau concentration camp, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, who described the mass murders that took place in his camp in a document written after he had been sentenced to death. It also fails to account for Adolf Eichmann who, in the memoir he wrote during his trial, spoke of the gassing of the Jews. Some deniers explain away the confessions by positing that after the war these Germans were subjected to a barrage of propaganda, and themselves become victims of the hoax. One must marvel at the power of those supposed to be responsible for this hoax. Not only did they win the cooperation of the world's greatest military and political powers, forge thousands of documents in record time without being detected, and create physical evidence attesting to an annihilation programme, but they even convinced the very people said to be a part of the hoax that it had actually happened. Top\n\nDisappearances Some deniers posit that the Jews said to have been killed under the Nazi regime actually survived the war, and succeeded in avoiding detection by going to places such as the Soviet Union or the United States. In these countries, the deniers claim, there were already so many Jews that no one noticed a couple of million more. This improbable explanation of why these people deserted their families would be hilarious, were the topic not so serious. Deniers such as Arthur Butz offer other equally fantastic explanations as to the supposed 'disappearance' of millions of Jews. Many of those who were reported killed in the war, he suggests, actually survived - but did not re-establish contact with their pre-war relatives because they were in bad marriages. After the war they found other partners, established better relationships, started a new life and failed to correct the record. This improbable explanation of why these people deserted their families would be hilarious, were the topic not so serious. The real facts are much better documented. For example, it is known that Nazis used gas buses at one point to murder Jews (eventually they abandoned this system because it was not efficient enough). This is known partly because SS-Major General Dr Harald Turner, chief of the German Administration in Serbia, wrote to Karl Wolff, chief of Heinrich Himmler's personal staff, on 11 April 1942. In the note Turner describes a 'delousing van' - the quotation marks around the word already suggest that it is a euphemism - then makes it quite clear what this means: Already some months ago, I shot dead all the Jews I could get my hands on this area, concentrated all the Jewish women and children in a camp and with the help of the SD got my hands on a 'delousing van', that in about 14 days to 4 weeks will have brought about the definitive clearing out of the camp... Additional details about these buses are to be found in a letter from Willy Just to SS Lieutenant Colonel Walter Rauff on 5 June 1942. In the letter, Just describes how a load of '97,000 have been processed'. He leaves little doubt about the nature of the load, when he writes about it pushing against the door as a result of 'fear aroused by the darkness'. Just also offers Rauff a series of suggestions on how the vans might be improved. Since there was a problem of 'off-road manoeuvrability', he suggests that the cargo area be reduced. This would make the operation more efficient, because '... were the cargo area smaller, but fully occupied, the operation would take considerably less time, because there would be no empty space.' Deniers find it impossible to 'explain away' these kinds of documents so they generally ignore them. Top\n\nDenying Auschwitz Most of all, deniers focus on the extermination camp run by the Nazis at Auschwitz. They claim - despite overwhelming documentary and physical evidence as well as eye-witness accounts by both perpetrators and victims - that it was not an extermination camp. They ignore or try to explain away evidence that leaves no doubt as to Auschwitz's nefarious purposes. A small sample of the many pieces of documentary evidence demonstrates the far-fetched nature of their claims. Most of all, deniers focus on the extermination camp run by the Nazis at Auschwitz. Though the Germans made concerted attempts to avoid direct references to the gassings that took place in the camp, sometimes even those in the upper echelons slipped up. On 29 January 1943, for example, SS Captain Bischoff, head of the Auschwitz Central Construction Management, wrote to officials in Berlin regarding Crematorium 2, and in this letter he referred to a Vergasungskeller (gassing cellar). In the Auschwitz archives one can inspect the architectural drawings for Crematoria 4 and 5. These call for 30 x 40cm windows, through which Zyklon B was to be thrown. In February 1943 the Auschwitz Construction Office issued a work order for the 'production of 12 gas-tight doors (window shutters) approximately 30/40cm'. In Auschwitz there remain a number of decrepit 30 x 40cm window shutters. The remnants of a gas-tight seal are still visible around their edges. The handle for closing the windows is on the outside, a decidedly impractical arrangement for any room, unless one wanted to ensure that those inside could not open them. On 28 February, according to the civilian contractors' daily time-sheets, the gas-tight shutters were installed. A time-sheet dated 2 March 1943, and submitted by the contractor for work on Crematorium 4, mentions a 'concrete floor in gas chamber'. These documents indicate that by March 1943 workers officially designated a room in Crematorium 4 a 'gas chamber'.' The drawings, work order, time-sheets, and remaining windows constitute a simple but stunning example of the confluence of evidence concerning the gassing of prisoners at the camp. Deniers also claim that the gas chambers were actually delousing chambers or morgues. But the documentary evidence proves this a bogus claim. In a letter dated 31 March, Bischoff refers to a 'gas [tight] door' for Crematorium 2, which was to be fitted with a rubberised sealing strip and a peephole for inspection. The deniers fail to explain why a door for a delousing chamber or morgue would need a peephole. Another claim is that the gas chambers were air-raid shelters. This argument ignores the fact that these supposed shelters were too small to house the camp inmates, and were over a kilometer away from where the guards were quartered - a decidedly silly arrangement if these shelters were meant to protect them. Furthermore, the doors had a metal grille over the peephole on the inside of the door - to protect the glass from being broken from within - exactly the opposite of where it would be were it the door for an air-raid shelter. And indeed there were proper one- or two-person air-raid shelters for guards around the camp. They are still visible at the perimeter of Birkenau. Most importantly, to support their position, deniers also have to ignore testimony given by perpetrators such as Hans Stark, a member of the Auschwitz 'Gestapo.' At his trial Stark described the killing process. As early as autumn 1941 gassings were carried out in a room...[which] held 200 to 250 people, had a higher than average ceiling, no windows, only a specially insulated door with bolts like those of an airtight door [Luftschutzer]. The room had a flat roof, which allowed daylight in through the openings. It was through these openings that Zyklon B in granular form would be poured. Stark told the court that, because the Zyklon B '... was in granular form, it trickled down over the people as it was being poured in. They then started to cry out terribly for they now knew what was happening to them.' Top\n\nEvidence In February 1943 Auschwitz camp building authorities complained to Topf, the company that built the crematoria equipment, that they needed ventilation blowers 'most urgently'. Why the urgency, if this was an air-raid shelter, morgue, or delousing chamber? There is no reputable evidence that affirms the deniers' claims. Deniers hypothesise that the urgency was a result of official fears that the camp would be hit with a typhus epidemic, which would cause a tremendous spike in the death toll. Without the proper ventilation system, the crematoria would not be able to operate. Deniers try to bolster their argument about the typhus by pointing to documents which show that at this point in time the planned monthly incineration rate of Auschwitz had been boosted to 120,000 bodies. Deniers claim this was because of the typhus epidemic. However, the camp's projected population was 150,000. For the deniers' explanation to make sense, in one month an epidemic would have to kill four-fifths of Auschwitz's population and the Germans would have to repopulate the camp with 120,000 people. This claim exceeded the absolute worst case epidemiological scenario. On 6 March 1943, one of the civilian employees working on the construction of Crematorium 2 referred to the air extraction system of 'Auskleidekeller [undressing cellar] 2'. No normal morgue could require an undressing room, particularly one that was 50 yards long. In that same month, there were at least four additional references to Auskleidekeller. It is telling that civilians who, according to the deniers, were in Birkenau to work on underground morgues, repeatedly referred not to morgues but to the ventilation of the 'undressing cellars'. In the same letter the employee asked about preheating the areas that would be used as the gas chamber. If these were morgues they should be cooled, not preheated. Heating a gas chamber, on the other hand, would speed the gassing process by more quickly vaporising the gas from the Zyklon B. A letter dated 31 March 1943, regarding Crematorium 3, spoke of it as having a Gast\u00fcr, a gas door. Deniers argue that this could mean many things. But the inventory attached to the handover documents for the crematorium states that it had a Gasdichtet\u00fcr, a 'gas-tight door'. One might argue about the meaning of Gast\u00fcr, but it is hard to squabble over a gas-tight door. Deniers have said for years that physical evidence is lacking because they have seen no holes in the roof of the Birkenau gas chamber where the Zyklon was poured in. (In some of the gas chambers the Zyklon B was poured in through the roof, while in others it was thrown in through the windows.) The roof was dynamited at war's end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper. Their location in the concrete matches with eyewitness testimony, aerial photos from 1944, and a ground photo from 1943. The physical evidence shows unmistakably that the Zyklon holes were cast into the concrete when the building was constructed. There is much additional evidence affirming Auschwitz/Birkenau's role as a killing centre. There is no reputable evidence that affirms the deniers' claims. Top\n\nDiary of Anne Frank Deniers have repeatedly attacked the authenticity of the famous Diary of Anne Frank, which tells of the young Jewish author's experiences as she and her family hid from Nazi persecution in Holland. It seems they believe that by creating doubts about this popular book, which is often a young person's first encounter with the literature of the Holocaust, they can generate broader doubts about the Holocaust itself. Their attacks on the diary became so widespread, that eventually the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, the archives to which Anne's father left the work, subjected the glue, paper and ink of the diary to extensive forensic tests. They found them all to be from the 1940s. The investigators compared Anne's handwriting in the diary to other samples of her writing, including letters she wrote before going into hiding, and traditional student autograph books she signed before the war. The tests found the handwriting to be that of the same person. In fact, every test to which the diary was subjected proved that this was a genuine World War Two era work by a teenager. Deniers also argue that there are multiple versions of the Diary of Anne Frank. Deniers also argue that there are multiple versions of the Diary of Anne Frank. This, they claim, proves it is a fraud. Actually, there are multiple versions of the diary, and Anne herself explains why this is so. In 1944, a Dutch government official, broadcasting from London, urged the population to save eyewitness accounts of their wartime experience, including memorabilia and diaries. Hearing this, Anne, decided to rewrite some of the entries. She also used her diary as a basis for a novel, The Annexe. Hence the different versions. Deniers also make the claim that the diary is in green ballpoint pen, something that was not readily available during the war. And there are, in fact, some minor stylistic marginal notes in green ink. However, as the Dutch investigation demonstrated, the only ballpoint writing is on two scraps of paper included among the loose leaves, and these have no significance whatsoever in terms of content. Moreover, the handwriting on the scraps of paper differs markedly from those in the diary, indicating that they were written by someone else, an editor perhaps. The final result of the Dutch investigation was a critical 712-page edition of the diary containing the original version, Anne's edited copy, and the published version as well as the experts' findings. While some may argue that the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation used an elephant to swat a fly, once again it becomes clear that the deniers glibly make claims that have no relationship to the most basic rules of truth and evidence. All this evidence, and much else, demonstrates the nature of the deniers' claims. Much of this information was entered into the High Court of Justice in London as evidence when the author of this article was sued for libel by David Irving, a man who has written many books on World War Two, a number of which deny the Holocaust. Irving sued for libel because he had been described as a Holocaust denier in one of the present author's books. He contended this was not true, because his claims about the Holocaust were correct. The judge in the case, Judge Gray, however, found Irving, who introduced virtually all of the standard denial arguments into his submission, to be indeed a Holocaust denier. Dismissing Irving's claims that the gas chambers were an impossibility, the judge noted that that the 'cumulative effect of the documentary evidence for the genocidal operation of the gas chambers' was not only 'considerable' but 'mutually corroborative'. Judge Gray, who found the eyewitness and documentary evidence to be 'striking[ly]... consistent', concluded that 'no objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt' the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, which were used on a substantial scale to kill Jews. He found Irving's arguments - and by extension the claims of deniers in general - to be 'perverse and egregious'. Furthermore, the judge said that Irving had 'significantly misrepresented what the evidence, objectively examined, reveals'. (For the complete judgement, the daily transcripts, and the expert witness reports see www.hdot.org - the link is given below.) Holocaust denial is a form of virulent anti-Semitism. But it is not only that. It is also an attack on reasoned inquiry and inconvenient history. If this history can be denied any history can be denied. Holocaust deniers have, thus far, been decidedly unsuccessful in convincing the broader public of their claims - although many people worry that after the last of the Holocaust survivors has died (most are now in their 80s) deniers will achieve greater success. However, historians, carefully relying on a broad array of documentary and material evidence, a small sample of which is mentioned in this article, can and already have demonstrated that Holocaust denial is a tissue of lies.

Upon the news of his death on January 28, 2022, we are re-surfacing our earlier coverage.\n\nIn October 1981, Judge Thomas Johnson made an announcement. After deliberation, he had accepted a fact into judicial notice\u2014a legal term for a fact accepted in a court as true without the need to produce evidence. The Holocaust, said Johnson, was an indisputable fact.\n\nThe pronouncement seems slightly ludicrous given the weight of evidence that has emerged since the extent of Hitler\u2019s \u201cFinal Solution\u201d was revealed at the end of World War II. But for the plaintiff in the case, Mel Mermelstein, it was nothing less than a triumph\u2014a critical moment in a decades-long struggle to tell the world that what he experienced in the Holocaust happened.\n\nIn 1944, Mermelstein, then 17 years old, was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was not alone: Despite the attempts of Hungarian Regent Mikl\u00f3s Horthy to prevent it, the deportation of Hungary\u2019s Jews to camps kicked off within weeks of Germany\u2019s occupation of the country in spring of that year.\n\nFour years earlier, Adolf Hitler annexed Mermelstein\u2019s hometown, Munkacs, Czechoslovakia, to Hungary as part of the Munich Agreement. Germany and Hungary were ostensibly allies, but Horthy, despite being a self-described anti-Semite, was never fully committed to the Nazi war effort.\n\nHorthy\u2019s government passed discriminatory laws, including ones that limited the number of Jewish university students and outlawed sex between Jewish and non-Jewish Hungarians.* But though he made daily life even more difficult for Jews, at least it wasn\u2019t deadly. Until the end. Horthy defied Hitler\u2019s orders to deport Jews for slaughter\u2014a reason why, on March 19, 1944, the German army invaded and occupied Hungary. His crime, Horthy told a friend, was that \u201cI have not fulfilled Hitler\u2019s wish, and have not allowed the Jews to be massacred.\u201d\n\nNazi SS leader Adolf Eichmann, often called the \u201cArchitect of the Holocaust,\u201d arrived to oversee the deportations of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau soon after the occupation. The first transports reached the death camp on May 2, and for two months, four trains brought some 12,000 Jews every day. Horthy halted the deportations in July 11, but only after 437,000 Jews were sent to perish. Between ten and 15 percent were put to work; the rest were murdered. During that stretch of 1944, Birkenau hit peak killing efficiency as more than a million people were killed, including 850,000 Jews.\n\nIn the last conversation he ever had with his father, Prisoner A-4685 described the horrific fate that befell his family.\n\n\u201cYour mother and sisters are\u2026\u201d He paused a moment, unable to go on. \u201cAnd you must not torture your minds about their fate. Yes, yes. Look! There!\u201d And he pointed to the flaming chimneys. The vision of mother, Etu and Magda being burned alive made me feel faint. My head began to spin. I wouldn\u2019t accept it. I wanted to run, but where? I started to rise, but father laid a restraining hand on me. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll happen to us, too,\u201d he added quietly. Then more firmly he said, \u201cBut if we stay apart, at least one of us will live to tell.\u201d\n\nMermelstein was the only one in his family to survive the Holocaust. He recounted his experiences in the 1979 memoir By Bread Alone. Not long after the book\u2019s publication, Mel would live to tell his story again\u2014this time, in Johnson\u2019s court, as he and lawyer William John Cox took on a group of Holocaust deniers who dared Mermelstein to prove the Holocaust happened at all.\n\n\u201cI would not let them get away with it,\u201d Mermelstein, 91, said via e-mail.\n\n***\n\nMermelstein\u2019s long journey to becoming a public witness to Nazi inhumanity began in January 1945. He was one of the 60,000 Jews set forth on the infamous death marches. Over three weeks, Mermelstein and 3,200 other prisoners walked roughly 155 miles from Auschwitz-Birkenau to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in the savage Polish winter. It\u2019s estimated a mere ten percent survived. To keep going, Mermelstein took a pair of shoes off a warm corpse, a recent shooting victim on the wayside whose body hadn\u2019t frozen yet.\n\nFrom Gross-Rosen, Mermelstein was packed onto a train for three days and nights\u2014without food or water\u2014and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. He arrived in February, stricken with typhus and weighing 68 pounds. He was shunted to the predominantly Jewish \u201cLittle Camp\u201d section, a series of barns built for 450 that were filled with more than 10,000 sick, dying, emaciated prisoners. The hunger he experienced there, he said, was \u201cvicious torture \u2026by bread and bread alone.\u201d\n\nAfter two months, on April 11, Buchenwald was liberated by U.S. forces. The next day, Generals Dwight Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, and George Patton toured Ohrdruf, a subcamp of the larger concentration camp and found 3,200 naked bodies in shallow graves, some showing evidence of cannibalism. Three days later, Eisenhower cabled General George C. Marshall asking for members of Congress and journalists to visit the liberated camps to report the atrocities to the American people.\n\n\u201cI visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that \u2018the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda\u2019\u201d Eisenhower wrote in his 1948 memoir Crusade in Europe, presaging the Holocaust denial Mermelstein would fight head-on more than three decades later.\n\nAfter a few weeks of recuperation, Mermelstein returned to Munkacs, but the 18-year-old quickly realized all of his immediate family was gone. His household obliterated, Mermelstein decided to leave Europe. About the only thing he kept was a box of family photos, which had been safeguarded by a friend. During his travels, Mermelstein would say the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, every chance he got.\n\nMel knew he had an Uncle Adolf and an Aunt Florence in the United States. He didn\u2019t know them well, but it was enough to begin anew. On August 31, 1946, he arrived in New York harbor aboard the SS Marine Perch.\n\n\u201cDad didn\u2019t speak English, but he had a great ability for languages and picked it up quickly,\u201d says Edie Mermelstein, Mel\u2019s daughter. \u201cHe was also fluent in Hungarian, Czechoslovakian, Hebrew, Russian, Polish, Yiddish, so he was able to get a job at the United Nations.\u201d\n\nMel worked for a number of years in New York City. Along the way, he fell in love and married Jane Nance. The couple didn\u2019t want to raise a family in Manhattan, so they headed out west and settled in Long Beach, California. In 1965, Mel started a manufacturing company that makes wooden pallets, and is still in operation today.\n\nOwning a successful family business gave Mermelstein the resources to travel overseas and begin building his personal collection of Holocaust-related artifacts. At first, he didn\u2019t speak publicly about his concerns that the world would forget the slaughter of the Jews. In 1967, the Six-Day War stirred him to action. \u201cI saw [Egyptian President Gamal Abdel] Nasser shaking his fists and saying he was going to drive the Jews into the sea,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. \u201cIt reminded me of Hitler.\u201d\n\nFrom then on, the Holocaust was omnipresent in the Mermelstein household.\n\n\u201cI grew up with the Holocaust. As a child, my father took me to a screening of Night and Fog at the public library he was hosting,\u201d says Edie, 54. \u201cNo second-grader should see a movie filled with actual Nazi footage, but Dad was never afraid to talk about it. Confronting the Holocaust became his mission.\u201d\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, Mermelstein repeatedly returned to the extermination camps \u2014more than 40 times. He always brought back objects to the Auschwitz Study Foundation, the Huntington Beach-based nonprofit he started in 1975. Mermelstein was an Indiana Jones-type, crossing the Atlantic to visit the camps and (with the blessing of the employees overseeing the grounds) take home various artifacts including light posts, barbed wire, Zyklon B canisters, human teeth and bone fragments, and bricks caked with ash. Mermelstein even found personal evidence: a photograph of himself in the barracks with a group of starving men and pieces of the oven where his mother and sister were cremated.\n\nHe didn\u2019t sport a wool fedora and leather coat a la Harrison Ford; he was more a swashbuckling figure in the spirit of a dapper Graham Greene, bounding through the 20th century\u2019s most notorious death chambers in three-piece suits, a trench coat and plaid blazer.\n\n\u201cDad was a badass,\u201d says Edie. \u201cHe fearlessly went back to Eastern Europe again and again.\u201d In 1978, she accompanied her father on a trip to Auschwitz where he put an entire concrete post in a wheeled suitcase. When he was stopped by Hungarian officials, he showed them his tattoos and was allowed to keep the artifact.\n\nMermelstein built a private 1,000-square-foot museum in the back of his lumber plant and started speaking to schools, synagogues, and community groups. As this was years before the Simon Wiesenthal Center was founded, the film Shoah was released, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was opened, his mission was a solitary, under-the-national-radar one. It was his 1979 memoir, By Bread Alone, that made him the target of rabid hatemongers.\n\n***\n\nIn June 1960, a right-wing activist named Willis Carto went to a San Francisco jail to interview Francis Yockey, publisher of a monthly bulletin titled Right, who was being held for passport fraud. Despite serving briefly as a post-trial review attorney on the Nuremberg trials, Yockey was a rabid anti-Semite. In 1948, under the pseudonym Ulick Varanage, he had written Imperium, a book dedicated to Adolf Hitler, \u201cthe hero of the second World War,\u201d calling for the racially pure Nordic race to dominate Europe and for their Aryan-American brethren to follow in totalitarian suit. In Imperium, Jews are the \u201cCulture Distorter\u201d who caused the Nazi failure.\n\nCarto was transfixed by Yockey and gained cachet amongst anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists as the last man to see their idol alive. Not long after Carto\u2019s visit, Yockey killed himself with a cyanide pill.\n\nTheir meeting would be deeply influential to Carto, who had been associated with various fringe groups since the 1950s. In 1958, he founded his own political organization, the Liberty Lobby, and remained active in extreme-right ideological circles throughout his life. He began publishing anti-Semitic books such as The Inequality of the Races, Teutonic Unity, and Carto\u2019s favorite, Imperium, with a fawning new introduction in which he called Yockey prophetic.\n\nCarto\u2019s book publishing was the backbone for his big picture project, making Holocaust revisionism seem as legitimate as possible. In 1978, he founded the Institute for Historical Review to spread its self-described \u201crevisionist\u201d view of the Holocaust through a glossy journal and conferences with like-minded \u201chistorians.\u201d The IHR put forth a variety of so-called experts and evidence in service of the message that there was no Nazi genocide of European Jews. It used conspiracy theories, like questioning the ability of the ovens at Auschwitz-Birkenau to burn as many bodies as claimed, to try and give the organization the outward appearance of honest, on-the-level, \u201cjust asking questions\u201d skepticism.\n\n\u201cIt has to be recognized that at the heart of Holocaust denial, or any Jewish conspiracy theory, is anti-Semitism,\u201d says Deborah Lipstadt, professor of Modern Jewish Studies and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and the author of numerous books including The Eichmann Trial and Denying the Holocaust, the first book-length investigation of the subject. \u201cIf you\u2019re a dyed-in-the-wool anti-Semite who believes Jews are evil people who control the world, then you\u2019ll believe anything. So if someone says Jews made it all up to get global sympathy, you\u2019ll buy it. The conspiracy reinforces their anti-Semitic, or racist, world view.\u201d\n\nIn 1979, the IHR held its first International Revisionist Convention in Los Angeles and followed up the conference with a provocative offer: a $50,000 reward for anyone who could prove Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust. Carto and his associates assumed nobody would take them up on the offer. The failure to get a response would in turn prove the IHR\u2019s \u201catrocity propaganda\u201d thesis, which they would then use as a way to get into academic circles. If Holocaust denial were to become a field, IHR\u2019s members wanted to be the leaders.\n\nA year later, Mel Mermelstein became aware of the IHR and its efforts. He responded with indignant letters to local newspapers\u2014IHR headquarters was in nearby Torrance, California\u2014and The Jerusalem Post. As a comeback, , the IHR began to taunt Mermelstein. William David McCalden, the IHR\u2019s director, wrote him a letter under an assumed name: Lewis Brandon, daring Mermelstein to try and claim the reward. If Mermelstein didn\u2019t respond, the IHR would draw its own conclusions and report its findings to the mass media. There was just one caveat: The evidence Mermelstein presented must be brought before a U.S. criminal court and not the Nuremberg Trials.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t stop harassing my father. They sent him hair in the mail and said his parents were alive and living under assumed names in Israel,\u201d says Edie. \u201cDad was incensed, so he went to a lot of established Jewish organizations and they told him to leave it alone.\u201d The taunts only fueled Mermelstein\u2019s outrage, she recalls. \u201cThere was no way he was going to live with being smeared.\u201d\n\nFollowing the dictum to never forget, Mermelstein decided he had to do something. In November 1980, he enlisted Long Beach attorney William John Cox, who took the case on a pro bono basis. The partnership would have significant historical ramifications. Mermelstein\u2019s doggedness in suing the IHR coupled with Cox\u2019s crafty interpretation of the law would change Holocaust scholarship for good.\n\n***\n\n\u201cI had never handled a civil case, but I certainly respected what Mel was doing,\u201d says Cox, 77, from his California home. \u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t take it, they would try to discredit his life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nAt first, Cox, who had a long history of quixotic campaigns in the public interest, including a tongue-in-cheek 1980 presidential campaign, thought his new client didn\u2019t have any viable options. There was no defamatory statement against Mermelstein to refute, just an offer to prove the Holocaust existed. Had Mermelstein ignored the letter and the IHR called him a liar, that could have been considered defamation. But no false statements about Mermelstein existed, and since the 1964 Supreme Court Sullivan v. New York Times ruling, the bar for establishing standing in libel or slander cases has been high.\n\nAfter their initial meeting, an idea came to Cox in his sleep. He awoke remembering the 1818 English case of Adams v. Lindsell. It established the \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d which states that an acceptance of an offer is considered valid as soon as it is dropped in the mail. The mailbox rule happens to be the law of California. By accepting the IHR\u2019s offer, Mermelstein could later file a lawsuit for breach of contract against the organization in a local superior court.\n\nCox expected the case to wrap up in a few weeks. It wouldn\u2019t.\n\nOn December 18, 1980, Cox sent Brandon and the IHR a completed questionnaire and claim for $50,000, along with a three-page declaration of Mermelstein\u2019s experiences at Auschwitz and a copy of By Bread Alone. A month later, Brandon replied saying he was \u201cdeliberating,\u201d then he sent another letter, asserting that the IHR was instead going to deal with another claim to the $50,000\u2014that of famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, not Mel Mermelstein. Cox had nailed it. The IHR breached their contract.\n\nHis next play was a stroke of legal genius. \u201cSomething was missing,\u201d Cox later wrote in his memoir The Holocaust Case: Defeat of Denial. The lie about the Holocaust was so blatant, wrote Cox, that it should be a separate issue than a mere civil wrong, or tort.\n\n\u201cThe thought occurred to me that such a fact would have to be so well-known that a court would be required to take judicial notice. One of the oldest precepts of English common law, judicial notice is based on the premise \u2018that which is known need not be proven.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn essence, Cox was saying nobody has to prove that the sun rises in the east. Mermelstein filed suit against the IHR and included a cause of action titled \u201cInjurious Denial of Established Fact.\u201d It required the established fact of the Holocaust to be judicially noticed as a matter of law.\n\n\u201cBill was thinking outside the box,\u201d says Edie. \u201cIt was like getting a Mafia don on tax evasion.\u201d\n\nIt wasn't easy to pin down the IHR during the discovery phase. Carto had decamped to Washington D.C., so Cox hired two retired homicide detectives to track his whereabouts. Carto was served on a D.C. sidewalk, but never showed for his deposition. Brandon, however, did. He\u2019d been fired by Carto for making the \u201cunauthorized\u201d reward in the first place. He threw Carto under the train, saying his boss knew there was no evidence to refute Mermelstein, the offer was a publicity gimmick, and they had no intention of ever paying up.\n\nAnxious for a ruling, Cox filed a pretrial motion for summary judgment. In preparation, his tiny legal team sought out preeminent historians to strengthen and deepen their argument. Cox himself made late night phone calls to Wiesenthal in Austria and Gideon Hauser, prosecutor of Adolf Eichmann, in Israel. Over time, the file of supporting evidence grew to over three-feet tall.\n\nEven if it seemed like an open-and-shut case, though, Cox began having nightmares as the court date drew closer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a scene in Marathon Man where the Dr. Mengele character is in New York City, in the jewelry district, and all of these survivors begin to recognize him,\u201d he says. \u201cThey start running after him, yelling at him as he runs away. The week before this case, I had a dream like that. I\u2019m in the city after defeat. Everywhere I go, Jews are chasing me, screaming \u2018Six million victims and you lost the case!\u2019 I was afraid the judge would set aside all of our motions and we\u2019d head to trial with nothing.\u201d\n\nOctober 9, 1981, was Cox and Mermelstein\u2019s moment. As Cox stood before Judge Johnson, he laid out his case for the Injurious Denial of Established Fact. The IHR had \u201cslapped the plaintiff Mel Mermelstein in the face with this great lie,\u201d he noted. \u201cWhere did the babies [of Auschwitz] go, Your Honor?\u2026Where did the children go? They were not subject to labor\u2026.they were not there. They were put to death.\u201d\n\nJudge Johnson accepted the judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at Auschwitz. Then he went even further and declared the Holocaust an indisputable fact.\n\n\u201cA judge, an American judge, stood up and said \u2018Yes, the Holocaust is not subject to dispute,\u2019\u201d Mermelstein recounted via email. \u201cThat moment stands out in my mind. Now and forever after, the judicial notice stands.\u201d\n\nWith that notice on the books, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Wenke wouldn\u2019t allow any evidence claiming the Holocaust never happened. The case itself wouldn\u2019t wrap up until July 1985, when a settlement was reached ending Mermelstein\u2019s civil suit against the IHR. The Holocaust deniers agreed to pay Mermelstein the $50,000 prize, an additional $50,000 in damages, and to issue a letter of apology.\n\nBy the time of the settlement, Mermelstein was represented by future celebrity attorney Gloria Allred. Shortly after Cox\u2019s tort was accepted, he closed his office and moved on. The year he spent working with Mermelstein had taken its toll. His pro bono work left him heavily in debt, setting him back $45,000. Emotionally, it was even harder. After the case, Cox had to deal with intimidation and threats of violence. One anonymous late-night caller told him they just poured gasoline under his front door, and Carto filed a declaration personally calling out Cox and mentioning a loaded gun.\n\nAlthough vindication was sweet, it wasn\u2019t easy on the Mermelstein family either. \u201cLitigation always takes its toll,\u201d says Edie. \u201cThere was a lot of tension in the house.\u201d\n\nThe case garnered a lot of media attention and was recreated in the 1991 TNT movie Never Forget, starring Leonard Nimoy, in his first non-Spock role in five years, as Mermelstein and Dabney Coleman as Cox. The film was nominated for a cable ACE award for best picture. Mel was proud, Edie thought it was well done, and Cox\u2026well, a little too Hollywood for his tastes. He liked the courtroom scenes though; his personal director\u2019s cut is on YouTube.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 35 years since Mermelstein heard a judge declare the Holocaust was real and its deniers are frauds. Sadly, the big lie persists and has gained steam in the digital age. A 2015 poll found that 20 percent of Americans believe \u201cJews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nThe hardcore deniers may now go by the softer \u201calt-right\u201d designation, but leaders like Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler are peddling the same anti-Semitic tropes as Carto did in his day. Emboldened white supremacists are resurfacing, most notoriously at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where protester Heather Heyer was mowed down and killed by a Nazi sympathizer. Multiple avowed Nazis and Holocaust deniers are running for public office. Even the Institute for Historical Review continues publishing in the 21st-century.\n\nThere will always be those who claim that there weren't 1.1 million people, 960,000 of them Jews, murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Cox and Mermelstein showed the best defense is to take the sewer rats head on.\n\n\u201cMel Mermelstein is important because he fought back against the bullies,\u201d says Lipstadt. (Denial, a film based on her book History on Trial starring Rachel Weisz and Tom Wilkinson, was released in 2016.) He basically said \u2018You people don\u2019t scare me,\u2019 and then hoisted them from their own petard. I did the same thing when I beat David Irving in a British court. He sued me for libel for calling him a Holocaust denier, but we proved he was falsifying history through historical and scientific evidence.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Irving has been a featured speaker at multiple IHR events and his books are featured on their website\u2019s homepage.\n\nMermelstein\u2019s health is fading, but he outlived his antagonist. Willis Carto died in 2015 at 89, his commitment to denying the Holocaust as strong as ever.\n\nDespite the horrors of his youth, Mermelstein has had a long, happy life. Jane is alive and well at 82; they celebrated 58 years together in March. After 53 years, he\u2019s in the process of winding down his pallet manufacturing company. It\u2019s housed the Auschwitz Study Foundation since it opened in 1972, and the Mermelstein family\u2019s current aim is to keep it out of storage. Edie is working with Erin Grunwell, founder of the Freedom Writers Foundation, on raising funds for an Orange County Holocaust Museum to house the collection. She recently put together a video tour of his father\u2019s true life work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Yad Vashem in Israel, the Holocaust Museums in D.C., the Museum of Tolerance here in L.A\u2026.My father's collection is different,\u201d says Edie. \u201cIt\u2019s guttural. It evokes a deep emotional response and leaves a lasting impression. It\u2019s amazing to watch the reaction of the kids when dad explains that he was in Auschwitz at their age. He believes education is the key and wants [kids] to look the demon in the eye.\u201d\n\nMel Mermelstein may not know how much time he has left, but he is comforted knowing he fulfilled his promise. He lived to tell.\n\n\u201cI honored my father, mother, brother and two sisters. There are so few of us still alive. I made a big impact for the survivors.\u201d\n\n*Editor's Note, August 28, 2018: A previous version of this article implied that Jews living in pre-war Hungary were not Hungarians, when, of course, they were.

It\u2019s a legend.\u201d Irving had written a book in 1977 called Hitler\u2019s War that attempted to rehabilitate the reputation of the F\u00fchrer. Since then, he had begun giving talks to groups who were \u2013 if we are being extremely generous \u2013 skeptical of the Holocaust. Later in his speech, undoubtedly with a naughty-boy relish, Irving slyly mused that \u201cin fact\u2026more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy\u2019s car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber at Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\n\nI assume that people laughed at this. It seems the kind of well-polished bon mot that Irving\u2019s audiences would find terribly witty. In 21st century internet terms, it almost seems mild. When I see things like this, I take a deep breath and remember that the world is full of assholes.\n\n\n\nProfessor Deborah Lipstadt responded differently. In 1993 she wrote Denying the Holocaust, devoting several hundred words to Irving and his craft. She went beyond merely calling him a jackass, which is where my focus would have been. Instead, she accused him, among other things, of distorting evidence, manipulating documents, and generally altering the historical record to suit his crypto-fascist purposes.\n\n\n\nIn 1995, Irving sued Lipstadt in Great Britain where the burden is on the defendant to prove the truth of their allegedly libelous statements. (In America, where slander and libel laws must contend with the First Amendment, the burden is on the plaintiff. At least for now). History on Trial is Lipstadt\u2019s account of that trial, which resulted in a resounding victory for her.\n\n\n\nThis is a book I liked a lot. Yet, as I reflect on it now, the first things that come to mind are criticisms. To the point that I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d recommend it.\n\n\n\nThe problem, I think, stems largely from a question of tone. Lipstadt writes in the first person, appearing as both participant and authority. Blending the subjectivity of memoir with the objectivity of history is a delicate task, and I\u2019m not sure Lipstadt nails it. She can be off-putting in her certainty, churlish even towards her own experts. Anyone who fails to agree with her instantly is given a disappointed aside. The only way to redeem yourself is to eventually adopt her point of view. Lipstadt is unremittingly glum and humorless in her outlook. Yeah, I get that the Holocaust is not a forum for laughs. But it\u2019s also helpful to have a little perspective. I kept wanting her to lighten up a bit. This is a fight about Holocaust scholarship, not the Holocaust itself. She paints herself as a victim, while at the same time describing her nice hotel in London, the fancy operas she attended, the fancier parties with the fanciest chocolates. We\u2019re not exactly talking the trials of Job. Getting sued sucks. But if you do, this is the way to do it.\n\n\n\nThe lead-up to the trial is especially grating, filled with distracting and unnecessary personal asides. I wanted more of the trial preparation aspect. Instead, Lipstadt basks in the adoration she received for fighting the good fight. During the trial, she often breaks the flow of her own narrative to interject hyperventilated responses to every twist and turn. These started to resemble the literary version of a bad soap opera reaction shot. She doesn\u2019t seem to trust that her story is good enough without her dire interpretation of the proceedings.\n\n\n\nIrving verses Lipstadt proves to be an inverse David and Goliath. That is, the bad guy \u2013 Irving \u2013 is David with a sling. Lipstadt has the high-priced legal team, famous historians like Richard Evans as high-priced experts, and the support of Penguin Publishing. All this force is arrayed against one man, acting as his own attorney. Don\u2019t get me wrong. This is Irving\u2019s fault. He filed the suit and brought it on himself. Lipstadt can\u2019t be faulted for responding Chicago-style, bringing big guns to Irving\u2019s knife fight. Moreover, Irving\u2019s hateful brand of historical misrepresentation deserves to be squashed. Still, there came a point where I felt like Lipstadt\u2019s crew was punching down.\n\n\n\nFrustratingly, Lipstadt never explain how a civil trial in Great Britain works. To be sure, she talks about the unusual burden of proof, and the specific roles of barristers verses solicitors. However, I never understood the formal presentation of evidence. In the U.S., the plaintiff presents her case, the defense gets a chance to present his, and then a judge or jury makes a decision. Here, witnesses for the plaintiff and defense seemed to be called willy-nilly, with no particular order. It almost felt like an inquisitorial, rather than adversarial process. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the explanation, or if Lipstadt rearranged trial events for a better story, or if the British use some kind of hybrid system.\n\n\n\nFinally, I didn't like Lipstadt\u2019s scorched earth tactics. She has a lot of critical remarks for people representing even mild opposition. For instance, she censures the esteemed historian John Keegan without ever attempting to see his standpoint. Meanwhile, her own strong views \u2013 such as her belief that Jews shouldn\u2019t marry non-Jews \u2013 go unexamined (except by Irving, who gloatingly notes they share some ideas).\n\n\n\nDespite this, the inherent drama of the trial itself covers a lot of sins. As a lawyer and an amateur historian (self-appointed), I found the spectacle of a judge deciding historical fact to be both fascinating and extremely troubling. Lipstadt\u2019s experts, Richard Evans, Robert Jan van Pelt, Christopher Browning, and Peter Longerich are all exceptionally smart individuals, and it is great seeing them in action, using their vast knowledge and facility with primary sources to knock aside the flimsy arguments of Holocaust deniers.\n\n\n\nEspecially riveting is Jan van Pelt\u2019s testimony on the massive confluence of evidence that proves the existence of Auschwitz\u2019s gas chambers. Irving\u2019s position, and that of many deniers, is that the buildings alleged to be gas chambers are not gas chambers at all. The reason? There are no holes for dropping in cyanide pellets. This dictum is captured in the asinine \u201cno holes, no Holocaust\u201d imbecility proffered by deniers. (There are, if I may be allowed, many holes in this logical construction). Jan van Pelt crushes Irving on this point, and it is grand.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the thing most lacking, more important than tonality, is a bit more self-reflection. This is a free speech case \u2013 it concerns Lipstadt\u2019s freedom to call a spade a spade.\n\n\n\nYet the free speech issue in this case rests on a knife\u2019s edge. I can see how it might go the other way, with unpopular historical positions being smothered, rather than debated (this was Keegan\u2019s fear). Lipstadt can\u2019t. She is too self-righteous to recognize that when you start saying a historical event is an objective truth, not subject to examination, testing, and reinterpretation, that you chill scholarship. This is why so many people were uncomfortable with her case, even though Irving started it, and Lipstadt obviously had to respond for both professional and fiduciary reasons.\n\n\n\nThe Holocaust happened. It is the most heavily documented crime in history. There are videos, photographs, documents, the remains of concentration camps. There are confessions, memoirs, diaries, and letters. There are thousands of eyewitnesses, both perpetrator and victim, who have left accounts. There is the rent torn in the fabric of the universe, the result of millions of innocent people murdered. Anyone who tries to deny the essence of this has something dark within their soul.\n\n\n\nThere are all kinds in this world. There are those who believe that 9/11 was an inside job, meant to spur a Middle Eastern war. There are those who will tell you that the 20 children butchered in their elementary school less than two weeks before Christmas never existed, their deaths \u2013 their very lives \u2013 a hoax to spur gun control. They will tell you that Hitler lived only to serve the Jews.\n\n\n\nThis is a tough crowd. I sympathize with Lipstadt\u2019s contempt for Irving and his disciples. But the fight is not entirely hopeless.\n\n\n\nThe holes, you see. The holes at Auschwitz that were always there because the gas chambers were there, these holes were found by a man named Charlie Provan. He was a Holocaust denier who\u2019d been told the facts were not factual, were to the contrary ridiculous and impossible. Provan read a manuscript by an SS man named Kurt Gerstein. He once claimed that seven to eight hundred Jews were packed into a death-room of 25 square meters. Deniers cried nonsense! Gerstein was clearly lying; therefore, according to denier logic, it was turtles all the way down. But Charlie wasn\u2019t sure. So Charlie had his kids strip to their skivvies, made them huddle together, measured the space they took up, and then used math to determine that yes, it was possible. Later, he went to Auschwitz and found the damn holes. He also discovered the Holocaust. Heck, there are rumors that even Irving acknowledges the death chambers at Auschwitz, though he\u2019ll minimize them to the end.\n\n\n\nThe truth will out.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-irving", "page_content": "But since the 1980s, he has cultivated a reputation as the world's most prominent Holocaust denier, a status he cemented by suing Penguin Books and American scholar Deborah Lipstadt for libel in 2000 after Lipstadt wrote that he was a denier and a pro-Nazi ideologue. In a dramatic judgment, Irving lost his case and most of the considerable amount of money he made over the years selling his books. That, and his 2006 stint in an Austrian prison for denying the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, have made Irving a hero in extremist circles. Any reputation he once had as a real \"historian\" has been wrecked.\n\nIn his own words\n\n\"I don't think there was any overall Reich policy to kill the Jews.

Irving had left the country by the time the warrants were issued. In 1992, a German court found Irving guilty of Holocaust denial under the Auschwitzl\u00fcge (Auschwitz lie/Holocaust denial) section of the law against Volksverhetzung (stirring up the populace through hatemongering). Irving was subsequently barred from entering Germany. The same year, he was barred from entering Australia due to his Holocaust denial activities. In 1994, Irving served 10 days of a three-month sentence at London's Petonville prison for contempt of court. Six years later, in 2004, Irving was barred from entering New Zealand due to his Holocaust denial activities. The next year, he was jailed in Austria on the 1989 warrant for trivializing the Holocaust in two speeches after he illegally sneaked into the country to give yet another speech. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the 1989 charges and was sentenced to three years in prison. That sentence was reduced on appeal in 2006 to time served (13 months) and Irving was deported to the United Kingdom.\n\nBackground\n\nDavid Irving grew up in Essex County, England, in what he described as \"very reduced circumstances.\" His father, a commander in the Royal Navy and author of several books concerning naval history and life, separated from his mother when Irving was a small child. According to a description of his personal background that he wrote for his lawyer in 1969, Irving was proud of his family's service history, stating that a photo of his father reviewing the troops with King George VI (1895-1952) was one of his most prized possessions.\n\nThough Irving never earned a degree, he took courses at Imperial College in London and cut his teeth as a journalist editing Phoenix, the college magazine. He then moved on to The Carnival Times, the London University newspaper, where he began to gain notoriety for his highly conservative views on apartheid in South Africa, and for an accusation that the British press was owned and operated by Jews.\n\nIn 1963, at the age of 25, Irving published The Destruction of Dresden, which dealt with the Allied bombing raids on the German city and was written at a time when British interest in the raids was high. The book gained Irving a reputation as a World War II historian and became an international bestseller, even though Irving's figures for the death toll \u2014 100,000-250,000 on first printing, adjusted down to 50,000-100,000 in later versions \u2014 were widely questioned. It was later revealed in court that Irving had based his figures on the word of Dresden's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, who himself said that he was just repeating rumors.\n\nIrving has written some 30 books on World War II, most of which tell the German side of the war. His most famous and most controversial book is Hitler's War (1977), a two-part biography describing the war from Hitler's point of view. The book was controversial primarily because Irving claimed that Hitler had no knowledge of the Holocaust. (The book did tacitly admit that the Holocaust had actually occurred, a position Irving would later repudiate.)\n\nThough leading World War II historians such as John Keegan and Hugh Trevor-Roper praised the book (aside from its claim of Hitler's ignorance of the Holocaust), others began to view Irving as a \"creative historian\" and to question his methods. In response to his subsequent book, The Trail of the Fox, a biography of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, British historian David Pryce-Jones accused Irving of blindly accepting anything Hitler had to say, while applying the strictest standards of suspicion to other sources, notably those with a pro-Allied slant.\n\nThough Irving's later works were received with increasing criticism and skepticism by established historians, he still enjoyed considerable financial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, even taking a flat in London's prestigious Mayfair district and driving a Rolls-Royce. He began to tackle with less success subjects other than the Third Reich, such as a biography of Winston Churchill that essentially painted Churchill as a reckless warmonger, and Uprising!, a book that portrayed the 1956 Hungarian revolt as \"primarily anti-Jewish.\" Irving's increasingly obvious anti-Semitism drew more and more scrutiny of the validity of his work, with the result that he was progressively isolated from the academic historical community.\n\nIn 1983, Irving played a major role in the \"Hitler Diaries\" controversy. Initially, he claimed that the supposed diaries were forgeries and crashed the press conference held by Der Stern magazine to publicize them. But a week later, Irving reversed his position. (Many believe he changed his view because the alleged diaries contained no mention of the Holocaust, thus buttressing Irving's argument in Hitler's War.) Later, when the diaries were definitively shown to be fakes, Irving described himself as vindicated, although many pointed out that he had only briefly held that position. The entire affair further damaged Irving's credibility as any kind of scholar.\n\nThat may have helped push Irving toward explicitly radical-right groups. During the same year as the diaries controversy, Irving began to speak at meetings of the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), a party classified as \"right-wing extremist\" by West Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Also in 1983, Irving gave a talk in Los Angeles for the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a group dedicated to disproving the Holocaust. At the time, Irving maintained that there were liquidations of Jews and other minorities conducted by high-ranking Nazi officers, but that these executions were carried out without Hitler's knowledge or consent. This drew a challenge from Robert Faurisson, a prominent French Holocaust denier and IHR member who rejected Irving's claims about Hitler's non-involvement, instead claiming that no Holocaust ever took place. Faurisson did not convince Irving, whose own epiphany, \"realizing\" there was no Holocaust, came later, during the 1988 trial of Ernst Zundel, a Canadian resident and key Holocaust denier. Zundel had relied on a 1988 report issued by self-styled engineer Fred A. Leuchter Jr., who claimed to have personally discovered there was no cyanide residue on the walls of Auschwitz's alleged gas chambers. Though Leuchter was discredited almost immediately, Irving, too, still cites his report as what changed his mind about the reality of the Holocaust. \"That's what converted me,\" said Irving. \"When I read that report in the courtroom of Toronto, I became a hardcore disbeliever.\"\n\nIrving has denied that racism or anti-Semitism forms the basis of his views. But his own history does not support that claim. During the early 1990s, Irving began to associate with the neo-Nazi American group the National Alliance, which sponsored seven Irving lectures between 1995 to 1998. Irving also began to refer to Jews as \"Shylocks\" during this period, a nod to Shakespeare's unflattering portrayal of a Jewish moneylender in The Merchant of Venice. In 1992, Irving publicly took exception to the British Broadcasting Corp.'s use of a black man to read the radio news. And, as became public during his later libel suit against Lipstadt, in 1994 Irving composed a revealing ditty for his infant daughter: \"I am a baby Aryan, not Jewish or sectarian,\" Irving's song, recorded in his private diaries, began. \"I have no plans to marry an, ape or Rastafarian.\" His predilection for nannies with a certain type of breast also came to light during the trial.\n\nIt was around this time that Irving began to run into trouble with European laws against denying or trivializing the Holocaust. In 1989, a warrant was issued for his arrest by Austrian authorities after he gave two speeches in that country denying the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz. In 1992, Irving was fined several thousand dollars by the German government for denying the Holocaust, and was banned from entering Germany the following year. Today, Irving is also persona non grata in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and, most recently, Austria.\n\nIrving's most famous legal battle came when he sued Penguin Books and American scholar Deborah Lipstadt over Lipstadt's portrayal of him in her 1994 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory. Irving brought the suit against the British division of Penguin once the book was circulated in that country because British common law states that in a libel suit, the burden of proof rests with the defendant rather than the plaintiff (American libel law shifts the burden of proof to the plaintiff and is far easier on writers' unintentional reporting errors). Still, the London judge sided with Penguin and Lipstadt, roundly denouncing Irving in his judgment and ordering him to pay Lipstadt's court costs \u2014 an estimated $5 million. The judge concluded that Irving \"displays a distinctly pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish bias\" and went on to call him \"an active Holocaust denier\" who \"deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence.\" Ultimately, the trial had the effect of wiping out Irving's dwindling finances and battering his credibility.\n\nIn 2005, Irving was arrested in Austria, where he had traveled secretly to give a speech to a radical group, on the 1989 warrant. He pleaded guilty and told the court that he had changed his views of the Holocaust, and was sentenced to three years in prison. That sentence was later reduced to time served, and he was deported to Britain (where he immediately announced that he hadn't, in fact, changed his views on the war). Since then, Irving reportedly has lectured in Hungary and attended a far-right nationalist rally there on March 15, 2007. He still distributes his now-discredited writings through his own publishing house, run through his website.\n\nIn 2009, Irving reportedly made one of his weirdest announcements yet. He declared that, \"Hitler appointed me his biographer.\" Irving told The Independent (U.K) that he discovered this while working on a biography of Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"I made a great point of tracking down all Hitler's surviving doctors,\" he told the paper, \"and I identified Erwin Giesing as the doctor who treated Hitler after the bomb attempt on his life in 1944.\" Irving said Giesing was living in Aachen, West German, in the 1970s. Irving claimed that when he called him, Giesing replied, \"I've been expecting you.\" Giesing then told Irving that Hitler had told him, \"One day, an Englishman will come along and write my biography. But it cannot be an English man of the present generation. They won't to be objective. It will have to be an Englishman of the next generation, and one who is totally familiar with all the German archives.\"\n\nIn late 2009, Wikileaks published a series of Irving\u2019s private E-mails, including a series of exchanges between himself and a then-24-year-old blonde woman who was described as his assistant. Jaenelle Antas, a college graduate from Minnesota who liked to post on racist forums, lit into Irving for being \u201csnotty, rude and disrespectful toward me\u201d and complaining about his \u201cunhelpful and hostile messages.\u201d He wrote her nasty notes in return, but then softened his tone, calling her \u201cso efficient and beautiful\u201d and asking her to \u201cwork your magic\u201d on his clients and also on him.\n\nOver the years, Irving has toured European countries and the United States, giving lectures defending Hitler and National Socialism. Although he is now barred from a whole series of countries, he has continued to give speaking tours \u2014 for which he charges hefty sums \u2014 in the United States. In 2013, for instance, he embarked on a 27-city tour, starting in Melbourne, Fla., and ending in Atlanta, a fairly typical schedule for him in recent years. In 2015, Irving also had a series of lectures planned in the United Kingdom, typically in small, secret venues. And he was also planning a tour that year, starting in Warsaw, Poland, that included a number of former concentration camps and Nazi military sites. And an extended tour to Latvia was planned.

On Tuesday, the Warsaw district court ordered two leading historians to apologise to a woman for defaming a relative in their book about the Holocaust. The landmark ruling has serious implications for academic freedom and the future of Holocaust research, with historians around the world condemning the judgment.\n\n\u201cThese are not matters to be adjudicated by courts, this is a point that can be discussed by scholars or interested readers in the exchange of opinions. In that sense, it\u2019s really scandalous,\u201d says Jan Tomasz Gross, whose seminal book Neighbours was a watershed in Poland\u2019s public discussion of the Holocaust more than 20 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a broad effort to stifle any inquiry and particularly the complicity of the local population in the persecution of Jews during that time.\u201d\n\nIn Night Without End, a forensic two-volume history that totals nearly 1,700 pages, professors Barbara Engelking and Jan Grabowski focus on the fate of Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland after the Nazis began liquidating the ghettoes in 1942. The book includes a brief passage based on the testimony of a survivor, Estera Siemiatycka, who accused Edward Malinowski, a village elder in Malinowo, north-east Poland, of collaborating with the Nazis and denouncing a group of Jews in hiding.\n\nMalinowski\u2019s niece, 81-year-old Filomena Leszczy\u0144ska, sued the historians. The Polish League Against Defamation financed the case, claiming in a lengthy statement that the historians had damaged \u201cthe reputation not only of Edward Malinowski, but also other Poles, or even Poland\u201d and accused them of \u201ccareless use of historical sources\u201d. The League is a handmaiden to Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice Party\u2019s political agenda to burnish the country\u2019s wartime\u200b \u200bimage. With the mission \u201cto initiate and support actions aimed at correcting false information on Poland\u2019s history\u201d, the League has pursued cases against those accused of defaming Poland, including international media outlets.\n\nCopies of the Polish edition of Night Without End on sale at the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. Photograph: Czarek Soko\u0142owski/AP\n\nThe Law and Justice Party\u2019s crusade to promote Poland\u2019s heroism under Nazi occupation and end what it calls \u201cthe pedagogy of shame\u201d attracted an international outcry three years ago, when it passed legislation outlawing discussion of Polish responsibility in the Holocaust. Leszczy\u0144ska and her backers took a different legal route in their case against Engelking and Grabowski, claiming that the historians had violated her personal rights. The court conceded that the claimant\u2019s right to \u201crespect for the memory of a relative\u201d had been infringed, but threw out the other claims and did not award damages, stating that the judgment was not intended to stifle academic research. The historians are appealing the judgment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got real doubts about this judgment,\u201d says lawyer Micha\u0142 Jab\u0142o\u0144ski, who acted for the defence. \u201cIt is dangerous for freedom of speech and academic research. It is unprecedented that the court decides which historical source is reliable instead of researchers. This judgment requires that testimonies of survivors are verified before they are published anywhere, that researchers have to be 100% sure that testimonies are accurate before they publish conclusions, especially if they regard someone\u2019s misconduct. In the view of the court, the existence of other sources that are contrary to a survivor\u2019s testimony should prevent researchers from publishing their research if it interferes with someone\u2019s personal rights. Such a standard makes historical research a dangerous job, in fact impossible, as in most cases survivors\u2019 testimonies can\u2019t be verified.\u201d\n\nInternational organisations and academics have also been swift to condemn the ruling. Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem said it was \u201cdeeply disturbed by its implications.\u201d Sascha Feuchert, director of the Arbeitsstelle Holocaustliteratur at the University of Giessen, Germany, said: \u201cFor many incidents in the Holocaust, we only have the testimonies from survivors. Of course they need to be checked and discussed in academic debates as far as possible. But this court ruling and its conclusions not only threaten the foundations of research based on survivor testimony, it could also be a gift for Holocaust deniers.\u201d\n\nJan Grabowski, one of the editors of Night Without End. Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters\n\nBefore the second world war, the Jewish population of Poland numbered more than three million, the largest Jewish community in Europe at the time. Just 10% survived. But Poles saved more Jews than any other country during the war, and are honoured at Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. However, Night Without End presents evidence that Poles participated in the murder of their fellow Jewish citizens on a larger scale than previously believed, estimating that two out of every three Jews who attempted to seek shelter among non-Jewish Poles died. Poland\u2019s wartime history includes acts of barbarism alongside heroism, something that is bitterly contested by ruling powers.\n\nEstera Siemiatycka was among the minority that survived \u2013 and it is her testimony in Night Without End for which the historians Engelking and Grabowski must now apologise. Her story is a devastating insight into the destruction of the Jewish community in Poland; Engelking has published a detailed account of her story, drawing on multiple sources, on the website of the Polish Centre for Holocaust Research, where she is director.\n\nSiemiatycka fled the Drohiczyn ghetto in north-east Poland after it was destroyed by the Nazis and most of the inhabitants deported to Treblinka death camp. She hid in a forest with her young son, who was less than two years old, her sister and her two children, who were all captured and murdered while Siemiatycka searched for food. She then reached the village Malinowo and turned to the village elder, Edward Malinowski, for assistance. He helped her to escape Poland for Prussia, Germany, as a forced labourer.\n\nAfter the war, Malinowski was brought to trial for allegedly collaborating with the Nazis and betraying a group of Jews who were in hiding. Siemiatycka gave evidence in his defence, stating that he had saved her life and helped other Jews, and he was acquitted. However, in an interview with the Shoah Foundation in 1996, under her new name Maria Wiltgren, she accused Malinowski of collaboration, and of robbing her. Engelking, who included Siemiatycka\u2019s testimony in Night Without End, found this later testimony most reliable in reconstructing the story.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex story, given Siemiatycka\u2019s conflicting testimonies. However, as Engelking has pointed out, the passage in her book reports the survivor\u2019s account; it is a matter of record. The judge stated that the historians should have limited their trust in Siemiatycka due to the discrepancies.\n\nAhead of Malinowski\u2019s trial, an anti-communist gang intimidated and beat up witnesses, some of whom then changed their testimony. This could explain why Siemiatycka\u2019s own accounts conflict. She may also, as Engelking has suggested, simply have been grateful to Malinowski for saving her life at the time of the trial.\n\nFor the nationalists, this case is ammunition in their bid to intimidate anyone who dares to investigate the truth\n\nThere are fears that the courts, rather than the academic community, have become the arena for testing scholarship, and that threats against academics and journalists in Poland are becoming routine. Earlier this month, police questioned journalist Katarzyna Markusz for writing \u201cdislike of Jews was widespread among Poles, and Polish participation in the Holocaust is a historical fact\u201d.\n\nMiko\u0142aj Grynberg, a writer who has documented Polish-Jewish accounts in his books, believes that the state\u2019s agenda to promote Polish heroism goes against historical truth. \u201cThe aim is to feel good and be a chosen people \u2013 we are the only nation that has only noble people among us,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s adolescent thinking and bad news that we are not growing to be an adult country. So it will stay like this for years.\u201d\n\nSiemiatycka\u2019s story is just a side note in Night Without End; the focus of the book is on the fate of Jews in Poland, while Siemiatycka survived by escaping to Germany. But for the nationalists, this case is ammunition in their bid to intimidate anyone who dares to investigate the truth. In the forthcoming English translation of Night Without End, Engelking and Grabowski hope that their work will no longer make it possible to discuss Poland\u2019s past on the basis of \u201csentiments, resentments or myths, but will be firmly based on sound historical knowledge\u201d. Their case \u2013 and their appeal \u2013 are the first test."}]}
