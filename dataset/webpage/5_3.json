In this case, it is appropriate to say that the cricket club\u2019s history begins with the army department, which was assigned to many disciplines (football, athletics, boxing, rugby), including cricket. Initially, all sports areas were part of the training of the military. Therefore, they were considered secondary.\n\nOver time, the development of the Army Sports Club reached a new level, which allowed the sports divisions to participate in national championships on an ongoing basis.\n\nThis is how the Sri Lanka Army Sports Club cricket team has been playing in first-class format matches since the 2006/07 season. Unfortunately, the club still has not shown itself in any way, but the successful completion of the group stage of the championship allows it to be deservedly in the top division (the Super Eight) of the country.\n\nSri Lanka Army Sports Club: achievements\n\nDuring its fifteen-year history, the club never managed to become the owner of the highest trophies. There is not a single championship on the ASC account.\n\nAt the same time, the Sri Lanka Army Sports Club has positive statistics. According to the latest data, the team played 93 first-class matches, where they won 38 victories, suffered 21 defeats and drew 34 times. The situation is similar in the List A format, where ASC has 35 wins in 68 matches, with 28 defeats and 5 unfinished fights.\n\nSri Lanka Army Sports Club: line-up\n\nThe Sri Lanka Army Sports Club line-up for the 2019/20 season:\n\nNo Name Nat Age Batting Style Bowling Style Batsmen 6 Lakshan Edirisinghe 28 Left-handed Right-arm off-break 17 Himasha Liyanage 24 Left-handed Right-arm off-break 36 Ashan Randika 27 Left-handed Right-arm medium \u2013 Lakshitha Madushan 29 Right-handed Right-arm leg-break \u2013 Dilshan de Soysa 26 Right-handed Right-arm leg-break \u2013 Ranjan Silva 32 Right-handed Right-arm off-break \u2013 Navod Ilukwatta 29 Left-handed Right-arm off-break \u2013 Tharindu Dharsana 32 Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast All-rounders 2 Dushan Vimukthi 29 Right-handed Right-arm off-break 7 Sanjika Ridma 26 Left-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 14 Asela Gunaratne 35 Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast 1 Thisara Perera (Captain) 32 Right-handed Right-arm Right-arm medium-fast 41 Seekkuge Prasanna 36 Right-handed Right-arm leg-break 99 Janith Silva 30 Right-handed Right-arm medium Wicket-keepers 3 Leo Fransisco 26 Left-handed \u2013 96 Kasun de Silva 30 Right-handed Right-arm leg-break 144 Dinesh Chandimal 31 Right-handed Right-arm off-break \u2013 Pathum Dilshan 30 Right-handed \u2013 Bowlers 21 Navantha Rathnayake 42 Right-handed Right-arm fast-medium 23 Buddika Madushanka \u2013 \u2013 Right-arm fast-medium 40 Ajantha Mendis 36 Right-handed Right-arm off-break 66 Janaka Sampath 33 Right-handed Right-arm leg-break \u2013 Malka Madusanka 25 Left-handed Slow left-arm orthodox \u2013 Viraj Pushpakumara 34 Left-handed Right-arm leg-break \u2013 Yasoda Mendis 28 Left-handed Right-arm medium \u2013 Nuwan Liyanapathirana 34 Right-handed Right-arm fast-medium \u2013 Lakshan Madushanka 30 Right-handed Right-arm off-break\n\n* international players are in bold."}, {"url": "https://www.sofascore.com/team/cricket/sri-lanka-army-sports-club/416419", "page_content": "Sri Lanka Army Sports Club scores, player list and schedule from all cricket tournaments that Sri Lanka Army Sports Club played.\n\nSri Lanka Army Sports Club next match\n\nStatistics are updated at the end of the game.\n\nSri Lanka Army Sports Club previous match\n\nSri Lanka Army Sports Club fixtures tab is showing last 100 cricket matches with statistics and win/lose icons.\n\nThere are also all Sri Lanka Army Sports Club scheduled matches that they are going to play in the future.\n\nSri Lanka Army Sports Club performance and form graph is Sofascore\u2019s unique algorithm that we are generating from the team\u2019s last 10 matches, statistics, detailed analysis and our own knowledge.\n\nThis graph may help you predict Sri Lanka Army Sports Club future matches.\n\nFor today\u2019s cricket matches and results visit our cricket live score page."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Sri_Lanka_Army_Sports_Club_(cricket)", "page_content": "Sri Lanka Army Sports Club is a first-class cricket team in Sri Lanka.
