Keim, who had one year remaining on his current deal, plus a team option for another season after that, is now under contract for essentially the same number of years as Wilks.\n\nThe Cardinals have gone 49-30-1 with two playoff appearances during Keim\u2019s five seasons as GM. Only four of his NFL counterparts have won more regular-season games than Keim during that span \u2013 New England\u2019s Bill Belichick, Seattle\u2019s John Schneider, Pittsburgh\u2019s Kevin Colbert and Denver\u2019s John Elway.\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s performance and accomplishments as Cardinals GM speak for themselves,\u201d Cardinals President Michael Bidwill said in a statement. \u201cHis role in the team\u2019s success over the last five seasons is undeniable. This new contract ensures that he will continue to shape our success going forward and we are thrilled about that.\u201d\n\nKeim's track record with the Cardinals\n\nKeim was named the 2014 Sporting News NFL Executive of the Year and earned NFL Executive of the Year honors from Pro Football Talk in back-to-back seasons (2013-14).\n\nThe teams put together by Keim during his tenure as GM have been some of the most successful in franchise history. In 2014, the Cardinals tied the franchise record for wins in a season (11) before setting a new mark the following year in 2015 with 13 wins and its first-ever postseason bye.\n\nKeim joined the franchise as a college scout in 1999. In 2006, he was promoted to Director of College Scouting and two years later, was elevated to Director of Player Personnel. In 2013, he was promoted to General Manager when the team hired Bruce Arians as head coach.\n\nThis is Keim\u2019s second contract extension since becoming GM, as he also signed a four-year extension with a team option back on Feb. 23, 2015.\n\nAfter the Cardinals dropped to 6-8 this past season, thus assuring themselves of a non-winning season, Keim apologized to fans and promised things will be different in 2018.\n\n\u201cI apologize to our fans and everybody in our organization,\u201d Keim said during his weekly radio appearance on Arizona Sports 98.7 FM. \u201cMoving forward, we have a lot of work to do. It\u2019s going to be a busy offseason. \u2026 I promise the product on the field in 2018 will finish much stronger.\u201d\n\nCardinals still need a quarterback\n\nOne of Keim's biggest tasks remains identifying and acquiring a new starting quarterback for the team. The Cardinals have no quarterbacks on their roster signed for next season.\n\nKeim has missed on some draft picks, but he also engineered trades that brought Palmer and outside linebacker Chandler Jones to Arizona and has been successful at addressing weaknesses during a season.\n\nThe team spent millions on upgrades to its training facility and University of Phoenix Stadium, and at Keim\u2019s urging five years ago, Bidwill agreed to substantially expand the team\u2019s pro scouting department.\n\n\u201cFive years ago we started with no head coach and no quarterback,\u201d Keim said last month, \u201cand I feel like that ended up pretty good.

He was said to be fed up with what he perceived as unfair criticism in his hometown.\n\nTobin said he was going to review personnel with coach Ted Marchibroda before he talks about anyone, including George.\n\nSince the Colts finished 28th in the league in defense, Tobin's brother Vince could soon rekindle the family reunion they had with the Bears from 1986-92, when the Bears' defense finished 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 25th, 6th, 4th and 17th.\n\n\"We've got some changes to make,\" Bill Tobin admitted when asked about Vince.\n\nThe Colts' defensive coordinator is former Northwestern coach Rick Venturi.\n\nThe Tobin hiring was one of two shakeups in the NFL Friday. The New York Jets fired coach Bruce Coslet and promoted defensive coordinator Pete Carroll after Coslet refused to hire an offensive coordinator. Coslet spent four years without a winning season. After making the playoffs in 1991 as an 8-8 wild card, the Jets suffered through 4-12 and 8-8 seasons.\n\nTobin praised former Bears General Manager Jim Finks as his role model in structuring a team.
