Her parents were Americans living in London and when she was 7, the family moved to Los Angeles. Her first small part in a movie was in There's One Born Every Minute in 1942 but her first starring role was in National Velvet in 1944. She became as famous for her 8 marriages (to 7 people) as she was for her beauty and films.\n\nIn 1967, at the age of 35 years old, Joseph was alive when on November 7th, President Johnson signed legislation passed by Congress that created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which would later become PBS and NPR. The legislation required CPB to operate with a \"strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature\".\n\nIn 1971, when he was 39 years old, on May 3rd, 10,000 federal troops, 5,100 officers of the D.C. Metropolitan Police, 2,000 members of the D.C. National Guard, and federal agents assembled in Washington DC to prevent an estimated 10,000 Vietnam War protesters from marching. President Nixon (who was in California) refused to give federal employees the day off and they had to navigate the police and protesters, adding to the confusion. By the end of a few days of protest, 12,614 people had been arrested - making it the largest mass arrest in US history.\n\nIn 1980, by the time he was 48 years old, on December 8th, ex-Beatle John Lennon was shot and killed by Mark David Chapman in front of his home - the Dakota - in New York City. Chapman was found guilty of murder and still remains in jail.\n\nIn 1994, when he was 62 years old, on May 6th, the Channel Tunnel or \"Chunnel\" was officially opened. The Chunnel is a railway tunnel beneath the English Channel that connects Great Britain to mainland France. Original plans for such a tunnel were developed in 1802 and approved by Napoleon Bonaparte but the British rejected the plan fearing that Napoleon would use the railway to invade."}, {"url": "https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/resources/birthdeath/Default.asp", "page_content": "Missouri Birth & Death Records Database, Pre-1910\n\nThe Missouri Birth and Death Records Database is an abstract of the birth, stillbirth, and death records recorded before 1909 and that are available on microfilm at the Missouri State Archives.

At 18 years of age he married the love of his life, Jenell C. Brown, with whom he enjoyed 59 years of love, laughter, great food, and the occasional tongue lashing. It was from this union they started their family: daughter Gayla (Brown)-Fewell, who then married William D. Fewell, who had a son Douglas J. Fewell, who had 2 children Zyra and Brayden. Beyond all things it was this family that Joe loved and cherished and carried in his heart for all his days.\n\nAmong the list of jobs Joe had in his younger days, it was Kraft Foods where he spent the majority of his career. He retired in 1992 after working over 30 years. In this time he met many of his lifetime friends, whom he also cherished beyond measure, Howell B. Lewis, being the closest friend of all.\n\n\n\nA very active man most of his life, with many accomplishments, including being a Golden Glove Boxing champion. He also was a lifetime golfer and enjoyed many years playing with another great friend of his (Dan), and even was put into the Springfield News-Leader for achieving a hole-in-one, by far the most difficult shot to execute, but then again that alone speaks volumes about his drive and determination to the things he loved. He also enjoyed walking long distances (7 miles per day) and lifting weights with his grandson late into his 70's. Joe also enjoyed giving. He was a blood donor at the American Red Cross and over his lifetime gave over 8 gallons of blood. After his retirement, Joe enjoyed giving his time; he served his community by volunteering for Sunset Church of Christ, where he was an active member for many years. Joe was loyal to his Christian faith and read his Bible every day for years upon years.\n\nJoe was preceded in death by his wife Jenell C.
