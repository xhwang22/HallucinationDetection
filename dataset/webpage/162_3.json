Searels becomes Georgia\u2019s fourth offseason hire, joining wide receivers coach Bryan McClendon, outside linebackers coach Chidera Uzo-Diribe and defensive backs coach Fran Brown.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s new coaches will look to replicate the success the Bulldogs had in 2021. Georgia posted a 14-1 record in head coach Kirby Smart\u2019s sixth season at the helm and ended the season with a 33-18 victory over Alabama to give the Bulldogs their first national title in 41 years.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at all 10 assistant coaches that will help the Bulldogs as they try to defend the title in 2022:"}, {"url": "https://247sports.com/Article/Georgias-McClendon-is-247Sports-National-Recruiter-of-the-Year-175899/", "page_content": "BOULDER, Colo.\u2014 Who's been talked about more in college football than Deion Sanders?\n\nWhether it's getting the nation's top recruit Travis Hunter to flip on signing day to Jackson State, his decision to accept the Colorado job or the massive roster overhaul that has taken place since the spring game (51 scholarship players total, 44 alone after the spring game) Sanders has given sports media plenty to write about while raising eyebrows across college football.\n\n\"We'll see how it works out but that, to me, looks bad on college football coaches across the country,\" Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi told 247Sports' Brandon Marcello in May, a quote that went viral. \"The reflection is on one guy right now but when you look at it overall \u2014 those kids that have moms and dads and brothers and sisters and goals in life \u2014 I don't know how many of those 70 that left really wanted to leave or they were kicked in the butt to get out.\"\n\nSanders believes his true true goal behind his roster makeover has been lost in translation. He addressed that and much more this week in a wide-ranging Q&A with 247Sports this week on campus, with Sanders and Colorado providing behind-the-scenes access to one of its summer football camps.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This interview has been edited for clarity.\n\n247Sports: What have you seen so far from your new team?\n\nSanders: \"Want, determination, effort, camaraderie. It is a collection of men \u2014 some wanting a second chance. And some of them are just trying to get to the next level. But all of them share a desperate want to get where they want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\n247Sports: What do you say to people like Pat Narduzzi who have been critical of your roster overhaul?\n\nSanders: \"What was his situation when he came to Pitt? He had a different situation than me. He is not mad at me, he is mad at the situation in football now that allowed his best player to leave a year ago. He\u2019s not mad at me, he\u2019s using me to shoot bullets at another coach who he has an issue with. I don\u2019t know who he is; if he walked in here right now I wouldn\u2019t know him.\"\n\n247Sports: There was a lot of smoke surrounding Travis Hunter when he entered the portal: Would he follow you to Colorado or land somewhere else? He obviously enrolled at Colorado. What are your expectations for him this season?\n\nSanders: \"People offered Travis Hunter a bag. About $1.5 million to try to lure him and buy him out of the transfer portal. But Travis is not the kind of guy that can be bought. He isn't built like that. Travis is a relational young man that is built on relationships and stability. And that\u2019s what he wanted and desired. That is why he decided to ride and stay with us. I cannot wait until they see what he is capable of doing in these next couple of years. Because he will be a top-5 or top-3 pick after his junior year. But the sky's the limit, he is going to play both ways and he is a vital part of the offense and the defense, and he wants that.\n\n247Sports: How do you manage him playing both ways?\n\nSanders: \"We don\u2019t have to manage that. His game is his game. It\u2019s nothing that we manage. Travis is bored when he is not on the field, Travis is not intertwined with things when he is not on the field. Travis likes to be in the action, that\u2019s who he is.\"\n\n247Sports: As I watched the workouts this week, one of the things that has stood out to me is the vocal leadership of Shedeur Sanders. You\u2019ve been coaching him from youth, to high school and now college football. How has Shedeur grown as a leader this spring in the transition to Colorado?\n\nSanders: \"It\u2019s funny telling you this because his brother is sitting here filming this, but [Shedeur\u2019s] nickname is \u201cGrown.\u201d Because he has always been truly mature for his age at different stages of his life that he has encountered and different obstacles he has overcome. He is rock-steady. Grown doesn't get flustered. He is not a 'ra-ra' guy. He's not a 'I\u2019m gonna talk about what he\u2019s going to do\u201d [type of person]. It\u2019s not too many things in life that will get him up or get him down. He is like a baseball player. Baseball players are rock-steady. Football players are up because they have to practice for six days and play one. Baseball players have to do it every day. That is his character. And I love the expectation that he has placed on himself. My expectation of him is far less than his expectations he places on himself. Because not only does he have tremendous expectations, but he is a Sanders. And he knows what that means.\"\n\nGet offseason and recruiting information on your favorite college team for $1 for first month\n\n247Sports: A lot of roster changes have been made.\n\nSanders: \"Necessary changes. Say: 'Necessary.'\n\n247Sports: How do you like your team going into the fall as opposed to what you had in the spring?\n\nSanders: \"Apples and Oranges. You can\u2019t compare the two. You are talking about a situation in which we inherited a team that was 1-11. And everyone knows there are going to be some changes. I don\u2019t understand how you would think that the coaching staff is the only thing that deserved a change. Now when you rid yourself of the entire coaching staff, you think you are going to keep all the kids? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense whatsoever when the previous staff was responsible for securing those kids. That\u2019s not the way that this game is played with us.\"\n\n247Sports: From a recruiting standpoint, if a young man wants to play for Colorado, what does he need to have?\n\nSanders: \"First he needs to have his grades correct and needs to be eligible through our compliance department. Then, he needs to be tough, smart, fast, disciplined and with character. And he has to understand that this coaching staff is old school. Not old fools, but old school. A lot of our principles and the way we attack the game comes from way back when. And we are still that way because that way is the way and it has not failed us yet. So it\u2019s a tremendous expectation, but we go hard and we play fast. And you have to love this thing. We don\u2019t want you to be 'in like' with it. We want you to be 'in love' with it.\"\n\nRELATED: 5 things Carl Reed learned from Colorado's spring game"}, {"url": "https://www.gcshof.com/williemcclendon", "page_content": "WILLIE McCLENDON\n\nMcClendon enjoyed a standout high school career at Glynn Academy, where he was a three-year letterman in football and also a two-year letterman in both basketball and track and field.

Defensive lineman Mike Morris and center Olusegun Oluwatimi were chosen four picks apart by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round. Punter Brad Robbins (Cincinnati Bengals), offensive lineman Ryan Hayes (Miami Dolphins) and wide receiver Ronnie Bell (San Francisco 49ers) were selected in the seventh round.\n\nWith nine players chosen this weekend, U-M has reached 401 players drafted as a program and is now one of six programs in college football to have 400-plus players selected in the NFL Draft.\n\nThis marks the sixth draft in eight since head coach Jim Harbaugh has been leading the program in which at least five Wolverines have been selected, and the fourth with at least eight players selected. With two specialists chosen this weekend, U-M has had at least one player drafted at every major position on offense, defense and special teams during Harbaugh's tenure.\n\nThe Seahawks selected Morris with the 151st overall selection in the fifth round and chose Oluwatimi at No. 154. Morris and Oluwatimi are the sixth and seventh Wolverines drafted by the Seattle organization, respectively, and the first U-M players taken since wide receiver Amara Darboh (2017). Morris is the first defensive lineman chosen by Seattle since Frank Clark (2015). The last time the team chose a U-M offensive lineman was Steve Hutchinson (2001). Both will join former Wolverine defensive lineman Bryan Mone on the roster.\n\nMorris had his best season in the maize and blue as a senior, earning second-team All-America honors in 2022. He was the Big Ten's Defensive Lineman of the Year after earning first team All-Big Ten honors from the coaches and media. The team's Richard Katcher Award winner as the team's top defensive lineman, Morris was also a semifinalist for the Bednarik Award and a candidate for the Ted Hendricks Trophy. He started at edge defender in 11 contests and played in 12 games, recording 23 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks and three pass breakups.\n\nA three-year letterman, Morris appeared in 27 career games and made 16 starts during his career. He registered 40 tackles, 12 TFLs, eight sacks, one interception and three PBUs during his career. Morris earned Academic All-Big Ten honors his final three seasons (2020-22).\n\nOluwatimi made the most of his only season in the winged helmet, earning consensus All-America honors and winning the Rimington Trophy (nation's best center) and Outland Trophy (country's best lineman) in 2022. He started all 14 games at center and helped anchor an offensive line that won the Joe Moore Award as college football's best offensive line for the second straight season. In addition to winning two individual national awards, Oluwatimi was a semifinalist for the Rotary Lombardi Award. He earned first team All-Big Ten honors.\n\nCincinnati chose its second Wolverine of the weekend ( DJ Turner , second round) when it made Brad Robbins its sixth-round selection (217th overall). The Westerville, Ohio, native is the 17th Wolverine drafted by the Bengals, joining former U-M teammates Daxton Hill, Chris Evans and Turner on the roster.\n\nA four-year starter at punter and five-year letterman, Robbins was a three-time Ray Guy Award candidate and 2021 semifinalist for the award honoring the nation's outstanding punter. He was twice selected as a finalist for the Mortell Holder of the Year award (2021-22). Robbins was a two-time All-Big Ten honorable mention selection. He is the first player in program history to be a two-time recipient of the Robert P. Ufer Bequest as the top senior demonstrating the most enthusiasm and love for Michigan.\n\nOn the field, he finished his career ranked second in Michigan history with a 43-yard average and is one of nine punters at U-M with a career average better than 40 yards per punt. He punted 179 times for 7,689 yards (43.0 avg.) with a 66-yard career-long punt. Robbins had 61 punts downed inside the opposition's 20-yard line with only nine career touchbacks; 75 of his 179 punts were fair caught.\n\nHayes was selected by Miami in the seventh round with the 238th pick overall. He is the ninth player from U-M to be chosen by the Dolphins, who have a penchant for drafting offensive linemen when they pick Wolverines. Offensive tackle Jake Long (2008) was the last Wolverine drafted by Miami, who also chose linemen Tony Pape (2004) and Jon Giesler (1979).\n\nThe starting left tackle for back-to-back Joe Moore Award-winning offensive lines, Hayes was a four-year letterman and three-year starter. He appeared in 40 career contests and started 30 games at left tackle. Hayes earned All-Big Ten second-team honors twice (2021-22) and was a three-time Academic All-Big Ten recipient.\n\nHe started 12 games at left tackle in 2022 and helped Michigan's offense surpass 6,000 total offensive yards in both 2021 and 2022, which were the second and third times accomplishing the feat in school history. Hayes was a candidate for the Rotary Lombardi Award and earned second-team All-Big Ten accolades.\n\nThe 49ers chose Bell with the 253rd selection overall (seventh round). He is the 18th Wolverine drafted by the franchise and will join former U-M teammates Moody and Ambry Thomas on the west coast. San Francisco has drafted four U-M wide receivers, with the last prior to Bell being Tai Streets (1999).\n\nBell appeared in 47 career games and started at receiver in 31 contests. A five-year letterman, he finished his career tied for ninth in school history in receiving yards (2,269) and is 10th in receptions (145). Bell scored nine receiving touchdowns and had 36 career receptions of 20-plus yards. A team captain for a pair of Big Ten Championship-winning teams, Bell hauled in at least one reception in 29 straight games played. He had 75 or more receiving yards in 13 games during his career, including four 100-yard receiving efforts.\n\nAs a senior, Bell led the receiving corps career highs in receptions (62), receiving yards (889) and touchdowns (four), earning the team's Offensive Skill Player of the Year award. He was a semifinalist for the Comeback Player of the Year award nationally and earned All-Big Ten third-team honors from the media and coaches. Bell started all 14 games at receiver in 2022.\n\nNotes\n\n\u2022 In eight NFL Drafts since head coach Jim Harbaugh has been leading the program, U-M has had every major position selected at least once. On offense: quarterback, running back, tight end, h-back/fullback, wide receiver, offensive line (tackle and interior). On defense: defensive line (edge and interior), linebacker, cornerback, and safety. Among specialists: kicker, punter, and long snapper.\n\n\u2022 When Ryan Hayes was selected in the seventh round, it marked 400 U-M players drafted in program history. Michigan is one of six programs in college football with 400-plus players chosen in the NFL Draft (401).\n\n\u2022 At least one Michigan player has been selected in 85 consecutive NFL Drafts (1938 to present), continuing the program's NCAA record streak among its peers.\n\n\u2022 Two Wolverines were chosen by the Seattle Seahawks in Mike Morris (151th overall) and Olu Oluwatimi (154). The last time a team selected two U-M players in the same year was 2020, when the New England Patriots chose Josh Uche (60) and Michael Onwenu (182) in the same draft.\n\n\u2022 The three-pick spread between selections from U-M is the tightest since Devin Bush (10) and Rashan Gary (12) were chosen in the first round of the 2019 draft. Chase Winovich (77) and David Long (79) also were chosen three picks apart that year.\n\n\u2022 When punter Brad Robbins was chosen in the sixth round (Cincinnati Bengals), he and kicker Jake Moody (San Francisco 49ers) became the first pair of U-M specialists to be drafted in the same year. In the last 40 NFL Drafts, only U-M (2023) and Utah (2019; kicker Mitch Wishnowsky, punter Matt Gay) have had multiple specialists drafted in the same year.\n\n\u2022 In six of the eight NFL Drafts to occur since head coach Harbaugh has been leading the program, at least five Wolverines have been selected. In four drafts, at least eight Wolverines have been selected.\n\n\u2022 Fifty-three players have been drafted during Harbaugh's tenure, including eight first-round picks."}, {"url": "https://www.gcshof.com/inductees", "page_content": "CLASS OF 2016\n\nBASEBALL\n\nKEVIN DRURY\n\nKevin Drury was a star shortstop on Glynn Academy's 1973 AAA state championship baseball team, whom long-time Brunswick News sports editor Murray Poole says was one of the two best fielding shortstops he witnessed in his 40 years with the newspaper.\n\nCOACH\n\nGARY LARKINS\n\nGary Larkins was a teacher and successful coach at Frederica Academy for 25 years from 1975-2000 before moving to Glynn Academy where he enjoyed continued success with the Glynn Academy girls soccer team until retiring from coaching following the 2013 season with...\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nRESHARD LEE\n\nReshard Lee was a record-setting quarterback for Brunswick High before going on to play collegiate and professional football.

It is really hard in football nowadays to go seven, eight, nine, ten play drives. You want guys that can create explosive plays on their own.\u201d\n\nWhile at Oregon, McClendon was the primary recruiter for two of the most highly touted wide receivers to ever sign with the program.\n\nMcClendon was the primary recruiter for 6-feet-5, 185 pound four-star receiver Dont\u2019e Thornton, who hailed from Mount Saint Joseph in Baltimore, Maryland. Thornton ranked as the No. 57 overall player in the country in the class of 2021.\n\nMcClendon was the secondary recruiter for Troy Franklin (6-2, 170) out of Melo-Atherton (CA) High School in the 2021 cycle. Franklin ranked as the No. 41 overall player in the country.\n\nAs true freshmen in 2021, Thornton and Franklin combined for 384 receiving yards and four touchdowns.\n\nIn the 2022 class, McClendon was targeting wide receiver Kevin Coleman out of St. Louis, Missouri. Coleman ranks as the No. 44 overall player in the country and stands 5-feet-11 and 170 pounds.\n\nDoes McClendon have a particular type of receiver he likes in terms of body type? The coach made it clear at Oregon that he simply wants playmakers.\n\n\u201cThe best guys, no matter what size they are, they can get open and create explosive plays. Whatever size that comes in, is what size it comes in,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cThe size range can really vary. At the end of the day, you want guys that can consistently beat man-to-man coverage. Whatever size that comes in, I am fine with it. I am more about the traits that you need to go out and play well. I am fine if that comes with a bigger body guy or a smaller guy.\u201d\n\nMcClendon\u2019s reputation as a top recruiter was earned dating back to when he was a young running backs coach at Georgia. McClendon is credited as the primary recruiter for top UGA backs like Isaiah Crowell, Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, and Todd Gurley.\n\nTalent acquisition is a key part of success in major college football and McClendon understands that.\n\n\u201cRecruiting is part of the job,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cIn today\u2019s day and age, coaches have to recruit. You have to do it. I definitely want to go out and bring in the best players that I can work with. I have been placed where people have put their trust in me to do that.\n\n\u201cRecruiting is about relationships. It is about gaining the trust of people and get to the point where they know you are going to do everything in your power to help them be the best they can be on and off the field. At the end of the day, that is what I am trying to show people.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at Oregon, McClendon appreciated being on a staff that was led by a head coach that embraces the grind of participating fully in the recruiting process.\n\n\u201cIt is always great to be on a staff with like minded people,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cRecruiting should always be a main focus for every staff. At the end of the day, that is the lifeblood of every program. Coach Cristobal has recruited at a high level during his career and that shows that he gets it and understands it.\u201d\n\nMcClendon has a lot of success recruiting in the southeastern region of the country and using those connections to land top players from Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas.\n\n\u201cAll I really know is recruiting in that region and so I have a lot of really good relationships built up,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cIt helps that I have known people a long time that will put a good word in for me with recruits and their families.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=6065152", "page_content": "Instead of saying you earned 4 varsity letters in XC, does it make sense to say \"4 x Letterman\" ?.......or do you only reach letterman status once?

He will be Georgia\u2019s new wide receivers coach.\n\nMcClendon followed new Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal from Oregon to Miami after spending two years as an assistant coach on Cristobal\u2019s staff with the Ducks. Before coaching with Cristobal at Oregon, McClendon coached at South Carolina for four years.\n\nTaking a position on Georgia\u2019s staff allows McClendon to return to his alma mater; he played for Georgia from 2002 to 2005 and coached there for nine seasons.\n\nMcClendon\u2019s departure opens another spot on Cristobal\u2019s staff. The new Miami coach has not hired an offensive or defensive coordinator and currently has only three assistant coaches on his staff: offensive line coach Alex Mirabal, running backs coach Kevin Smith and defensive line coach and associate head coach Joe Salave\u2019a\n\nMcClendon has a reputation as a good position coach and as an excellent recruiter, and he already played a key role in securing 2023 wide receiver commit Andy Jean, who announced his commitment to the Hurricanes on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMe and coach Bryan McClendon\u2019s relationship feels great like I [knew] him for years,\u201d Jean told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Sunday before news of McClendon\u2019s departure broke. \u201cGreat energy from the both us. We connect well. Can\u2019t wait to be coached by him.\u201d"}]}
