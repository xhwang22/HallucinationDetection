Here we have a disc of the piano works of Tadeusz Szeligowski, a native of Lvov which is now one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. He was introduced to music at an early age, his mother hoping that he would one day become a musician. After graduating from the Galician Conservatory in 1914, the young Tadeusz then entered Vienna University where he studied law. His studies were interrupted by the First World War when he served in the Austrian army, although his life was made easier when he became music teacher to the child of a high-ranking officer. After the war, he returned to his studies, gaining a law degree and in 1922 his PhD, after which he began practising in the local courthouse in Lvov. During this period, he also undertook further musical studies and began working at the Krak\u00f3w Opera, an appointment that lasted some seven years. It was here that he met the woman destined to become his wife. In 1923 he took up a legal position in Vilnius, where he first met Karol Szymanowski and, becoming a great admirer of his music, set about developing the cultural and musical life of the city. In 1929, thanks to a scholarship he moved to Paris in order to study composition with Nadia Boulanger and instrumentation with Paul Dukas; his time in France had a lasting influence upon his music. He became a well-respected teacher and lecturer in musical theory, music history and composition and was influential in the founding of the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n\n\nHe composed a great deal of music in most genres, but despite this, the only list I could find contained little solo piano music. The first work on this disc is his short Sonatina of 1940, dedicated to his friend, the pianist Stanislaw Szpinalski. Despite the work\u2019s brevity, its four movements lasting only seven minutes in total, it is quite a colourful work. It opens with a jovial Allegro moderato in which the influence of Poulenc can be heard; it is followed by a slow Arietta whose main theme is treated to various changes, almost as if it were a set of variations, and is repeated throughout. The final two movements resume a jovial character, the third movement opening with a brisk first theme before a more lyrical and slightly slower second theme which gives way to the original music of the movement then hurries to a conclusion. The final movement has a brisk cheerful theme that is repeated throughout but which gives way to a slightly slower second subject ending the movement and the work.\n\n\n\nThe real heart of this disc comes in the form of the Sonata in D minor from 1949, the largest and most powerful work on the disc; its three movements last longer than all the other works combined. Its opening Allegro con fuoco is alone longer than the preceding Sonatina and opens with a powerful statement of intent. The frivolity of the Sonatina has gone; this is a serious work with a main theme reminiscent of the piano music of his friend Szymanowski and even more of Rachmaninov. There are lighter episodes, but these appear as asides from the main late Romantic themes of the movement. The Andantino opens with a repeated four-note motif in the left hand before the entry of a melodious theme in the right; there follows a brief section where the left joins in the melody before returning to the four-note theme, this time slightly faster. There follows a more lyrical and expansive second theme, which is in turn followed by a return four-note motif and a return to the first theme, which this time is punctuated by tremolos in the right that develops into the transitional music leading into the final movement. The Allegro molto vivace is the brightest and quickest of the three movements, but even this is tempered by dark notes in the bass. Its opening theme is almost mechanical in the way that it is hammered out, yet it is without aggression; this leads again to a more lyrical section where the left hand holds the tune whilst the right has a run of notes. The movement ends with an almost cyclical re-emergence of the opening theme of the first movement which is treated slightly differently here. This is a very fine sonata and on the evidence of this work alone I am eager to hear more music by Tadeusz Szeligowski.\n\n\n\nGitary z Zalamei reflects Szeligowski\u2019s enthusiasm for Spanish music; this short and expressive piece certainly displays elements of guitar-style as well as a liking for the piano music of Alb\u00e9niz. Despite the brevity of the piece, a number of themes are introduced which are developed into an attractive whole, one that could easily be mistaken for a work by a Spanish composer.\n\n\n\nThe final four pieces are described as Four Miniatures in the booklet notes and could relate to the Small pieces for piano from 1952 that appears in the list of the composer\u2019s compositions. This in reality is a short suite which opens with the Preludium, a piece that harkens back to Szeligowski\u2019s French days. This is reinforced through the charming Minuet, the lilting Malinconia, which at just short of two and a half minutes is the longest of the four pieces. The finale is Mazurek - not the Polish Easter sweetmeat but a stately kujawiak, one of the five national dances of Poland; it is an inspired piece which ensures that this short suite ends with a really Polish feeling.\n\n\n\nAlthough some might find 46:25 minutes a bit short measure, this disc is filled with rewarding music which is well worth investigating. It might display a French influence, but it is clearly essentially Polish with an air of France about it. El\u017cbieta Tyszecka\u2019s playing is excellent throughout; she really gets to the heart of Szeligowski\u2019s fine music, finding every nuance and change of character here, and her playing of the Sonata is wonderful. The recorded sound is very good, as are the booklet notes, which are in Polish and English. Acte Pr\u00e9alable should once again be applauded for bringing this wonderful music to our attention; all I can say is, more please!\n\n\n\nStuart Sillitoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://sonichits.com/video/Tadeusz_Szeligowski/Tadeusz_Szeligowski_-_Kaziuki_-_Fantastic_March", "page_content": "Tadeusz Szeligowski (13 September 1896 - 10 January 1963) was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer.

Tadeusz Szeligowski was born in 1896 in the city of Lw\u00f3w (or Lvov), which at that time was under the control of Austria. Although he received a doctorate in law, he also had a well-rounded musical education in Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w, and (later) in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas. Paris between the two world wars had a decisive effect on him, and when he returned to Poland in 1931, he gave up law in order to devote himself entirely to music \u2013 teaching, composing, and conducting. He was among the original founders of the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic, and served as its first music director between 1947 and 1949. Between 1950 and his death in 1963, he was a leading musical figure in Pozna\u0144, teaching at that city's conservatory and organizing major musical events.\n\nThis composer is not entirely new to CD \u2013 there's flute sonata out there, and a wind quintet \u2013 but all five of the works on this new Naxos CD are receiving their first commercial recordings here. The Comedy Overture (1952), which starts things off, isn't literally a curtain-raiser. It's just a bright and unpretentious introduction to the composer. The annotations (co-authored by conductor Smolij) suggest a resemblance between this work and Kabalevsky's Colas Breugnon overture, and I think that's right on the money. Next come Four Polish Dances (1954), and Szeligowski dresses them up so grandly that their folk origins are almost hidden. (Indeed, the outer portions of the \"Korow\u00f3d\" sound like what Elgar might have written on an Eastern European vacation.) The Piano Concerto (1941) is in a diverting neoclassical style that doesn't give much of a hint, except for the lightly melancholy second movement \u2013 that World War Two was raging through and around Poland as it was composed. Here, hints of Elgar have been replaced with hints of Poulenc, perhaps as a souvenir of Szeligowski's years in Paris. The extended Nocturne (1947) is lushly orchestrated, and exhales an atmosphere of magic and veiled eroticism. Finally, the Concerto for Orchestra (1930), composed while Szeligowski was in Paris, is an assured, attractive work, even if it doesn't approach later works in this genre by Bart\u00f3k or Szeligowski's younger countryman Lutos\u00bbawski. It is more modern in style than the other works on this CD, but still very digestible.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic is a top-notch ensemble, and they do their founder proud with the performances on this CD. Smolij, an up-and-coming conductor, makes an excellent case for this music. Czapiewski sparkles in the concerto, and gives substance to its middle movement.\n\nOnce again, Naxos is to be praised for making virtually unknown music available to the masses in excellent performances, and at an almost give-away price.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2008, Raymond Tuttle"}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Tadeusz_Szeligowski", "page_content": "This category has only the following subcategory.\n\nMedia in category \"Tadeusz Szeligowski\"\n\nThe following 5 files are in this category, out of 5 total."}], "Tadeusz Szeligowski's works were performed in many countries.": [{"url": "https://www.prestomusic.com/sheet-music/composers/21352--szeligowski", "page_content": "Tadeusz Szeligowski was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer.

The com- posers were expected to:1) re-evaluate the hierarchy of musical genres and forms (the need for musical creativity to be based on vocal and programme forms, as well as forms of utility music);2) use (in the verbal or programme layer) topical subjects supporting the process of shaping the new system;3) make references in their works to national and European tradition (excluding the elements of the 19th century tradition) and to Polish folk music.Tadeusz Szeligowski\u2019s opera Bunt \u017cak\u00f3w (The scholars\u2019 revolt) was the first opera to be com-posed in Poland after 1945. Its creators were awarded the Level I State Prize in 1951. The preview of the piece, which took place in Wroc\u0142aw, and subsequent performances in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, Po- zna\u0144, Moscow and Dresden were enthusiastically received by listeners and music critics. The piece was presented as a model realisation of the socialist realism method in musical creation in Poland. High artistic values and spectacular attractiveness of the piece were pointed out as well.The article attempts to describe the opera in the context of cultural policy in Poland in the period 1945\u20131956. The analysis of the piece results from the adoption of the assumptions of the Russian national musical drama and includes: the plot of the opera - with a focus on the sources of conflicts, the main character, the dramatic and musical form, opera elements, melodics and harmonies, texts and leitmotifs.On the basis of the conducted analyses, it can be stated that the implementation of the instruc- tions issued by politicians and party activists to the composers is performed in the piece in question on three levels: dramaturgical, linguistic and musical. The opera The scholars\u2019 revolt constitutes a kind of response of its creators (composer and librettist) to a specific \u201csocial demand\u201d (in the words of the propaganda of that time). Thus, the piece is a part of the process of the ideologization of musical culture taking place in Poland in the 1950s."}]}
