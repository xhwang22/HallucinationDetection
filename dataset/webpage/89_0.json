He joined the Blues in 1942, and was a key member of premiership teams in both 1945 and his Brownlow year of 1947. Strong overhead and brilliant at ground level, he effectively constituted the first line of attack for the Blues, with his superb anticipation frequently enabling him to intercept the ball and return it with interest, almost invariably to his team's advantage.\n\nIn 1952, Deacon returned to his original club Preston as captain-coach. He was regarded as having \"an excellent rapport with his players\",\u00b9 but it was not until he began to coach the team from the sidelines that this began to bear fruit. In 1955 the Bullants qualified for the finals for the first time since the war, and although they would not win a premiership for another eight seasons there is little doubt that Deacon was instrumental in laying a foundation of professionalism on which his successors were able to build.\n\nIn 1958, Bert Deacon returned to Carlton as vice-president, and later served as club secretary.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney"}, {"url": "https://blueseum.org/Bert+Deacon", "page_content": "Milestones\n\nVideo\n\nBert Deacon holds a special place among the legends of the Carlton Football Club. Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old. The football world was rocked to its core by the news, and there was widespread grief at the loss of one of football\u2019s favourite sons \u2013 a man whose dignity and integrity transcended club loyalties and brought him genuine admiration. Winning and losing mattered much to Bert Deacon, but so did how the game was played.The Deacon family tradition continued at Preston with his brother Bill acting as President from 1983 to 1987, a period that saw the club become the first in V.F.A. history to take out premierships at the Firsts, Seconds and Thirds levels in 1983 and again the following year. Bill's widow, Maisie has had the honour of the Preston and now Northern Bullant No. 1 membership for many years50 Games : Round 15, 1947 Vs Footscray100 Games : Round 2, 1951 Vs Footscray"}, {"url": "https://libraries.darebin.vic.gov.au/darebinheritage/biographies/sports-people/bertrandjohndeacon", "page_content": "(1922 -1974)\n\nBert Deacon was born in Northcote in 1922 before moving to Preston in 1927.

After all, Deacon had just come off a stellar season, having taken out the 1947 Brownlow Medal, represented Carlton in its eighth premiership and earned Victorian and All-Australian selection.\n\nHow well Dudley remembers the moment. \u201cMy mother was blind, and when Bert won the Brownlow I was sitting with Mum in the bedroom talking to her one night and she said, \u2018You should paint a portrait of Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Dudley explained.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 and she said \u2018I think it will be wonderful for you\u2019. I then said \u2018How do I do this?\u2019 and she said \u2018Go and see him\u2019.\u201d\n\nDudley made his way to 2 Hawker Avenue, Preston, where Bert and Jean then lived. \u201cWhen I got there this particular night, around about seven o\u2019clock, Bert was already in bed because he was injured - he\u2019d injured his leg playing football, but he and Jean just welcomed me so much. It was great and I felt so proud,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI then asked Bert if he would pose for the big portrait and he said \u2018I\u2019d be very happy to do that\u2019. He sat for the portrait about eight times and I remember in one sitting he began to smile, exposing this toothless gap. He was painted sporting grey trousers and navy blue blazer with the white V on the pocket and included in the painting is a trophy Bert also won for best afield for Victoria.\n\n\u201cTowards the end Bert said, \u2018You know I really love this painting and I\u2019m going to tell everybody about the greatest artist in the world\u2019, and he did. He sent many people to me to have their portraits painted. He was just great. No wonder I cried when he went to heaven.\n\nThough Bert and his wife Jean were thrilled with Dudley\u2019s gift, they had nowhere in their small home to hang the sizeable canvas. For a brief period the portrait found a wall in the city sports store of the former Collingwood footballer Ron Todd, but at some point in 1948 it was returned to Dudley\u2019s home and stored in a shed \u2013 which is where the work unfortunately came to grief.\n\nAs the artist explained, the painting toppled on to a steel table which pierced the canvas beyond repair.\n\nThe story might have ended then and there, were it not for this reporter\u2019s chance viewing of a photograph of the original portrait in a scrapbook in Jean\u2019s keep. Jean revealed that Dudley, now in his 80s, was the artist responsible and was alive and well in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThe question then begged. Sixty years on, would Dudley be up for the job of repainting the portrait from the photograph of the original? Remarkably, Dudley explained that the very thought had recently crossed his mind and that yes, he would commit to the task of recreating the image of Deacon, who died suddenly while serving Carlton as club secretary back in 1974.\n\nAnd so it was that the new version of the old Bert Deacon was this week unveiled by Dudley in the presence of Bert\u2019s widow, Jean and son Robert. The portrait is basically true to the original, but boasts one slight embellishment - Dudley has painted in Bert\u2019s \u201947 Brownlow, which can be seen dangling from the trophy.\n\n\u201cTo think that 60 years on I\u2019ve brought that painting back to life,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a great story?\u201d\n\nDudley has also just completed a work of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road, based on a press photograph Bert handed him years before.\n\n\u201cBert had given me a copy of this photograph, which carried a handwritten message in the top left hand corner \u2013 \u2018To my friend Dud - regards, Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Drew said.\n\nRegrettably the photograph was later stolen and all was thought lost . . . until early last year when Jean again came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cI went out to Jean\u2019s house and sat down with her, during which time she showed me the family photo album . . . that\u2019s where I came across another copy of this photograph,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Jean, you must let me borrow this. I want to paint this picture\u2019. That happened about a year and a half ago\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the past nine months, Drew, now in his early 80s, has put brush to canvas to recreate the Deacon image. The paint was still drying when he recently unveiled the canvas.\n\n\u201cBert actually told me that the Richmond fellow in front of the marking contest is George Smeaton and Jack Wrout is sandwiched between them,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\u201cRon Savage is the Carlton player watching on, but I\u2019m not sure of the identity of the other Richmond player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Drew is somewhat circumspect when asked what will become of the Bert Deacon artworks. Perhaps a Carlton-friendly benefactor might see fit to purchase the paintings and make them available on permanent loan to the Club.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the life of a painting,\u201d said the man who has also painted the portraits of such luminaries as Archbishop Daniel Mannix, King O\u2019Malley and \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.\n\nBut there can be no doubting the strength of the lifelong bond Dudley and Bert forged from the moment they met at the house in Hawker Avenue back in \u201948.\n\n\u201cI had a friendship with and a great admiration for this fellow, and his wife Jean,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cBert and I became great friends and I could tell you many stories about him. He was a wonderful man. The day he died I remember picking up a paper. It was all over the front page and I just cried.\n\n\u201cOne night we met in the city and we were on our way to my parents place in Albert Park for dinner. We caught the tram here as he didn\u2019t have a car then, nor did I. And I remember saying to him, I should have been as tall as you Bert, and he said to me \u2018Dud, diamonds were never made as big as bricks\u2019. So that made me feel good and every time I see someone bigger than me I think of the diamond.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://www.westberkshirewarmemorials.org.uk/texts/stories/WBP01040S.php", "page_content": "Officers Steward Class I Albert Thomas Deacon, HMS Narborough\n\n\n\nBert was born on 7 January 1888 in Greenham; he was the eldest son of Thomas Deacon and his wife Annie n\u00e9e Kealing. He had an older sister, Elizabeth (born 1884) and younger siblings, Eva Nellie (1890), Kate Maria (1 Sep 1892), Edith (1896), Philip (13 Aug 1899) and Mabel Annie (1905). In 1901 the family was living at Daisy Cottage, Greenham but moved to 2 Holly Bank (now 71), King\u2019s Road in Newbury around 1894/5.\n\n\n\n\n\nBert's grave at Lyness on the island of Hoy. (Lyness Cemetery Blog)\n\nThomas was considerably older than Annie, in 1911 he was recorded in the census, aged 60, at home with several of the children while Annie was a live-in housekeeper for Samuel Burridge and his family in Arlington Cottages, Newbury. It was unusual for a wife to be working away from home; perhaps Thomas was finding it difficult to find work as a labourer - suggesting that his health may have been failing? Three years later he died, aged 63.\n\n\n\nBert opted for a radically different career path to that of his father, starting as a book stall assistant as soon as he left school he then went into domestic service as a footman. Whilst this may raise thoughts of Downton Abbey (filmed at nearby Highclere Castle), Bert was at the parental home in King\u2019s Road for the 1911 census \u2013 an odd place for a footman. Of course he could have been given the night off if his employers were away for the weekend, or he could have been employed at a house where there was inadequate servants quarters to house the entire staff \u2013 or he could have been \u2018between jobs\u2019.\n\n\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914 Bert did not rush to sign up, waiting until 17 September 1915 to volunteer, not for the army, but for the senior service, the Royal Navy. His employment as a footman was evidently noted by those responsible for Navy postings, after a very short period of training in Portsmouth he was sent to serve as an Officer\u2019s Steward Class II on HMS Zealandia. HMS Zealandia (formerly HMS New Zealand) was a pre-Dreadnought battleship, powerful but out-dated, nevertheless an important part of the Grand Fleet based at Rossyth in Scotland. Soon after Bert joined her the Zealandia was sent to the Mediterranean to support the Dardanelles campaign returning in February 1916 after the withdrawal from the Gallipoli peninsular. HMS Zealandia rejoined the Grand Fleet on 16 March 1916 and was then transferred to the Nore command in May. On 26 July Bert was promoted to Officer\u2019s Steward Class I. In December 1916 the Zealandia went to Chatham Dockyard for a long refit, halfway through which Bert\u2019s services were deemed unnecessary. He was returned to Portsmouth in April 1917 for reassignment. He did not get another ship until October (no doubt an officer\u2019s mess in Portsmouth found him useful).\n\n\n\n\n\nHMS Narborough. (Imperial War Museum)\n\nHis new ship was HMS Narborough, a modern (launched 1916) M Class destroyer that formed part of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla based at Scapa Flow. In early January 1918 the Narborough and a sister ship, HMS Opal, were at sea escorting the light cruiser HMS Boadicea on a patrol against German mine layers when a severe snowstorm forced them to abandon the patrol and return to Scapa Flow. On the return journey at night on 12 January 1918, in appalling visibility, the Opal struck rocks off South Ronaldsay, the Narborough, following the Opal, struck 80 yards away. Both destroyers were lost with only one survivor (Able Seaman William Sisson from HMS Opal), in all 188 men lost their lives, some drowned, others died of exposure after making it to the cliffs (Sisson was found alive on the cliff 36 hours after the wreck).\n\nHis death was announced in the local paper:\n\nNewbury Weekly News, 24 January 1918 \u2013 Died on Service\n\nDEACON \u2013 Jan 12, Albert (Bert), eldest and dearly loved son of Mrs Deacon, 2, Hollybank Terrace, King\u2019s-road, lost his life on the \u201cNarborough,\u201d off the coast of Scotland, when returning to base, the ship becoming a total wreck through a terrific gale and snowstorm.\n\nHad He asked us, well we know\n\nWe should cry, \u201cOh spare this blow,\u201d\n\nYes, with streaming tears we should pray,\n\nLord we love him, let him stay.\n\nFrom his sorrowing Mother, Sisters and Brother.\n\nBert's name on Newbury War Memorial (top centre)\n\nBert\u2019s body was one of the few recovered and buried in grave B.164A at Lyness Naval Cemetery, which he shares with an unidentified shipmate.

Deacon Bert Cambre died peacefully, surrounded by his family at Burlington's Joseph Brant Hospital March 29. \"He was an icon of Christ the servant, especially when it came to reaching out to try to gather the marginalized,\" said Stephen Pitre, Toronto's co-ordinator of diaconal ministry. Deacon Cambre grew the office for deacons at the archdiocese of Toronto in 2000 and ran it for 10 years. He was a careful steward of the community of deacons and always attentive to the deacons' wives and widows.\n\nAn immigrant from Argentina, an engineer and a successful businessman, Deacon Cambre was most proud of his 30 years as a deacon in St. Gabriel's parish in Toronto, St. Francis Xavier in Mississauga and St. Christopher's in Mississauga.\n\n\n\nDavid Zuber of Mississauga remembered the day Cambre presided at his marriage.\n\n\n\n\"He wished for us that we have the great marriage that he and (his wife) Terry had,\" wrote Zuber in a Toronto newspaper's online obituary column. \"I think of those words often. He made our special day that much more special.\"\n\nDeacon Cambre helped establish new ministries to some of the most marginalized people in the archdiocese. He was there at the beginning of the Friends of Dismas, an ecumenical ministry to ex-convicts. He pioneered El Sembrador, which ministers to about 700 Hispanic migrant workers who come every year to work on farms in the Holland Marsh north of Toronto. He encouraged deacons to work with addicts, prostitutes and the mentally ill on the streets in downtown Toronto.\n\n\n\nThe diaconate program in Toronto was so successful other dioceses sought advice from Deacon Cambre when they decided to establish the diaconate for themselves.\n\n\n\n\"Bert was a very passionate and vigourous promoter of the diaconate,\" said Pitre. \"He was a great support and advocate for deacons, especially when they were having trouble.\"\n\n\n\nHe may have ruffled a few feathers along the way, but nobody will recall him as anything but kind, said Pitre.\n\n\n\nDeacon Cambre was ordained June 18, 1983 and his wife Maria Teresa was along for the ride the whole way.

Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old. The football world was rocked to its core by the news, and there was widespread grief at the loss of one of football\u2019s favourite sons \u2013 a man whose dignity and integrity transcended club loyalties and brought him genuine admiration. Winning and losing mattered much to Bert Deacon, but so did how the game was played.The Deacon family tradition continued at Preston with his brother Bill acting as President from 1983 to 1987, a period that saw the club become the first in V.F.A. history to take out premierships at the Firsts, Seconds and Thirds levels in 1983 and again the following year. Bill's widow, Maisie has had the honour of the Preston and now Northern Bullant No. 1 membership for many years50 Games : Round 15, 1947 Vs Footscray100 Games : Round 2, 1951 Vs Footscray"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/bert-deacon/", "page_content": "Bert Deacon (8 November 1922 \u2013 3 January 1974) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He is remembered for being Carlton's first ever Brownlow Medal winner.\n\nInitially a centreman, Deacon began his senior career at Preston in the Victorian Football Association. Carlton signed Deacon in March 1941, one day before his residential address in Preston, which had previously been unallotted, became part of Fitzroy's zone. He joined the army during World War II, and from 1942 until 1945 played most of his football for services teams, including acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a 1945 services competition in Darwin. However, he also made his league debut with Carlton and played eight games between 1942 and 1944 whenever he was stationed in Melbourne.\n\nDeacon returned permanently to Melbourne in mid-1945. He played a few games for Preston, then was cleared to and Carlton and played there permanently for the next seven years. Adept at all key positions, he quickly established himself at centre half back with Carlton. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 and 1947, and in the latter in a year which he won the Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. He was the first Carlton player to win the award.\n\nDeacon was held in extremely high regard throughout the league for his quality key position play in the years immediately following the war. In 1945, despite having played only half of the season, the Age sportswriter Percy Beames lauded Deacon's \"great versatility and sustained brilliance through each game\", and said he was perhaps the best key player since the early days of Laurie Nash. Deacon was also noted as a very fair player, and one of the few remembered for gentlemanly behaviour in the notoriously violent 1945 VFL Grand Final \u2013 when he helped his 17-year-old opponent Ron Clegg, who had been concussed in a behind-the-play incident, first to face the right direction to take a free kick, then to protect him from joining the outbreaking violence.\n\nDeacon struggled with injuries in his last couple of years with Carlton. He left Carlton after the 1951 season, Deacon returned to Preston as captain-coach. He retired as a player after 1953, and continued as non-playing coach until he end of 1956. He later served as Carlton vice-president and club secretary.\n\nHe is the centre half back in Carlton's official 'Team of the Century', and was one of the inaugural players elevated to Legend status in the Carlton Football Club Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nOff the field, Deacon worked for many years for long-serving VFL and Carlton president Sir Kenneth Luke.\n\nDeacon died of a heart attack at age 51 on 3 January 1974 while on holiday at Balnarring despite the desperate efforts of his Preston team-mate, Pat Foley, to revive him."}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/798452/for-dizzy-one-game-was-an-honour", "page_content": "As a Carlton senior footballer he ran out but once wearing the famous button-up dark Navy Blue guernsey with the No.47 on the back.\n\nIt happened almost 50 years ago - but Daryl Gutterson always deemed it an honour to wear that jumper.\n\nNow, in the wake of Daryl\u2019s untimely passing at the age of 67, the item carries even greater poignancy for the loved ones he leaves behind.\n\nPictured from left to right is the late Daryl Gutterson\u2019s son Brent, daughter Emmilee, wife Robyn and son Rhys, proudly displaying Daryl\u2019s treasured Carlton guernsey worn into his one and only senior appearance for the Blues, Round 10, 1971.\n\nZoned to Carlton (but only just as the dividing line with Fitzroy was across the road from his family\u2019s home in Derrick Street, Lalor), Daryl, then an impressionable 16 year-old, joined fellow Lalor player Ian Cartwright in the move to Princes Park in 1969 \u2013 in what was a magnificent epoch in Carlton history.\n\nA second cousin of the seven-game Footscray player and 1962 Gardiner Medallist Jim Gutterson, Daryl \u2013 or \u2018Dizzy\u2019 as Brent Crosswell dubbed him for his breathtaking turn of speed - first turned out for the Bill Hoogen-coached Under 19s.\n\nHe progressed through the reserves - initially under the watch of the late Keith McKenzie \u2013 and in 1971 finally earned his one and only call-up, ironically against the Lions, in the Round 10 match at Princes Park.\n\nHaving blown out the candles on his 18th birthday cake just 27 days earlier, Daryl featured in another first when he followed \u2018Big Nick\u2019 down the race in that maiden senior appearance.\n\nFor this was also the game in which Carlton coach Ron Barassi and Fitzroy coach Graham Donaldson (Daryl\u2019s reserve grade coach at Carlton the previous year), famously agreed to trial the 50-yard centre square, within which only four players from each team were permitted to frequent at the centre bounce.\n\nCarlton Secretary Bert Deacon\u2019s letter welcoming Daryl Gutterson to the senior supplementary list, July 1970\n\nNamed 20TH man on the bench alongside John Warden (wearing the No.46), the budding wingman with a thumping left foot got the call-up early in his solitary senior appearance and stood both David Rhodes and Treva McGregor, eight weeks after McGregor took out the \u201971 Stawell Gift \u2013 the last League footballer to win the coveted footrace.\n\nDaryl\u2019s oldest son Brent (so named after Crosswell his long-time friend) said that a lack of application in his tender years probably went against his father.\n\n\u201cAfter making his senior debut against Fitzroy in \u201971, Dad played the rest of that year in the reserves . . . and he played on in the twos until the end of \u201973,\u201d Brent said.\n\n\u201cAlthough \u2018Barass\u2019 liked Dad as a footballer, Dad always told me that with the likes of Garry Crane, Ian Robertson and Bryan Quirk going around, it was a case of \u2018right place, wrong time\u2019 for him.\n\n\u201cBeing a young guy, Dad probably thought natural talent would get him through . . . and in the end a run-in with \u2018Barass\u2019 didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe run-in\u201d to which Brent referred took place on another occasion, when Daryl was kicking the dew of the grass.\n\nA former teammate, the 1968 Premiership player Ian Collins, recalled the incident.\n\n\u201cDaryl was quite a clever wing/half-forward, although he wasn\u2019t very big and was quite light. Anyway he was playing in the reserves this particular day and at half-time, while we were stripping for the senior match, he walked into the room,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cBarassi lined Daryl up and told him he was shirking the issue. Barass grabbed him by the throat and tried to put him into one of the lockers. The locker was about half the size of Daryl, but Barass was trying to force him headfirst into it.\u201d\n\nLittle did Barassi realise that Daryl, a southpaw, was a more than handy amateur welterweight, and retribution came swiftly \u2013 courtesy a left hook across the chops - which split the coach\u2019s lip and drew blood in the process.\n\nNot surprisingly, Daryl, at 21, and with 68 reserve grade matches and the one solitary senior appearance to his name, parted company with the club he loved. He sought a clearance to Fitzroy, but the Blues played hard ball and so he crossed to VFA outfit Brunswick.\n\nBy the age of 28, after having represented Watsonia in the Diamond Valley Football League, Daryl opted to give the game away - his commitment to work as a sales rep for a fittings and bearings business taking precedence.\n\n\u201cThough he loved Carlton, Dad always thought that if he\u2019d lived on the other side of Derrick Street he might have been a 100-game Fitzroy player given the players he was competing against at Princes Park in that era,\u201d Brent said.\n\nBut Daryl always kept a soft spot for Princes Park and its people. He was a regular at Spirit of Carlton functions and only recently took great delight in seeing Callum Moore getting around in the old No.47.\n\nDaryl Gutterson, Princes Park, 1970\n\n\u201cDad used to say to me \u201cI only played one game\u2019, but I\u2019d tell him \u2018Dad, you played in exalted company \u2013 the company of absolute legends of the VFL/AFL\u2019 and I\u2019d have given anything to have run out once in a senior game wearing a Carlton guernsey,\u201d said Brent - himself a Carlton reserve grade player who trained with the likes of Bradley, Fevola, Koutoufides and Ratten through 2002 - and took goalkicking honours with 30 from a half-forward flank.\n\n\u201cDad played in a magnificent era at Carlton with Crane, Crosswell, Gallagher, Jackson, Jesaulenko, McKay, Nicholls, Robertson and Walls \u2013 famous names that are still talked about now.\n\n\u201cAs a person, Dad was a pure gentleman. He wanted to know everyone\u2019s stories. When I was playing he used to follow me down to the games and we\u2019d talk footy, because footy brought him so much joy.\u201d\n\nThe four-time Carlton Premiership player David McKay, as with Collins another of Daryl\u2019s old teammates, remembered the one-game wingman as \u201ca good player who like so many of his time found it difficult to break into the side\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut that one game meant so much to Daryl. He was proud of his association with Carlton and he was loved and respected by his former teammates,\u201d McKay said.\n\n\u201cHe was a terrific fellow too. Every time you saw him at a past players function, which was often, his face lit up. He had a rough look about him, but underneath beat a heart of gold.\u201d\n\nDaryl Gutterson, January 2020\n\nDaryl died in the Intensive Care Unit of Heidelberg\u2019s Austin Hospital on Thursday, August 13, after suffering a cardiac arrest five days previous. He is survived by his wife Robyn (a niece of Carlton\u2019s first Brownlow Medallist Bert Deacon), sons Brent and Rhys, daughter Emmilee and their respective spouses, and six grandchildren.\n\nThe funeral service for Daryl Graeme Gutterson will be held next Monday, August 24, commencing 11.00am.

Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}, {"url": "https://igpp.fudan.edu.cn/igppen/c0/61/c20933a180321/page.htm", "page_content": "1.

However, services are increasingly storing data across many servers shared with other data owners. An example of this is cloud computing which has the great potential of providing various services to the society at significantly reduced cost due to aggregated management of elastic resources. Since software systems are not guaranteed to be bug-free and hardware platforms are not under direct control of data owners in such distributed systems, security risks are abundant. To mitigate users\u2019 security and privacy concerns about their data, a common solution is to outsource data in encrypted form so that it will remain private even if data servers are not trusted or compromised. The encrypted data, however, must be amenable to sharing and access control. In this talk, I will discuss various security issues related to outsourced data storage and provide an overview of emerging solutions for realizing secure access to encrypted data in untrusted servers.\n\n\n\n"}], "Bert Deacon was an Australian rules footballer.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bert_Deacon", "page_content": "Bertrand John Deacon (8 November 1922 \u2013 3 January 1974) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

He joined the Blues in 1942, and was a key member of premiership teams in both 1945 and his Brownlow year of 1947.

Amongst the players recruited from Sydney is a player who kicked the winning goal in a VFL grand final, a Norm Smith medallist, eleven premiership players and a couple of record-holding goal kickers. It is a record of achievement that deserves more kudos.\n\nIn comparison, although one must preface this by stating I don\u2019t have an intimate knowledge of rugby league recruiting, this figure of 80 players from Sydney to the VFL/AFL would presumably be larger than the combined number of rugby league players recruited from Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin rugby league clubs to the NRL.\n\nDecade by decade- number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL/AFL\n\n1897-1909 \u2013 4 players\n\n1910s \u2013 6 players\n\n1920s \u2013 12 players\n\n1930s \u2013 10 players\n\n1940s \u2013 2 players\n\n1950s \u2013 7 players\n\n1960s \u2013 1 player\n\n1970s \u2013 5 players\n\n1980s \u2013 11 players\n\n1990s \u2013 9 players\n\n2000s \u2013 11 players\n\n2010-11 \u2013 2 players\n\nIn 2012, there are 20 players who have been recruited from Sydney who are on AFL lists. Eight of these twenty have debuted in league football.\n\n1897-1910\n\nSydney\u2019s first player: Bob Kenny\n\nBob Kenny was the first player recruited from a Sydney club to play in the VFL. He debuted in 1899 and played just two games for St Kilda. He was followed soon after by John Stephenson, who was recruited from the Balmain football club and played 10 games for Essendon in 1907. Marshall Herbert, a recruit from Redfern, was the most successful of these early Sydney recruits, as he played 51 games with the Pies from 1908 to 1910. At this stage it should be noted that the only major football code that competed with Australian football in Sydney for players was rugby union, as rugby league was not played in Sydney until 1908.\n\n1910s\n\nThe 1910s was a decade that resulted in the recruitment of two Sydneysiders who had a significant impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYERS: Bob Merrick and Chris Laird. Recruited from East Sydney, Merrick established a goal-kicking record for his adopted Victorian team of Fitzroy in 1919 when he kicked a total of 12 goals in a match. This feat of 12 goals in a match was never bettered by any other Fitzroy player in the history of that club. Bob headed Fitzroy\u2019s goalkicking list each year between 1919-22.\n\nThe other Sydneysider to have an impact in the big league during this decade was Chris Laird. He was recruited from the eastern suburbs club of Paddington and is one of the few players in the history of the game to live the dream of kicking a clutch goal in a grand final with just vital seconds remaining in the match. Laird changed the fortune of the 1918 VFL grand final when he kicked the winning goal for South Melbourne with less than a minute remaining in the match.\n\n1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw a twofold increase over the previous decade in the number of players from Sydney making the transition to the best Australian football competition in the land. Six Sydneysiders played in the VFL in the 1910s and as many as twelve Sydneysiders were recruited in the 1920s.\n\nFred Davies, who was another recruit from Sydney\u2019s Eastern Suburbs, was the pick of the\n\nSydney recruits in this decade. His most notable achievement was being named as the captain of Fitzroy in 1934. Nevertheless, few of the other Sydney players had a large impact during this decade.\n\n1930s\n\nTen players from Sydney made the transition to the VFL in the 1930s. The pick of the players was Newtown\u2019s Reg Garvin.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Reg Garvin\n\nBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,\n\nReg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in\n\n1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club. Reg GarvinBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,Reg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club.\n\n1940s\n\nThe 1940s was a decade in which there was a noticeable drop-off in the numbers of high quality players making their way from Sydney clubs to the VFL, obviously due to WWII. Ron Hall, from St George, was one of only two players recruited from Sydney to the VFL in the 1940s. The other player was Arthur Richardson, who played just five games for the Swans.\n\n1950s\n\nThe 1950s was another decade in which only a small number of Sydney players were recruited to the top league. One of the recruits, however, had a large impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Roger Duffy \u2013\n\nAnother Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). Roger Duffy \u2013Another Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951. He was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states. Duffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). His premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). 1960s\n\nThe 1960s was Sydney footballs lowest point in terms of the number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL. Barry Fitzgerald was the only player recruited directly from a Sydney club to the VFL during this decade. And he played just 35 games for Fitzroy. 1970s\n\nThe 1970s can be viewed as a decade of revival for football recruiting from Sydney. Whilst the 1960s was a low point in terms of player recruitment, the 1970s saw the recruitment of two stars of the game \u2013 Mark Marclure and Michael Byrne. STAR PLAYER:Mark Maclure\n\nMaclure played junior football for East Sydney and also won the Sanders Medal as the best player in Sydney\u2019s reserve grade competition as a 17 year old. From there he tried out with Carlton\u2019s under 19s team and was eventually lured to Carlton by their master recruiter Bert Deacon. Of all the players to have been recruited from Sydney, Mark Maclure is the player who can boast as having the greatest CV. On top of his list of achievements is being a member of three premiership teams (1979, 1981 and 1982). Maclure is the only player recruited from a Sydney football club to have played in as many as three VFL/AFL premiership teams. On top of this, he was the captain of his AFL club (in 1986), won his club\u2019s goal kicking award (1979 and 1985) and played over 200 games for his beloved Blues. STAR PLAYER: Michael Byrne\n\nMichael Byrne is Sydney born and raised, having come through the ranks of local Sydney football on the northern beaches and then playing for the Sydney club of North Shore. Byrne\u2019s induction into football was a tough one, as he played in the ruck for North Shore in the bloodbath Sydney grand final of 1976 at Trumper Park. This match was infamous in Sydney football for being punctuated by rolling brawls involving almost every player on the ground. After he left Sydney, Byrne became a premiership player with Hawthorn in 1983 and he produced on the big day, as he was the 2nd highest goal kicker for Hawthorn in the grand final after the legendary Leigh Matthews. Playing during Hawthorn\u2019s greatest era. Byrne also had the honour of being runner up for the club\u2019s best and fairest in 1984. 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of the Sydney Swans into the VFL competition and it was a decade in which there was a large upswing in the numbers of players recruited from Sydney. Only one player (1960s) and five players (1970s) made the transition to the top league in the two previous decades, but 11 players made the transition in the 1980s. Amongst these players was St George\u2019s Mark Roberts, who was a premiership player with North Melbourne in 1996. 1990s\n\nThe 1990s was a remarkable decade in terms of the contribution of Sydney footballers to the AFL. It was the starting point for the careers of three Sydneysiders who played over 200 games of AFL football. The three players from Sydney who pulled on the guernsey in over 200 games of AFL football were Mark McVeigh [pictured left] (Essendon), Lenny Hayes (St Kilda) and Greg Stafford (Sydney and Richmond). McVeigh and Hayes were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club and Greg Stafford was recruited from Western Suburbs. STAR PLAYER: Lenny Hayes\n\nHayes became the first player from Sydney to win the Norm Smith medal. His last quarter performance in the 2010 grand final for the Saints was one for the record books, as he willed his team back into the contest by obtaining 11 possessions as well as kicking an inspiring goal from 50 metres out.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Nick Davis\n\nNick Davis, recruited from Ramsgate juniors, didn\u2019t have the longevity of career that Hayes, McVeigh or Stafford had, but he produced one of the defining moments in finals history and arguably the Swan\u2019s greatest moment outside the 2005 grand final when he kicked four goals in the last quarter of the 2005 semi-final against Geelong. That blitz of goal turned the match around and secured the Swans a vital 3-point victory and the passage to a grand final victory. 2000s\n\nTwo exceptional footballers were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club in the 1990s (Lenny Hayes and Mark McVeigh), and the feat was replicated in the noughties, as two further Pennant Hills juniors of exceptional talent, Jarrad McVeigh and Kieran Jack, made their transition to the AFL. STAR PLAYER: Jarrad McVeigh\n\nMcVeigh won the Sydney Swan\u2019s best and fairest award in 2008. This was a noticeable feat as McVeigh became the first player to be recruited from a local Sydney football club to win the award. It took 26 years after the club started in Sydney for a Sydney local to win the award, yet it only took a further two years for the next Sydney local to win the award when Kieran Jack was deemed Sydney\u2019s best and fairest player in 2010. STAR PLAYER: Kieran Jack\n\nJack started his career for the Swans as a dogged tagger in 2007, yet it was only three years later that he won the club best and fairest award. Displaying unbridled determination, Kieran Jack won the award in 2010 largely because he had become a vital attacking option for the Swans. In his best and fairest year of 2010, Jack kicked 21 goals whilst still largely working in the midfield. In 2012, he is in contention for All-Australian selection as he continues to combine attacking flair with an ability to win the contested ball. Many may question if the introduction of the Swans has been a success, yet from a recruiting viewpoint for Sydneysiders it has been. Only one player from Sydney in the 80 years prior to the Swans introduction into the Sydney sporting landscape played over 200 games of top grade football. Since the Swans moved to Sydney there have been three 200 game players from Sydney . The players recruited from Sydney clubs in the years ahead will be following in the footsteps of exceptional footballers such as Roger Duffy, Michael Byrne, Lenny Hayes and the McVeigh brothers amongst others. Over the journey, the record of Sydneysiders at the top level is far better than what many would presume is the case\u201c there have been premiership players, club captains, club coaches, and best and fairest winners. Sydneysiders have achieved at the highest level of the Australian game, but just not with all the fanfare of players from other cities.

It took 26 years after the club started in Sydney for a Sydney local to win the award, yet it only took a further two years for the next Sydney local to win the award when Kieran Jack was deemed Sydney\u2019s best and fairest player in 2010.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Kieran Jack\n\nJack started his career for the Swans as a dogged tagger in 2007, yet it was only three years later that he won the club best and fairest award. Displaying unbridled determination,\n\nKieran Jack won the award in 2010 largely because he had become a vital attacking option for the Swans. In his best and fairest year of 2010, Jack kicked 21 goals whilst still largely working in the midfield. In 2012, he is in contention for All-Australian selection as he continues to combine attacking flair with an ability to win the contested ball.\n\nMany may question if the introduction of the Swans has been a success, yet from a recruiting viewpoint for Sydneysiders it has been. Only one player from Sydney in the 80 years prior to the Swans introduction into the Sydney sporting landscape played over 200 games of top grade football. Since the Swans moved to Sydney there have been three 200 game players from Sydney .\n\nThe players recruited from Sydney clubs in the years ahead will be following in the footsteps of exceptional footballers such as Roger Duffy, Michael Byrne, Lenny Hayes and the McVeigh brothers amongst others. Over the journey, the record of Sydneysiders at the top level is far better than what many would presume is the case\u201c there have been premiership players, club captains, club coaches, and best and fairest winners. Sydneysiders have achieved at the highest level of the Australian game, but just not with all the fanfare of players from other cities."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Bert-Deacon", "page_content": "Bert Deacon (8 November 1922 \u2013 3 January 1974) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He is remembered for being Carlton's first ever Brownlow Medal winner.\n\nA centre half back, Deacon began his league career in 1942. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 (after acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a services competition in Darwin) and 1947, the latter in a year which he won both a Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. The previous season Deacon had finished fourth in the Brownlow Medal count but this time around finished on top, thus becoming Carlton's inaugural winner of the award.\n\nDeacon left Carlton after the 1951 season and became captain-coach for Preston in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the club where he had played for prior to being recruited by Carlton. He later served as Carlton vice-president and club secretary.\n\nHe is the centre half back in Carlton's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nOff the field, Deacon worked for many years for long-serving VFL and Carlton president Sir Kenneth Luke.

After all, Deacon had just come off a stellar season, having taken out the 1947 Brownlow Medal, represented Carlton in its eighth premiership and earned Victorian and All-Australian selection.\n\nHow well Dudley remembers the moment. \u201cMy mother was blind, and when Bert won the Brownlow I was sitting with Mum in the bedroom talking to her one night and she said, \u2018You should paint a portrait of Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Dudley explained.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 and she said \u2018I think it will be wonderful for you\u2019. I then said \u2018How do I do this?\u2019 and she said \u2018Go and see him\u2019.\u201d\n\nDudley made his way to 2 Hawker Avenue, Preston, where Bert and Jean then lived. \u201cWhen I got there this particular night, around about seven o\u2019clock, Bert was already in bed because he was injured - he\u2019d injured his leg playing football, but he and Jean just welcomed me so much. It was great and I felt so proud,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI then asked Bert if he would pose for the big portrait and he said \u2018I\u2019d be very happy to do that\u2019. He sat for the portrait about eight times and I remember in one sitting he began to smile, exposing this toothless gap. He was painted sporting grey trousers and navy blue blazer with the white V on the pocket and included in the painting is a trophy Bert also won for best afield for Victoria.\n\n\u201cTowards the end Bert said, \u2018You know I really love this painting and I\u2019m going to tell everybody about the greatest artist in the world\u2019, and he did. He sent many people to me to have their portraits painted. He was just great. No wonder I cried when he went to heaven.\n\nThough Bert and his wife Jean were thrilled with Dudley\u2019s gift, they had nowhere in their small home to hang the sizeable canvas. For a brief period the portrait found a wall in the city sports store of the former Collingwood footballer Ron Todd, but at some point in 1948 it was returned to Dudley\u2019s home and stored in a shed \u2013 which is where the work unfortunately came to grief.\n\nAs the artist explained, the painting toppled on to a steel table which pierced the canvas beyond repair.\n\nThe story might have ended then and there, were it not for this reporter\u2019s chance viewing of a photograph of the original portrait in a scrapbook in Jean\u2019s keep. Jean revealed that Dudley, now in his 80s, was the artist responsible and was alive and well in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThe question then begged. Sixty years on, would Dudley be up for the job of repainting the portrait from the photograph of the original? Remarkably, Dudley explained that the very thought had recently crossed his mind and that yes, he would commit to the task of recreating the image of Deacon, who died suddenly while serving Carlton as club secretary back in 1974.\n\nAnd so it was that the new version of the old Bert Deacon was this week unveiled by Dudley in the presence of Bert\u2019s widow, Jean and son Robert. The portrait is basically true to the original, but boasts one slight embellishment - Dudley has painted in Bert\u2019s \u201947 Brownlow, which can be seen dangling from the trophy.\n\n\u201cTo think that 60 years on I\u2019ve brought that painting back to life,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a great story?\u201d\n\nDudley has also just completed a work of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road, based on a press photograph Bert handed him years before.\n\n\u201cBert had given me a copy of this photograph, which carried a handwritten message in the top left hand corner \u2013 \u2018To my friend Dud - regards, Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Drew said.\n\nRegrettably the photograph was later stolen and all was thought lost . . . until early last year when Jean again came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cI went out to Jean\u2019s house and sat down with her, during which time she showed me the family photo album . . . that\u2019s where I came across another copy of this photograph,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Jean, you must let me borrow this. I want to paint this picture\u2019. That happened about a year and a half ago\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the past nine months, Drew, now in his early 80s, has put brush to canvas to recreate the Deacon image. The paint was still drying when he recently unveiled the canvas.\n\n\u201cBert actually told me that the Richmond fellow in front of the marking contest is George Smeaton and Jack Wrout is sandwiched between them,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\u201cRon Savage is the Carlton player watching on, but I\u2019m not sure of the identity of the other Richmond player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Drew is somewhat circumspect when asked what will become of the Bert Deacon artworks. Perhaps a Carlton-friendly benefactor might see fit to purchase the paintings and make them available on permanent loan to the Club.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the life of a painting,\u201d said the man who has also painted the portraits of such luminaries as Archbishop Daniel Mannix, King O\u2019Malley and \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.\n\nBut there can be no doubting the strength of the lifelong bond Dudley and Bert forged from the moment they met at the house in Hawker Avenue back in \u201948.\n\n\u201cI had a friendship with and a great admiration for this fellow, and his wife Jean,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cBert and I became great friends and I could tell you many stories about him. He was a wonderful man. The day he died I remember picking up a paper. It was all over the front page and I just cried.\n\n\u201cOne night we met in the city and we were on our way to my parents place in Albert Park for dinner. We caught the tram here as he didn\u2019t have a car then, nor did I. And I remember saying to him, I should have been as tall as you Bert, and he said to me \u2018Dud, diamonds were never made as big as bricks\u2019.

Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}], "Bert Deacon played for the Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).": [{"url": "https://www.afl.com.au/news/503359/the-story-of-dudley-drew-and-the-lost-painting-of-bert-deacon", "page_content": "\n\nDudley Drew talks to CFC TV about his memories of his friend Bert Deacon, and about the painting he has just completed of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road.\n\nClick here to view the video\n\nBack in 1948, a budding Melbourne artist named Dudley Drew was trying to eke out an existence in his adopted profession when, on the advice of his dear mother, he resolved to paint somebody famous.\n\nDudley\u2019s Mum volunteered the name of Carlton centre half-back the late great Bert Deacon.

He joined the Blues in 1942, and was a key member of premiership teams in both 1945 and his Brownlow year of 1947. Strong overhead and brilliant at ground level, he effectively constituted the first line of attack for the Blues, with his superb anticipation frequently enabling him to intercept the ball and return it with interest, almost invariably to his team's advantage.\n\nIn 1952, Deacon returned to his original club Preston as captain-coach.

Office the field, Deacon worked for many years for long-serving VFL and Carlton president Sir Kenneth Luke. Bertram Deacon died of a heart attack on 3 January 1974 while on holiday at Balnarring.

But even before he took the field for Carlton, Clover had to conquer the odds on the battlefields of France in World War 1. From Maryborough in central Victoria, Horrie enlisted in the 1st AIF in September 1915. After basic training, he embarked for France with reinforcements for the 7th Battalion in January of 1916. Soon pitched into the horrors of trench warfare, he fought and survived until September of that year, when he was transferred to a machine gun company and promoted to the rank of Corporal. On Christmas day, 1916, Horrie was struck down with acute appendicitis. He was evacuated to a field hospital for emergency surgery, where the doctors discovered that his appendix was gangrenous and that his life was in danger. He was immediately transferred to London for specialist treatment, and months of recuperation. Pronounced unfit for further front-line service, he was repatriated back to Australia in August 1917, and honourably discharged in May of the following year \u2013 six months before the Armistice. Having recovered, and keen to have a crack at senior football, Clover trained with Richmond and Melbourne before Carlton gave him an opportunity at VFL level. And how he delivered! In his first match in 1920 \u2013 ironically, against Richmond - he kicked four goals from centre half-forward, and hit the post three times! By the end of his first season at Princes Park, Clover was one of Carlton\u2019s drawcards. Former Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was just one of the many Carlton fans who were captivated; \u201che was the most artistic of high marks, unforgettable at half-forward,\u201d said Menzies. Horrie could kick a football, too. A balanced, deceptively quick mover, he was a glorious running drop-kick for goal. Playing against Richmond again at Princes Park in July, 1921, he let fly with a monster kick that was later measured at 86.26 metres \u2013 that\u2019s 94 yards, 2 feet in imperial terms! And there are numerous other instances where he roosted the ball more than 70 metres. In round 12 of 1921, he slotted 13 goals in a game against St Kilda; a club record which still stands today. The Blues made the finals in third place in 1921 and battled through to meet Richmond for the Premiership. Then the heavens above the MCG opened up on the day before the decider, turning the ground into a quagmire. In what was to be Clover\u2019s only Grand Final appearance, Richmond won a slogging, mauling contest by four points. While Premiership glory eluded him, Horrie was Carlton\u2019s top goalkicker in three of his first four seasons, including 1922, where his total of 58 was the competition\u2019s best. He was appointed captain of the Blues that same year, and in 1923 took on the dual role of captain-coach. Over 1924 / 1925, he suffered more debilitating illness that prevented him from playing all season. Unable to pull on his football boots, he took on the job of Club Secretary, and continued in that position even after returning to the field in 1926. When he did eventually resume, he formed a new, powerful Carlton forward set-up with a young Harry \u201cSoapy\u201d Vallence at full-forward. Twice more \u2013 in 1926 and 1928, Clover\u2019s brilliance and accuracy in front of goal saw him at the top of Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking, and in 1929 \u2013 aged 34, he was honoured with the captaincy of Victoria against WA in his ninth and final game in the Big Vee. show_image.php?id=205 Horrie Clover retired as a player in 1931 after 147 games. His total of 396 goals is still ranked fifth best in Carlton\u2019s proud history (only displaced for fourth when Brendan Fevola broke through in 2007/2008) \u2013 and it should be remembered that all but a handful of his games were played at centre half-forward, not in the goal square. In 1932 he was elected Vice-President of the Carlton Football Club, but retired after one year. In February 1935 on learning of Terry Ogden's the serious illness, Clover and Newton Chandler offered their services for a blood transfusion for the club's wing man. After a blood test Chandler's blood was accepted. However, Ogden passed away the next month. Clover stood again in 1935, was elected \u2013 and spent twenty unbroken years serving his beloved Blues. He even took on the Presidency in 1956, aged 60, and was as vigorous and determined as ever in his two years in the job. Carlton Football Club mourned deeply when Horrie Clover passed away on the first day of January, 1984. Three years later, he was among the first to be inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame. Testament to his stature in the game as a whole, he was elected to the AFL Hall of Fame in 1996; and May 2000 saw him named as one of four emergencies in Carlton\u2019s Team of the Century. A champion in every sense of the word, he spent 37 years of his remarkable life at Princes Park. Footnote The Argus published an article on Maryborough, April 12 1930, it said; \"Clover has been the leading half-forward in League ranks for some time. It takes a specialist to fill the position capably, and the Carisbrook man does this admirably. Like good wine he has improved with age, and besides being one of the greatest half forwards that has ever appeared on a football field, he is about the best all round kicker that has ever played the game. He excells in punting, drop, and place kicking. He is a great marksman and a splendid exponent, one of the greatest the district has produced, besides being a fair cricketer also.\" When Clover returned to football in 1926, The Argus mentioned that they thought it was the first time a member of the Permit and Umpire Committee had played in a League game. 13 GOAL AWARD Round 12, 1921 At the Carlton AGM held on Monday 27 February 1922, Horrie Clover \"was presented with ball used on the occasion, the St.Kilda club having generously donated it to the Carlton officials, who had it mounted for the purpose.\" (Age February 22 1922) 1922 The Art Of Forward Play Horrie wrote an article for the Sporting Globe August 30 p7 To read click here> http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article184798404 1928 Idol of Carlton Crowds - Australia's Best Centre Half Forward The Sporting Globe's football writer W.

For that reason he deserves a line to himself. He played the game like a sportsman, was a glorious high mark, and could cover a great distance by either drop, punt, or place kick - a remarkable accomplishment. Many players have been notable kicks in two aspects of the game, yet none have equalled Clover in the three branches. His nearest rival as an all-round kick, though not quite as certain in his efforts, was Frank Caine, of Carlton, who, like Clover, also hailed from the country.\" 1933 Coming Football Champion Melbourne, Saturday A special warning was issued to the Victorian Football League delegates last night by Mr. D. H. Crone, a Carlton delegate, not to angle for a certain \"coming\" champion that the Carlton Club had signed up that day. At first delegates were a little puzzled at the statement, but when it was explained that Horrie Clover, former champion half-forward, had that day become the father of of a son they burst into sustained laughter. It was only by persistent ringing of the bell by the chairman that order was restored.

He is remembered for being Carlton's first ever Brownlow Medal winner.\n\nInitially a centreman, Deacon began his senior career at Preston in the Victorian Football Association. Carlton signed Deacon in March 1941, one day before his residential address in Preston, which had previously been unallotted, became part of Fitzroy's zone. He joined the army during World War II, and from 1942 until 1945 played most of his football for services teams, including acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a 1945 services competition in Darwin. However, he also made his league debut with Carlton and played eight games between 1942 and 1944 whenever he was stationed in Melbourne.\n\nDeacon returned permanently to Melbourne in mid-1945. He played a few games for Preston, then was cleared to and Carlton and played there permanently for the next seven years. Adept at all key positions, he quickly established himself at centre half back with Carlton. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 and 1947, and in the latter in a year which he won the Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. He was the first Carlton player to win the award.\n\nDeacon was held in extremely high regard throughout the league for his quality key position play in the years immediately following the war. In 1945, despite having played only half of the season, the Age sportswriter Percy Beames lauded Deacon's \"great versatility and sustained brilliance through each game\", and said he was perhaps the best key player since the early days of Laurie Nash. Deacon was also noted as a very fair player, and one of the few remembered for gentlemanly behaviour in the notoriously violent 1945 VFL Grand Final \u2013 when he helped his 17-year-old opponent Ron Clegg, who had been concussed in a behind-the-play incident, first to face the right direction to take a free kick, then to protect him from joining the outbreaking violence.\n\nDeacon struggled with injuries in his last couple of years with Carlton.

Amongst the players recruited from Sydney is a player who kicked the winning goal in a VFL grand final, a Norm Smith medallist, eleven premiership players and a couple of record-holding goal kickers. It is a record of achievement that deserves more kudos.\n\nIn comparison, although one must preface this by stating I don\u2019t have an intimate knowledge of rugby league recruiting, this figure of 80 players from Sydney to the VFL/AFL would presumably be larger than the combined number of rugby league players recruited from Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin rugby league clubs to the NRL.\n\nDecade by decade- number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL/AFL\n\n1897-1909 \u2013 4 players\n\n1910s \u2013 6 players\n\n1920s \u2013 12 players\n\n1930s \u2013 10 players\n\n1940s \u2013 2 players\n\n1950s \u2013 7 players\n\n1960s \u2013 1 player\n\n1970s \u2013 5 players\n\n1980s \u2013 11 players\n\n1990s \u2013 9 players\n\n2000s \u2013 11 players\n\n2010-11 \u2013 2 players\n\nIn 2012, there are 20 players who have been recruited from Sydney who are on AFL lists. Eight of these twenty have debuted in league football.\n\n1897-1910\n\nSydney\u2019s first player: Bob Kenny\n\nBob Kenny was the first player recruited from a Sydney club to play in the VFL. He debuted in 1899 and played just two games for St Kilda. He was followed soon after by John Stephenson, who was recruited from the Balmain football club and played 10 games for Essendon in 1907. Marshall Herbert, a recruit from Redfern, was the most successful of these early Sydney recruits, as he played 51 games with the Pies from 1908 to 1910. At this stage it should be noted that the only major football code that competed with Australian football in Sydney for players was rugby union, as rugby league was not played in Sydney until 1908.\n\n1910s\n\nThe 1910s was a decade that resulted in the recruitment of two Sydneysiders who had a significant impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYERS: Bob Merrick and Chris Laird. Recruited from East Sydney, Merrick established a goal-kicking record for his adopted Victorian team of Fitzroy in 1919 when he kicked a total of 12 goals in a match. This feat of 12 goals in a match was never bettered by any other Fitzroy player in the history of that club. Bob headed Fitzroy\u2019s goalkicking list each year between 1919-22.\n\nThe other Sydneysider to have an impact in the big league during this decade was Chris Laird. He was recruited from the eastern suburbs club of Paddington and is one of the few players in the history of the game to live the dream of kicking a clutch goal in a grand final with just vital seconds remaining in the match. Laird changed the fortune of the 1918 VFL grand final when he kicked the winning goal for South Melbourne with less than a minute remaining in the match.\n\n1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw a twofold increase over the previous decade in the number of players from Sydney making the transition to the best Australian football competition in the land. Six Sydneysiders played in the VFL in the 1910s and as many as twelve Sydneysiders were recruited in the 1920s.\n\nFred Davies, who was another recruit from Sydney\u2019s Eastern Suburbs, was the pick of the\n\nSydney recruits in this decade. His most notable achievement was being named as the captain of Fitzroy in 1934. Nevertheless, few of the other Sydney players had a large impact during this decade.\n\n1930s\n\nTen players from Sydney made the transition to the VFL in the 1930s. The pick of the players was Newtown\u2019s Reg Garvin.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Reg Garvin\n\nBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,\n\nReg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in\n\n1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club. Reg GarvinBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,Reg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club.\n\n1940s\n\nThe 1940s was a decade in which there was a noticeable drop-off in the numbers of high quality players making their way from Sydney clubs to the VFL, obviously due to WWII. Ron Hall, from St George, was one of only two players recruited from Sydney to the VFL in the 1940s. The other player was Arthur Richardson, who played just five games for the Swans.\n\n1950s\n\nThe 1950s was another decade in which only a small number of Sydney players were recruited to the top league. One of the recruits, however, had a large impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Roger Duffy \u2013\n\nAnother Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). Roger Duffy \u2013Another Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951. He was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states. Duffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). His premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). 1960s\n\nThe 1960s was Sydney footballs lowest point in terms of the number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL. Barry Fitzgerald was the only player recruited directly from a Sydney club to the VFL during this decade. And he played just 35 games for Fitzroy. 1970s\n\nThe 1970s can be viewed as a decade of revival for football recruiting from Sydney. Whilst the 1960s was a low point in terms of player recruitment, the 1970s saw the recruitment of two stars of the game \u2013 Mark Marclure and Michael Byrne. STAR PLAYER:Mark Maclure\n\nMaclure played junior football for East Sydney and also won the Sanders Medal as the best player in Sydney\u2019s reserve grade competition as a 17 year old. From there he tried out with Carlton\u2019s under 19s team and was eventually lured to Carlton by their master recruiter Bert Deacon. Of all the players to have been recruited from Sydney, Mark Maclure is the player who can boast as having the greatest CV. On top of his list of achievements is being a member of three premiership teams (1979, 1981 and 1982). Maclure is the only player recruited from a Sydney football club to have played in as many as three VFL/AFL premiership teams. On top of this, he was the captain of his AFL club (in 1986), won his club\u2019s goal kicking award (1979 and 1985) and played over 200 games for his beloved Blues. STAR PLAYER: Michael Byrne\n\nMichael Byrne is Sydney born and raised, having come through the ranks of local Sydney football on the northern beaches and then playing for the Sydney club of North Shore. Byrne\u2019s induction into football was a tough one, as he played in the ruck for North Shore in the bloodbath Sydney grand final of 1976 at Trumper Park. This match was infamous in Sydney football for being punctuated by rolling brawls involving almost every player on the ground. After he left Sydney, Byrne became a premiership player with Hawthorn in 1983 and he produced on the big day, as he was the 2nd highest goal kicker for Hawthorn in the grand final after the legendary Leigh Matthews. Playing during Hawthorn\u2019s greatest era. Byrne also had the honour of being runner up for the club\u2019s best and fairest in 1984. 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of the Sydney Swans into the VFL competition and it was a decade in which there was a large upswing in the numbers of players recruited from Sydney. Only one player (1960s) and five players (1970s) made the transition to the top league in the two previous decades, but 11 players made the transition in the 1980s. Amongst these players was St George\u2019s Mark Roberts, who was a premiership player with North Melbourne in 1996. 1990s\n\nThe 1990s was a remarkable decade in terms of the contribution of Sydney footballers to the AFL. It was the starting point for the careers of three Sydneysiders who played over 200 games of AFL football. The three players from Sydney who pulled on the guernsey in over 200 games of AFL football were Mark McVeigh [pictured left] (Essendon), Lenny Hayes (St Kilda) and Greg Stafford (Sydney and Richmond). McVeigh and Hayes were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club and Greg Stafford was recruited from Western Suburbs. STAR PLAYER: Lenny Hayes\n\nHayes became the first player from Sydney to win the Norm Smith medal. His last quarter performance in the 2010 grand final for the Saints was one for the record books, as he willed his team back into the contest by obtaining 11 possessions as well as kicking an inspiring goal from 50 metres out.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Nick Davis\n\nNick Davis, recruited from Ramsgate juniors, didn\u2019t have the longevity of career that Hayes, McVeigh or Stafford had, but he produced one of the defining moments in finals history and arguably the Swan\u2019s greatest moment outside the 2005 grand final when he kicked four goals in the last quarter of the 2005 semi-final against Geelong. That blitz of goal turned the match around and secured the Swans a vital 3-point victory and the passage to a grand final victory. 2000s\n\nTwo exceptional footballers were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club in the 1990s (Lenny Hayes and Mark McVeigh), and the feat was replicated in the noughties, as two further Pennant Hills juniors of exceptional talent, Jarrad McVeigh and Kieran Jack, made their transition to the AFL. STAR PLAYER: Jarrad McVeigh\n\nMcVeigh won the Sydney Swan\u2019s best and fairest award in 2008. This was a noticeable feat as McVeigh became the first player to be recruited from a local Sydney football club to win the award. It took 26 years after the club started in Sydney for a Sydney local to win the award, yet it only took a further two years for the next Sydney local to win the award when Kieran Jack was deemed Sydney\u2019s best and fairest player in 2010. STAR PLAYER: Kieran Jack\n\nJack started his career for the Swans as a dogged tagger in 2007, yet it was only three years later that he won the club best and fairest award. Displaying unbridled determination, Kieran Jack won the award in 2010 largely because he had become a vital attacking option for the Swans. In his best and fairest year of 2010, Jack kicked 21 goals whilst still largely working in the midfield. In 2012, he is in contention for All-Australian selection as he continues to combine attacking flair with an ability to win the contested ball. Many may question if the introduction of the Swans has been a success, yet from a recruiting viewpoint for Sydneysiders it has been. Only one player from Sydney in the 80 years prior to the Swans introduction into the Sydney sporting landscape played over 200 games of top grade football. Since the Swans moved to Sydney there have been three 200 game players from Sydney . The players recruited from Sydney clubs in the years ahead will be following in the footsteps of exceptional footballers such as Roger Duffy, Michael Byrne, Lenny Hayes and the McVeigh brothers amongst others. Over the journey, the record of Sydneysiders at the top level is far better than what many would presume is the case\u201c there have been premiership players, club captains, club coaches, and best and fairest winners. Sydneysiders have achieved at the highest level of the Australian game, but just not with all the fanfare of players from other cities.

Barry Fitzgerald was the only player recruited directly from a Sydney club to the VFL during this decade. And he played just 35 games for Fitzroy.\n\n1970s\n\nThe 1970s can be viewed as a decade of revival for football recruiting from Sydney. Whilst the 1960s was a low point in terms of player recruitment, the 1970s saw the recruitment of two stars of the game \u2013 Mark Marclure and Michael Byrne.\n\nSTAR PLAYER:Mark Maclure\n\nMaclure played junior football for East Sydney and also won the Sanders Medal as the best player in Sydney\u2019s reserve grade competition as a 17 year old. From there he tried out with Carlton\u2019s under 19s team and was eventually lured to Carlton by their master recruiter Bert Deacon.

From there he tried out with Carlton\u2019s under 19s team and was eventually lured to Carlton by their master recruiter Bert Deacon. Of all the players to have been recruited from Sydney, Mark Maclure is the player who can boast as having the greatest CV. On top of his list of achievements is being a member of three premiership teams (1979, 1981 and 1982). Maclure is the only player recruited from a Sydney football club to have played in as many as three VFL/AFL premiership teams. On top of this, he was the captain of his AFL club (in 1986), won his club\u2019s goal kicking award (1979 and 1985) and played over 200 games for his beloved Blues.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Michael Byrne\n\nMichael Byrne is Sydney born and raised, having come through the ranks of local Sydney football on the northern beaches and then playing for the Sydney club of North Shore. Michael ByrneMichael Byrne is Sydney born and raised, having come through the ranks of local Sydney football on the northern beaches and then playing for the Sydney club of North Shore. Byrne\u2019s induction into football was a tough one, as he played in the ruck for North Shore in the bloodbath Sydney grand final of 1976 at Trumper Park. This match was infamous in Sydney football for being punctuated by rolling brawls involving almost every player on the ground. After he left Sydney, Byrne became a premiership player with Hawthorn in 1983 and he produced on the big day, as he was the 2nd highest goal kicker for Hawthorn in the grand final after the legendary Leigh Matthews. Playing during Hawthorn\u2019s greatest era. Byrne also had the honour of being runner up for the club\u2019s best and fairest in 1984.\n\n1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of the Sydney Swans into the VFL competition and it was a decade in which there was a large upswing in the numbers of players recruited from Sydney.\n\nOnly one player (1960s) and five players (1970s) made the transition to the top league in the two previous decades, but 11 players made the transition in the 1980s. Amongst these players was St George\u2019s Mark Roberts, who was a premiership player with North Melbourne in 1996.\n\n1990s\n\nThe 1990s was a remarkable decade in terms of the contribution of Sydney footballers to the AFL. It was the starting point for the careers of three Sydneysiders who played over 200 games of AFL football. The three players from Sydney who pulled on the guernsey in over 200 games of AFL football were Mark McVeigh [pictured left] (Essendon), Lenny Hayes (St Kilda) and Greg Stafford (Sydney and Richmond). McVeigh and Hayes were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club and Greg Stafford was recruited from Western Suburbs.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Lenny Hayes\n\nHayes became the first player from Sydney to win the Norm Smith medal. His last quarter performance in the 2010 grand final for the Saints was one for the record books, as he willed his team back into the contest by obtaining 11 possessions as well as kicking an inspiring goal from 50 metres out.\n\n\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Nick Davis\n\nNick Davis, recruited from Ramsgate juniors, didn\u2019t have the longevity of career that Hayes, McVeigh or Stafford had, but he produced one of the defining moments in finals history and arguably the Swan\u2019s greatest moment outside the 2005 grand final when he kicked four goals in the last quarter of the 2005 semi-final against Geelong. That blitz of goal turned the match around and secured the Swans a vital 3-point victory and the passage to a grand final victory.\n\n2000s\n\nTwo exceptional footballers were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club in the 1990s (Lenny Hayes and Mark McVeigh), and the feat was replicated in the noughties, as two further Pennant Hills juniors of exceptional talent, Jarrad McVeigh and Kieran Jack, made their transition to the AFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Jarrad McVeigh\n\nMcVeigh won the Sydney Swan\u2019s best and fairest award in 2008. This was a noticeable feat as McVeigh became the first player to be recruited from a local Sydney football club to win the award. It took 26 years after the club started in Sydney for a Sydney local to win the award, yet it only took a further two years for the next Sydney local to win the award when Kieran Jack was deemed Sydney\u2019s best and fairest player in 2010.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Kieran Jack\n\nJack started his career for the Swans as a dogged tagger in 2007, yet it was only three years later that he won the club best and fairest award. Displaying unbridled determination,\n\nKieran Jack won the award in 2010 largely because he had become a vital attacking option for the Swans. In his best and fairest year of 2010, Jack kicked 21 goals whilst still largely working in the midfield. In 2012, he is in contention for All-Australian selection as he continues to combine attacking flair with an ability to win the contested ball.\n\nMany may question if the introduction of the Swans has been a success, yet from a recruiting viewpoint for Sydneysiders it has been. Only one player from Sydney in the 80 years prior to the Swans introduction into the Sydney sporting landscape played over 200 games of top grade football. Since the Swans moved to Sydney there have been three 200 game players from Sydney .\n\nThe players recruited from Sydney clubs in the years ahead will be following in the footsteps of exceptional footballers such as Roger Duffy, Michael Byrne, Lenny Hayes and the McVeigh brothers amongst others.

He is remembered for being Carlton's first ever Brownlow Medal winner.\n\nInitially a centreman, Deacon began his senior career at Preston in the Victorian Football Association. Carlton signed Deacon in March 1941, one day before his residential address in Preston, which had previously been unallotted, became part of Fitzroy's zone. He joined the army during World War II, and from 1942 until 1945 played most of his football for services teams, including acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a 1945 services competition in Darwin. However, he also made his league debut with Carlton and played eight games between 1942 and 1944 whenever he was stationed in Melbourne.\n\nDeacon returned permanently to Melbourne in mid-1945. He played a few games for Preston, then was cleared to and Carlton and played there permanently for the next seven years. Adept at all key positions, he quickly established himself at centre half back with Carlton. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 and 1947, and in the latter in a year which he won the Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. He was the first Carlton player to win the award.\n\nDeacon was held in extremely high regard throughout the league for his quality key position play in the years immediately following the war. In 1945, despite having played only half of the season, the Age sportswriter Percy Beames lauded Deacon's \"great versatility and sustained brilliance through each game\", and said he was perhaps the best key player since the early days of Laurie Nash. Deacon was also noted as a very fair player, and one of the few remembered for gentlemanly behaviour in the notoriously violent 1945 VFL Grand Final \u2013 when he helped his 17-year-old opponent Ron Clegg, who had been concussed in a behind-the-play incident, first to face the right direction to take a free kick, then to protect him from joining the outbreaking violence.\n\nDeacon struggled with injuries in his last couple of years with Carlton. He left Carlton after the 1951 season, Deacon returned to Preston as captain-coach. He retired as a player after 1953, and continued as non-playing coach until the end of 1956. He later served as Carlton vice-president and club secretary.\n\nHe is the centre half back in Carlton's official 'Team of the Century', and was one of the inaugural players elevated to Legend status in the Carlton Football Club Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nOff the field, Deacon worked for many years for long-serving VFL and Carlton president Sir Kenneth Luke.\n\nDeacon died of a heart attack at age 51 on 3 January 1974 while on holiday at Balnarring despite the desperate efforts of his Preston team-mate, Pat Foley, to revive him.\n\nReferences\n\nBert Deacon's playing statistics from AFL Tables\n\nBert Deacon at Blueseum\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/Collingwood%20Reserves/2515", "page_content": "Collingwood Reserves\n\nCollingwood originally joined the Victorian Football Association (which later became the modern day VFL in 1996) in 1892. In 1897, Collingwood was one of the eight breakaway clubs to form the Victorian Football League (which later became the modern day AFL in 1990), and has fielded its senior team in that competition every year since.\n\nThe VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition from 1919\u20131991, and a de facto AFL reserves competition known as the Victorian State Football League operated from 1992\u20131999. The Collingwood Football Club fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Collingwood in the lower grade.\n\nIn 2000, the VSFL merged with the modern day Victorian Football League. Since the merger, the senior grade of the VFL has accommodated senior teams from the VFL, reserves teams from the AFL, and affiliations between VFL and AFL clubs, in which VFL senior players and AFL reserves players compete in the same team. Collingwood fielded a stand alone reserves team in the VFL in the 2000 VFL season. It finished eleventh on the ladder, and the side at times included the likes of Gavin Brown, Gavin Crosisca, Shane Watson, Stephen Patterson, Ben Johnson, Rhyce Shaw and Ricky Olarenshaw. It played its home games at Victoria Park, with a handful of curtain raisers at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nIn 2001, Collingwood entered into an affiliation with the VFL's Williamstown Football Club, which meant there was no separate Collingwood VFL team or reserves team for the first time since 1918. Collingwood ended its affiliation with Williamstown after the 2007 season, and re-established a stand-alone reserves team in the VFL in 2008. The reserves team has competed in the VFL since 2008.\n\nThe Collingwood VFL team is composed of both reserves players from the club's primary and rookie AFL lists, and a separately maintained list of players eligible only for VFL matches. Its coach is Dale Tapping and captain Scott Pendlebury.\n\nIn 2016 the Magpies performed well during the home and away rounds, winning 14 of their 18 matches to qualify for the finals in second place, behind minor premiers Casey Scorpions only on percentage. They then comfortably accounted for Williamstown, their former affiliates, in a qualifying final. However, their preliminary final clash with Footscray turned into something of a nightmare as the Bulldogs cruised to victory by 119 points, 27.19 (181) to 9.8 (62).\n\nA year later the Magpies again qualified for the finals but their involvement was fleeting as Richmond reserves accounted for them in an elimination final by a margin of 12 points. A year later they again bowed out of the flag race at the elimination final stage, this time at the hands of Essendon by 34 points."}, {"url": "https://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/1970-vfl-grand-final-50th-anniversary", "page_content": "'Bring him oxygen!'\n\nOften bestowed with a litany of platitudes, the 1970 Victorian Football League (VFL) Grand Final remains a defining moment in the history of Australian Rules football. In front of an unsurpassed 121,696 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the code\u2019s fiercest rivals, Carlton and Collingwood, played out one of the most dramatic encounters on the biggest day of the season. Approaching half-time, Carlton were adrift by over seven goals in an era of football when such a deficit was generally considered to be impossible to make up. Against a star-studded Collingwood side that had beaten Carlton in all three previous encounters that season, it was practically unthinkable.

It remains the most famous grab in VFL history. Endlessly rescreened ever since, HSV7 commentator Mike Williamson\u2019s accompanying catchcry \u2013 'Jesaulenko, you beauty!' \u2013 has entered the game's lexicon, transcending the moment of play to become a catchphrase of high marking and enshrining both the player and event in Australian sporting folklore.\n\nPresented here for the first time is in an edited montage of surviving TV, film and radio coverage from the NFSA collection of 'Jezza\u2019s' most famous moment, including the iconic sequence in colour:"}]}
