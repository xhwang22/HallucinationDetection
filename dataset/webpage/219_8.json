The insanity of the U.S. presidential campaign has the band waxing political on a new two-song release, which marks the first material from the outfit in over 15 years.\"By the Time I Get to Pennsylvania\"/\"Damaged\" is streaming now through Bandcamp, with both tracks also able to be downloaded on a name-your-price basis. The first track is a savage assemblage of grinding blasts and post-thrash pinch squeals. Lyrically, the piece hints at Republican candidate Donald Trump's plan to build a wall around Mexico and the \"masquerade\" of the campaign trail.Racetraitor explained in a statement: \"The 2016 election has been a parade of jingoism and xenophobia. We consider it a call to action. 'By the Time I Get to Pennsylvania' is our small way of voicing disgust at what is going on.\"The two-song offering is the first release from Racetraitor since a split record with Burn It Down in 1999. While currently available in the digital realm, a flexi disc version of \"By the Time I Get to Pennsylvania\"/\"Damaged\" is also in the works.The Chicago-bred band play a hometown reunion show at the Cobra Lounge on October 22.Back in the summer, Hurley's Sect project with members of Cursed and Earth Crisis issued their self-titled debut album"}, {"url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qv9mnm/hardcore-legends-racetraitor-are-on-a-mission-to-defeat-white-supremacy", "page_content": "A few months ago, I went to a metal bar in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to see La Armada\u2014a killer Dominican-turned-Chicago hardcore band we\u2019ve covered here before\u2014headline a benefit show to raise legal funds for migrant families detained at the U.S. border. I got there earlier than expected, and had planned to while away the extra time with a whiskey at the bar, until I spotted the second-to-last band\u2019s name: Racetraitor. I\u2019d never heard of them, but was more than willing to let my curiosity get the better of me\u2014especially after I passed their merch table and saw that they were selling shirts with the phrase \u2018DEFEAT WHITE SUPREMACY\u2019 printed in big block letters on the back.\n\nMostofi, whose family is Iranian, works with human rights defenders in the Middle East. F. Drummer Andy Hurley joined pop punk outfit Fall Out Boy (alongside occasional Racetraitor fill-in bass player Pete Wentz), and is now also part of hardcore group Sect, with whom Racetraitor will soon embark upon a European tour. They never ruled out the idea of a reunion, and rumors of a Racetraitor resurrection floated around for years, but, simply put, life kept getting in the way.\n\nRacetraitor\u2019s original run was short-lived, even in the blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-\u2019em hardcore scene. As Mostofi says, they were active during the second half of the 90s, then broke up in 1999. They released two records\u2014 the furious Burn the Idol of the White Messiah LP on Uprising Records, and a split EP called Make Them Talk via Trustkill\u2014before disappearing. The members remained close and occasionally crossed paths in other projects throughout the years, but ultimately followed their own pursuits. Some chose graduate school or full-time activist work; others switched musical gears.\n\nI had initially been content to be the old lady in the back clutching an overpriced Bulleit, but soon as Racetraitor stepped onstage and their singer Mani Mostofi grabbed the mic, I snapped right the fuck to attention, and pushed my way closer. They were on fire, and stayed lit up throughout their entire short, sharp set. It was only afterwards that I looked them up and realized I\u2019d stumbled into a little piece of hardcore history\u2014and that the band who\u2019d bowled me over with their machinegun riffs and impassioned between-song political speeches were reunited legends.\n\nThe result of those sessions, a full-length called 2042, is a barn-burning blast of metallic hardcore fury that screams by with guns blazing and fists held high. In classic Racetraitor fashion, the title itself is a provocation\u2014as Mostofi explains, the year 2042 is when the census predicts that white Americans will fall below 51 percent and no longer make up a majority of the country\u2019s population. As one might imagine, both right-wing FOX News gasbags like Tucker Carlson and the outright white nationalists at Breitbart have been collectively losing their shit over this information, and Mostofi notes their decision to nab this particular title as a nod to that particular brand of fragile white fear, and a thumbed nose at the inflammatory xenophobic, Islamophobic rhetoric fueling the right wing\u2019s terror.\n\nEventually, though, the time was right. Racetraitor reunited in 2016, and added a new member, guitarist Andrea Black (formerly of Howl and A Storm of Light), who the band knew through mutual friends in the music world; she started out as a touring member, but they immediately clicked, and she was soon invited to join the band outright. The new lineup released a new EP on Organized Crime Records and promising a reissue of Burn the Idol of the White Messiah.That was all they\u2019d originally planned to do, but as Mostofi explains, \u201cAs soon as we started writing, that EP turned into an LP almost immediately. We had 12-13 songs within a period of a month. I think part of that is that we are really highly motivated; we\u2019re putting as much as we can of ourselves into this because it is a personal way of us expressing our take on what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d\n\nSince you got together, how have people reacted? Has it felt like more of a homecoming, or a reintroduction? It\u2019s a little bit of both. We had very divided reaction back in the 90s, so when we were coming back this time, we didn\u2019t really know what to expect. We were very critical, confrontational band, and we basically went to war with the punk scene\u2014not particular individuals, but with the concept of the punk/hardcore community thinking it was always the good guys. And we were challenging them. You can\u2019t just assume the mantle of anti-racist, anti-authoritarian because you wear the right T-shirt and go to the right shows. It has to be a practice.\n\nNoisey: What brought Racetraitor back? I know it\u2019s been a very long time since you were out here\u2014like, a real long time. Mani Mostofi : The thing that really made the conversation serious was Ferguson. When the Ferguson uprising happened, we just thought like, \u201cOK, this is really something that we want to lend solidarity to, and we feel like our music could do that in a way.\u201d It was a slow conversation\u2014and then Trump came on the scene. It became really self-evident that we had to jump into the fold and do something\u2014if not for the larger community\u2014for our own sanity.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that you mentioned label support as a means of getting involved politically. I\u2019ve seen that happening, too\u2014labels that up until a few years ago didn\u2019t talk about politics are now signing bands that are actively anti-fascist and anti-racist. It\u2019s like watching the marketing aspects of a political message unfold in real time. What is that like from your perspective? I was once working with a group of activists on solidarity work with pro-democracy movements in Iran. I said, \u201cLook, in some ways all activism, the sort of awareness-raising activism or acts of solidarity, is marketing. It\u2019s the same set of tools.\u201d That pissed a lot of people off. When we market ourselves as a band, it\u2019s the same thing as marketing an idea, and the trick is, how do you convince people that it\u2019s not performative? There\u2019s a big critique for example, that anarchism is dumpster diving and growing out dreads; it\u2019s not about developing a movement for fundamental change in the way we structure our societies. For us, an inescapable part of what we are as a band is saying that if you want to fight white supremacy, you\u2019re getting involved with struggles where communities of color are empowered, and you\u2019re trying to dismantle the system of hierarchy based on race. That\u2019s how you do it. It\u2019s through activism; it\u2019s through community involvement. It\u2019s listening to people most impacted by oppression. It\u2019s inescapable. For us, are we marketing our politics? Sure, but our politics get involved in more than the superficial. That\u2019s how we reconcile it.\n\nWe still see internet trolls who will say things like, \u201cThe band Racetraitor invented white genocide,\u201d [but] that stuff is to be expected in this era. And the other thing that has been heartwarming is the fact that, for some people in the metal and hardcore community, they feel like supporting us is a way of contributing. Our label Good Fight is backing us pretty intensely and it\u2019s really because of what we\u2019re about. They feel like they have to contribute what they can, and as a label, what they can do is put out a band like us.\n\nNow, a lot of [concepts] we were talking about\u2014like white privilege\u2014have become commonplace, so we\u2019re no longer thematically cutting-edge in any way. I don\u2019t necessarily think we\u2019re changing people\u2019s minds. What I think we\u2019re doing is making people feel less alone, feel more connected to these ideas through music and art, and that allows them to become more active and more conscious. We are cheerleaders for people who want to stand up to fascism and white supremacy.The insanity of the Trump campaign and the rise of the Alt-Right catching everybody off guard made us a band that people welcomed.\n\nYou\u2019re also bringing racism and the ongoing exclusion of people of color from these genres to the forefront. Because it is such an overwhelmingly white scene, there seems to be an awkwardness and silence around these issues, because most white people don\u2019t know how to address it. How we can make more space for bands like you? Hardcore and metal are still really white; there\u2019s no argument there. Sometimes for people of color, that becomes exhausting, and it pushes them away from the scene. It\u2019s hard sometimes for white kids to understand what that means, because white kids aren\u2019t trying to be racist or exclusionary. It\u2019s just that sometimes people feel, I can\u2019t really be myself here. There\u2019s certain things that people don\u2019t get about my experience. I will say is that from 1999 to 2018, right, even though it\u2019s an extremely white scene still, at least in hardcore and punk, there\u2019s a more inclusiveness than there was. I would say especially more women than people of color that are taking prominent roles. When I was around, there were a lot women involved in the scene, but they did zines, and other aspects of what makes the scene, but ultimately when talking about the music scene, the band is the center point, right? There\u2019s a lot more women in bands now in prominent roles, and that\u2019s been different. And there\u2019s definitely more people of color.\n\nWe\u2019re at a time where neutrality is not an option, so if people are taking political stances, it\u2019s at least an opportunity to engage them, and translate that into deeper deeds. I was just chatting online with people about whether Taylor Swift saying she doesn\u2019t like homophobia, sexism, and systematic racism is a good thing. Of course it\u2019s a good thing! It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sufficient, [but] I\u2019m all for the fact that she said that, and that opens the conversation with her or her fanbase to push the envelope. At this time, we shouldn\u2019t really talk about who needs to be excluded from the movement. If anyone wants to lends their voice in support in one way or another, I don\u2019t think we should immediately question their intentions and try to ostracize them. We\u2019re very, very much on this precipice of not just evil and neoliberal capitalism that we\u2019ve been living in, but actually fascism. As bad as things have been, that\u2019s actually worse, so we need to have a big tent approach.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s nothing very dangerous or status quo smashing about parroting Rush Limbaugh talking points. There\u2019s this prevailing thought in parts of the metal community that metal and music in general is meant to be about escapism\u2014that you shouldn\u2019t have to think about the art you are consuming. And I find that so frustrating. Metal has always had political bands. If you want to ostracize those bands from metal, go ahead, but you lose a lot of the most pivotal bands. I totally get escapism. Escapism is actually not something we should disparage; it\u2019s something we can celebrate. It\u2019s just whether or not you get all consumed by it. If you don\u2019t want to listen to political metal, that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s plenty of other stuff to listen to. I\u2019m not saying you have to listen to political music. I\u2019m saying I use music to say how people should live more political lives. I don\u2019t care what music you listen to. I care about, are you apathetic to suffering around you? If you don\u2019t want to express your lack of apathy by listening to my band or any other political band, that\u2019s cool, but some people, myself included, when I put on a band that tested my ideas or reflected my values, it made me feel like I was part of something bigger. And that gave me courage or motivation to actually be part of something bigger in real life.\n\nHow do you make more politically conscious bands? Part of it is you try to celebrate the bands that are saying the right thing. We think of ourselves as anti-authoritarian radical music scene; whether that\u2019s metal or punk or hardcore, all these genres try to buck norms. We try to say to buck norms to buck power, otherwise it\u2019s just what costume you\u2019re wearing, and that\u2019s just as shallow as anything else. That gives this type of music power. Makes it threatening. Makes it a form of cultural resistance. The more we celebrate that, the more people will feel empowered to express those ideas through music or whatever else they do to contribute to this community.\n\nThat\u2019s been a great thing and what we do, as Racetraitor, is we introduce this idea of what does it mean to actually be involved in anti-racism. You can be personally anti-racist, all you want, but the schools around are designed in a certain way, how people have housing and generational wealth has been designed a certain way. You live under white power whether you choose to or not, and we\u2019re saying, \u201cMake a conscious choice not to,\u201d and we\u2019re often saying that in predominantly white spaces intentionally. The fact that that is acceptable part of the scene that this band could come here and say these things I think has value.\n\nI know for a fact there\u2019s people that just listen to our band for the riffs, because that\u2019s all they comment on. That\u2019s cool. We also think our riffs are heavy. That\u2019s why we play them [laughs]. So that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s not forget, the music that we play is sonically violent, right? And the scene both in terms of visuals and in terms of lyrics has always used violence as a way of conveying ideas, right? It\u2019s weird, because if you think about a liberation politic, the ultimate goal is to minimize violence. It\u2019s really easy for people who actually want to promote violence and right-wing thought to infiltrate our type of music. Rush Limbaugh is actually the perfect example. Why? Basically he just tells a bunch of dudes to just go ahead and be assholes. You\u2019re being your true self by just being a total dickhead.\n\nWe use that type of music because we feel that violence inside, and we\u2019re trying to exorcise it; we\u2019re trying to get it out of our system and we\u2019re trying to put it in the world and give it a positive shake. That\u2019s also sometimes part of the escapism. You listen to aggressive music as a healthy outlet, and we take that one step further and we turn the healthy outlet into a political philosophy. But you could see how it could become the other way. You take the violence and the aggression and sense of fuck you, and you make it about empowering the individual to take on the rest of the world around them, and sometimes that means hating people because of their nationality or race. Sometimes it means hating women. Sometimes it means hating queer people. It\u2019s very easy to transform this type of music into those negative ideas if you\u2019re not conscious about it. It can infiltrate everything we do. A lot of people don\u2019t buy into it; there\u2019s a lot of cool people in these scenes. But is it contested territory? For sure.\n\nSo if a younger kid comes up to you at a show and says, \u201cHey I just walked in because your riffs sounded cool, and I really like what you had to say. I\u2019m into metal and I\u2019m into punk but I don\u2019t know much about this political stuff but I want to do something .\u201d What would you tell them to do with their energy?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily tell someone go join your local socialist organization chapter or anarchist affinity group; what we have always stressed is grassroots local organizations that are not necessarily about one political ideology of another. The way the members of this band got into activism was through working with people in affected communities.We tell people to work with communities that are trying to figure out how to survive, and turn the process of survival into an act of greater social change. That creates a lot more empathy, and it\u2019s more grounded in human values.\n\nWe all derive influence from different ideological thoughts on the left, but I would never tell somebody to just become all consumed by ideology. For us, activism is about people. People live in communities. So it\u2019s really about finding those community groups you agree with and working with them on whatever issue it might be. It might be gentrification in your community. It might be immigrant rights and supporting refugees. It might be working with queer teenagers. It might be working with women who survive sexual assault. Working with those communities make a big difference, and then in your own brain, thinking about how that is part of a struggle for a more just society as a whole.\n\nWhat came first for you: punk rock or politics?\n\nIt depends on how you define punk rock! I was into post-punk bands at a very young age, like Joy Division or the Cure, and the term I use for those bands was punk when I was 12-13 years old; I didn\u2019t know there was another word for them. At the same time, I\u2019ve always sort of had a sort of political consciousness as a really young kid. It sounds weird, but I can\u2019t remember a time in my life when I wasn\u2019t thinking about these issues of race and class. I was born in Chicago in the late seventies, and my family\u2019s apartment was really on the line between the rich part of Hyde Park and the poor side of Inglewood. Maybe because I was the son of immigrants\u2014I was from an Iranian family\u2014I never really felt like I totally fit in. At a young age, I started thinking about, \u2018So, there\u2019s different races, there\u2019s different incomes.\u2019 I didn't have a word for class, but I knew some people could afford shit and some people couldn\u2019t. I was picked on as a kid for being Iranian. I can\u2019t tell you how many times they told me my father is a terrorist. If you feel like you hate the system of oppression around you, this is the music for that, right?\n\nSo where did you get the name Racetraitor in the first place?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of different disputes about where the name of the band came from, but the person that came up with it was our guitar player, Dan [Binaei]. His family is from small town Kentucky, but Dan grew up in Chicago and got into progressive politics in high school. He always felt like, this was his family, but there was a level of disconnect with them. He remembered watching an episode of Jerry Springer or Donahue, where they had KKK members on, and they started calling white people in the audience who were speaking out against racism \u201cracetraitors.\u201d It just sort of clicked with Dan that, in his environment, maybe there are people who think of him as a racetraitor. He proposed that name to the rest of the band, and we just thought it was so crazy that we had to do it.\n\nWhen I\u2019m just talking to someone and I tell them I\u2019m in a band called Racetraitor, within like ten seconds, I always make sure to say it\u2019s an anti-racist band, because it\u2019s such a crazy term that people don\u2019t always get the idea that we\u2019re trying to reclaim the term, take it away from the white nationalists, and turn it into something that\u2019s a badge of honor. Not everybody gets it right away, but that\u2019s one of the victories of the band. From the first second you\u2019re introduced to us, you have to process something.That\u2019s sort of our success and our curse, you know? I\u2019ve read reviews that call us a band that\u2019s really unpleasant and challenging\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s the road we paved for ourselves, and it starts with the name."}, {"url": "https://blogdigger.com/andy-hurley/", "page_content": "Andy Hurley is an incredibly talented musician and artist who has made a name for himself through his work in several hardcore punk bands, as well as his current role as the drummer for the rock band Fall Out Boy.\n\nBorn in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, Andy began playing drums at the age of 12 and joined his first hardcore punk band, Racetraitor, in 1996.

The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux. While shy guy Andy wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ever-increasing limelight, he let his memorable drum parts do the talking. By 2010 Fall Out Boy were burned out and a three-year hiatus was quickly announced.\n\nAndy fed his passion for heavy metal and hardcore punk, recording and touring with bands including Enabler and Earth Crisis, and forming heavy rock band The Damned Things with Trohman. Andy still uses downtime from Fall Out Boy to play with hardcore band, Sect. Fall Out Boy returned refreshed and fighting fit in 2012, releasing three chart-topping albums in a row, culminating in this year\u2019s Mania.\n\nWhile the band\u2019s sound has evolved through the years, their core DNA remains, and Fall Out Boy continue to sell out arenas around the world. We hooked up with Andy Hurley during the recent UK tour to learn more about the band\u2019s incredible journey.\n\nYou joined Fall Out Boy around 2003. What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.altpress.com/andy_hurley_fall_out_boy_hardcore_influence/", "page_content": "[Photo by: Aggressive Tendencies/YouTube]\n\nIt's true: Fall Out Boy's sound has evolved over the years.

The first riff in \"Grand Theft Autumn / Where Is Your Boy,\" from 2003's Take This to Your Grave, was also directly inspired by fellow Midwest band Harvest, specifically their song \"Meditations.\"\"I think that was Patrick [Stump's],\" Hurley says of Infinity on High opener \"Thriller.\" \"He wrote that song to a Racetraitor breakdown because he just ripped it off, which is fair because that's a band I was in \u2014 am in... Especially back then, Patrick would kind of try to adapt hardcore breakdowns or hardcore rhythmic sensibilities into a pop sensibility to kind of see where you could take that, which I think was really interesting.\"You can hear comparisons between the tunes in the first video below.While also speaking to Aggressive Tendencies, Hurley also discusses how he got into music via metal and hardcore, why his biggest drumming inspiration is Slayer 's Dave Lombardo (despite his favourite band being Metallica ), his time playing in/with bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Vegan Reich, Global Scam and Earth Crisis , in addition to Racetraitor, as well as how that led to him joining Fall Out Boy. He also goes in-depth on his latest heavy band, SECT and their recently released sophomore LP, No Cure for Death Finally, he gets political when revealing why last year was the right time for Racetraitor to come back, discussing racism, slavery, the prison system, the NFL kneeling protests and the activist side of straight edge. Despite his project's occasionally brazen messaging, he says Fall Out Boy's management (and the other members) support his political side, something they all possess as well, despite it not being clear in their music.Learn more about the guy whose favourite things were (and still are) \"Metallica, Star Wars and Earth Crisis... and the vegan straight edge\" in the players below."}, {"url": "https://antifawatch.net/ViewReport/f01c248e", "page_content": "Is this report missing info?

They released an album called Burn the Idol of the White Messiah on Uprising Records and then a split EP called Make Them Talk on Trustkill with their friends in the Indianapolis band Burn It Down. Racetraitor was one of the most controversial political bands of the 1990s hardcore scene and garnered on the covers of both Maximumrocknroll and HeartattaCk before recording a single note of music. The name Racetraitor was in reference to using one's social and economic privilege to create a more egalitarian world. The idea was to take the pejorative term \"race traitor\" used by white American racists and claim it as a positive self-chosen label. The band was known for aggressively challenging audiences to confront the ways they might help perpetuate or buy into racist and exploitative social and economic systems. Many of their shows turned into heated arguments and they became one of the most talked about political hardcore bands of the late 1990s. Drummer Andy Hurley went on to play in Fall Out Boy along with Pete Wentz who occasionaly filled in on bass for the band. The band reformed in 2016 with plans to remix and re-release Burn The Idol of the White Messiah. \u00ab hide Similar Bands: Earth Crisis, Disembodied, Integrity, Snapcase, Unruh LPs 2042\n\n2018\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n15 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic Burn the Idol of the White Messiah\n\n1998\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n36 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic EPs Invisible Battles Against Invisible Fortresses\n\n2017\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n5 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic Demo 1996\n\n1996\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n3 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic Contributors: Mort., SinNanna,"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/andy-hurley-33226.php", "page_content": "He studied anthropology and history in college as making a serious career in music wasn\u2019t on his mind at that time. Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}], "Racetraitor recorded one album before the band split up in 2004.": [{"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/racetraitor-mn0000381281/biography", "page_content": "Racetraitor shook up the punk and hardcore scenes' consciousness with their radical politics and scorching, uncompromisingly brutal metalcore sound like few bands before or since. They were so on fire with their attitude and music that they managed to grace the covers of both Maximum Rock N' Roll and Heartattack before even having a record out or completing a single national tour.\n\nRacetraitor formed in 1996, emerging from the ashes of the short-lived screamo-political project Hinkely as a grinding, blasting sonic maelstrom heavily influenced by the ideas of the progressive left. Their attitude that \"whiteness\" is more sociological construct than inherent identity raised many eyebrows in the supposedly \"liberal\" punk scene. The band also believed that joining with the oppressed in their struggle constituted \"treason\" to societal injustice. This \"treason\" caused them to dub themselves \"race traitors\" -- a term that neo-fascists use in a derogatory sense and one that this band wore as a badge of honor. Vocalist Mani Mostofi, bassist Brent Decker, guitarist Dan Binaei, and drummer Andy Hurley (who replaced original drummer and later second guitarist Karl Hlalvinka early on) brought their engaging, intense, and confrontational performances to small clubs, basements, and do-it-yourself festivals around America.\n\nSoon, California's Uprising label took notice of the Chicago-based band, issuing their first album, Burn the Idol of the White Messiah, in 1998. The following year, Racetraitor hit the touring circuit even harder, toning down their approach while streamlining their brutal hardcore sound. A bassist known simply as \"the Survivor\" replaced Decker, who left for South America and Mexico to continue his own activism. Injecting a dose of spirituality into their lyrical consciousness, Racetraitor offered up three new songs in 1999 on their half of Make Them Talk, a split EP with Indiana's Burn It Down, released by Trustkill. Just before signing a deal that would have brought them to Revelation Records, Racetraitor disbanded that same year.

Personally, I've always felt like these suspicions were a bit exaggerated, and have found Wikipedia a useful resource in nearly field of query.\n\n\n\nFor example, if it weren't for Wikipedia, how would I have known that:\n\nRacetraitor (1995-1999) was a political straight edge metalcore band from Chicago, Illinois who managed to get on the covers of both Maximum Rock N' Roll and HeartattaCk before releasing a note of music. Known for calling audience members \"crackers\" and for espousing radical beliefs influenced by black nationalism, third worldism and other anti-colonial ideologies (and for some members, eventually, Islam). Their lyrical content revolved around issues of privilege, Western dominance of the Third World and inequalities in globalization. Additionally the band addressed issues pertaining to constructions of sexuality in America, corporate dominance of economic and public life, veganism and the straight edge lifestyle. The name Racetraitor was in reference to using one's social and economic privilege to create a more egalitarian world. The idea was to take the pejorative term \"race traitor\" used by white American racists and claim it as a positive self-chosen label. The band's message also held that \"race\" was an artificial and constructed human category. They released an album called 'Burn the Idol of the White Messiah' on Uprising Records and then a split EP called 'Make Them Talk' on Trustkill with their friends in the Indianapolis band Burn It Down. The band were also followers of Fred Hampton Jr and encouraged their fans to write to him, visit him in prison, and raise money for his legal defense\n\n???? I mean, why else would I be slightly intrigued if not for Wikipedia?Oh, maybe the fact the band is called RACETRAITOR and featured two members who would go on to form a fairly popular band you might have heard of.Though it's said more often than it's true, Racetraitor may actually be so divisive that \"you either love \u00e2\u0080\u0098em or you hate \u00e2\u0080\u0098em.\" Or I suppose you could be like me and find amusement in the abrasiveness of the message while only vaguely enjoying the music. While perfectly tolerable in the handful of songs that don't top the two-minute mark (\"Curse,\" \"Dar-al Harb,\" \"Suffocation\"), four minutes of blast-beats and metalcore crunches (\"Broken Dust\") wanes on excessive. However, the longer songs are usually as such due to mid-song devices like spoken word breaks (\"Cast You Down\"), acoustic interludes (\"Path to Misery\") or extended drum solos (\"Broken Dust\").Lyrically, Rt attacks colonialism, slavery, non-Muslim organized religion (Zionism in \"Dar-al Harb\" and Christianity in \"Cast You Down\") but is best when articulating a poetic, rebellious ire, spit with passion like in the nearly taqwacore/powerviolence of \"Suffocation\": \"I don't really know how to end this review, but I'd just like to point out that never once did I directly mention Fall Out Boy.

They released an album called Burn the Idol of the White Messiah on Uprising Records and then a split EP called Make Them Talk on Trustkill with their friends in the Indianapolis band Burn It Down. Racetraitor was one of the most controversial political bands of the 1990s hardcore scene and garnered on the covers of both Maximumrocknroll and HeartattaCk before recording a single note of music. The name Racetraitor was in reference to using one's social and economic privilege to create a more egalitarian world. The idea was to take the pejorative term \"race traitor\" used by white American racists and claim it as a positive self-chosen label. The band was known for aggressively challenging audiences to confront the ways they might help perpetuate or buy into racist and exploitative social and economic systems. Many of their shows turned into heated arguments and they became one of the most talked about political hardcore bands of the late 1990s. Drummer Andy Hurley went on to play in Fall Out Boy along with Pete Wentz who occasionaly filled in on bass for the band. The band reformed in 2016 with plans to remix and re-release Burn The Idol of the White Messiah. \u00ab hide Similar Bands: Earth Crisis, Disembodied, Integrity, Snapcase, Unruh LPs 2042\n\n2018\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n15 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic Burn the Idol of the White Messiah\n\n1998\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n36 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic EPs Invisible Battles Against Invisible Fortresses\n\n2017\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n5 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic Demo 1996\n\n1996\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n3 Votes Rate It Awful Very Poor Poor Average Good Great Excellent Superb Classic Contributors: Mort., SinNanna,"}, {"url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qv9mnm/hardcore-legends-racetraitor-are-on-a-mission-to-defeat-white-supremacy", "page_content": "A few months ago, I went to a metal bar in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to see La Armada\u2014a killer Dominican-turned-Chicago hardcore band we\u2019ve covered here before\u2014headline a benefit show to raise legal funds for migrant families detained at the U.S. border. I got there earlier than expected, and had planned to while away the extra time with a whiskey at the bar, until I spotted the second-to-last band\u2019s name: Racetraitor. I\u2019d never heard of them, but was more than willing to let my curiosity get the better of me\u2014especially after I passed their merch table and saw that they were selling shirts with the phrase \u2018DEFEAT WHITE SUPREMACY\u2019 printed in big block letters on the back.\n\nMostofi, whose family is Iranian, works with human rights defenders in the Middle East. F. Drummer Andy Hurley joined pop punk outfit Fall Out Boy (alongside occasional Racetraitor fill-in bass player Pete Wentz), and is now also part of hardcore group Sect, with whom Racetraitor will soon embark upon a European tour. They never ruled out the idea of a reunion, and rumors of a Racetraitor resurrection floated around for years, but, simply put, life kept getting in the way.\n\nRacetraitor\u2019s original run was short-lived, even in the blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-\u2019em hardcore scene. As Mostofi says, they were active during the second half of the 90s, then broke up in 1999. They released two records\u2014 the furious Burn the Idol of the White Messiah LP on Uprising Records, and a split EP called Make Them Talk via Trustkill\u2014before disappearing. The members remained close and occasionally crossed paths in other projects throughout the years, but ultimately followed their own pursuits. Some chose graduate school or full-time activist work; others switched musical gears.\n\nI had initially been content to be the old lady in the back clutching an overpriced Bulleit, but soon as Racetraitor stepped onstage and their singer Mani Mostofi grabbed the mic, I snapped right the fuck to attention, and pushed my way closer. They were on fire, and stayed lit up throughout their entire short, sharp set. It was only afterwards that I looked them up and realized I\u2019d stumbled into a little piece of hardcore history\u2014and that the band who\u2019d bowled me over with their machinegun riffs and impassioned between-song political speeches were reunited legends.\n\nThe result of those sessions, a full-length called 2042, is a barn-burning blast of metallic hardcore fury that screams by with guns blazing and fists held high. In classic Racetraitor fashion, the title itself is a provocation\u2014as Mostofi explains, the year 2042 is when the census predicts that white Americans will fall below 51 percent and no longer make up a majority of the country\u2019s population. As one might imagine, both right-wing FOX News gasbags like Tucker Carlson and the outright white nationalists at Breitbart have been collectively losing their shit over this information, and Mostofi notes their decision to nab this particular title as a nod to that particular brand of fragile white fear, and a thumbed nose at the inflammatory xenophobic, Islamophobic rhetoric fueling the right wing\u2019s terror.\n\nEventually, though, the time was right. Racetraitor reunited in 2016, and added a new member, guitarist Andrea Black (formerly of Howl and A Storm of Light), who the band knew through mutual friends in the music world; she started out as a touring member, but they immediately clicked, and she was soon invited to join the band outright. The new lineup released a new EP on Organized Crime Records and promising a reissue of Burn the Idol of the White Messiah.That was all they\u2019d originally planned to do, but as Mostofi explains, \u201cAs soon as we started writing, that EP turned into an LP almost immediately. We had 12-13 songs within a period of a month. I think part of that is that we are really highly motivated; we\u2019re putting as much as we can of ourselves into this because it is a personal way of us expressing our take on what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d\n\nSince you got together, how have people reacted? Has it felt like more of a homecoming, or a reintroduction? It\u2019s a little bit of both. We had very divided reaction back in the 90s, so when we were coming back this time, we didn\u2019t really know what to expect. We were very critical, confrontational band, and we basically went to war with the punk scene\u2014not particular individuals, but with the concept of the punk/hardcore community thinking it was always the good guys. And we were challenging them. You can\u2019t just assume the mantle of anti-racist, anti-authoritarian because you wear the right T-shirt and go to the right shows. It has to be a practice.\n\nNoisey: What brought Racetraitor back? I know it\u2019s been a very long time since you were out here\u2014like, a real long time. Mani Mostofi : The thing that really made the conversation serious was Ferguson. When the Ferguson uprising happened, we just thought like, \u201cOK, this is really something that we want to lend solidarity to, and we feel like our music could do that in a way.\u201d It was a slow conversation\u2014and then Trump came on the scene. It became really self-evident that we had to jump into the fold and do something\u2014if not for the larger community\u2014for our own sanity.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that you mentioned label support as a means of getting involved politically. I\u2019ve seen that happening, too\u2014labels that up until a few years ago didn\u2019t talk about politics are now signing bands that are actively anti-fascist and anti-racist. It\u2019s like watching the marketing aspects of a political message unfold in real time. What is that like from your perspective? I was once working with a group of activists on solidarity work with pro-democracy movements in Iran. I said, \u201cLook, in some ways all activism, the sort of awareness-raising activism or acts of solidarity, is marketing. It\u2019s the same set of tools.\u201d That pissed a lot of people off. When we market ourselves as a band, it\u2019s the same thing as marketing an idea, and the trick is, how do you convince people that it\u2019s not performative? There\u2019s a big critique for example, that anarchism is dumpster diving and growing out dreads; it\u2019s not about developing a movement for fundamental change in the way we structure our societies. For us, an inescapable part of what we are as a band is saying that if you want to fight white supremacy, you\u2019re getting involved with struggles where communities of color are empowered, and you\u2019re trying to dismantle the system of hierarchy based on race. That\u2019s how you do it. It\u2019s through activism; it\u2019s through community involvement. It\u2019s listening to people most impacted by oppression. It\u2019s inescapable. For us, are we marketing our politics? Sure, but our politics get involved in more than the superficial. That\u2019s how we reconcile it.\n\nWe still see internet trolls who will say things like, \u201cThe band Racetraitor invented white genocide,\u201d [but] that stuff is to be expected in this era. And the other thing that has been heartwarming is the fact that, for some people in the metal and hardcore community, they feel like supporting us is a way of contributing. Our label Good Fight is backing us pretty intensely and it\u2019s really because of what we\u2019re about. They feel like they have to contribute what they can, and as a label, what they can do is put out a band like us.\n\nNow, a lot of [concepts] we were talking about\u2014like white privilege\u2014have become commonplace, so we\u2019re no longer thematically cutting-edge in any way. I don\u2019t necessarily think we\u2019re changing people\u2019s minds. What I think we\u2019re doing is making people feel less alone, feel more connected to these ideas through music and art, and that allows them to become more active and more conscious. We are cheerleaders for people who want to stand up to fascism and white supremacy.The insanity of the Trump campaign and the rise of the Alt-Right catching everybody off guard made us a band that people welcomed.\n\nYou\u2019re also bringing racism and the ongoing exclusion of people of color from these genres to the forefront. Because it is such an overwhelmingly white scene, there seems to be an awkwardness and silence around these issues, because most white people don\u2019t know how to address it. How we can make more space for bands like you? Hardcore and metal are still really white; there\u2019s no argument there. Sometimes for people of color, that becomes exhausting, and it pushes them away from the scene. It\u2019s hard sometimes for white kids to understand what that means, because white kids aren\u2019t trying to be racist or exclusionary. It\u2019s just that sometimes people feel, I can\u2019t really be myself here. There\u2019s certain things that people don\u2019t get about my experience. I will say is that from 1999 to 2018, right, even though it\u2019s an extremely white scene still, at least in hardcore and punk, there\u2019s a more inclusiveness than there was. I would say especially more women than people of color that are taking prominent roles. When I was around, there were a lot women involved in the scene, but they did zines, and other aspects of what makes the scene, but ultimately when talking about the music scene, the band is the center point, right? There\u2019s a lot more women in bands now in prominent roles, and that\u2019s been different. And there\u2019s definitely more people of color.\n\nWe\u2019re at a time where neutrality is not an option, so if people are taking political stances, it\u2019s at least an opportunity to engage them, and translate that into deeper deeds. I was just chatting online with people about whether Taylor Swift saying she doesn\u2019t like homophobia, sexism, and systematic racism is a good thing. Of course it\u2019s a good thing! It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sufficient, [but] I\u2019m all for the fact that she said that, and that opens the conversation with her or her fanbase to push the envelope. At this time, we shouldn\u2019t really talk about who needs to be excluded from the movement. If anyone wants to lends their voice in support in one way or another, I don\u2019t think we should immediately question their intentions and try to ostracize them. We\u2019re very, very much on this precipice of not just evil and neoliberal capitalism that we\u2019ve been living in, but actually fascism. As bad as things have been, that\u2019s actually worse, so we need to have a big tent approach.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s nothing very dangerous or status quo smashing about parroting Rush Limbaugh talking points. There\u2019s this prevailing thought in parts of the metal community that metal and music in general is meant to be about escapism\u2014that you shouldn\u2019t have to think about the art you are consuming. And I find that so frustrating. Metal has always had political bands. If you want to ostracize those bands from metal, go ahead, but you lose a lot of the most pivotal bands. I totally get escapism. Escapism is actually not something we should disparage; it\u2019s something we can celebrate. It\u2019s just whether or not you get all consumed by it. If you don\u2019t want to listen to political metal, that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s plenty of other stuff to listen to. I\u2019m not saying you have to listen to political music. I\u2019m saying I use music to say how people should live more political lives. I don\u2019t care what music you listen to. I care about, are you apathetic to suffering around you? If you don\u2019t want to express your lack of apathy by listening to my band or any other political band, that\u2019s cool, but some people, myself included, when I put on a band that tested my ideas or reflected my values, it made me feel like I was part of something bigger. And that gave me courage or motivation to actually be part of something bigger in real life.\n\nHow do you make more politically conscious bands? Part of it is you try to celebrate the bands that are saying the right thing. We think of ourselves as anti-authoritarian radical music scene; whether that\u2019s metal or punk or hardcore, all these genres try to buck norms. We try to say to buck norms to buck power, otherwise it\u2019s just what costume you\u2019re wearing, and that\u2019s just as shallow as anything else. That gives this type of music power. Makes it threatening. Makes it a form of cultural resistance. The more we celebrate that, the more people will feel empowered to express those ideas through music or whatever else they do to contribute to this community.\n\nThat\u2019s been a great thing and what we do, as Racetraitor, is we introduce this idea of what does it mean to actually be involved in anti-racism. You can be personally anti-racist, all you want, but the schools around are designed in a certain way, how people have housing and generational wealth has been designed a certain way. You live under white power whether you choose to or not, and we\u2019re saying, \u201cMake a conscious choice not to,\u201d and we\u2019re often saying that in predominantly white spaces intentionally. The fact that that is acceptable part of the scene that this band could come here and say these things I think has value.\n\nI know for a fact there\u2019s people that just listen to our band for the riffs, because that\u2019s all they comment on. That\u2019s cool. We also think our riffs are heavy. That\u2019s why we play them [laughs]. So that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s not forget, the music that we play is sonically violent, right? And the scene both in terms of visuals and in terms of lyrics has always used violence as a way of conveying ideas, right? It\u2019s weird, because if you think about a liberation politic, the ultimate goal is to minimize violence. It\u2019s really easy for people who actually want to promote violence and right-wing thought to infiltrate our type of music. Rush Limbaugh is actually the perfect example. Why? Basically he just tells a bunch of dudes to just go ahead and be assholes. You\u2019re being your true self by just being a total dickhead.\n\nWe use that type of music because we feel that violence inside, and we\u2019re trying to exorcise it; we\u2019re trying to get it out of our system and we\u2019re trying to put it in the world and give it a positive shake. That\u2019s also sometimes part of the escapism. You listen to aggressive music as a healthy outlet, and we take that one step further and we turn the healthy outlet into a political philosophy. But you could see how it could become the other way. You take the violence and the aggression and sense of fuck you, and you make it about empowering the individual to take on the rest of the world around them, and sometimes that means hating people because of their nationality or race. Sometimes it means hating women. Sometimes it means hating queer people. It\u2019s very easy to transform this type of music into those negative ideas if you\u2019re not conscious about it. It can infiltrate everything we do. A lot of people don\u2019t buy into it; there\u2019s a lot of cool people in these scenes. But is it contested territory? For sure.\n\nSo if a younger kid comes up to you at a show and says, \u201cHey I just walked in because your riffs sounded cool, and I really like what you had to say. I\u2019m into metal and I\u2019m into punk but I don\u2019t know much about this political stuff but I want to do something .\u201d What would you tell them to do with their energy?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily tell someone go join your local socialist organization chapter or anarchist affinity group; what we have always stressed is grassroots local organizations that are not necessarily about one political ideology of another. The way the members of this band got into activism was through working with people in affected communities.We tell people to work with communities that are trying to figure out how to survive, and turn the process of survival into an act of greater social change. That creates a lot more empathy, and it\u2019s more grounded in human values.\n\nWe all derive influence from different ideological thoughts on the left, but I would never tell somebody to just become all consumed by ideology. For us, activism is about people. People live in communities. So it\u2019s really about finding those community groups you agree with and working with them on whatever issue it might be. It might be gentrification in your community. It might be immigrant rights and supporting refugees. It might be working with queer teenagers. It might be working with women who survive sexual assault. Working with those communities make a big difference, and then in your own brain, thinking about how that is part of a struggle for a more just society as a whole.\n\nWhat came first for you: punk rock or politics?\n\nIt depends on how you define punk rock! I was into post-punk bands at a very young age, like Joy Division or the Cure, and the term I use for those bands was punk when I was 12-13 years old; I didn\u2019t know there was another word for them. At the same time, I\u2019ve always sort of had a sort of political consciousness as a really young kid. It sounds weird, but I can\u2019t remember a time in my life when I wasn\u2019t thinking about these issues of race and class. I was born in Chicago in the late seventies, and my family\u2019s apartment was really on the line between the rich part of Hyde Park and the poor side of Inglewood. Maybe because I was the son of immigrants\u2014I was from an Iranian family\u2014I never really felt like I totally fit in. At a young age, I started thinking about, \u2018So, there\u2019s different races, there\u2019s different incomes.\u2019 I didn't have a word for class, but I knew some people could afford shit and some people couldn\u2019t. I was picked on as a kid for being Iranian. I can\u2019t tell you how many times they told me my father is a terrorist. If you feel like you hate the system of oppression around you, this is the music for that, right?\n\nSo where did you get the name Racetraitor in the first place?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of different disputes about where the name of the band came from, but the person that came up with it was our guitar player, Dan [Binaei]. His family is from small town Kentucky, but Dan grew up in Chicago and got into progressive politics in high school. He always felt like, this was his family, but there was a level of disconnect with them. He remembered watching an episode of Jerry Springer or Donahue, where they had KKK members on, and they started calling white people in the audience who were speaking out against racism \u201cracetraitors.\u201d It just sort of clicked with Dan that, in his environment, maybe there are people who think of him as a racetraitor. He proposed that name to the rest of the band, and we just thought it was so crazy that we had to do it.\n\nWhen I\u2019m just talking to someone and I tell them I\u2019m in a band called Racetraitor, within like ten seconds, I always make sure to say it\u2019s an anti-racist band, because it\u2019s such a crazy term that people don\u2019t always get the idea that we\u2019re trying to reclaim the term, take it away from the white nationalists, and turn it into something that\u2019s a badge of honor. Not everybody gets it right away, but that\u2019s one of the victories of the band. From the first second you\u2019re introduced to us, you have to process something.That\u2019s sort of our success and our curse, you know? I\u2019ve read reviews that call us a band that\u2019s really unpleasant and challenging\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s the road we paved for ourselves, and it starts with the name."}, {"url": "https://www.qobuz.com/se-en/interpreter/racetraitor/1853513", "page_content": "Racetraitor\n\nRacetraitor shook up the punk and hardcore scenes' consciousness with their radical politics and scorching, uncompromisingly brutal metalcore sound like few bands before or since. They were so on fire with their attitude and music that they managed to grace the covers of both Maximum Rock N' Roll and Heartattack before even having a record out or completing a single national tour. Racetraitor formed in 1996, emerging from the ashes of the short-lived screamo-political project Hinkely as a grinding, blasting sonic maelstrom heavily influenced by the ideas of the progressive left. Their attitude that \"whiteness\" is more sociological construct than inherent identity raised many eyebrows in the supposedly \"liberal\" punk scene. The band also believed that joining with the oppressed in their struggle constituted \"treason\" to societal injustice. This \"treason\" caused them to dub themselves \"race traitors\" -- a term that neo-fascists use in a derogatory sense and one that this band wore as a badge of honor. Vocalist Mani Mostofi, bassist Brent Decker, guitarist Dan Binaei, and drummer Andy Hurley (who replaced original drummer and later second guitarist Karl Hlalvinka early on) brought their engaging, intense, and confrontational performances to small clubs, basements, and do-it-yourself festivals around America.

They were so on fire with their attitude and music that they managed to grace the covers of both Maximum Rock N' Roll and Heartattack before even having a record out or completing a single national tour. Racetraitor formed in 1996, emerging from the ashes of the short-lived screamo-political project Hinkely as a grinding, blasting sonic maelstrom heavily influenced by the ideas of the progressive left. Their attitude that \"whiteness\" is more sociological construct than inherent identity raised many eyebrows in the supposedly \"liberal\" punk scene. The band also believed that joining with the oppressed in their struggle constituted \"treason\" to societal injustice. This \"treason\" caused them to dub themselves \"race traitors\" -- a term that neo-fascists use in a derogatory sense and one that this band wore as a badge of honor. Vocalist Mani Mostofi, bassist Brent Decker, guitarist Dan Binaei, and drummer Andy Hurley (who replaced original drummer and later second guitarist Karl Hlalvinka early on) brought their engaging, intense, and confrontational performances to small clubs, basements, and do-it-yourself festivals around America.
