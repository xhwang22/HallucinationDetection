{"IBM's patent operations were worldwide.": [{"url": "https://research.ibm.com/blog/future-of-ibm-innovation", "page_content": "For more than a century, IBM has been rooted in the fundamental promise of technology: We believe that when we apply science to real-world problems, we can make progress \u2014 for both business and society. And as those problems have changed over time, so have we. IBM has repeatedly reinvented itself to overcome whatever obstacles stand in the way of innovation and value for our clients.\n\nIBM scientists and engineers have been at the heart of our relentless reinvention. They have always been guided by a core principle, to deliver innovation that matters, for our company and the world.\n\nOur commitment to research as part of our business model means we will continue to create the technologies that our clients and the world rely upon. For example, we have led US companies for decades in the number of patents received annually. Today, it was announced IBM has achieved this milestone for IBM\u2019s total of more than 8,500 patents led the IFI Claims Patent Service 2021 rankings. 29 years in a row .\n\nWe are proud of this accomplishment and our leadership. However, the number of patents we receive has never told the full story of the innovation we drive. Our priority has always been leading the frontiers of computing and its relationship to business, science, professions, and society.\n\nI believe that today, more than ever, we need innovation to meet the demands of many of the major challenges of our time \u2014 from models to create sustainable growth, to addressing future pandemics and climate change, to enabling energy and food security. To address them, we need faster discovery, open collaboration, efficient problem solving, and the ability to push science and business into new frontiers.\n\nThis future will be powered by a blend of high-performance computing, AI, and quantum computing, all integrated through the hybrid cloud. The confluence of these technologies represents a step change in computing, and the outcomes will surpass anything we\u2019ve seen before. Together, these advancements can exponentially alter the speed and scale at which we can uncover solutions to complex problems. We\u2019ve come to call this accelerated discovery.\n\nOur priority has always been leading the frontiers of computing and its relationship to business, science, professions, and society.\n\nBut this will not happen in a vacuum. Strong innovation is built on a collaborative ecosystem, a commitment to long-term investment in hard tech challenges and fundamental materials, and the implementation of an open approach.\n\nWe have a long history of putting these principles into practice, and it\u2019s in this spirit we undertook some of the most daunting hard technology challenges in 2021 \u2014 and delivered on them.\n\nTo name just a few: we worked with our partners to demonstrate the first 2 nm nanosheet technology for semiconductors, which will support up to 50 billion transistors on a chip the size of a fingernail and offer enormous gains in efficiency. We also collaborated with Samsung on the successful prototype of a chip that defies conventional semiconductor design, and lays the groundwork to achieve energy density and performance levels previously thought unattainable.\n\nRow of 2 nm nanosheet devices as seen using transmission electron microscopy. 2 nm is smaller than the width of a single strand of human DNA.\n\nAnd as we lead the quest to reach practical and large-scale quantum computing, we stayed true to the ambitious roadmap we laid out in 2020 and In addition to unveiling Eagle, our 127-qubit quantum processor, and previewing the design for IBM Quantum System Two, our next-generation system that will house future quantum processors, we also introduced, Quantum Serverless, a new programming model for leveraging quantum and classical resources. Read more. delivered Eagle , our first 127-qubit processor, which will be critical to growing the nascent quantum industry IBM is pioneering.\n\nTo continue to realize a future marked by fundamental technology progress and the exploration of new scientific boundaries, we are deepening our commitment to this approach.\n\nBuilding open communities for innovation\n\nAs part of our strategy, we are doubling down on our already robust and long-standing commitment to open communities. Innovation can emerge from anywhere, from a tech giant or a disruptive startup. In software, the growth of open source has redefined where innovation can come from, and how it is monetized. IBM has a long history in open source, and that continues today. Our pioneering work in serverless computing, which is quickly becoming the leading platform for the hybrid cloud industry because of the significant growth of Red Hat, is just one example of this.\n\nWe will also expand our focus to grow communities of innovation. The most successful technologies and innovations are often found when complementary institutions work together. To take one example among many, our collaboration with the The Cleveland Clinic + IBM Discovery Accelerator is a collaboration set to advance pathogen research, and foster the next-gen tech workforce for healthcare. Read more. Cleveland Clinic will bring together IBM\u2019s technology and expertise in hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum computing to help Cleveland Clinic discover solutions to pressing issues around public health.\n\nThese sorts of collaborations will help technology to solve truly profound problems, and we hope to do so in partnership with other institutions adopting our technology, including Fraunhofer-Geselleschaft, Germany\u2019s largest research institution, the Hartree Centre, a major AI and high-performance computing research facility in the UK, and Japan\u2019s University of Tokyo and Keio University. Worldwide, we will continue to forge partnerships with the broader scientific community as we look to accelerate the pace of discovery.\n\nIBM Germany engineers working on Fraunhofer-Geselleschaft\u2019s IBM Quantum System One.\n\nPushing discovery beyond patent filings\n\nMoving forward, we\u2019re strengthening our companywide approach to focus our innovation efforts around the areas that matter most for our business and for society at large. This will include hybrid cloud, AI, quantum computing, systems and semiconductors, and security.\n\nWe believe these areas will have the most impact on our clients, industries, and the world. We also believe they\u2019re the ones with the greatest potential for ecosystem collaboration.\n\nWhile IBM will remain an intellectual property powerhouse with one of the strongest US patent portfolios, as part of our heightened focus moving forward, we\u2019ll also take a more selective approach to patenting. We are proud of our decades-long history of topping the US patents chart, but in this new era, our position as the recipient of the most patents in any given year will not be a priority. Instead, our focus will be to prioritize growing these key technology areas of our company.\n\nThe problems the world is facing today require us to work faster than ever before. We see it as our duty to catalyze scientific progress by taking the cutting-edge technologies we\u2019re working on, scaling them, and deploying them with partners across every industry.\n\nInnovation is the heart and soul of IBM and serves as the engine to make our clients and the world work better. We made enormous strides in the last year, and we plan to achieve even more in 2022.\n\nLearn more about:"}, {"url": "https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-01-12-IBM-Tops-U-S-Patent-List-for-28th-Consecutive-Year-with-Innovations-in-Artificial-Intelligence-Hybrid-Cloud-Quantum-Computing-and-Cyber-Security", "page_content": "ARMONK, N.Y., Jan. 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) scientists and researchers received 9,130 U.S. patents in 2020, the most of any company, marking 28 consecutive years of IBM patent leadership. IBM led the industry in the number of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, quantum computing and security-related patents granted.\n\n\"The world needs scientific thinking and action more than ever,\" Dar\u00edo Gil, SVP and Director of IBM Research\n\n\"The world needs scientific thinking and action more than ever. IBM's sustained commitment to investing in research and development, both in good and in challenging times, has paved the way for new products and new frontiers of information technology that have greatly benefited our clients and society,\" said Dar\u00edo Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research. \"The culture of innovation at IBM is stronger than ever, thanks to our inventors worldwide who devote themselves to advancing the boundaries of knowledge in their respective fields every single day.\"\n\nIBM led the industry in the number of U.S. patents across key technology fields:\n\nMaking AI More Intuitive IBM received more than 2,300 AI patents as inventors developed new AI technologies to help businesses scale their use of AI. Patents in this area ranged from technology to make virtual agents more responsive to emotions when speaking to customers, to AI that can help people make difficult decisions -- summarizing key decision points from a variety of information sources, both written and verbal, and presenting them in easy-to-understand visualizations. IBM is focused on delivering innovations in natural language processing, automation and building trust in AI, and continually infusing new capabilities from IBM Research into our IBM Watson products. In 2020, this included the IBM Watson team announcing the first commercialization of capabilities from Project Debater \u2013 a technology that digests massive amounts of text and constructs a well-structured speech on a given topic and delivers it with clarity and purpose.\n\nStreamlining Hybrid Cloud Deployments at the Edge IBM received more than 3,000 patents related to cloud and hybrid cloud technologies. One of the crucial decisions CIOs face today is determining which data will be processed on premises and which will be processed in the cloud. IBM inventors developed a technology to intelligently distribute the data processing components between the cloud, the edge and computing devices in-between. It offers the potential to greatly optimize the hybrid cloud for IoT workloads \u2013 such as GPS-generated driving instructions - that are sensitive to latency. Edge and hybrid cloud offerings are crucial parts of IBM's product roadmap. In 2020, they included the launch in May 2020 of the IBM Edge Application Manager, an autonomous management solution to enable AI, analytics and IoT enterprise workloads to be deployed and remotely managed, delivering real-time analysis and insight at scale. In addition, in November 2020 , IBM announced the IBM Cloud for Telecommunications to help companies unlock the power of edge and 5G in November 2020 . The holistic hybrid cloud offering leverages IBM's innovative encryption capabilities, designed to enable mission-critical workloads to be managed consistently from the network core to the edge, to position telecom providers to extract more value from their data while they drive innovation for their customers.\n\nLaying the Foundation for Powerful Quantum Applications Quantum computing is a major focus for IBM and this is reflected in IBM's leadership in quantum computing patents obtained. One patent, for example, simplifies the mapping of quantum molecular simulation on a quantum computer. As a result, researchers will be able to explore simulating chemical reactions on quantum computers to understand how and when the discovery process around new materials and new pharmaceuticals will be revolutionized. IBM was also granted a patent that sets the foundation for investigating more accurate and efficient risk analysis calculations on a quantum computer. These ideas are already being extended by research done in collaboration with leading financial institutions.\n\nMaximizing Security for the World's Most Sensitive Data As enterprises work to protect their data, particularly in highly-regulated industries, IBM inventors received more than 1,400 security-related patents. One of the patents is used for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), an IBM-pioneered method of performing computation on data that remains encrypted while being processed in order to maximize security for data in use. Previously, processing encrypted data required decryption before processing and re-encrypting the results, thus making data more vulnerable while unencrypted. IBM inventors patented a technique that allows encrypted data to be organized so that FHE vector comparison operations can be performed efficiently and maximizes the security of the data. IBM Security launched a service that allows companies to experiment with fully homomorphic encryption in December of 2020.\n\n\n\nPatents were awarded to more than 9,000 inventors located in 46 U.S. states and 54 countries. Since 1920, IBM has received more than 150,000 U.S. patents and played a crucial role in innovations ranging from magnetic storage to laser eye surgery. IBM's culture of scientific research is integral to the company's legacy of innovation that matters to our clients and to the world. To that end, in April 2020, IBM announced that it was a founding partner of the Open COVID Pledge, which grants free access to the patents and patent applications of its portfolio of more than 80,000 patents worldwide to those developing technologies to help diagnose, prevent, contain or treat coronaviruses.\n\nRead more about IBM's patent leadership here.\n\n*2020 patent data is sourced from IFI Claims Patent Service: http://www.ificlaims.com.\n\nHugh Collins\n\nIBM Research Communications\n\nhughdcollins@ibm.com\n\nSOURCE IBM Research"}, {"url": "https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/patents/", "page_content": "On January 26, 1939, James W. Bryce, IBM\u2019s chief engineer, dictated a two-page letter to Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the company\u2019s president. It was an update on the research and patents he had been working on. Today, the remarkable letter serves as a window into IBM\u2019s long-held role as a leader in the development and protection of intellectual property.\n\nThe investigation bore fruit. On January 15, 1940, Arthur H. Dickinson, Bryce\u2019s top associate and a world-beating inventor in his own right, submitted an application for a patent for \u201ccertain improvements in accounting apparatus.\u201d In fact, the patent represented a turning point in computing history. Dickinson, under Bryce\u2019s supervision, had invented a method for adding and subtracting using vacuum tubes\u2014a basic building block of the fully electronic computers that began to appear in the 1940s and transformed the world of business in the 1950s.\n\nBryce was one of the most prolific inventors in American history, racking up more than 500 U.S. and foreign patents by the end of his career. In his letter to Watson, he described six projects, each of which would be considered a signature life achievement for the average person. They included research into magnetic recording of data, an investigation into the use of light rays in computing and plans with Harvard University for what would become one of the first digital computers. But another project was perhaps most significant. Wrote Bryce: \u201cWe have been carrying on an investigation in connection with the development of computing devices which do not employ the usual adding wheels, but instead use electronic effects and employ tubes similar to those used in radio work.\u201d\n\n2010 was the 18th consecutive year that IBM topped the list of the world's most inventive companies. With a few exceptions, the number of patents received has grown each year.\n\nThe very first patent that inspired IBM's culture of innovation was this one, filed by Herman Hollerith for his tabulating machine on September 18th, 1894. IBM continued to innovate punched card tabulation technology throughout the first half of the 20th century.\n\nHerman Hollerith, inventor of the tabulating machine that was used in U.S. population censuses, had worked briefly as an assistant examiner at the U.S. Patent Office in 1883\u201384 before becoming a full-time inventor. Soon after leaving government service, he filed his first patent\u2014for an electrical calculating system that was the basis for his Tabulating Machine Co., a precursor of IBM. By hiring engineering consultant Bryce in 1917, Watson showed that he recognized the importance of pure inventing. Rather than developing products, Bryce\u2019s job was to dream up new ways of doing things and patent them. He established a patent development department in 1932, hiring Dickinson, who later described his boss\u2019 style: \u201cIf he had an idea or was thinking about something, he would discuss it. Usually he would make a sketch or a drawing, which was sufficient to establish what he was thinking about or what he wanted to do.\u201d\n\nThe pattern continues today. In a world where relationships and innovation are increasingly collaborative, the concept of intellectual property is undergoing profound change\u2014and IBM is leading the way toward new regimes and approaches to the creation of intellectual capital. The company\u2019s century of fostering innovation has revealed that the way to optimize intellectual property systems for maximum innovation in this new world is to seek balance between appropriate protection of individual and organizational ownership on one hand, and the fostering of new, open, collaborative forms of value creation on the other.\n\nFor example, IBM helped establish the open-source operating system\n\nLinux \u00ae as a mainstream software platform in business by declaring in 2005 that it would not enforce its patents against the Linux kernel. In 2008, IBM co-founded the Eco-Patent Commons and contributed 28 patents covering environmentally friendly business and manufacturing processes, which are now freely available for anybody to use for eco-friendly purposes.\n\nAt the same time, IBM has taken significant steps to improve the performance of national patent offices and stimulate innovation throughout society. In 2006, in collaboration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other companies, IBM helped establish the Peer-to-Patent project. This project enables experts to contribute evidence of prior inventions via a website, helping patent examiners evaluate the patent-worthiness of an application.\n\nThrough it all, IBM\u2019s dedication to inventing and protecting intellectual property is as strong as ever. In 2010, IBM ranked number one among companies receiving U.S. patents, with 5,896 granted. It marked the company\u2019s 18th consecutive year as the U.S. patent leader."}, {"url": "https://newsroom.ibm.com/Introducing-7-of-IBMs-Masters-of-Invention", "page_content": "Introducing 7 of IBM\u2019s Masters of Invention\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable winning streak.\n\nRecently, for the 27th consecutive year, IBM announced it had received more U.S. patents than any other company. What\u2019s more, the total for 2019\u20149,262 patents\u2014was the highest ever awarded to a single company.\n\nImpressive as that record may be, it\u2019s simply scorekeeping for the real IBM game: scalable innovation that continually reshapes the way we work and live.\n\nAmong the world\u2019s biggest technology companies, IBM stands alone as the global leader in original and applied research. The patents are important, of course, because they ensure that IBM\u2019s continual stream of technological breakthroughs can lead to scalable, commercial products and services that can be adopted by business and society.\n\n\n\nIBMJohn Kelly, executive vice president, oversees intellectual property at IBM.\n\n\n\nThe DRAM circuit that an IBM inventor named Robert H. Dennard patented in 1966, for example, now enables the billions of bytes of memory that make today\u2019s smartphones the equivalent of a mobile mainframe computer.\n\nAnd it was IBM research in artificial intelligence over the decades, when scientists and engineers elsewhere were giving up in frustration, that has made AI part of everyday modern life.\n\nOr take quantum computing, something IBM physicists began exploring in the 1980s. The technology, which harnesses the unique properties of sub-atomic physics, is now in the early stages of adoption by companies and research universities worldwide, which are tapping into a shared global fleet of IBM quantum machines.\n\nBalancing \u2018Far-Out\u2019 With Business Relevance\n\nAI and quantum research continue unabated. So does basic research into blockchain, cloud computing and the Internet of Things, all of which were among the fields in which IBM inventors secured patents in 2019. That work comes from the IBM Research division, as well as the company\u2019s development labs around the world.\n\nIn some cases, primary research is the main task of the scientists and engineers who secure patents. In many other instances, inventing is work that IBMers do on their own time, when they\u2019re not busy with client-specific projects. Either way, IBM's culture of innovation, inquiry and collaboration has yielded a steady stream of technological breakthroughs that are already changing how the company and its clients do business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do an incredibly good job over the decades of balancing between bleeding-edge, far-out, high-risk research and being relevant to the company,\u2019\u2019 says John E. Kelly III, the IBM executive vice president who oversees intellectual property and has been with the company since 1980.\n\nSo valued are the IBM inventors who turn their research into patentable ideas that the company has developed a career path whose milestones include becoming a Master Inventor. The designation is awarded to those who, according to the company, have \u201cmastered the patent process, mentored broadly, added value to IBM's portfolio and demonstrated sustained innovation leadership and service.\u201d IBM also pays inventors for their patents.\n\n\u201cCulturally,\u2019\u2019 Kelly says, \u201cthese people are really, really inventive and innovative. We try to create a culture where that\u2019s appreciated, but it\u2019s also recognized and rewarded.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Art of the Patent\n\nKelly also acknowledges the art and craft of the patent process as perfected by IBM\u2019s intellectual property lawyers, led by Manny Schecter, the company\u2019s chief patent counsel.\n\n\n\nSchecter was an IBM patent lawyer working from Tucson, Ariz., when the company reached the top of the patent charts in 1993 (with 1,085 that year). He recalls it as a turning point, in which IBM unseated the Japanese titans like Canon and Hitachi that had dominated U.S. patenting for much of the previous decade.\n\n\n\nROBERT JONES FOR IBMManny Schecter, IBM's chief patent counsel.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing the leader in patents is a reminder to the world that IBM is an innovator,\u201d says Schechter. \u201cWe\u2019re really good at seeing the nugget of what\u2019s new each time the inventor brings something forward.\"\n\nThis year, Feb. 11 is National Inventors Day. In the run-up to that day of national recognition, we\u2019re presenting a series of profiles of IBM inventors and the culture of innovation that supports them.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see, part of the marvel is the diverse global talent pool responsible for these inventions. It\u2019s the work of these scientists and engineers today that will drive IBM\u2019s business tomorrow, and make the world more efficient and livable in the years to come.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you went to any IBM business unit and said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to cut off research,\u2019 they\u2019d go crazy,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThey know it\u2019s IBM\u2019s lifeblood.\u2019\u2019\n\nSee the Master Inventor profiles \u2192"}, {"url": "https://www.consortiuminfo.org/intellectual-propery/intellectual-property-rights/ibm-adopts-open-patent-policy/", "page_content": "Updated 12:45 PM EDT: The original version of this blog entry was based on an article in the New York Times, and then updated when the related IBM press release became generally available. For the Back Story on that rewrite, see this entry\n\nThe New York Times reported this morning that IBM would announce a new patent policy later today, and described in general what the terms of that policy might be. IBM clearly hopes that this move will increase pressure on other companies to accelerate efforts to improve the quality of software patents, which is an issue of interest and concern to a broad audience, and particularly those that participate in the development of, or that use, open source software.\n\nThe press release that issued later in the day states that the new policy applies to IBM's operations worldwide, and is based on four \"tenets:\"\n\nPatent applicants are responsible for the quality and clarity of their patent applications.\n\nPatent applications should be available for public examination.\n\nPatent ownership should be transparent and easily discernable.\n\nPure business methods without technical merit should not be\n\npatentable.\n\nThe Times article states that IBM is seeking to lead the market towards patent reform, despite the lagging efforts of Congress to improve the quality of software patents, which are widely regarded as being too easy to get, and too expensive and difficult to challenge.\n\nThe Times article speaks in sufficiently broad terms that make it difficult to determine exactly how broad the impact of the new policy will be, and the press release itself is somewhat heavy going, due to its subject matter. As a result, I got in touch with IBM\u2019s Ari Fishkind, the Public Affairs Manager associated with the press release, to get clarification on a few points, which I\u2019ll come back to later on below.\n\nFirst, though, let\u2019s look at the exact text of the new policy itself, which reads as follows:\n\n\n\nPatent applicants are responsible for the quality and clarity of their patent applications. Patent applications must be written with clear specifications and claims, and include a thorough review of prior art. This includes performing patentability searches in advance of filing patent applications, and of course providing all of the pertinent prior art documents to the applicable patent offices.\n\n\n\nPatent applications should be available for public examination and comment. Patent applications are generally published automatically 18 months after filing, but where they are not, applicants should request 18-month publication. Applicants should also permit public comment on their published patent applications, so that the best prior art and other pertinent information can be made available to patent offices during the patent examination process.\n\n\n\nPatent ownership should be transparent and easily discernible. Patent owners should record their ownership in their own name and not in the name of a shell company, and patent applicants should state in their applications who owns those applications.\n\n\n\nPure business methods without technical merit should not be patentable. All inventions with technical merit should be patentable, provided they meet all of the requirements of patentability. Applicants should seek to publish, not patent, their pure business method innovations if they wish to prevent others from patenting similar business methods.\n\nIn some ways, the last point is the most interesting, and requires a bit of explanation for those not versed in patent law. Under prevailing law, an invention must be \u201cnovel,\u201d as well as \u201cnon-obvious.\u201d Loosely speaking, this means that an invention can\u2019t be patented if someone invented it before, or if, based on existing knowledge and patent filings (\u201cprior art\u201d) conceiving it would be obvious to anyone who is \u201cskilled in the art.\u201d\n\nBoil all that down, and it means that if you invent something and publish it, it becomes difficult or impossible for anyone else to successfully gain a patent on the same, or a very similar, invention. In effect, then, publishing an invention is akin to placing it in the public domain in a way that makes it immune from being patented by anyone else in the future. And this is what IBM is stating it will do in appropriate cases, and what it is urging others to do as well. I think that\u2019s a great idea, and have wondered why this has not more frequently and deliberately done before.\n\nThe press release states that IBM will take several actions \u201cto implement and support this new policy.\u201d Those actions (in my paraphrasing) are:\n\n\n\nTo spend \u201cthousands of hours annually\u201d reviewing published patent applications filed by others with the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and make any \u201cprior art\u201d known to the PTO that it discovers that would indicate that a given patent claim should not be allowed. This effort would be made through a recently launched pilot project launched by the PTO with the collaboration of IBM, Microsoft, GE, HP, Oracle, Intel, and Red Hat called the USPTO Community Patent Review pilot\n\n\n\nIt will make all of its own software patent applications open to community review after 18 months.\n\n\n\nIBM will \u201cmake available\u201d over 100 of its business method patents, constituting over 50% of its portolio of such patents (details are not given in the press release how, or under what terms, these patents will be made available). It also pledges to \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d its filing of business method patents in the future.\n\n\n\nIBM will \u201cpromptly and publicly\u201d record the clear ownership of all patents that it owns\n\nAs noted in my comments above, some aspects of the new policy could use elaboration. Here\u2019s what Ari had to say on those points:\n\nOn the question of what applications would be published and when:\n\n\n\nRegarding community review of patents: we\u2019re starting modestly, with probably less than 100 patent applications of all varieties, being made available for public review and comment. That number will be probably grow in tandem with the [PTO pilot] program\u2019s success. So, no, not all of our patents. The goal is to make the public review of all applications, industrywide, mandatory, but for right now, we want to show that this kind of thing can be done successfully.\n\nApparently, the PTO pilot program is only able to handle so many applications at this time. In a later email, Ari told me that IBM is looking forward to that number increasing, and that the patent applications can be of all kinds, and not just software patent applications.\n\nOn how to determine what types of business method patents (BMPs) should still be permitted and which should not:\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not calling for an end to all BMPs, just the ones without huge technical underpinnings. If a BMP can still be expressed by a software algorithm, then it probably meets a high standards. We\u2019re going to focus on BMPs that meet those standards, and make about 100 other BMPs available to the public to innovate on.\n\nThe new policy is the result of a development process that included external as well as internal input, and is based upon a Wiki that gathered the comments and contributions of \u201cover 50 patent and policy experts from the United States, Europe, Japan and China,\u201d offered during May and June of this year. That document can be accessed at this page at the IBM site.\n\nThe new IBM move follows on the heels of several other initiatives in the marketplace (the PTO pilot project being an example), some supported by other major technology vendors in addition to IBM, and some unilateral efforts by single companies. Individual actions include a series of \u201cnon-assertion covenants\u201d made by some of the same companies, and most recently, by Microsoft, in connection with 35 Web services standards.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what reactions this latest unilateral action elicits among IBM\u2019s peers and competitors.\n\nAlready, commentators have begun greeting each new pledge by a major technology company not to use its patents oppressively as a challenge to the rest of the industry to not only match, but beat, the latest move in support of open standards and, in particular, open source software development and licensing.\n\nHow far can this process go? Lately, the raises in this intellectual property poker game seem to be growing larger rather than more modest, indicating that the pile of patent chips on the table has plenty of room to grow.\n\nFull text of the IBM press release:\n\nIBM Establishes Worldwide Patent Policy to Promote Innovation\n\nPledges Thousands of Hours to Community Review of Patent Applications; Reduction in Business Method Patents\n\nARMONK, NY \u2013 26 Sep 2006: Inspired by a two-month, online forum involving dozens of experts, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today formalized a new, groundbreaking corporate policy governing the creation and management of patents.\n\nThe worldwide policy, built on IBM\u2019s long-standing practices of high quality patents and transparency of ownership, is designed to foster integrity, a healthier environment for innovation, and mutual respect for intellectual property rights. IBM encouraged others in the patent community to adopt similar policies and practices, more stringent than currently required by law.\n\nThe tenets of the new policy, which applies everywhere IBM does business, are:\n\n\n\nPatent applicants are responsible for the quality and clarity of their patent applications.\n\n\n\nPatent applications should be available for public examination.\n\n\n\nPatent ownership should be transparent and easily discernable.\n\n\n\nPure business methods without technical merit should not be\n\npatentable.\n\nAdditional detail on the policy can be found below. IBM also announced several actions it will undertake immediately to implement and support this new policy:\n\n\n\nIBM\u2019s technical experts will spend thousands of hours annually\n\nreviewing published patent applications submitted to patent offices. For example, they will provide pertinent prior art to assist the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) in verifying the patentability of submissions more rapidly and accurately, as part of the USPTO Community Patent Review pilot. IBM urges other qualified experts to similarly provide their time and knowledge by participating in this program.\n\n\n\nIBM will make its patent applications open to community review.\n\n\n\nIBM will make available over 100 of its business-method patents \u2014 about 50 percent of IBM\u2019s total business method patents \u2014 to the public, where they can be used openly to stimulate innovation. IBM will focus future business method filings on those with substantial technical content, and as a result, expects to substantially reduce its filing of business method patents.\n\n\n\nIBM will promptly and publicly record, in its name, assignment of all patents and published patent applications it owns.\n\n\u201cThe centerpiece of this policy, and our actions to support it, is based on the principles that patent quality is a responsibility of the applicant,\u201d said Dr. John E. Kelly III, IBM senior vice president for Technology and Intellectual Property. \u201cThese principles are as relevant in emerging regions of the world as they are in more mature economies. IBM is holding itself to a higher standard than any law requires because it\u2019s urgent that patent quality is improved, to both stimulate innovation and provide greater clarity for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\u201d\n\nThe impetus to share this policy and to encourage an open discourse on best practices for patent holders was sparked by a two-month online forum facilitated by IBM (please see below for more detail). The forum brought together dozens of the world\u2019s most prominent intellectual property experts from the fields of government, academia and economics. IBM used wiki technology to enable the participants to debate and suggest solutions for pressing intellectual property issues.\n\n\u201cAs advances in information technology and basic science transform the nature of innovation and increase the relative value of intellectual property, it is crucial that we modernize the systems for creating and protecting those assets,\u201d said Ronald Mann, University of Texas School of Law, and one of the wiki participants. \u201cUntil that time, having the community work together to adhere to a set of principles that sets a higher standard for behavior is even more important.\u201d\n\nIBM believes that widespread adoption of a more formal code of conduct around patents could ease the burden on legal and government administrative systems. Those systems now deal with growing numbers of questionable patent applications and patent lawsuits.\n\nIBM Patent Policy\n\n\n\nPatent applicants are responsible for the quality and clarity of their patent applications. Patent applications must be written with clear specifications and claims, and include a thorough review of prior art. This includes performing patentability searches in advance of filing patent applications, and of course providing all of the pertinent prior art documents to the applicable patent offices.\n\n\n\nPatent applications should be available for public examination and comment. Patent applications are generally published automatically 18 months after filing, but where they are not, applicants should request 18-month publication. Applicants should also permit public comment on their published patent applications, so that the best prior art and other pertinent information can be made available to patent offices during the patent examination process.\n\n\n\nPatent ownership should be transparent and easily discernible. Patent owners should record their ownership in their own name and not in the name of a shell company, and patent applicants should state in their applications who owns those applications.\n\n\n\nPure business methods without technical merit should not be patentable. All inventions with technical merit should be patentable, provided they meet all of the requirements of patentability. Applicants should seek to publish, not patent, their pure business method innovations if they wish to prevent others from patenting similar business methods.\n\n\n\nIntellectual Property Marketplace Wiki\n\nCreating, capitalizing on, and protecting intellectual property have become vital business functions. Firms are increasingly striving to become globally integrated enterprises that collaborate with their extended value chains, and the resulting intellectual property plays a central role in the evolving future of this trend.\n\nThese issues were a consistent undercurrent throughout IBM\u2019s Global Innovation Outlook, a worldwide conversation with 248 thought leaders from nearly three dozen countries and regions, representing 178 organizations.\n\nIBM assembled a worldwide community of 50 experts in the fields of law, academia, economics, government, technology and others. These experts collaborated with IBMers to discuss the issues, determine the key characteristics of a properly functioning IP marketplace, and establish a blueprint for meaningful change.\n\nThroughout May and June 2006, the group collaborated in the online IP Marketplace wiki. Wikis are a new media Web 2.0 tool that enables documents to be collaboratively written and rewritten through a common Web site.\n\nThe wiki was divided into six sections, each of which also contained a corresponding discussion area. These discussion areas were designed to encourage a free and open exchange of ideas, and provoke new approaches and new thinking about the IP marketplace.\n\nThe participants debated some of the most significant challenges surrounding intellectual property \u2014 sometimes reaching consensus on the solution and sometimes agreeing to disagree.\n\nThe result of the project is a collaboratively written document that establishes the foundation for building a functioning marketplace for the creation, ownership, licensing and equitable exchange of intellectual property.

It\u2019s been an amazing run \u2013 but the new IBM is ready for new challenges.\n\nAs part of our relentless capacity for reinvention, we decided in 2020 that we would no longer pursue the goal of numeric patent leadership. As a result, 2022 is the first time since 1993 that IBM didn\u2019t claim the top spot on the list of companies with the most U.S. patents. Why, after three decades, such a shift?\n\nOne word: focus.\n\nIBM is a hybrid cloud and AI company today. While we will remain an intellectual property powerhouse with one of the strongest US patent portfolios, as part of our innovation strategy, focus means that we are taking a more selective approach to patenting. We have turned more of our talent and resources towards achieving high-quality, high-impact advancements in the specific areas of hybrid cloud, data and AI, automation, security, semiconductors, and quantum computing.\n\nPatents are only one measure of a company\u2019s true capacity for innovation. IBM will continue to patent new technology, but patents alone are a more incomplete barometer than ever before.\n\nOur long-standing commitment to research as part of our business model means we will continue to create the technologies that our clients and the world rely upon. When it comes to the most promising fields in tech \u2013 AI, cloud, security, semiconductors, and quantum computing \u2013 innovating requires deep focus and depth. These fields are so dynamic and complex, that we need more hands on deck for each breakthrough.\n\nMore and more, this requires balancing trade-secrets and patents alongside a style of R&D called \u201copen innovation\u201d, in which teams from various organizations and institutions collaborate with both internal and external players. They share knowledge openly around well-defined problems and communities.\n\nTake the example of one of the most fascinating and promising technologies, quantum computing. IBM\u2019s work in quantum computing has been intentionally based on a blend a proprietary and open innovation since day one. Our quantum hardware has always been developed internally, and protected by trade secrets and patents. But in 2016, we made the decision to put that hardware on the cloud. For the first time ever, quantum computing was no longer the domain of research scientists. Anyone with an internet connection could access the most sophisticated quantum technology in the world. We backed this up by open-sourcing our Qiskit software so developers worldwide could learn how to build quantum applications.\n\nThis has quite literally been game-changing. Today, more than 1.5 million people have downloaded the Qiskit software development kit, there are over 450,000 registered IBM Quantum users and researchers have used our technology to write more than 1,700 scientific publications. We\u2019ve worked with academic partners to put quantum computers in Germany and Japan, with more systems to come online in Canada, South Korea and at the Cleveland Clinic in the US. Meanwhile, our IBM Quantum Network stands at more than 200 members, with enterprises from Boeing to HSBC to Mitsubishi Chemical using quantum computers to pursue industry-changing research.\n\nWe see collaboration, not exclusivity, as the best way to advance the technology and build a quantum industry.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that intellectual property protection, as a concept, is going away. IBM, like most companies, is still going to protect its innovations using copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. You simply can\u2019t do innovation at scale without a thoughtful, proactive IP strategy to protect parts of what you have created. But a balanced innovation approach requires that technical teams devote as much energy to open innovation, community building, and delighting customers through great design and user experiences, as they do to protecting their innovations and inventions.\n\nToday, there\u2019s really no simple measure that can capture the nature of innovation. But our experience suggests a few goalposts that can help us do so in this new era.\n\nWe might posit, for instance, that innovation is a combination of talent, resources, and how the talent applies those resources. That might involve obtaining a patent, contributing to open source, or creating entirely new markets, like the work we are doing to build a quantum industry. And while you can\u2019t quantify it like a single patent number, or even R&D dollars, progress will become obvious as the life and business changing applications of these exciting new technologies continue to tick up."}, {"url": "https://insights.greyb.com/ibm-patents/", "page_content": "IBM has a total of 122110 patents globally, out of which 35080 have been granted.

In 1938, Tom Watson Sr. told his shareholders that in the twenty-four years since he had taken over the company, it had obtained 1301 patents\u2014a little over 50 patents a year. In comparison, over the last three years IBM has received, on average, 9,025 yearly patent grants. This is astronomical growth\u2014mostly achieved since 1993, and there is no taking away IBM\u2019s decades of patent leadership from those employees who responsibly moved their ideas from the conceptual arena into the realm of revenue-producing, patentable offerings.\n\nFor the last three decades, IBM has been industry-leading in this measurement.\n\nPeter E. Greulich produced chart with publicly available information and information from IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. IFI Claims Patent Services' information used with permission.\n\nBut through October of this year, IBM\u2019s patent production has fallen off a cliff. This is giving Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) an opening to become this year\u2019s pennant winner. If so, IBM will close out its third full decade of patent leadership with a whimper rather than a flourish.\n\nEither way, it will be a newsworthy event to evaluate in kicking off your 2023 investments!\n\nLet\u2019s look at the yearly patent details and then consider the investment options.\n\nA Possible Changing Of The Guard In Yearly Patent Leadership\n\nSamsung is on track. It is maintaining its consistent year-over-year performance. Through each of the Octobers of the last three years, Samsung has had patent grants of 5310, 5348, and 5372, respectively. Through October of this year, Samsung has 5,238 patent grants\u2014only down a recoverable 2%.\n\nThrough each of the Octobers of the last three years, IBM has had patent grants of 8,537, 8,003, 7,010, respectively\u2014falling 6% and then 18% over the two years. Through October of this year, IBM only has 3,626 patent grants\u2014a shortfall, now, of almost 60% over its 2019 October attainment.\n\nAs reflected in the following chart, Samsung has now registered a fourth-quarter first: As of the end of October, it pulled ahead of IBM in yearly patent grants: 5,238 to 3,626.\n\nPeter E. Greulich produced chart with information from IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. Used with permission.\n\nSamsung is positioned to capture the flag: The 2022 Patent Pennant!\n\nCan IBM recover?\n\nThe previous year, IBM received 1,671 patent grants in November and December\u2014its largest two-month closing number since 2015. If IBM turns in another similar, two-month run\u2014and Samsung stands still, the corporation may be able to pull off another win.\n\nIBM: Short-Term Or Long-Term Investment Decisions\n\nWhether IBM pulls out another victory or not, this will be a newsworthy event: IBM will either close out a full three decades\u2014exactly thirty years, of patent leadership with a flourish or a whimper. In either case, headlines are going to fly. Your level of interest and the timing of your next investment in either of the two companies will depend on if you are a short-term investor or long-term investor.\n\nIf you are a short-term investor who practices \u201cbuy on the rumor, sell on the news\u201d or its antithesis \u201csell on the rumor and buy on the news,\u201d this article is stating facts as of October 2022, not rumors\u2014but no one can see the future.\n\nSo, although this isn\u2019t a rumor, it will be a year-end, photo finish where the two top contestants are going full out for the finish line\u2014and the winner is up for grabs.\n\nMake your \"rumor-buy\" or your \"rumor-sell\" before the end of the year.\n\nI have never been a short-term investor though.\n\nTread carefully, eh?\n\nIf you are a long-term investor who is looking for indications that the IBM destroyer is continuing a turnaround, has started to turn\u2014for the better or worse, or is just taking on more water, you will have one more indication as to the state of the IBM warship in January 2023.\n\nFor me, whether IBM pulls this off or not, I see a three-year drop in patent production. As can be seen from 2007, this can be quickly fixed, but as a long-term-outlook type of guy, even if IBM doesn\u2019t fall from its yearly patent leadership position, I will just add another \u201cp\u201d to my long-term view of the corporation as stated in THINK Again! The Rometty Edition:\n\nIBM\u2019s corner office doesn\u2019t understand \u201cbusiness-first investing.\u201d For three-decades, its corner offices have invested in paper instead of investing to make its people more productive, its processes more effective, its products more valuable \u2026 and now, its patents of higher quality in ever-higher quantities.\n\nIn either case, January 2023 will be an investor newsworthy event. Remember that as either a short-term or long-term investor:\n\nForewarned is forearmed.\n\nThe latest 2022 yearly-patent grant numbers cited above are through the end of October 2022.

Streamlining Hybrid Cloud Deployments at the Edge\n\nIBM received more than 3,000 patents related to cloud and hybrid cloud technologies. One of the crucial decisions CIOs face today is determining which data will be processed on premises and which will be processed in the cloud. IBM inventors developed a technology to intelligently distribute the data processing components between the cloud, the edge and computing devices in-between. It offers the potential to greatly optimize the hybrid cloud for IoT workloads \u2013 such as GPS-generated driving instructions - that are sensitive to latency. Edge and hybrid cloud offerings are crucial parts of IBM's product roadmap. In 2020, they included the launch in May 2020 of the IBM Edge Application Manager, an autonomous management solution to enable AI, analytics and IoT enterprise workloads to be deployed and remotely managed, delivering real-time analysis and insight at scale. In addition, in November 2020 , IBM announced the IBM Cloud for Telecommunications to help companies unlock the power of edge and 5G in November 2020 . The holistic hybrid cloud offering leverages IBM's innovative encryption capabilities, designed to enable mission-critical workloads to be managed consistently from the network core to the edge, to position telecom providers to extract more value from their data while they drive innovation for their customers.\n\nof the IBM Edge Application Manager, an autonomous management solution to enable AI, analytics and IoT enterprise workloads to be deployed and remotely managed, delivering real-time analysis and insight at scale.

Laying the Foundation for Powerful Quantum Applications\n\nQuantum computing is a major focus for IBM and this is reflected in IBM's leadership in quantum computing patents obtained. One patent, for example, simplifies the mapping of quantum molecular simulation on a quantum computer. As a result, researchers will be able to explore simulating chemical reactions on quantum computers to understand how and when the discovery process around new materials and new pharmaceuticals will be revolutionized. IBM was also granted a patent that sets the foundation for investigating more accurate and efficient risk analysis calculations on a quantum computer. These ideas are already being extended by research done in collaboration with leading financial institutions.\n\nMaximizing Security for the World's Most Sensitive Data\n\nAs enterprises work to protect their data, particularly in highly-regulated industries, IBM inventors received more than 1,400 security-related patents. One of the patents is used for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), an IBM-pioneered method of performing computation on data that remains encrypted while being processed in order to maximize security for data in use. Previously, processing encrypted data required decryption before processing and re-encrypting the results, thus making data more vulnerable while unencrypted. IBM inventors patented a technique that allows encrypted data to be organized so that FHE vector comparison operations can be performed efficiently and maximizes the security of the data. IBM Security launched a service that allows companies to experiment with fully homomorphic encryption in December of 2020.\n\nPatents were awarded to more than 9,000 inventors located in 46 U.S. states and 54 countries. Since 1920, IBM has received more than 150,000 U.S. patents and played a crucial role in innovations ranging from magnetic storage to laser eye surgery. IBM's culture of scientific research is integral to the company's legacy of innovation that matters to our clients and to the world. To that end, in April 2020, IBM announced that it was a founding partner of the Open COVID Pledge, which grants free access to the patents and patent applications of its portfolio of more than 80,000 patents worldwide to those developing technologies to help diagnose, prevent, contain or treat coronaviruses.\n\nRead more about IBM's patent leadership here.\n\n*2020 patent data is sourced from IFI Claims Patent Service: http://www.ificlaims.com.\n\nHugh Collins\n\nIBM Research Communications\n\n[email protected]\n\nSOURCE IBM Research"}, {"url": "https://fortune.com/2023/01/06/ibm-patent-record-how-to-measure-innovation-open-source-quantum-computing-tech/", "page_content": "For 29 years straight, IBM has led the United States in minting patents, at its peak filing over 10,000 US patent applications in a single year for innovations ranging from the ATM to e-commerce, two-nanometer chips, and quantum computing.

When it comes to the most promising fields in tech\u2013A.I., cloud, security, semiconductors, and quantum computing\u2013innovating requires deep focus. These fields are so dynamic and complex, that we need more hands on deck for each breakthrough.\n\nIncreasingly, this requires balancing trade secrets and patents alongside a style of R&D called \u201copen innovation\u201d, in which teams from various organizations and institutions collaborate with both internal and external players. They share knowledge openly around well-defined problems and communities.\n\nTake the example of one of the most fascinating and promising technologies, quantum computing. IBM\u2019s work in quantum computing has been intentionally based on a blend of proprietary and open innovation since day one. Our quantum hardware has always been developed internally and protected by trade secrets and patents. But in 2016, we made the decision to give access to these pioneering quantum computers through the cloud. For the first time ever, quantum computing was no longer the domain of research scientists. Anyone with an internet connection could access the most sophisticated quantum technology in the world. We backed this up by open-sourcing our Qiskit software so developers worldwide could learn how to build quantum applications.\n\nThis has literally been game-changing. Today, more than 1.5 million people have downloaded the Qiskit software development kit, there are over 450,000 registered IBM Quantum users and researchers have used our technology to write more than 1,700 scientific publications. We\u2019ve worked with academic partners to put quantum computers in Germany and Japan, with more systems to come online in Canada, South Korea, and at the Cleveland Clinic in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, our IBM Quantum Network stands at more than 200 members, with enterprises from Boeing to HSBC to Mitsubishi Chemical using quantum computers to pursue industry-changing research.\n\nWe see collaboration, not exclusivity, as the best way to advance the technology and build a quantum industry.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that intellectual property protection, as a concept, is going away. IBM, like most companies, is still going to protect its innovations using copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents. You simply can\u2019t do innovation at scale without a thoughtful, proactive IP strategy to protect parts of what you have created. A balanced innovation approach requires that technical teams devote as much energy to open innovation, community building, and delighting customers through great design and user experiences, as they do to protecting their innovations and inventions.\n\nToday, there\u2019s really no simple measure that can capture the nature of innovation. However, our experience suggests a few goalposts that can help us do so in this new era.\n\nInnovation is a combination of talent, resources, and how the talent applies those resources. That might involve obtaining a patent, contributing to open source, or creating entirely new markets, like the work we are doing to build a quantum industry. And while you can\u2019t quantify it in terms of patent numbers or even R&D dollars, progress will become obvious as the life-changing applications of these exciting new technologies continue to tick up.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re betting that you should account for the real-world impact of a given technology\u2013not just how many patents were issued while building it.\n\nDar\u00edo Gil, Ph.D., is IBM\u2019s SVP and the director of IBM Research.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:"}], "IBM's trademark operations were worldwide.": [{"url": "https://www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade", "page_content": "Fair Use guidelines for use and reference of IBM trademarks\n\nIBM trademarks include the famous IBM eight-bar logo and other designs and logos owned and used by IBM, as well as IBM product and service names.

Its headquarters are in Armonk, New York.\n\nIt was incorporated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company in a consolidation of three smaller companies that made punch-card tabulators and other office products. The company assumed its present name in 1924 under the leadership of Thomas Watson, a man of considerable marketing skill who became general manager in 1914 and had gained complete control of the firm by 1924. Watson built the then-floundering company into the leading American manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems used by governments and private businesses. He also developed a highly disciplined and competitive sales force that adapted the company\u2019s custom-built tabulating systems to the needs of particular customers.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Technology Quiz\n\nIn 1933 IBM purchased Electromatic Typewriters, Inc., and thereby entered the field of electric typewriters, in which it eventually became an industry leader. During World War II, IBM helped construct several high-speed electromechanical calculators that were the precursors of electronic computers. But the firm refrained from producing these electronic data-processing systems until Watson\u2019s son, Thomas Watson, Jr., became president of the company in 1952 and sponsored an all-out push into that field. Having entered the computer field, IBM\u2019s size allowed it to invest heavily in development. This investment capability, added to its dominance in office-calculating machines, its marketing expertise, and its commitment to repair and service its own equipment, allowed IBM to quickly assume the predominant position in the American computer market. By the 1960s it was producing 70 percent of the world\u2019s computers and 80 percent of those used in the United States.\n\nIBM\u2019s specialty was mainframe computers\u2014i.e., expensive medium- to large-scale computers that could process numerical data at great speeds. The company did not enter the growing market for personal computers until 1981, when it introduced the IBM Personal Computer. This product achieved a major share of the market, but IBM was nevertheless unable to exercise its accustomed dominance as a maker of personal computers. New semiconductor-chip\u2013based technologies were making computers smaller and easier to manufacture, allowing smaller companies to enter the field and exploit new developments such as workstations, computer networks, and computer graphics. IBM\u2019s enormous size hindered it from responding rapidly to these accelerating rates of technological change, and by the 1990s the company had downsized considerably. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus Development Corporation, a major software manufacturer.\n\nIn 2002 IBM sold its magnetic hard drive business for $2.05 billion to the Japanese electronics firm of Hitachi, Ltd. Under the terms of the sale, IBM agreed to continue producing hard drives with Hitachi for three years in a joint venture known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. In 2005 Hitachi took full control of the joint venture and IBM stopped building a device that it had invented in 1956. In December 2005 IBM sold its personal computer division to the Lenovo Group, a major Chinese manufacturer. In addition to cash, securities, and debt restructuring, IBM acquired an 18.9 percent stake in Lenovo, which acquired the right to market its personal computers under the IBM label through 2010. With these divestitures, IBM shifted away from manufacturing so-called commodity products in order to concentrate on its computer services, software, supercomputer, and scientific research divisions.\n\nSince 2000, IBM has placed one of its supercomputers consistently at or near the top of the industry\u2019s list of most powerful machines as measured by standardized computation tests. In addition to producing supercomputers for governments and large corporations, IBM\u2019s supercomputer division, in cooperation with the Toshiba Corporation and the Sony Corporation of Japan, designed the Cell Broadband Engine. Developed over a four-year period beginning in 2001, this advanced computer chip has multiple applications, from supercomputers to Toshiba high-definition televisions to the Sony Playstation 3 electronic game system. IBM also designed the computer chips for the Microsoft Corporation Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Company Wii game systems. IBM became the first company to generate more than 3,000 patents in one year (2001) and, later, more than 4,000 patents in one year (2008). The company now holds more than 40,000 active patents, which generate considerable income from royalties."}, {"url": "https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdse/6.3.0?topic=SSVJJU_6.3.0/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc/install250.htm", "page_content": "IBM Tivoli Directory Server, Version 6.3\n\n\n\nTrademarks\n\nIBM\u00ae, the IBM logo, and ibm.com are trademarks or registered trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both.

He held an international \u201cbroadcast by telephone\u201d for them in October 1949 to announce the new World Trade Corporation. A performance by the Endicott IBM Glee Club opened the call.\n\nIt was an auspicious day in June of 1917, when stevedores in the port of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, unloaded Hollerith machines shipped there by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., later to be renamed IBM. These machines, destined to be used by Brazil\u2019s government to track economic statistics, were the first mechanical data processing machines in the country. The sale had been arranged by an enterprising Brazilian, Valentim Fernandes Bou\u00e7as, who had traveled to New York to convince Thomas J. Watson Sr. to begin selling equipment in Brazil\u2014with Bou\u00e7as as his representative. Bou\u00e7as later ran IBM\u2019s first branch office in Brazil and its Brazil subsidiary. Among his many achievements, in 1930, after a revolution overthrew the government, he convinced the new leaders to keep using IBM machines. His offer: IBM would provide the machines free of charge until they proved their value. The pitch worked. Later, Bou\u00e7as became an economic advisor to the new government.\n\nIBM\u2019s global ethos \u201cWorld Peace through World Trade\u201d Thomas Watson Sr.\u2019s hopeful slogan expressed his enormous faith in free trade. The slogan appeared on a building plaque, shown here, that greeted visitors to the IBM headquarters building at 590 Madison Avenue in New York, completed in 1938. A worldwide corporate culture Cultural aspects of IBM, such as the THINK motto and formal employee training, made their way around the world as the company expanded. Here, in France\u2014one of the first countries outside of the US where IBM established a presence\u2014salesmen attend a 1937 sales training session in a Parisian office bedecked with a picture of Watson Sr. and a sign that reads \u201cR\u00e9fl\u00e9chissez\u201d\u2014French for \u201cTHINK.\u201d Investing in emerging markets The progressive mindset that informed the creation of the IBM World Trade Corporation endures today in IBM\u2019s identity as a globally integrated enterprise which operates with broadly distributed decision-making,a highly skilled global workforce and is buoying standards of living in developing countries. In recent years, IBM has poured investments into offices, data centers, training centers and other facilities in emerging economies. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the company recently established or expanded branches in Ghana, Nigeria, Angola, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.\n\nIBM\u2019s early years in Brazil demonstrate its approach to doing business around the world: Be ambitious. Get there early. Employ local people as managers. Help countries build their economies. And don\u2019t give up when business conditions get rough. Those instincts guided Watson through IBM\u2019s international expansion over his decades as chairman\u2014and they were crystallized into organizational form in 1949, when he established the IBM World Trade \u00ae Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM with its headquarters near the United Nations in New York City. Watson figured that by giving the foreign operation a measure of independence, the organization would be focused and aggressive. Watson had believed in the global destiny of IBM\u2019s business from the start. When he arrived as general manager in 1914, he launched an aggressive international expansion beyond the company\u2019s existing operations in the US, Canada, Germany and Britain\u2014first to France and then to Brazil, South Africa, Japan and China. By the late 1940s, although IBM was selling machines in 78 countries, each country operation was separate. Watson thought that by setting up an organization to focus on international expansion, more would get done. \u201cThe United States has six percent of the world\u2019s population, and the rest of the world has ninety-four percent: someday the World Trade Company is going to be larger than the US company,\u201d he predicted. Watson\u2019s claim seemed rash at the time. Much of the world was still rebuilding in the aftermath of the war. But the event that he predicted came to pass in 1975 when revenues from foreign sales overtook those in the United States. Watson assigned his second son, Arthur K. Watson, who was just a few years out of college, to an executive position in IBM World Trade Corp. A short time later, he promoted him to run the organization. In spite of the young Watson\u2019s inexperience, he thrived in the position\u2014making investments in manufacturing and sales that paid off as Europe roared back to life economically in the 1950s and 1960s. Foreign sales were less than US$50 million a year in 1949. When Arthur Watson resigned in 1970 to become US Ambassador to France, foreign sales had grown to more than US$2.5 billion, and the company had operations in 108 countries.\n\n\u201cWe want to find the way to take national labels off of our business and off of ourselves. We want IBMers to be at home anywhere in the world.\u201d Arthur K. Watson IBM World Trade Corporation Chairman, 1963 - 1970 THINK magazine \u201cI do not believe we will be permanently welcome anywhere unless national employees of our companies\u2014be they British, Japanese, or American\u2014can look forward to careers that will take them anywhere and as far and fast as their talents permit. This kind of policy is simple justice\u2014and good sense. It is also the only way to develop a real world constituency for international cooperation.\u201d Arthur K. Watson IBM World Trade Corporation Chairman, 1963 - 1970 THINK magazine \u201cOur role in the free world depends on technological leadership. In the international markets, we are living on our wits and it is a competition that not only benefits us, it benefits the rest of the world as well. As my father used to put it, if two men have one dollar each, and they trade dollars, they both still end up with only a dollar. But if they have one idea each, and they exchange their ideas, they both end up with two ideas.\u201d Arthur K.

Industry experts warned that the Indian tech services companies\u2014the Bangalore Tigers\u2014would devour American competitors. IBM decided to engage in this competitive battle on two fronts. First, it would reduce the cost and improve the quality of its service delivery. Second, it would position itself in India, not as a low-cost provider, but instead as a company that could draw on its capacity to create breakthrough technology and deeper client solutions.

The company wanted to align itself with the host country\u2019s national economic vision for growth; to tailor products and services across all brands to the local market. When IBM Chairman and CEO Samuel Palmisano spoke to 10,000 employees in Bangalore, India (plus hundreds of thousands via global webcast) he made a financial commitment of US$6 billion to grow IBM\u2019s presence in that country which was already the largest country division outside of the US. IBM would establish a number of new research and service delivery centers based in Bangalore to serve clients around the globe. Palmisano\u2019s Bangalore announcement not only reflected IBM\u2019s recognition of the vast opportunities in India; the speech also marked IBM\u2019s boldest advancement toward becoming a globally integrated enterprise\u2014a vision he outlined in an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine that same month.\n\n2006: IBM opens first integrated delivery centre in South Africa Integrated delivery centres (IDCs) are a means of developing skills and jobs in areas that hold significant business potential for IBM. Within its first year, the South Africa IDC created 500 new jobs and continued to increase local employment, while providing services to more than 250 businesses in South Africa and elsewhere. As part of the effort, IBM also established a graduate program for financially challenged students, helping to foster their professional careers. Based on its success, the South Africa IDC became the model for the establishment of IDCs in Argentina, Brazil, China, Egypt, Vietnam and other countries worldwide.\n\n2006-2010: Remaking IBM into a globally integrated enterprise IBM was clear on its strategy; making it a reality took a lot of work. The transformation took place in phases that often overlapped. From 2006 to 2008, IBM expanded its presence in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and today nearly half of its employees are in emerging markets. The company set up a network of global delivery centers in India, China, Brazil and other countries. By standardizing processes and outputs across its large, diverse client base, IBM could deliver quality services to its IT and business process outsourcing clients consistently, with the right skills, in the right place\u2014wherever that would be. Projects could be staffed more quickly, delivering greater value to clients sooner.\n\nSharing resources The model of shared services caught on. Global procurement was centralized in China. Back-office finance operations moved to Brazil. IBM established Centers of Excellence\u2014for telecommunications, water management, rail innovation and more\u2014which served clients around the world. Today, IBM shares services among its legal, marketing communications, sales transactions, real estate and other functions. From 2005 through 2010, IBM has reduced total spending by US$4.8 billion through shared services.\n\nSimplifying processes In 2008, the transformation journey entered a new phase. \u201cOur mantra is radical simplification\u2014eliminating, standardizing and automating work that currently adds to our complexity and makes global integration difficult,\u201d said Linda Sanford, senior vice president, Enterprise Transformation. IBM began to review its horizontal processes end-to-end, looking for greater synergies, simplifying workflows, and moving services and resources into the right channels. For example, in the hardware product design and development process, the systems portfolio was reduced by 40 percent; features and products were slimmed down by 35 percent\u2014streamlining that is expected to yield US$250 million in savings through 2015. And in the sales process, by pooling tasks related to the pre-sales phase into a sales support hub, 10 to 20 percent of seller time was freed up to focus on the client.\n\nNew technologies ease integration, make transformation smarter Analytics, cloud computing and other capabilities have been critical to much of IBM\u2019s global integration. In manufacturing, deep analytics have enabled IBM to improve chip yields, detect problems and optimize performance across complex manufacturing processes\u2014resulting in US$32 million in cost savings and US$21 million in annual incremental revenue. Using analytics, IBM optimized 13,000 seller territories, which show an average of 10 percent sales performance improvement. Two other factors are facilitating global integration: flexible work arrangements and social media. About one-third of IBMers work from mobile locations, gaining flexibility in terms of location and hours\u2014they can work side by side with clients for periods of time as needed and change their daily schedule to accommodate different time zones. Secondly, social media offers compelling new ways to collaborate. As of December 2010, 500,000 employees had participated in four jams\u2014open brainstorming events on IBM\u2019s intranet\u2014around key topics. In addition, as of that date, some 300,000 employees were collaborating through the developerWorks site, and 196,000 IBMers were using LinkedIn."}, {"url": "https://www.statista.com/topics/1325/ibm/", "page_content": "IBM\u2019s business segments\n\nIBM\u2019s innovations\n\nIBM reorganized its business reporting segments for 2021.

The firm\u2019s third largest segment by revenue in 2021 was infrastructure, accounting for over 14 billion U.S. dollars. The segment includes hybrid cloud infrastructure, as well as infrastructure support services.IBM is responsible for some of the most groundbreaking inventions in the technology industry: the automated teller machine (ATM), the hard disk drive (HDD), the Universal Product Code (UPC), and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The company continues to innovate, ranking first among companies with the most U.S. patents granted and a leading owner of machine learning and AI patents . Alongside this, IBM has committed itself to environmental leadership, addressing climate change, energy efficiency, product design, and the use of materials. A key part of this involves IBM\u2019s energy conservation projects , which include virtualization and cooling efficiency projects in data center environments."}, {"url": "https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/makingibm/transform/", "page_content": "As IBM expanded to additional countries in the early part of the twentieth century, its culture\u2014including its iconic \u201cTHINK\u201d motto\u2014expanded with it, serving as a powerful corporate unifier. Here, at a 1938 meeting in Poland, the letters \u201cMY\u015aL\u201d are framed on the wall: the Polish translation for \u201cTHINK.\u201d\n\nThe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company was indeed a \u201clittle outfit\u201d relative to other American companies in 1924. Yet Thomas Watson Sr. had a grand\u2014and prescient\u2014vision for its expansion, one reflected in its worldly new name. From its earliest overseas offices established by Watson in Canada, Brazil, France and other countries around the world, International Business Machines would grow into its name\u2014and into today\u2019s US$100 billion globally integrated enterprise, with a presence in 176 countries.\n\nIBM\u2019s early reach around the world Below is a look at just a few of the dozens of countries where IBM began doing business very early on in its history. Using its reach \u201cdown under\u201d as an example, IBM established five Australian locations in one year, opening shop in Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane in 1914, the first year of Thomas Watson Sr.\u2019s tenure as president.\n\nIBM in Australia Manufacturing facility at Perth, 1928 The main IBM office in Sydney, 1932 Coffee grinders and meat and bread slicers join computing scales and time recorders on display in the Sydney office storefront. Persian carpets were a tradition in IBM corporate showrooms around the world. The main IBM office in Sydney, 1938 The metal THINK mobile that hangs from the ceiling in the back left area of the office shows just how far Watson Sr.\u2019s famed employee directive and company motto had traveled\u2014halfway around the world. Like the International Business Machines name, the THINK motto was universally accepted and ingrained as a critical aspect of the corporate culture. Australia\u2019s Hundred Percent Club qualifiers, 1937 Watson Sr.\u2019s Hundred Percent Club was the pinnacle of sales achievement at IBM. It honored salespeople who met 100 percent of their sales quota for the year. A company-wide institution, the Club drove a borderless sales culture at IBM.\n\nA leading role in Brazilian IT C-T-R opened its first office outside of the US in Brazil\u2014a \u201crepresentation office\u2019\u2019 for the company\u2014in 1917, beginning what would become a leading role in the development of information technology in Brazil. Watson Sr. added subsequent offices at a healthy clip over the following three decades. By 1948, IBM offices could be found in many of Brazil\u2019s largest cities, including S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Fortaleza and Belo Horizonte, among others.\n\nIBM Brazil Graduation, 1923 Brazilian C-T-R employees toast their completion of the company\u2019s customer service school.

As advances in communication technology and transportation during the 1930s facilitated international business, IBM US and IBM China enjoyed a closer connection: IBM vice president and general manager F.W. Nichol made the first-ever business call from the US to China when he called the Shanghai office from New York in May 1937.

IBM also alleges that LzLabs has made false and misleading claims about LzLabs' products.\n\nIBM is seeking relief that includes an injunction against LzLabs to prevent further unlawful use of IBM's intellectual property and trade secrets.\n\nLzLabs is owned and run by some of the same individuals who previously owned and ran Neon Enterprise Software, LLC of Austin, Texas. Neon previously attempted to free ride on IBM's mainframe business, and prior litigation between IBM and Neon ended with a U.S. District Court permanently barring Neon and certain of its key employees from, among other things, reverse engineering, reverse compiling and translating certain IBM software, and also from continuing to distribute certain Neon software products.\n\nIBM has made significant investment in research and development in this critical technology field and will aggressively defend its investments and resulting patents against those who violate them, as LzLabs has now repeatedly done.\n\nPatents infringed by LzLabs include:\n\nTwo that describe methods embodied in IBM mainframe instructions that LzLabs must emulate with or translate into Intel x86 instructions,\n\nTwo that describe methods of increasing emulation/translation efficiency that LzLabs must implement if it is to achieve optimized performance objectives; and\n\nOne that describes a method related to the translation of IBM mainframe applications wherein IBM programs called by those applications are identified and an x86 substituted for each.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

Its headquarters are in Armonk, New York.\n\nIt was incorporated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company in a consolidation of three smaller companies that made punch-card tabulators and other office products. The company assumed its present name in 1924 under the leadership of Thomas Watson, a man of considerable marketing skill who became general manager in 1914 and had gained complete control of the firm by 1924. Watson built the then-floundering company into the leading American manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems used by governments and private businesses. He also developed a highly disciplined and competitive sales force that adapted the company\u2019s custom-built tabulating systems to the needs of particular customers.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Technology Quiz\n\nIn 1933 IBM purchased Electromatic Typewriters, Inc., and thereby entered the field of electric typewriters, in which it eventually became an industry leader. During World War II, IBM helped construct several high-speed electromechanical calculators that were the precursors of electronic computers. But the firm refrained from producing these electronic data-processing systems until Watson\u2019s son, Thomas Watson, Jr., became president of the company in 1952 and sponsored an all-out push into that field. Having entered the computer field, IBM\u2019s size allowed it to invest heavily in development. This investment capability, added to its dominance in office-calculating machines, its marketing expertise, and its commitment to repair and service its own equipment, allowed IBM to quickly assume the predominant position in the American computer market. By the 1960s it was producing 70 percent of the world\u2019s computers and 80 percent of those used in the United States.\n\nIBM\u2019s specialty was mainframe computers\u2014i.e., expensive medium- to large-scale computers that could process numerical data at great speeds. The company did not enter the growing market for personal computers until 1981, when it introduced the IBM Personal Computer. This product achieved a major share of the market, but IBM was nevertheless unable to exercise its accustomed dominance as a maker of personal computers. New semiconductor-chip\u2013based technologies were making computers smaller and easier to manufacture, allowing smaller companies to enter the field and exploit new developments such as workstations, computer networks, and computer graphics. IBM\u2019s enormous size hindered it from responding rapidly to these accelerating rates of technological change, and by the 1990s the company had downsized considerably. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus Development Corporation, a major software manufacturer.\n\nIn 2002 IBM sold its magnetic hard drive business for $2.05 billion to the Japanese electronics firm of Hitachi, Ltd. Under the terms of the sale, IBM agreed to continue producing hard drives with Hitachi for three years in a joint venture known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. In 2005 Hitachi took full control of the joint venture and IBM stopped building a device that it had invented in 1956. In December 2005 IBM sold its personal computer division to the Lenovo Group, a major Chinese manufacturer. In addition to cash, securities, and debt restructuring, IBM acquired an 18.9 percent stake in Lenovo, which acquired the right to market its personal computers under the IBM label through 2010. With these divestitures, IBM shifted away from manufacturing so-called commodity products in order to concentrate on its computer services, software, supercomputer, and scientific research divisions.\n\nSince 2000, IBM has placed one of its supercomputers consistently at or near the top of the industry\u2019s list of most powerful machines as measured by standardized computation tests. In addition to producing supercomputers for governments and large corporations, IBM\u2019s supercomputer division, in cooperation with the Toshiba Corporation and the Sony Corporation of Japan, designed the Cell Broadband Engine. Developed over a four-year period beginning in 2001, this advanced computer chip has multiple applications, from supercomputers to Toshiba high-definition televisions to the Sony Playstation 3 electronic game system. IBM also designed the computer chips for the Microsoft Corporation Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Company Wii game systems. IBM became the first company to generate more than 3,000 patents in one year (2001) and, later, more than 4,000 patents in one year (2008). The company now holds more than 40,000 active patents, which generate considerable income from royalties."}, {"url": "https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/kaaas/notices.html", "page_content": "Knowledge Accelerators\n\nLicensed Materials - Property of IBM\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBM Corporation 2021 .\n\nIBM Corporation\n\nNew Orchard Road, Armonk, NY 10504\n\nProduced in the United States of America\n\nUS Government Users Restricted Rights - Use, duplication or disclosure restricted by GSA ADP Schedule Contract with IBM Corp.\n\nIBM, the IBM logo, ibm.com, IBM Watson, IBM Cloud Pak, and IBM Cloud are trademarks of International Business Machines Corp., registered in many jurisdictions worldwide.

A key factor was the emergence of the Internet [Read more about this Icon of Progress] and the laying of a global network of communications cable. Together, they made it possible for knowledge work to be performed anywhere in the world where skilled people could be found to do it.\n\nWorkers in populous countries, such as India, were acquiring highly valued technical skills. New competitors appeared\u2014Indian tech companies that could provide some services at a fraction of the cost of IBM. Industry experts warned that the Indian tech services companies\u2014the Bangalore Tigers\u2014would devour American competitors. IBM decided to engage in this competitive battle on two fronts. First, it would reduce the cost and improve the quality of its service delivery. Second, it would position itself in India, not as a low-cost provider, but instead as a company that could draw on its capacity to create breakthrough technology and deeper client solutions. IBM rapidly expanded its presence in India and other emerging markets, attracting talent and building up its local presence through the promise of long-term, transformational work.\n\nBeijing, China\u2014November 14, 2006: IBM Chairman, President and CEO Samuel J. Palmisano (left) and Dr. Zhou Ji (right), Minister of the Ministry of Education, People\u2019s Republic of China, at the launch of a major initiative to bring IBM\u2019s global information technology services expertise and capabilities to China in support of the country\u2019s increased focus on developing its services industry. Beijing, China\u2014November 14, 2006: Speaking at an IBM employee meeting at the Beijing Exhibition Center Theater in Beijing, China, IBM Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Samuel J. Palmisano announced ten new initiatives that the company will pursue over the next two years. Sunil Mittal, Chairman, Bharti Enterprises, being recognized by Samuel J. Palmisano and President APJ Abdul Kalam for his contribution to \"Innovation in Enterprise\" in India. Samuel J. Palmisano and India President APJ Abdul Kalam kicking off the proceedings with a ceremonial Indian lamp lighting ceremony. Samuel J. Palmisano greeting IBMers before the IBM India Townhall.\n\n2006: Announcement in Bangalore, India In India\u2014and elsewhere\u2014IBM didn\u2019t want to just hire local talent. The company wanted to align itself with the host country\u2019s national economic vision for growth; to tailor products and services across all brands to the local market. When IBM Chairman and CEO Samuel Palmisano spoke to 10,000 employees in Bangalore, India (plus hundreds of thousands via global webcast) he made a financial commitment of US$6 billion to grow IBM\u2019s presence in that country which was already the largest country division outside of the US. IBM would establish a number of new research and service delivery centers based in Bangalore to serve clients around the globe. Palmisano\u2019s Bangalore announcement not only reflected IBM\u2019s recognition of the vast opportunities in India; the speech also marked IBM\u2019s boldest advancement toward becoming a globally integrated enterprise\u2014a vision he outlined in an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine that same month.\n\n2006: IBM opens first integrated delivery centre in South Africa Integrated delivery centres (IDCs) are a means of developing skills and jobs in areas that hold significant business potential for IBM. Within its first year, the South Africa IDC created 500 new jobs and continued to increase local employment, while providing services to more than 250 businesses in South Africa and elsewhere. As part of the effort, IBM also established a graduate program for financially challenged students, helping to foster their professional careers. Based on its success, the South Africa IDC became the model for the establishment of IDCs in Argentina, Brazil, China, Egypt, Vietnam and other countries worldwide.\n\n2006-2010: Remaking IBM into a globally integrated enterprise IBM was clear on its strategy; making it a reality took a lot of work. The transformation took place in phases that often overlapped. From 2006 to 2008, IBM expanded its presence in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and today nearly half of its employees are in emerging markets. The company set up a network of global delivery centers in India, China, Brazil and other countries. By standardizing processes and outputs across its large, diverse client base, IBM could deliver quality services to its IT and business process outsourcing clients consistently, with the right skills, in the right place\u2014wherever that would be. Projects could be staffed more quickly, delivering greater value to clients sooner.\n\nSharing resources The model of shared services caught on. Global procurement was centralized in China. Back-office finance operations moved to Brazil. IBM established Centers of Excellence\u2014for telecommunications, water management, rail innovation and more\u2014which served clients around the world. Today, IBM shares services among its legal, marketing communications, sales transactions, real estate and other functions. From 2005 through 2010, IBM has reduced total spending by US$4.8 billion through shared services.\n\nSimplifying processes In 2008, the transformation journey entered a new phase. \u201cOur mantra is radical simplification\u2014eliminating, standardizing and automating work that currently adds to our complexity and makes global integration difficult,\u201d said Linda Sanford, senior vice president, Enterprise Transformation. IBM began to review its horizontal processes end-to-end, looking for greater synergies, simplifying workflows, and moving services and resources into the right channels. For example, in the hardware product design and development process, the systems portfolio was reduced by 40 percent; features and products were slimmed down by 35 percent\u2014streamlining that is expected to yield US$250 million in savings through 2015. And in the sales process, by pooling tasks related to the pre-sales phase into a sales support hub, 10 to 20 percent of seller time was freed up to focus on the client.\n\nNew technologies ease integration, make transformation smarter Analytics, cloud computing and other capabilities have been critical to much of IBM\u2019s global integration. In manufacturing, deep analytics have enabled IBM to improve chip yields, detect problems and optimize performance across complex manufacturing processes\u2014resulting in US$32 million in cost savings and US$21 million in annual incremental revenue. Using analytics, IBM optimized 13,000 seller territories, which show an average of 10 percent sales performance improvement. Two other factors are facilitating global integration: flexible work arrangements and social media. About one-third of IBMers work from mobile locations, gaining flexibility in terms of location and hours\u2014they can work side by side with clients for periods of time as needed and change their daily schedule to accommodate different time zones. Secondly, social media offers compelling new ways to collaborate. As of December 2010, 500,000 employees had participated in four jams\u2014open brainstorming events on IBM\u2019s intranet\u2014around key topics. In addition, as of that date, some 300,000 employees were collaborating through the developerWorks site, and 196,000 IBMers were using LinkedIn."}, {"url": "https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/copyright-notice-and-trademarks", "page_content": "IBM WebSphere?

They not only terminated a dispute over IBM allegations that Fujitsu illegally copied its software, but established a detailed mechanism to prevent future conflicts for a period of five to 10 years.\n\nThe decisive action announced Tuesday contrasted conspicuously with the legal morass that has enveloped the field of computer software copyrights.\n\nCopyrights are supposed to protect and encourage innovation, but some computer innovators say uncertainty over what can be copyrighted and the threat of endless litigation are actually doing the opposite.\n\nOften, software disputes pit companies that have well-established products against companies that are trying to seize a piece of the business by making products that are similar but cheaper or with extra features.\n\nEach party typically claims that it alone is on the side of progress and innovation.\n\nThe danger of prolonged confusion over copyrights is that cautious computer companies might choose the safe course and stand pat, a course that would ultimately ruin one of the few industries in which the United States remains clearly No. 1 in the world.\n\nCopyright cases dragging through the courts include a landmark computer chip dispute between Intel Corp. and Japan\u2019s NEC Corp. and three cases over the \u2033look and feel\u2033 of Lotus Development Corp.\u2019s best-selling 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.\n\nAlthough the arbitration order contains some bad news for both IBM and Fujitsu, it has the merit of letting the companies know exactly where they stand with each other.\n\nFujitsu will pay IBM a lump sum for a paid-up license to use the operating systems that control IBM\u2019s mainframe computers and will be given access for a fee to the programming information that will allow it to make functional equivalents of future IBM operating systems.\n\nThe order guarantees that Fujitsu will be able to continue as a competitor to IBM, the dominant force in the $20 billion-a-year worldwide business of mainframe computers.\n\nSome lawyers think the IBM-Fujitsu order will encourage other companies to set up arrangements to avoid copyright entanglements.\n\nIn fact, that has already begun to happen. Many companies that are working on products designed to be compatible with those of an industry leader - such as clones of the IBM personal computer - have the work done in a \u2033clean room.\u2033\n\nThe clean room is a work area staffed only by people who are supposed to have no familiarity with the inner workings of the product they are mimicking and thus cannot be accused of illegal copying.\n\nThe IBM-Fujitsu case is a twist because it creates what is, in effect, a \u2033dirty room.\u2033 Fujitsu engineers will be allowed to look at all of IBM\u2019s programming code for its operating systems, but the arbitrators will control how much of it they can carry out the door.\n\nCopyright lawyers tend to say the system is working as is.\n\nCourts are gradually managing to clarify the areas of software copyrights that were left vague by the 1976 copyright law, argues Robert Morgan of Fish & Neave, a New York law firm specializing in intellectual property.\n\nOthers are not so sure.\n\n\u2033I have some questions about whether the courts will ever be conversant enough with the technology to make me comfortable with the judge or the juries making the decision,\u2033 said Michael Scott, director of the non-profit Center for Computer Law in Los Angeles.\n\nIn many cases, companies that are accused of copying use the argument that the product they mimic is so established that it has become a standard that in effect belongs to everybody.\n\n\u2033Users of computer products are no different than users of every other product. We all know where the clutch is on a car. We love the fact that we\u2019re standardized on 33 rpm records and standard film cartridges,\u2033 said Kenneth Wasch, executive director of the Washington-based Software Publishers Association.\n\nBut Thomas Lemberg, general counsel of Lotus, takes the other side in arguing that other companies should not be allowed to use the same screen display and commands as Lotus 1-2-3.\n\n\u2033What\u2019s so innovative about copying 1-2-3? The innovation comes in creating a better mousetrap, not in copying my mousetrap,\u2033 he said.\n\nIn economic news this past week, the government said:\n\n-The nation\u2019s gross national product grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate during the April-June quarter, faster than a previous estimate.\n\n-After-tax corporate profits climbed 4.3 percent in the April-June quarter, the best showing since last fall.\n\n-The deficit in the U.S. current account, the broadest measure of international transactions, widened to a record $41.1 billion in the April- June quarter.\n\n-Business inventories rose 0.2 percent in July as total business sales remained essentially unchanged.\n\n-Housing construction edged down 1.5 percent in August as rising mortgage rates continued to dampen demand for new homes.\n\n-Retail sales climbed 1.3 percent in August, the biggest increase in six months.\n\n-The nation\u2019s factories, mines and utilities operated at 81 percent of capacity in August, and output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent during the month.\n\n-The nation\u2019s commercial banks suffered their worst quarter in more than 50 years in the second quarter, adding $21.2 billion to reserves for bad loans, which caused a $10.6 billion loss.\n\nIn other business and economic developments:\n\n-The House approved a bill putting tighter limits on imports of textiles, apparel and shoes, but the measure fell short of the two-thirds majority required to override an expected presidential veto.\n\n-The American Petroleum Institute said domestic crude oil production continued its downward spiral in August, while the nation\u2019s dependence on imported oil increased.\n\n-Sales of U.S.-made cars were down 48.2 percent to 266,192 vehicles during the Sept. 1-10 period, automakers said.\n\n-Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers agreed on a precedent-setting contract guaranteeing the jobs of most of Ford\u2019s 104,000 UAW workers in return for the support of union leaders for more flexible work rules. The agreement still must be approved by the rank and file.\n\n-Thousands of Chrysler Corp. workers in the United States were forced to stay home after about 10,000 Canadian counterparts went on strike, but the Canadian union reached a tentative accord.\n\n-Honda Motor Co. said it will spend $561 million to expand its U.S. operations and also plans to increase the U.S.-built content of its cars.\n\n-Dart Group Corp. proposed to buy Dayton Hudson Corp., one of the country\u2019s largest retailers, in a deal that could be worth $6.3 billion in cash and stock.\n\n-G.

IBM led the industry in the number of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, quantum computing and security-related patents granted.\n\n\"The world needs scientific thinking and action more than ever,\" Dar\u00edo Gil, SVP and Director of IBM Research\n\n\"The world needs scientific thinking and action more than ever. IBM's sustained commitment to investing in research and development, both in good and in challenging times, has paved the way for new products and new frontiers of information technology that have greatly benefited our clients and society,\" said Dar\u00edo Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research. \"The culture of innovation at IBM is stronger than ever, thanks to our inventors worldwide who devote themselves to advancing the boundaries of knowledge in their respective fields every single day.\"\n\nIBM led the industry in the number of U.S. patents across key technology fields:\n\nMaking AI More Intuitive IBM received more than 2,300 AI patents as inventors developed new AI technologies to help businesses scale their use of AI. Patents in this area ranged from technology to make virtual agents more responsive to emotions when speaking to customers, to AI that can help people make difficult decisions -- summarizing key decision points from a variety of information sources, both written and verbal, and presenting them in easy-to-understand visualizations. IBM is focused on delivering innovations in natural language processing, automation and building trust in AI, and continually infusing new capabilities from IBM Research into our IBM Watson products. In 2020, this included the IBM Watson team announcing the first commercialization of capabilities from Project Debater \u2013 a technology that digests massive amounts of text and constructs a well-structured speech on a given topic and delivers it with clarity and purpose.\n\nStreamlining Hybrid Cloud Deployments at the Edge IBM received more than 3,000 patents related to cloud and hybrid cloud technologies. One of the crucial decisions CIOs face today is determining which data will be processed on premises and which will be processed in the cloud. IBM inventors developed a technology to intelligently distribute the data processing components between the cloud, the edge and computing devices in-between. It offers the potential to greatly optimize the hybrid cloud for IoT workloads \u2013 such as GPS-generated driving instructions - that are sensitive to latency. Edge and hybrid cloud offerings are crucial parts of IBM's product roadmap. In 2020, they included the launch in May 2020 of the IBM Edge Application Manager, an autonomous management solution to enable AI, analytics and IoT enterprise workloads to be deployed and remotely managed, delivering real-time analysis and insight at scale. In addition, in November 2020 , IBM announced the IBM Cloud for Telecommunications to help companies unlock the power of edge and 5G in November 2020 . The holistic hybrid cloud offering leverages IBM's innovative encryption capabilities, designed to enable mission-critical workloads to be managed consistently from the network core to the edge, to position telecom providers to extract more value from their data while they drive innovation for their customers.\n\nLaying the Foundation for Powerful Quantum Applications Quantum computing is a major focus for IBM and this is reflected in IBM's leadership in quantum computing patents obtained. One patent, for example, simplifies the mapping of quantum molecular simulation on a quantum computer. As a result, researchers will be able to explore simulating chemical reactions on quantum computers to understand how and when the discovery process around new materials and new pharmaceuticals will be revolutionized. IBM was also granted a patent that sets the foundation for investigating more accurate and efficient risk analysis calculations on a quantum computer. These ideas are already being extended by research done in collaboration with leading financial institutions.\n\nMaximizing Security for the World's Most Sensitive Data As enterprises work to protect their data, particularly in highly-regulated industries, IBM inventors received more than 1,400 security-related patents. One of the patents is used for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), an IBM-pioneered method of performing computation on data that remains encrypted while being processed in order to maximize security for data in use. Previously, processing encrypted data required decryption before processing and re-encrypting the results, thus making data more vulnerable while unencrypted. IBM inventors patented a technique that allows encrypted data to be organized so that FHE vector comparison operations can be performed efficiently and maximizes the security of the data. IBM Security launched a service that allows companies to experiment with fully homomorphic encryption in December of 2020.\n\n\n\nPatents were awarded to more than 9,000 inventors located in 46 U.S. states and 54 countries. Since 1920, IBM has received more than 150,000 U.S. patents and played a crucial role in innovations ranging from magnetic storage to laser eye surgery. IBM's culture of scientific research is integral to the company's legacy of innovation that matters to our clients and to the world. To that end, in April 2020, IBM announced that it was a founding partner of the Open COVID Pledge, which grants free access to the patents and patent applications of its portfolio of more than 80,000 patents worldwide to those developing technologies to help diagnose, prevent, contain or treat coronaviruses.\n\nRead more about IBM's patent leadership here.\n\n*2020 patent data is sourced from IFI Claims Patent Service: http://www.ificlaims.com.\n\nHugh Collins\n\nIBM Research Communications\n\nhughdcollins@ibm.com\n\nSOURCE IBM Research"}, {"url": "https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibmworldtrade/", "page_content": "Thomas Watson Sr. went to great lengths to instill cohesiveness among IBM\u2019s foreign subsidiaries. He held an international \u201cbroadcast by telephone\u201d for them in October 1949 to announce the new World Trade Corporation. A performance by the Endicott IBM Glee Club opened the call.\n\nIt was an auspicious day in June of 1917, when stevedores in the port of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, unloaded Hollerith machines shipped there by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., later to be renamed IBM. These machines, destined to be used by Brazil\u2019s government to track economic statistics, were the first mechanical data processing machines in the country. The sale had been arranged by an enterprising Brazilian, Valentim Fernandes Bou\u00e7as, who had traveled to New York to convince Thomas J. Watson Sr. to begin selling equipment in Brazil\u2014with Bou\u00e7as as his representative. Bou\u00e7as later ran IBM\u2019s first branch office in Brazil and its Brazil subsidiary. Among his many achievements, in 1930, after a revolution overthrew the government, he convinced the new leaders to keep using IBM machines. His offer: IBM would provide the machines free of charge until they proved their value. The pitch worked. Later, Bou\u00e7as became an economic advisor to the new government.\n\nIBM\u2019s global ethos \u201cWorld Peace through World Trade\u201d Thomas Watson Sr.\u2019s hopeful slogan expressed his enormous faith in free trade. The slogan appeared on a building plaque, shown here, that greeted visitors to the IBM headquarters building at 590 Madison Avenue in New York, completed in 1938. A worldwide corporate culture Cultural aspects of IBM, such as the THINK motto and formal employee training, made their way around the world as the company expanded. Here, in France\u2014one of the first countries outside of the US where IBM established a presence\u2014salesmen attend a 1937 sales training session in a Parisian office bedecked with a picture of Watson Sr. and a sign that reads \u201cR\u00e9fl\u00e9chissez\u201d\u2014French for \u201cTHINK.\u201d Investing in emerging markets The progressive mindset that informed the creation of the IBM World Trade Corporation endures today in IBM\u2019s identity as a globally integrated enterprise which operates with broadly distributed decision-making,a highly skilled global workforce and is buoying standards of living in developing countries. In recent years, IBM has poured investments into offices, data centers, training centers and other facilities in emerging economies. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the company recently established or expanded branches in Ghana, Nigeria, Angola, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.\n\nIBM\u2019s early years in Brazil demonstrate its approach to doing business around the world: Be ambitious. Get there early. Employ local people as managers. Help countries build their economies. And don\u2019t give up when business conditions get rough. Those instincts guided Watson through IBM\u2019s international expansion over his decades as chairman\u2014and they were crystallized into organizational form in 1949, when he established the IBM World Trade \u00ae Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM with its headquarters near the United Nations in New York City. Watson figured that by giving the foreign operation a measure of independence, the organization would be focused and aggressive. Watson had believed in the global destiny of IBM\u2019s business from the start. When he arrived as general manager in 1914, he launched an aggressive international expansion beyond the company\u2019s existing operations in the US, Canada, Germany and Britain\u2014first to France and then to Brazil, South Africa, Japan and China. By the late 1940s, although IBM was selling machines in 78 countries, each country operation was separate. Watson thought that by setting up an organization to focus on international expansion, more would get done. \u201cThe United States has six percent of the world\u2019s population, and the rest of the world has ninety-four percent: someday the World Trade Company is going to be larger than the US company,\u201d he predicted. Watson\u2019s claim seemed rash at the time. Much of the world was still rebuilding in the aftermath of the war. But the event that he predicted came to pass in 1975 when revenues from foreign sales overtook those in the United States. Watson assigned his second son, Arthur K. Watson, who was just a few years out of college, to an executive position in IBM World Trade Corp. A short time later, he promoted him to run the organization. In spite of the young Watson\u2019s inexperience, he thrived in the position\u2014making investments in manufacturing and sales that paid off as Europe roared back to life economically in the 1950s and 1960s. Foreign sales were less than US$50 million a year in 1949. When Arthur Watson resigned in 1970 to become US Ambassador to France, foreign sales had grown to more than US$2.5 billion, and the company had operations in 108 countries.\n\n\u201cWe want to find the way to take national labels off of our business and off of ourselves. We want IBMers to be at home anywhere in the world.\u201d Arthur K. Watson IBM World Trade Corporation Chairman, 1963 - 1970 THINK magazine \u201cI do not believe we will be permanently welcome anywhere unless national employees of our companies\u2014be they British, Japanese, or American\u2014can look forward to careers that will take them anywhere and as far and fast as their talents permit. This kind of policy is simple justice\u2014and good sense. It is also the only way to develop a real world constituency for international cooperation.\u201d Arthur K. Watson IBM World Trade Corporation Chairman, 1963 - 1970 THINK magazine \u201cOur role in the free world depends on technological leadership. In the international markets, we are living on our wits and it is a competition that not only benefits us, it benefits the rest of the world as well. As my father used to put it, if two men have one dollar each, and they trade dollars, they both still end up with only a dollar. But if they have one idea each, and they exchange their ideas, they both end up with two ideas.\u201d Arthur K. Watson IBM World Trade Corporation Chairman, 1963 - 1970 THINK magazine \u201cThe globally integrated enterprise can deliver enormous economic bene\ufb01ts to both developed and developing nations. The integration of the work force in developing countries into global systems of production is already raising living standards, improving working conditions, and creating more jobs in those countries. Small and medium-sized businesses everywhere, particularly, are bene\ufb01tting: as new services\u2014from back-office administration to sales support\u2014create infrastructures once only affordable to large organizations, these businesses can now participate in the global economy.\u201d Sam Palmisano IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \u201cThe Globally Integrated Enterprise,\u201d Foreign Affairs"}], "David Kappos was responsible for IBM's licensing.": [{"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J.

He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

Based in Armonk, New York, Mr. Kappos directs IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Law function, providing legal counsel over all facets of protecting and licensing IBM\u2019s intellectual property assets and leading IBM\u2019s engagement of intellectual property law policy issues. In particular, Mr. Kappos is responsible for the management of IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios; protecting and licensing intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how and technology) worldwide; directing intellectual property law operations relating to the research, services, consulting, computer systems, storage products, semiconductor and technology development, software, marketing and other groups, divisions, and entities within IBM. In addition, Mr. Kappos has responsibility for IP policy and coordination with IBM\u2019s litigation and corporate development groups in matters relating to intellectual property. Mr. Kappos serves on the Board of Directors of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, and the International Intellectual Property Society. He is also the Vice President of the Intellectual Property Owners Association. He has held various previous leadership positions in intellectual property law associations in Asia and the U.S. He has spoken widely in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. on intellectual property topics.

Neuman for PTO Director. Gene\u2019s rationale:\n\nA character like Al Neuman would be perfect because he wouldn\u2019t (and couldn\u2019t) get in the way of the progress being made by the quite able members of the PTO senior management team who are doing what is necessary to move the PTO forward. Amazing what can be accomplished without having the watchful eye (and meddling) of a political appointment.\n\nThe Coalition for Patent Fairness (CPF) has already issued the its statement regarding the nomination of Kappos as Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office:\n\nThe PTO has an important role to play in fostering an economic environment that promotes American innovation and global competitiveness, spurs new product development and creates jobs here in the United States. As leading U.S. patent holders, we look forward to the opportunity to work with Mr. Kappos in helping the PTO fulfill that important responsibility. We support President Obama\u2019s call for reforms to the US patent system that will spur innovation and job creation.\n\nThe IAM Blog thinks Kappos is good news for the USPTO and the wider IP community:\n\nFor my part, I think he will do an excellent job. He knows the issues; he has a strong IP background; he comes from an industry in which IP is hugely important; he knows all the major players; he has long management experience; and he thinks deeply about IP and its role in society. Frankly, I cannot think of anyone better to do the job. He is not perfect, but who is? President Obama has made a good choice.\n\nDennis Crouch at Patently-O is excited:\n\nAs someone who writes daily about US Patent Law, I am excited about the Kappos nomination because he is likely to open access to previously hidden data and information. He will also work to create systems that work and measures that are meaningful. I suspect that the biggest challenge for Mr. Kappos will be moving beyond the unique IBM perspective. Big Blue is an atypical patent owner in its internal systems, patenting volume, and licensing power. As I discussed earlier, it will be important for him to spend time understanding how the rest of the patent community operates.\n\nBiotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) President and CEO Jim Greenwood gave Kappos a thumbs up:\n\nWe believe Mr. Kappos will bring a thoughtful perspective to the Department of Commerce and the USPTO. He has a long history of industry experience, providing a point of view and insights we have always thought to be highly valuable in this position. He also has a demonstrated track record of managing a large organization, and a true appreciation for industrial innovation. As a prominent and respected member of the patent community, Mr. Kappos brings much goodwill to this position. We look forward to working with him and his leadership team over the coming years.\n\nThe Patent Prospector questions the nomination given that IBM has submitted some questionable patent applications (citing its 2009/0119,148 application for \u201cenhancing productivity,\u201d which appears to claims claims using shorter hours to facilitate shorter meetings):\n\nPresident Obama announced today nominees for two related governmental posts: Director, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of Energy; and Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Warren F. \u201cPete\u201d Miller, Jr., a part-time Professor at Texas A&M University, got the easier job. Managing the real radioactive waste went to David J. Kappos, who, as long-time corporate mook, has shaped IBM patent policy, publicly spouting horse hockey in the process. People have been known to rise to a position, garnering dignity.

At IBM, he oversees management of IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios, and is responsible for protecting, licensing and directing law operations around its intellectual property worldwide.\n\nKappos joined IBM in 1983 as a development engineer.
