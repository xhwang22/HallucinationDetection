It started at No. 1 when the Orlando Magic tabbed Paolo Banchero with the top pick. Jabari Smith of Auburn, who was widely expected to go first, fell to the No. 3 spot and the Houston Rockets.\n\nDraft night also is always a time for trades, and this year is no different. The Oklahoma City Thunder made a trade with the New York Knicks for the No. 11 pick and Ousmane Dieng of New Zealand Breakers for three future conditional first-round picks.\n\nIn another draft-day trade, the Detroit Pistons acquired No. 13 pick Jalen Duren and Knicks guard Kemba Walker in a three-team deal.\n\nAnd the Philadelphia 76ers reportedly moved Danny Green and the No. 23 pick to Memphis as part of trade to acquire De\u2019Anthony Melton.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nUSA TODAY Sports recapped the entire 2022 NBA draft with all 58 picks (two second-round picks were forfeited), plus pick-by-pick analysis from Jeff Zillgitt, Cydney Henderson, Matt Eppers and Larry Starks on each of the first-round selections.\n\nFIRST ROUND\n\n1. Orlando Magic: Paolo Banchero, Duke\n\nThe Magic need help on the offensive end. The team finished last season 28th in effective field goal percentage, 28th in free throw rate, 27th in offensive rebounding percentage and 23rd in turnover rate. Look no further than Paolo Banchero, who can add versality to the Magic\u2019s offense with his physical tools (size, strength, speed) and on-court skills. He can pass, handle the ball, drive to the basket and finish near the rim and possesses solid footwork. He\u2019s easily the most NBA-ready player among the top projected top five. The 6-10 Banchero averaged 17.2 points on 47.8% shooting from the field, in addition to 7.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.1 steals in his only season at Duke, which marked Mike Krzyzewski\u2019 final season.\n\n2. Oklahoma City Thunder: Chet Holmgren, Gonzaga\n\nHolmgren has immense potential, with an impressive all-around skillset for a modern NBA big man. With his elite rim protection and shot-blocking, he fills an immediate need for the Thunder as an interior defender. He has a versatile offensive game and has shown the ability to handle the ball, shoot from the outside and finish at the rim. Holmgren will need to add strength to reach his peak on offense, but the Thunder can give him time to develop behind top options Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey.\n\n3. Houston Rockets: Jabari Smith, Auburn\n\nSmith was widely expected to the No. 1 pick but instead went No. 3. He only worked out for the Magic and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Smith averaged 42% on his 3-pointers (5.5 attempts), which could make him a good fit in Houston. At his size, he is difficult to defend. And he was also a quality defender at Auburn.\n\n4. Sacramento Kings: Keegan Murray, Iowa\n\nWith a point guard in place with De\u2019Aaron Fox, the Kings bypassed Jaden Ivey and took Murray, an efficient wing scorer. Murray, who improved significant from his freshman to sophomore seasons, averaged 23.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game while shooting 55% from the field and 39.8% on 3-pointers. Murray, 21, is one of the oldest lottery picks and could have an immediate impact for Sacramento. Like Banchero, Murray is NBA-ready.\n\n5. Detroit Pistons: Jaden Ivey, Purdue\n\nIvey only worked out for the Pistons and Magic. He uses his speed to blow by defenders, who will have a hard time slowing Ivey down in transition. He can explode into the lane similar to Ja Morant and has the bounce to finish. The son of Niele Ivey, the women\u2019s basketball coach at Notre Dame and a former women\u2019s college champion.\n\n6. Indiana Pacers: Bennedict Mathurin, Arizona\n\nOne of the biggest risers in the months leading up to the draft, Mathurin has the shooting touch and size to fill a 3-and-D role on the wing for the Pacers. Mathurin shot 42% from 3-point range in his final year at Arizona and flashed nice speed and athleticism. He can play off the ball next to Tyrese Hailburton and Chris Duarte, while helping boost a Pacers offense that was 18th in efficiency and 25th in 3-point shooting.\n\n7. Portland Trail Blazers: Shaedon Sharpe, Kentucky\n\nSharpe is one of the biggest mysteries in the draft. He enrolled at Kentucky in January, didn\u2019t play a second for the Wildcats and once he was ruled eligible for the draft, he entered. While teams only had high school and AAU-type video on Sharpe, he is a gifted scorer with his jump shot and at the rim. He is an explosive leaper who loves to get out in transition and dunk. Wildcats coach John Calipari said that if Sharpe returned to Kentucky next season, he would be the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft. Instead, he ends up the No. 7 pick and backcourt mate for Blazers star Damian Lillard.\n\n8. New Orleans Pelicans (from Los Angeles Lakers): Dyson Daniels, G League Ignite\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity for New Orleans to add another quality player to a playoff squad that is poised to be better next season with the return of Zion Williamson. The Australian got a taste of NBA-level play in the NBA All-Star Weekend\u2019s Rising Stars contest in February and he held his own. The 6-8 Daniels is a big guard who began playing professionally as a teenager in his native Australia.\n\n9. San Antonio Spurs: Jeremy Sochan, Baylor\n\nThe Spurs have three first-round picks and used their first to select Baylor\u2019s Jeremy Sochan. Sochan gives the Spurs some size at the wing to compliment All-Star Dejounte Murray. He\u2019s a versatile defender and solid rebounder, averaging 6.4 rebounds at Baylor in 2021-22. He runs the court well and scores with efficiency inside the 3-point line. Sochan can shoot the 3 but needs to improve his percentage. He averaged 9.2 points for the Bears.\n\n10. Washington Wizards: Johnny Davis, Wisconsin\n\nWith a roster potentially in flux this summer, the Wizards need talent and landed on one of the best players remaining. Davis took a huge leap as a scorer and rebounder in his second year at Wisconsin, from 7.0 points and 4.1 rebounds to 19.7 and 8.2. He can score and create in the mid-range but will need to improve his outside shot.\n\n11. New York Knicks (traded to Thunder): Ousmane Dieng, New Zealand Breakers\n\nSome mock drafts had Dieng going as high as No. 8. He fell to No. 11 and the Knicks, who then traded Dieng to the Thunder. He played last season in Australia\u2019s pro league for the New Zealand Breakers and averaged 8.9 points, 3.1 rebounds and an assist while shooting just 39.8% from the field and 27.1% on 3-pointers. But he improved as the season continued and was a much better scorer and shooter in the second half of the season. The Thunder\u2019s player development staff will work hard to make Dieng a significant contributor as they continue their rebuild.\n\n12. Oklahoma City Thunder (from Los Angeles Clippers): Jalen Williams, Santa Clara\n\nWilliams shot up draft boards after the combine in which his vertical leap, speed and wingspan caught the attention of scouts and executives. His defense will fit in well in OKC. The Thunder traded for the No. 11 pick, which did not affect the No. 12 pick. Williams was efficient on 3-pointers (39.6%) and inside the 3-point line (55.1%) and averaged 18 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists in 2021-22. He has patience with the basketball in pick-and-roll situations and finds his spots at the 3-point line for spot-up jumpers.\n\n13. Charlotte Hornets (traded to Pistons): Jalen Duren, Memphis\n\nDuren can play with his back to the basket, run the court and rebound. He has a capable face-up game in the low post and can make mid-range jump shots. He seemed like the perfect fit for the Hornets, but he was traded to the Knicks and then ultimately landed with the Pistons, where he and No. 5 pick Ivey join a promising young core led by last year's top pick Cade Cunningham.\n\n14. Cleveland Cavaliers: Ochai Agbaji, Kansas\n\nA team on the rise in the East, the Cavaliers are putting together quite a defensive unit. They have rim protectors and they added a need in a perimeter defender. Agbaji is 6-5 with a 6-10 wingspan and 8-8 standing reach and known as a 3-and-D wing. He played four seasons for the Jayhawks and was the 2022 Final Four Most Outstanding Player in the Jayhawks\u2019 title run. He averaged 18.8 points and 5.1 rebounds and shot 47.5% from the field and 40.7% on 3s. Former ESPN NBA draft analyst Mike Schmitz, now in Portland\u2019s front office, once tweeted, \"Ochai Agbaji could play 25+ minutes in an NBA game tomorrow.\"\n\n15. Charlotte Hornets (from New Orleans): Mark Williams, Duke\n\nWilliams should be able to step in immediately and fill a big need for the Hornets at center. At 7-2 with a 7-6 wingspan and 9-9 standing reach, Williams has the tools and good mobility for his size to be an imposing presence around the rim. He doesn't offer much yet on the offensive end, but he should catch a lot of lobs from LaMelo Ball.\n\n16. Atlanta Hawks: A.J. Griffin, Duke\n\nGriffin averaged 10.4 points on a team that has potentially five NBA draft picks, including No. 1. Hailing from a basketball family (his brother, sister and father all played for Power 5 schools; his father also is an assistant with the Toronto Raptors), Griffin is considered one of the better shooters in the draft. He shot 44.7% on 3s and 49.3% overall. He will add necessary shooting alongside Trae Young and give the Hawks needed help defensively with his ability to guard multiple positions at 6-6, 220 pounds.\n\n17. Houston Rockets (from Brooklyn): Tari Eason, LSU\n\nAfter finishing with the league\u2019s worst record this year, the Rockets are looking for someone to help Jalen Green (Houston\u2019s No. 2 draft pick in 2021). Rockets already picked up Jabari Smith at No. 3, and Tari Eason will add more offensive versatility with his ability to score at the rim. He uses his athleticism and length to attack the paint and can impact the game on the defensive end. He was named the 2022 SEC Sixth Man of the Year at LSU, where he averaged 16.9 points on 52.1% from the field.\n\n18. Chicago Bulls: Dalen Terry, Arizona\n\nTerry has good size at 6-7 with a 7-0 wingspan and the versatility to guard multiple positions on the perimeter. He moves without the ball well and has the athleticism to attack the rim and finish consistently, but he still needs to improve his outside shot to help a Bulls offense that was last in the league in 3-pointers attempted and next-to-last in 3-pointers made.\n\n19. Minnesota Timberwolves (traded to Grizzlies): Jake LaRavia, Wake Forest\n\nThe Timberwolves traded LaRavia to Memphis for the Nos. 22 and 29 picks in the first round. LaRavia was a late climber in draft, and the way he shoots, passes and moves without the ball, it\u2019s easy to see why the Grizzlies traded two picks to move up. LaRavia spent his first two college seasons at Indiana State then transferred to Wake Forest where he averaged 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists while shooting 55.9% from the field and 38.4% on 3s. He also has fundamental footwork that frees him for easy baskets in the post. LaRavia is a willing defender and has a knack for getting steals and creating in transition.\n\n20. San Antonio Spurs (from Toronto): Malaki Branham, Ohio State\n\nBranham loves to get to the rim, flourishes in transition offensively and can finish in the paint. That could be just what the doctor order for the Spurs. In half-court sets, he moves well with and without the basketball as a playmaker and cutter. His 3-point shot is not picture-perfect, but he made 41.6% from that range. He averaged 19 points in the final 10 games of the season. Branham arrived as a highly rated recruit and eventually developed into a second option, averaging 13.7 points while shooting 49.8% from the field and 41.6% from 3-point range.\n\n21. Denver Nuggets: Christian Braun, Kansas\n\nChristian Braun and his family decided to go to the 2022 NBA Draft in New York this week and good thing he did. He will join 2022 MVP Nikola Joki\u0107 in the Mile High City as the No. 21 pick. Braun is a two-way player that proved himself earning an NCAA championship with Kansas earlier this year. He will mesh well with Denver\u2019s style of play that operates through Jokic. He averaged 14.1 points from 49.5% shooting from the field, 6.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists for the Jayhawks in 2021-22.\n\n22. Memphis Grizzlies (traded to Timberwolves): Walker Kessler, Auburn\n\nThis pick will go the Timberwolves as part of the deal that gave Memphis the No. 19 pick. Kessler is a pick-and-roll big, knows how to set screens and is patient alongside the ball-handler. He is also very active on the offensive boards and blocks shots. Defense is what the Timberwolves like. Kessler had two triple-double last season \u2013 with blocks being a category where he notched at least 10. He improved his game after playing his freshman season at North Carolina, shooting 70.2% on 2-pointers for Auburn. Adding a reliable 3-ball will help.\n\n23. Philadelphia 76ers (traded to Grizzlies): David Roddy, Colorado State\n\nA unique and intriguing prospect at 6-6 and 260 pounds, Roddy saw plenty of time as an undersized center at Colorado State. His defensive instincts will give him a chance to contribute early, and his frame should allow him guard bigger players at the pro level. Philadelphia is trading Roddy to Memphis, where he will need to improve the consistency on his outside shot to stick in a 3-and-D role.\n\n24. Milwaukee Bucks: MarJon Beauchamp, G League Ignite\n\nHis is one of the most interesting stories in the draft. A Washington native who grew up in Yakima \u2014 about 140 miles away from talent-rich Seattle \u2014 and was widely considered one of the top prospects in the 2020 class, with multiple offers that included local schools Washington and Washington State. Instead, he chose to train for a year with the Chameleon BX program in San Francisco. Now, he gets to play with Giannis Antetokounmpo. At 6-6 with a 7-1 wingspan, Beauchamp has the size and talent to contribute immediately as a versatile defender who can guard multiple positions on the wing, as well as bigger players down low. He uses that wingspan to create turnovers, block shots and collect rebounds.\n\n25. San Antonio Spurs (from Boston): Blake Wesley, Notre Dame\n\nWesley, a 6-5 guard, creates easy transition points with his defense \u2014 he has great hands and a knack for interrupting passing lanes, and as a freshman held his own against talented scoring wings in the ACC. He\u2019s another guard with size who attacks the basket, finds his own shot and has good footwork in the paint. He shot just 29.6% on 3s, so that will be an area of focus, along with playmaking skills as a passer. The Spurs are accumulating two-way players with the idea that one or more will pan out.\n\n26. Dallas Mavericks (from Houston): Wendell Moore Jr., Duke\n\nThe Mavericks will bolster their shooting with Moore, an explosive guard playing on the perimeter. The Mavericks have built their team around Luka Doncic, who likes to create open looks for his teammates beyond the arc by attracting defenders. Moore improved his shooting \u2014 his 3s in particular \u2014 and was a better assist man in his third season at Duke. He can play the point if necessary and creates his own shot or a good look for others off the dribble.\n\n27. Miami Heat: Nikola Jovic, Serbia\n\nThe Serbian is another European sharpshooter who spends a lot of time at the 3-point line and shot 35.6% from long range in the ABA pro league in 2021-22. He can also be a playmaker. He grew eight inches in the past five years. He had been on the Heat\u2019s radar and could be considered a steal this late in the draft. At the start of the season, he received votes from NBA executives as the best international player not in the NBA. He averaged 12 points, four rebounds, and three assists per game in 29 games.\n\n28. Golden State Warriors: Patrick Baldwin Jr., Milwaukee\n\nA top-10 player coming out of high school in 2021, Baldwin had offers from top schools, including Duke, but decided to play for his dad at Milwaukee. He has a great shot but made just 26.6% on 3s and injuries limited him to 11 games. He has great size for a shooting wing at 6-9, and he ended up in a perfect spot where he will learn from a championship team and an outstanding player development staff.\n\n29. Memphis Grizzlies: TyTy Washington, Kentucky\n\nWashington has lottery talent but there was not a great market for point guards. A good table-setter who can initiate the offense and create shots for others, Washington has the passing instincts and vision to potentially flourish in the spread pick-and-roll sets that are a big part of NBA offenses. At 6-3, 200 pounds, he can also play shooting guard but letting him play point in the NBA is where he\u2019ll succeed. Washington averaged 12.5 points and 3.9 assists and shot 45.1% from the field.\n\n30. Denver Nuggets (from Oklahoma City): Peyton Watson, UCLA\n\nWatson has intriguing potential as a defensive prospect with his rangy frame (6-8, 7-0 wingspan, 203 pounds). Add in his quickness and athleticism, and Watson has a chance to make an impact early as a defender. He wasn't asked to do much offensively as a freshman for a veteran UCLA team, so he's something of a blank slate on that end. The Nuggets, who are acquiring Watson in a trade, can afford to bring him along slowly.\n\nSECOND ROUND\n\n31. Indiana Pacers (from Houston via Cleveland): Andrew Nembhard, Gonzaga\n\n32. Orlando Magic: Caleb Houstan, Michigan\n\n33. Toronto Raptors (from Detroit via San Antonio, Washington and Chicago): Christian Koloko, Arizona\n\n34. Oklahoma City Thunder: Jaylin Williams, Arkansas\n\n35. Los Angeles Lakers (from Indiana via Milwaukee and Orlando): Max Christie, Michigan State\n\n36. Detroit Pistons (from Portland): Gabriele Procida, Italy\n\n37. Sacramento Kings: Jaden Hardy, G League Ignite\n\n38. San Antonio Spurs (from L.A. Lakers via Chicago and Washington): Kennedy Chandler, Tennessee\n\n39. Cleveland Cavaliers (from San Antonio via Utah): Khalifa Diop, Senegal\n\n40. Minnesota Timberwolves (from Washington via Cleveland): Bryce McGowens, Nebraska\n\n41. New Orleans Pelicans: EJ Liddell, Ohio State\n\n42. New York Knicks: Trevor Keels, Duke\n\n43. Los Angeles Clippers: Moussa Diabate, Michigan\n\n44. Atlanta Hawks: Ryan Rollins, Toledo\n\n45. Charlotte Hornets: Josh Minott, Memphis\n\n46. Portland Trail Blazers (from Brooklyn via Detroit): Ismael Kamagate, France\n\n47. Memphis Grizzlies (from Cleveland via New Orleans and Atlanta): Vince Williams, Virginia Commonwealth\n\n48.

Minnesota Timberwolves (from Denver via Philadelphia): Matteo Spagnolo, Italy\n\n51. Golden State Warriors (from Toronto via Philadelphia): Tyrese Martin, UConn\n\n52. New Orleans Pelicans (from Utah): Karlo Matkovic, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n53. Boston Celtics: JD Davidson, Alabama\n\n*54. Milwaukee Bucks (forfeited)\n\n*55. Miami Heat (from Philadelphia via Denver; forfeited by Miami)\n\n54. Washington Wizards (from Dallas): Yannick Nzosa, Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n55. Golden State Warriors: Gui Santos, Brazil\n\n56. Cleveland Cavaliers (from Miami via Indiana): Luke Travers, Australia\n\n57. Portland Trail Blazers (from Memphis via Utah): Jabari Walker, Colorado\n\n58. Indiana Pacers (from Phoenix): Hugo Besson, France"}, {"url": "https://www.landofbasketball.com/draft/2004_nba_draft.htm", "page_content": "403 Error - Forbidden\n\nFor some reason this resource can't be accessed.\n\n(If your browser version is too old it might have been blocked for security reasons. Try updating its version)."}, {"url": "https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2021/7/28/22583591/nba-draft-detroit-pistons-second-round-big-men", "page_content": "The first pick is a lock if you ask fans, and a mystery if you ask Troy Weaver. But let\u2019s just say, for the sake of sanity, it\u2019s wing Cade Cunningham, who already looks great in Motown. If that\u2019s the case, then it seems wise for the franchise to load up with bigs in the second round. Motown has three second-round picks and, in this year\u2019s draft, it can bring about important pieces for its basketball future also with them as the draft looks to be extremely deep. You can find very interesting playmakers and wings appearing to be available in the second round. And you can find a ton of very interesting big men appearing to be available there as well.\n\nSince Detroit has an abundance of young guards and wings with tremendous upside, especially when it takes Cunningham with the no. 1 overall pick, I think it\u2019d be a good idea for them to turn to some bigs, if they\u2019d be obtainable, with one, two or all three of their 37th, 42nd and 52nd picks.\n\nThe Pistons seem to have drafted their center of the future in Isaiah Stewart last year. But other than him they only have savvy veteran, Mason Plumlee, whose timeline isn\u2019t compatible with that of their young core, a restoration project still in need of restoration in Jahlil Okafor, and a young prospect, Tyler Cook, who can flourish within Dwane Casey\u2019s offense but is never likely more than a fringe player.\n\nSo, as regards the future, Motor City has one sure thing on the five spot. Thus, they might be tempted to add to this pool when a conducive situation in this regard like this year\u2019s draft presents itself.\n\nSo who I\u2019d like most?\n\n1. Isaiah Jackson\n\nThe local kid is an athletic, 6-foot-10, 206-pound big with reportedly 7-foot-5 wingspan and with the seeds of a functional jumper (38% of all his shots are midrangers and he was making 34.6% of them). So in our firsts comments about this year\u2019s draft class, I thought of him as a potential second coming of Nic Claxton. This in itself means there is a lot to like. But then he showed some dribble plays. Therefore, now I see him as a one year older, but a little taller, around 10-pounds heavier and maybe longer prospect than Giannis Antetokounmpo, when the latter was entering his 2013 NBA draft; a prospect who already shows the flashes of all the abilities that constitute matured Antetokounmpo\u2019s game, plus carries a promise of a better shooting.\n\nAnd as much as this adds more intrigue to the Kentucky alum, I\u2019m worrying he might not last till the second round. The kid already has got the invite to the Green Room last week. So now we\u2019ll need a fall at least as spectacular as Deyonta Davis, but without also including the fall of his basketball career, to grab Jackson in the second round. Another way would be to combine some assets (like two or all of this year\u2019s second round picks and maybe something more) to move back into the first round.\n\n2. Sandro Mamukelashvili\n\nThe 22-year-old Pirate from Seton Hall, has the size of a classical big: 6-foot-10, 240-pound with more than a 7-foot wingspan. But he plays a modern big\u2019s game. He can make off the dribble jumpers from deep, handle the ball in P&Rs and pass. Thus, he reminds some of 2018 era Blake Griffin. Like Griffin, the American-Georgian baller isn\u2019t much of a rim protector. But he shows some potential to defend in space. These skills could work wonders within coach Casey\u2019s system. Someone who can do all the stuff Mason Plumlee is doing but also brings that Griffin dimension, namely the capacity to initiate the offense from the power position and spread the floor, seems to be a perfect completion for current Pistons offense. A big body that can bang on the blocks, is long enough and can move its feet to be disruptive for both ball-handler and roller in P&Rs as well as do a solid job when switched to defend on perimeter, would lack only the rim protection feature to be a perfect completion for current Pistons defense.\n\n3. JT Thor\n\nAnother prospect I initially thought of as a the next Claxton. He\u2019s close to Jackson in measurements: minimally smaller at 6-foot-9\u00bc, a few pounds lighter and shorter (7-foot-3\u00bc wingspan). As Jackson, he revealed the some new aspects (shooting and dribble play) to his game as the NCAA season progressed. His athleticism is more tuned though than that of Jackson and Antetokounmpo, so maybe he\u2019s more like Pascal Siakam, as Scott observed, though entering the NBA while being four years younger and looking bigger. So, his added value might rather be in him turning into a big wing, who can play some small-ball five minutes, than a big with wing\u2019s skills. Either way, he definitely carries a potential for one of the biggest upsides from players predicted to be still on board in the second round range.\n\n4. E.J. Onu\n\nThe NAIA hooper has the best metrics of the whole pack: 6-foot-11, 231-pound with allegedly 7-foot-8\u00bd wingspan. He\u2019s all about blocks, dunks\u2026 and triples. But he\u2019s also 22 years old. I\u2019m a little concerned with his lateral movement. He shows some flashes of the ability to move his feet in the mold of Even Mobley. But often he looks very slow-footed. Nevertheless, a poor man\u2019s Rudy Gobert with long gun seems to be one of the shrewdest ways to use your second-round pick.\n\nI\u2019m sure you have some other interesting ideas of the prospects of the bigs in particular and of what to do with Detroit\u2019s three second round draft picks in the coming (it\u2019s only one day away!) draft in general.

(Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)\n\nThe Pistons added four players to the franchise in the 2021 NBA Draft, including the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nThe Pistons walked into the draft with four total picks -- three in the second round -- and they used all of them. Here\u2019s a look at who is joining the Pistons.\n\nNo. 1: Cade Cunningham (Oklahoma State)\n\nOkay, you already knew this one, that\u2019s for sure. The first No. 1 pick for the Pistons since they drafted Bob Lanier back in 1970, Cunningham will make the Pistons better on day one.\n\nAt 6-foot-8, Cunningham, 19, has excellent size for a point guard. He averaged 20.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game for Oklahoma State while shooting 40% from three and 43.8% overall.\n\nCunningham\u2019s ability to find open teammates, especially off the dribble, will immediately make the Pistons offense more dangerous. Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant and company should improve from beyond the arc thanks to the attention Cunningham draws and the accuracy with which he passes.\n\nRead more on this pick here: Detroit Pistons select Cade Cunningham with No. 1 pick in NBA draft\n\nNo. 42: Isaiah Livers (Michigan)\n\nThis pick has John Beilein written all over it. The former Michigan basketball coach is now in the front office with the Pistons, and you have to think he had some opinions on Livers at No. 42. He recruited Rivers to Michigan in the first place.\n\nLivers, a Kalamazoo native and former Mr. Basketball (2017), spent four years at Michigan, starting 69 of 119 career games, and averaged 13.1 points and 6.0 rebounds a game in his senior season. Livers shot 43.1 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nLivers will likely start his NBA career bouncing between the Pistons bench and the Pistons G League team, the Motor City Cruise, which will begin playing on campus at Wayne State this fall.\n\nNo. 52: Luka Garza (Iowa)\n\nAnother Big Ten addition just ten picks later, Garza was a stat monster with Hawkeyes, entering the draft after four years with Iowa.\n\nGarza, 22, averaged 23.9 points and 9.8 rebounds as a junior and 24.1 points and 8.7 rebounds as an Iowa senior, sweeping the national player of the year awards in 2020-2021.\n\nGarza is NBA ready and could be a nice little steal for the Pistons in the second round. His floor is probably one of the highest for anyone drafted in the second round. He\u2019ll likely start on a two-way contract, too.\n\nNo. 57: Balsa Koprivica (Florida State)\n\nThis pick comes from the Pistons trading Mason Plumlee to Charlotte right before the draft started on Thursday.\n\nBalsa Koprivica, originally from Serbia, played for Florida State for the last two years. The 7-footer is a rebounding machine and can score from the post. He averaged 9 points and about 6 rebounds in his sophomore year at Florida State.\n\nKoprivica will join Livers and Garza as a two-way player to start his career.\n\nSign up for the Pistons Pivot Newsletter below:"}, {"url": "https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2004.html", "page_content": "Click the Team for players drafted by that franchise.\n\nClick the College for players drafted from that college.\n\nClick the Pk for players drafted in that slot.\n\nMatthew Maurer of TheDraftReview is an NBA Draft historian who has researched and collected the data on the entire history of the NBA Draft.

A second-round pick is a second-round pick, after all. But, this is a bigger deal than many realize. For one, the success rate of guys drafted below pick No. 45 is incredibly low. Isaiah Thomas and Manu Gin\u00f3bili are two of the few over the last 20 or 30 years that were drafted late in the second round that went on to have success in the NBA.\n\nThe success rate for picks 31-45 is MUCH higher. How much higher? Since the 2012 NBA Draft, guys drafted in this range include Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, Ivica Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Dillon Brooks, Jalen Brunson, Devonte\u2019 Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, Hamidou Diallo, Nic Claxton, Daniel Gafford, Herb Jones, and Ayo Dosunmu. Oh and two-time MVP Nikola Joki\u0107 went 41st too, so if you weren\u2019t excited before about the team moving up to 36 then I hope that changes now.\n\nWhile my second-round series was pondering who the team would be able to find at the end of the second round, now we get to shift our attention to guys that might have fallen out of the first round AND guys that profile similar to former 36th overall pick Malcolm Brogdon as guys that have clear skills to contribute from day one. Herb Jones went one spot before at 35 so we\u2019ll throw him in here too since he also was overlooked for the same \u201cage\u201d concerns and perceived lack of upside as Brogdon.\n\nJaden Hardy\n\nJaden Hardy is someone I would be ecstatic if the team were able to select him at 36. This is a guy that was a consensus top-10 pick going into the year with many draft experts predicting he would be a top-five pick when all was said and done. Unfortunately, he had an inefficient year playing for G League Ignite with shooting splits of 40.2/26.9/88.2 and some downright terrible defensive tape. He\u2019s also listed at 6-foot-4 and 190 pounds so he does not have the size upside some teams want.\n\nAs I stated in my Final Big Board, however, Hardy was in one of the worst team situations this past season. There was exactly ONE teammate of his on the G League Ignite that played at least 10 games and shot over 34.0% from three. Both Dyson Daniels and Marjon Beauchamp shot under 26% from three so he was not getting help from his fellow draft prospects in that regard.\n\nHardy also had to adjust to Scoot Henderson\u2019s arrival in the fifth game of the season. Oh, and Scoot shot an absolutely terrible 17.4% to boot. And, the final struggle being that Ignite only had two big men in Jessie Govan and Michael Foster Jr. who were able to play 10 games or more. In the midst of all this, Hardy was still asked to be the primary shot creator. Anybody would struggle in this kind of environment. And yes, I am aware the defense is bad, but this is the G League where defense is optional and Hardy\u2019s bread and butter is as a bucket getter.\n\nLost in this is the fact that Hardy had both one of the best handles in this class and has the ability to get his jumpshot off from anywhere on the court. Of course, this also contributed to Hardy\u2019s inefficient percentages, but he still maintained his confidence through all the struggles and understood that he had to get buckets for his team to stay afloat. And he started to turn a corner down the stretch as he scored 20 or more points in eight of the Ignite\u2019s final 11 games of the season and shooting 32/93 on three-pointers which was 34.4%.\n\nI think with actual NBA spacing and big men, Hardy could be an impactful microwave scorer with playmaking ability to boot.\n\nKendall Brown\n\nIf you stay quiet and listen close enough, you can hear Chaz Malibu cackling and nodding in gleeful excitement at the thought of the mega-athletic forward falling to 36. Kendall Brown has drawn comparisons to Shawn Marion and Aaron Gordon athletically but is way behind where both guys were in terms of basketball skills going into their respective draft classes.\n\nWhat Brown CAN do is finish at the rim, pass, and play consistently impactful defense. He dished out 63 assists for the year, which was third on a veteran-laden Baylor team. He also was the actual embodiment of the NBA Jam \u201cHe\u2019s On Fire\u201d character as Brown shot 81.5% on 108 attempts at the rim. And lastly, Brown used his 6-foot-7.5 and 201.2 pounds with a 6-foot-11 wingspan to switch on to just about anyone with the strength and length to handle forwards and the quickness and agility to stay glued to guards. Brown is one of the easiest projections to make for guarding ones through fours in the NBA.\n\nWhat Brown CAN\u2019T DO is shoot and handle the rock efficiently. Hitting more than one-third of his threes seems okay, but this was on just 41 total attempts all season which translates to 1.2 attempts per game. Brown\u2019s main issue with shooting is that he does not want to take them at times. He will have to work on having a corner three at the very least in the NBA if he does not want to be an offensive liability in the NBA. His handle is also very loose and will require him to work on as he had a high turnover rate in pick-and-roll at 42.6% and in isolations at 33.3%.\n\nFor those Tari Eason fans out there (like me), Brown offers the same type of size and tools, but with much less polish. Thankfully, the Pistons would be in no rush to actualize Brown immediately and he could follow a similar path to fellow athlete with shooting struggles Isaac Okoro in the meantime to take full advantage of his defense and finishing ability.\n\nRyan Rollins\n\nMacomb, Michigan\u2019s own, Ryan Rollins is just 19 years old despite playing two years for the Rockets just south down I-75 to Toledo. A great mix of skills and upside, Rollins is the type of potential second-rounder you do not see very often. A quick look at his shot chart gives you both the encouragement and concern for his NBA potential.\n\nRollins has an advanced midrange game that is essential for a guard in today\u2019s NBA, but he does not yet have the three-point shooting to match. Part of this is due to the fact that Rollins had to create a lot of his own offense off the dribble at Toledo while also trying to create for his teammates. This means he had to dribble into the teeth of the defense to draw extra attention, use his strength as a pull-up shooter to make it so that is bullet point No. 1 on a scouting report, and dish out 123 assists in the meantime. He had fewer opportunities to get clean three-point shots off. I personally think he will be a fine three-point shooter once surrounded by NBA talent as evidenced by his pull-up jumper and his 80.2% from the free-throw line.\n\nDefensively there will be big concerns, however. Rollins measures in at 6-foot-3.25 and 179.2 pounds at the NBA Combine so he does not have good size. He also showed below-average athleticism on film and the area it affected him the most was man-to-man defense. He does not have the foot speed to keep up with top-notch athletes and is not as attentive to technique here as he is on offense. I think he could be a good defender because he does show good awareness off the ball in help defense, but he will have to clean up things like footwork and closeout technique when in man-to-man situations.\n\nLike Jaden Hardy, I think Rollins at the very least could be an impactful microwave scorer with good playmaking skills as well.\n\nMax Christie\n\nSparty fans, rejoice! The Pistons are now in Max Christie range. Christie has a few more physical tools than Rollins, but is usually mocked behind him because he has shown to be more than a role player. Scoring just 9.3 points per game with shooting splits of 42.9/31.7/82.4, Christie had a disappointing freshman season at Michigan State. Christie did flash plenty of ability, however, to warrant a top-40 ranking in this draft, and I would not at all be surprised if he ended up getting selected at the end of the first round.\n\nChristie is 6-foot-5.75 and weighs in at 189.2 pounds with a 6-foot-8.75 wingspan\u2014so he is on the edge of being a wing or guard. Christie has a solid handle, great man-to-man defensive skills, and real shooting potential. Christie, more often than not, took on the toughest perimeter assignment on defense for the Spartans, and his blend of quickness and hustle always made a big difference. He also looked at his best on offense as a shooter coming off screens which makes his 3-and-D potential abundantly clear.\n\nChristie\u2019s main deficiency comes as a finisher. Christie could neither get to the rim nor could he finish when he got there. Just look at this shot chart to get an idea of how bad it is.\n\nThis more than anything is what will knock Christie down boards as he wasn\u2019t nearly as good as someone like Bryce McGowens who similar had shooting struggles but attacked the rim and finished to offset some of those concerns. There is also not a lot of red on that shot chart so Christie is a ball of POTENTIAL on offense that hasn\u2019t yet put it all together. This is mainly due to the fact that this Michigan State really did not have a reliable veteran shot-creator like in years past.\n\nNo one on this Michigan State team: scored 420 total points, averaged AT LEAST 12 ppg, took at least 10 field goal attempts per game, or had more than 81 trips to the free-throw line. If you want to diss Christie, please look at that sentence again and tell me how a freshman is supposed to succeed in that? Unless you are Cade, LeBron, Kyrie level then you are going to struggle.\n\nAs I have stated before, I love Michigan State guys the way Bill Belichick loves players out of Rutgers cuz we trust the man coaching them to get them fully prepared to be a pro. Surrounded by guys that can get their own shot consistently and space the floor, I think Christie will improve and be a good 3-and-D option in the NBA.\n\nChristian Koloko\n\nOne of the more underrated guys in this class, I think there is little to no difference between Christian Koloko and all-of-a-sudden potential lottery pick Mark Williams. Williams has the advantage in terms of size, but I think Koloko is much better than Williams when it comes to being a switchable 5 on defense. And the size advantage is not as wide as you might think with Koloko\u2019s 7-foot height and 221 pound weight, 9-foot-5 standing reach and 7-foot-5.25 wingspan.\n\nI personally have Koloko rated above Williams because Koloko moves like a wing out there. He is able to get up and down the court in a hurry, and Koloko is a great transition finisher and lob threat. I also feel strongly he would immediately be one of Cade\u2019s favorite teammates with that length and Koloko\u2019s verticality to get up for any and all lobs. Koloko\u2019s defensive impact, also cannot be understated as he posted two or more blocks in 25 out of Arizona\u2019s 37 games this past season. He is also not just hunting down blocks and blowing defensive assignments chasing them down, this was within the system and Arizona\u2019s defense was built entire around Koloko\u2019s abilities to defend the paint.\n\nI do think on defense he will need to fine-tune his footwork to do a better job in switches. Right now, he gets too excited and does not sit down and patiently slide to use his length to its utmost impact. If he does this, he could be like a seven-foot Robert Williams in my opinion. Koloko is a limited offensive player, however, who is only going to be a rim runner to start his NBA career. His touch was spotty at the beginning of the year when the team asked him to create offense and he looked to have almost no post moves. By the end of the year, though, it did improve he was Arizona\u2019s second most reliable offensive player in the Pac-12 and NCAA Tournaments, so there is improvement here.\n\nBUT, BUT, and I cannot star, asterisk, and dump a whole bag of salt on what I am about to share with you, BUT Koloko did come in tied for second place at the NBA Combine in the three-point star drill.

But let\u2019s just say, for the sake of sanity, it\u2019s wing Cade Cunningham, who already looks great in Motown. If that\u2019s the case, then it seems wise for the franchise to load up with bigs in the second round. Motown has three second-round picks and, in this year\u2019s draft, it can bring about important pieces for its basketball future also with them as the draft looks to be extremely deep. You can find very interesting playmakers and wings appearing to be available in the second round. And you can find a ton of very interesting big men appearing to be available there as well.\n\nSince Detroit has an abundance of young guards and wings with tremendous upside, especially when it takes Cunningham with the no. 1 overall pick, I think it\u2019d be a good idea for them to turn to some bigs, if they\u2019d be obtainable, with one, two or all three of their 37th, 42nd and 52nd picks.\n\nThe Pistons seem to have drafted their center of the future in Isaiah Stewart last year. But other than him they only have savvy veteran, Mason Plumlee, whose timeline isn\u2019t compatible with that of their young core, a restoration project still in need of restoration in Jahlil Okafor, and a young prospect, Tyler Cook, who can flourish within Dwane Casey\u2019s offense but is never likely more than a fringe player.\n\nSo, as regards the future, Motor City has one sure thing on the five spot. Thus, they might be tempted to add to this pool when a conducive situation in this regard like this year\u2019s draft presents itself.\n\nSo who I\u2019d like most?\n\n1. Isaiah Jackson\n\nThe local kid is an athletic, 6-foot-10, 206-pound big with reportedly 7-foot-5 wingspan and with the seeds of a functional jumper (38% of all his shots are midrangers and he was making 34.6% of them). So in our firsts comments about this year\u2019s draft class, I thought of him as a potential second coming of Nic Claxton. This in itself means there is a lot to like. But then he showed some dribble plays. Therefore, now I see him as a one year older, but a little taller, around 10-pounds heavier and maybe longer prospect than Giannis Antetokounmpo, when the latter was entering his 2013 NBA draft; a prospect who already shows the flashes of all the abilities that constitute matured Antetokounmpo\u2019s game, plus carries a promise of a better shooting.\n\nAnd as much as this adds more intrigue to the Kentucky alum, I\u2019m worrying he might not last till the second round. The kid already has got the invite to the Green Room last week. So now we\u2019ll need a fall at least as spectacular as Deyonta Davis, but without also including the fall of his basketball career, to grab Jackson in the second round. Another way would be to combine some assets (like two or all of this year\u2019s second round picks and maybe something more) to move back into the first round.\n\n2. Sandro Mamukelashvili\n\nThe 22-year-old Pirate from Seton Hall, has the size of a classical big: 6-foot-10, 240-pound with more than a 7-foot wingspan. But he plays a modern big\u2019s game. He can make off the dribble jumpers from deep, handle the ball in P&Rs and pass. Thus, he reminds some of 2018 era Blake Griffin. Like Griffin, the American-Georgian baller isn\u2019t much of a rim protector. But he shows some potential to defend in space. These skills could work wonders within coach Casey\u2019s system. Someone who can do all the stuff Mason Plumlee is doing but also brings that Griffin dimension, namely the capacity to initiate the offense from the power position and spread the floor, seems to be a perfect completion for current Pistons offense. A big body that can bang on the blocks, is long enough and can move its feet to be disruptive for both ball-handler and roller in P&Rs as well as do a solid job when switched to defend on perimeter, would lack only the rim protection feature to be a perfect completion for current Pistons defense.\n\n3. JT Thor\n\nAnother prospect I initially thought of as a the next Claxton. He\u2019s close to Jackson in measurements: minimally smaller at 6-foot-9\u00bc, a few pounds lighter and shorter (7-foot-3\u00bc wingspan). As Jackson, he revealed the some new aspects (shooting and dribble play) to his game as the NCAA season progressed. His athleticism is more tuned though than that of Jackson and Antetokounmpo, so maybe he\u2019s more like Pascal Siakam, as Scott observed, though entering the NBA while being four years younger and looking bigger. So, his added value might rather be in him turning into a big wing, who can play some small-ball five minutes, than a big with wing\u2019s skills. Either way, he definitely carries a potential for one of the biggest upsides from players predicted to be still on board in the second round range.\n\n4. E.J. Onu\n\nThe NAIA hooper has the best metrics of the whole pack: 6-foot-11, 231-pound with allegedly 7-foot-8\u00bd wingspan. He\u2019s all about blocks, dunks\u2026 and triples. But he\u2019s also 22 years old. I\u2019m a little concerned with his lateral movement. He shows some flashes of the ability to move his feet in the mold of Even Mobley. But often he looks very slow-footed. Nevertheless, a poor man\u2019s Rudy Gobert with long gun seems to be one of the shrewdest ways to use your second-round pick.\n\nI\u2019m sure you have some other interesting ideas of the prospects of the bigs in particular and of what to do with Detroit\u2019s three second round draft picks in the coming (it\u2019s only one day away!) draft in general.

In 1990, University of Detroit and Mercy College of Detroit consolidated to become University of Detroit Mercy.\n\nThe legacy of University of Detroit Mercy, Michigan's oldest and largest Catholic university, began over 125 years ago. The founders, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and the Religious Sisters of Mercy, have always believed in the power of education to change people and, through them, the world. To that end, each order began colleges to foster the intellectual, social, spiritual and moral development of individuals.\n\nThe Society of Jesus, an order known for excellence in education, has a history in Detroit that dates to the 1600s. In 1877, the Jesuits, at the invitation of Bishop Casper Henry Borgess of Detroit, established Detroit College. Located on the bustling corner of Jefferson Avenue, the college expanded into the University of Detroit. In 1927, under the guidance of Fr. John P. McNichols, the University moved many of its programs to a sprawling campus at Livernois and Six Mile Road (McNichols Road).\n\nIn 1940, the Religious Sisters of Mercy, headed by Mother Mary Carmelita Manning, R.S.M., established their Detroit Province at Southfield and West Outer Drive. Mercy College of Detroit opened its doors in 1941 to prepare young women for careers in nursing and teaching so that they might contribute intelligently and effectively to the welfare of society. Over the years, it expanded into a comprehensive coeducational liberal arts college.\n\nBoth the Jesuits and the Sisters of Mercy established their local colleges to improve the lives of men and women through higher education. They also believed that this education should occur in Detroit, a growing urban center. Here, students would learn in a dynamic urban community and gain valuable experience that only a major metropolitan area could offer. At the same time, Detroit and the region would benefit from the talents and skill of graduates.\n\nIn 1990, the University of Detroit and Mercy College of Detroit combined their resources and operations in a consolidated institution with the same ongoing commitments. This innovative union created the University of Detroit Mercy and a new way to carry forth the legacy.\n\nRELATED ITEMS IN THE COLLECTION\n\nView all items related to the University of Detroit Mercy"}, {"url": "https://www.collegesimply.com/colleges/michigan/university-of-detroit-mercy/", "page_content": "Public domain college data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics survey for academic years 2021/2022.
