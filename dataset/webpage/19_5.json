The performances will mark the first time in 40 years the original band \u2014 Steve Morse (guitar),Andy West (bass),Allen Sloan (violin),Steve Davidowski (keyboards) and Rod Morgenstein (drums) \u2014 will share the stage. Tickets are on sale now.\n\nThe \"Dawn Of The Dregs\" 25-date tour \u2014 with additional dates to be announced soon \u2014 will take the band across the country starting on February 28 in Clearwater, Florida and make stops in Atlanta, Charleston, Washington D.C., New York City, Boston, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, Milwaukee, Boulder and Phoenix, among many others,before wrapping April 25 in Dallas, TX.\n\n\"This tour is the result of the overwhelming requests we've received from a loyal audience of diehard Dregheads, and new fans who have never seen us perform live, but discovered the band for the first time through Steve's membership in DEEP PURPLE, or Rod as the drummer for WINGER,\" said West. \"We can't wait to playfor them all.\"\n\nFor guitar aficionados, Steve Morse needs no introduction, and his place in the pantheon of guitar greats is certain. But, in fact, his career started with DIXIE DREGS. The band traces its true beginnings to the band DIXIE GRIT, which started in a Georgia high school with Steve on guitar and Andy West on bass. DIXIE GRIT morphed into DIXIE DREGS at the University of Miami School of Music, where Allen Sloan (violin) and Rod Morgenstein (drums) joined up with Steve and Andy, who were the \"dregs\" of DIXIE GRIT.\n\nThe members of DIXIE DREGS remained committed to attending the University of Miami School of Music, which hosted a lively and talented musical community during their tenure, including future greats Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, T Lavitz, and Bruce Hornsby, among manyothers. In 1975, the group's demo album, \"The Great Spectacular\", was recorded at the University of Miami and then re-released on CD in 1997.\n\nAfter graduation, the band moved back to Augusta where Steve Davidowski (keyboards) completed the band. The band paid its dues and honed its skills playing in bars and venues throughout the South in the mid-'70s. They established themselves in the firmament of American instrumental music, seamlessly fusing rock with progressive and jazz elements to create a uniquely instrumental-driven style that has stood the test of time.\n\nBased on a short demo and a tip from former ALLMAN BROTHERS keyboardist Chuck Leavell along with legendary ALLMAN/DREGS tour manager Twiggs Lyndon, Capricorn Records signed THE DIXIE DREGS to record \"Free Fall\" (1977). The success and critical acclaim of \"Free Fall\" announced DIXIE DREGS to the world, and after its release, they would become a cult-favorite band that would have a lasting influence on much of modern rock.\n\nTour dates:\n\nFeb. 28 - Clearwater, FL - Capitol Theatre\n\nMar. 01 - Ponte Vedra Beach, FL - Ponte Vedra Concert Hall\n\nMar. 02 - Augusta, GA - Bell Auditorium\n\nMar. 03 - Atlanta, GA - Center Stage\n\nMar. 05 - Charleston, SC - Charleston Music Hall\n\nMar. 06 - Durham, NC - Carolina Theater\n\nMar. 07 - Washington, DC - Lincoln Theater\n\nMar. 08 - Wilmington, DE - The Grand Opera House\n\nMar. 09 - Collingswood, NJ - Scottish Rite Auditorium\n\nMar. 10 - Newton, NJ - Newton Theater\n\nMar. 14 - Ridgefield, CT - Ridgefield Playhouse\n\nMar. 15 - Huntington, NY - The Paramount\n\nMar. 16 - New York, NY - Town Hall\n\nMar. 17 - Woodstock, NY - Bearsville Theater\n\nMar. 19 - Boston, MA - Wilbur Theater\n\nMar. 21 - Albany, NY - The Egg\n\nMar. 22 - Pittsburgh, PA - Carnegie Music Hall\n\nMar. 23 - Cleveland, OH - Kent Stage\n\nMar. 24 - Chicago, IL - The Vic Theater\n\nApr. 11 - Milwaukee, WI - Pabst Theater\n\nApr. 14 - Boulder, CO - Boulder Theatre\n\nApr. 20 - San Juan Capistrano, CA - The Coach House\n\nApr. 21 - Agoura Hills, CA - The Canyon Club\n\nApr. 22 - Phoenix, AZ - Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts\n\nApr. 25 - Dallas, TX - House of Blues\n\nFor a complete list of dates, visit DixieDregs.com."}, {"url": "https://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Rod_Morgenstein.html", "page_content": "Rod\u2019s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan. The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dreg\u2019s music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\n\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possible the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\n\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beack, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\n\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\n\n\nAnd so, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band\n\n\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. And offshoot of Platypus is Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their first release is due out in 2001.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Premier Percussion (Rod Morgenstein Signature Drumheads), Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been and endorser for many, many years.\n\n\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.umdrums.com/2015/08/10/rod-morganstein/", "page_content": "Rod Morganstein\n\nRod\u2019s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan.

Their mostly instrumental music fuses jazz, southern rock, bluegrass and classical forms in an often unique style.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation and early years\n\nThe Dixie Dregs evolved from an Augusta, Georgia band called Dixie Grit, formed by Steve Morse and Andy West in 1970. The band featured Morse's older brother Dave on drums, Frank Brittingham (guitar and vocals) and Johnny Carr (keyboards). Carr was later replaced by Mark Parrish. Shortly after Steve Morse's enrollment at University of Miami's School of Music in 1971, Dixie Grit was disbanded. Morse and West continued performing as a duet, calling themselves Dixie Dregs (the \"Dregs\" of \"Dixie Grit\").[1]\n\nIn 1973, Steve Morse (guitar), Andy West (bass), Allen Sloan (violin) and Bart Yarnal (drums) met while students at the University of Miami's School of Music to play as Rock Ensemble II. West also attended Georgia State University for a year while studying cello and music theory & composition along with Parrish. Parrish remained at GSU during the academic school years only to return to Augusta, Georgia during summer breaks - re-establishing the guitar/bass/keyboards/drums quartet with Morse, West, Parrish, and Gilbert Frayer (drums) performing as opening acts for concerts and headlining local gigs as the Dixie Dregs.\n\nDuring subsequent academic school years, the remaining members of the Dregs \u2014 including Andy West \u2014 returned to the University of Miami and Mark Parrish returned to Atlanta, Georgia to complete his degree in music performance and composition at Georgia State University under the study of William Masselos, with additional studies of electronic music at Columbia University in New York City under Alice Shields - a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wendy Carlos.\n\nFirst recording\n\nAt the time, the University of Miami hosted a lively musical community, including future greats Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Rod Morgenstein was asked to fill in as drummer after a surfing accident disabled Yarnal. In 1974, during the school years at UofM, keyboardist Frank Josephs was added to their lineup. In 1975, the group's first effort, The Great Spectacular (named by ex-\"Dixie Grit\" second guitarist and singer, Frank Brittingham) was recorded at the University. Approximately 1,000 copies of the original LP were pressed. The album was reissued in 1997 in CD form.\n\nSigned to Capricorn\n\nBased on the strength of a three song demo and a tip from former Allman Brothers Band members Chuck Leavell and Twiggs Lyndon, Capricorn Records signed them in late 1976 to record Free Fall (1977). Steve Davidowski was the keyboardist on \"Free Fall\". When Steve left to work with fiddler Vassar Clements, former Dixie Grit/Dixie Dregs keyboardist Mark Parrish rejoined the group later that year. The moderate success and critical acclaim of Free Fall led to their 1978 effort, What If, supported by their first tour with dates in New York, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and California.\n\nTheir fourth album, Night of the Living Dregs (featuring Morse, West, Sloan, Parrish, and Morgenstein), was released in April 1979, gaining the band their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance - won that year by Paul McCartney's band Wings. Night of the Living Dregs included studio recordings as well as compositions performed live and recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 23, 1978. Ken Scott - The Beatles' and producer/arranger George Martin's right-hand man and engineer - produced both Dixie Dregs albums What If and Night of the Living Dregs.\n\nSwitch to Arista\n\nIn October 1979, Capricorn Records declared bankruptcy, and the band was signed by Arista Records in January 1980, to create three albums. At that time, keyboardist Parrish left and was replaced by T Lavitz. Later that year, Dregs of the Earth (featuring Morse, West, Sloan, Lavitz, and Morgenstein) was released.\n\nParrish went on to play piano and keyboards for vocalists Andy Williams, Roberta Flack, Natalie Cole, Luther Vandross, Peabo Bryson, Celine Dion, Regina Belle, Deborah Gibson, Pat Boone and daughter Debby Boone, Glen Campbell and for guitarist Larry Coryell. He won an Angel Award as co-producer of a Christian album, where he arranged and played all the instrumental segments. He has also been musical director, conductor, and keyboard instrumentalist with the touring stage shows of Cats, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Wizard of Oz, Little Shop of Horrors, Nunsense, Brigadoon, The Phantom of the Opera, Anything Goes, and other Broadway stage shows.\n\nName change\n\nFor Unsung Heroes, released in 1981, the band changed their name to The Dregs in an effort to gain more commercial appeal. Violinist Sloan was replaced by Mark O'Connor, winner of Nashville's Grand Masters Fiddle Championship for their 1982 release, Industry Standard. This album introduced vocals for the first time as a further attempt to gain more airtime. Guest vocalists included the Doobie Brothers's Patrick Simmons and Alex Ligertwood (Santana). Industry Standard provided the Dregs with another Grammy nomination for Best Rock/Jazz Instrumental Performance. The recent name change, vocal additions and a grueling touring schedule did nothing to improve sales and the members of The Dregs parted for individual projects.\n\nReunion\n\nIn the late 1980s, the group reunited for a tour featuring former members Morse, Morgenstein (who was also playing with Winger), Lavitz and Sloan. Their return was complemented by a \"Best Of\" release entitled Divided We Stand (1989). Bassist Dave LaRue completed the line-up for a seven date tour culminating in the 1992 live album Bring 'em Back Alive, which garnered them a second Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in January, 1993 - awarded to Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble for \"Little Wing\". Violinist Jerry Goodman, of The Mahavishnu Orchestra fame, filled in for Sloan, who was frequently absent as a result of his busy medical career. They signed a deal with former label Capricorn Records for their first studio album in years entitled Full Circle in 1994.\n\nToday\n\nThe Dregs to this day remain a loose collection of its former members, reuniting briefly for short tours and rare studio work. 1997's releases were The Great Spectacular in April and King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents (originally recorded in 1979 for the King Biscuit radio show) in September. California Screamin' (2000) is a curious mix of live recordings from the performances at the Roxy Theatre in August 1999. This release features older compositions and covers of the Allman Brothers Band's \"Jessica\", and Frank Zappa's \"Peaches en Regalia\" (with Dweezil Zappa sharing guitar lead). 20th Century Masters: The Best Of The Dixie Dregs and the DVD Sects, Dregs and Rock 'n' Roll were released in 2002.\n\nPersonnel\n\nMembers\n\nTimeline\n\nLineups\n\n1970\n\nAs \"Dixie Grit\" 1970-1971\n\nAs \"Dixie Grit\" 1971-1973 1973 Frank Brittingham - guitar, vocals\n\n- guitar, vocals Johnny Carr - keyboards\n\n- keyboards Dave Morse - drums\n\n- drums Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar Frank Brittingham - guitar, vocals\n\n- guitar, vocals Dave Morse - drums\n\n- drums Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Mark Parrish - keyboards Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar As \"Rock Ensemble II\" Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin\n\n- violin Bart Yarnall - drums As \"Dixie Dregs\" Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Mark Parrish - keyboards\n\n- keyboards Gilbert Frayer - drums 1973-1974 1974-1975 1975-1977 1977-1978 Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin\n\n- violin Rod Morgenstein - drums Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin\n\n- violin Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums Frank Josephs - keyboards Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin\n\n- violin Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums Steve Davidowski - keyboards Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin\n\n- violin Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums Mark Parrish - keyboards 1978-1981 1981-1982 1982-1988 1988-1992 Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin\n\n- violin Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums T Lavitz - keyboards Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums T Lavitz - keyboards\n\n- keyboards Mark O'Connor - violin Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Andy West - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums T Lavitz - keyboards Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums T Lavitz - keyboards\n\n- keyboards Dave LaRue - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Allen Sloan, M.D. - violin 1992-2010 2010-present Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums T Lavitz - keyboards\n\n- keyboards Dave LaRue - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Jerry Goodman - violin Steve Morse - guitar\n\n- guitar Rod Morgenstein - drums\n\n- drums Dave LaRue - bass guitar\n\n- bass guitar Jerry Goodman - violin\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nLive albums\n\nBring 'Em Back Alive (1992)\n\n(1992) King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents (September 16, 1997)\n\n(September 16, 1997) California Screamin' (February 1, 2000)\n\n(February 1, 2000) From the Front Row...

But in fact, his career started with the Dixie Dregs. And now beginning March 2018, with much anticipation and in response to demand from devoted fans, the original lineup announces a return to live performance for the Dawn of the Dregs Tour! The band traces its true beginnings to the band Dixie Grit, which started in a Georgia high school with Steve on guitar and Andy West on bass. Dixie Grit morphed into the Dixie Dregs at the University of Miami School of Music, where Allen Sloan (violin) and Rod Morgenstein (drums) joined up with Steve and Andy, who were the \u201cdregs\u201d of Dixie Grit.\n\nThe members of the Dixie Dregs remained committed to attending the University of Miami School of Music, which hosted a lively and talented musical community during their tenure, including future greats Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, T Lavitz, and Bruce Hornsby, among many others. In 1975, the group's demo album, The Great Spectacular, was recorded at the University of Miami and then re-released on CD in 1997.\n\nAfter graduation, the band moved back to Augusta where Steve Davidowski (keyboards) completed the band that would eventually emerge and become known simply as The Dregs. The band paid its dues and honed its skills playing in bars and venues throughout the South in the mid-70's. They established themselves in the firmament of American instrumental music, seamlessly fusing rock with progressive and jazz elements to create a uniquely instrumental-driven style that has stood the test of time.\n\nBased on a short demo and a tip from former Allman Brothers keyboardist Chuck Leavell along with Allman/Dregs tour manager Twiggs Lyndon, Capricorn Records signed the Dixie Dregs to record Free Fall (1977). The success and critical acclaim of Free Fall announced the Dixie Dregs to the world, and after its release, they would became a cult favorite band that would have a lasting influence on much of modern rock.\n\nOver the course of 40 years, the Dixie Dregs have released eleven commercial albums of original material, and a number of compilations, reissues, and countless live bootlegs also exist. Along the way they have garnered six (!) Grammy nominations. The band has played with several well-known additional alumni and guests -- among others, Jerry Goodman (Mahavishnu Orchestra) Alex Ligertwood (Santana) and Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater) -- and its original band members have played and recorded on well over 300 releases (including Deep Purple (Steve Morse) and Winger/Jelly Jam (Rod Morgenstein)). The Dawn of the Dregs tour is coming soon to a city near you!\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/dixie-dregs", "page_content": "Dixie Dregs\n\nRock group\n\nFor the Record\u2026\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nThe Dixie Dregs are an instrumental group whose music blended jazz and Southern boogie with a healthy dose of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. \u201cOne of the top jazz-rock fusion ensembles ever,\u201d wrote Steve Huey of All Music Guide, \u201cthe Dixie Dregs combined virtuoso technique with eclecticism and a sense of humor and spirit too frequently lacking in similar projects.\u201d Following in the wake of Chick Corea and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, they played guitar, violin, keyboards, bass, and drums at breakneck speed in original compositions. The group received six Grammy Award nominations for Best Instrumental Performance; their outstanding live performances earned them an invitation to the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1978. Although the group originally disbanded in 1982, the Dregs (the group shortened its name in 1980) reunited in 1988 and have continued to tour and record.\n\nNeither guitarist/composer Steve Morse nor bassist Andy West came from the South, but both moved to Augusta, Georgia in the mid-1960s; Morse had been playing the guitar for five years when he met West at Richmond Academy in the tenth grade. They found a keyboard player and a singer, and formed the Dixie Grits. The band played locally, though its progressive originals failed to win over local crowds expecting dance music. \u201cAfter the Dixie Grits broke up,\u201d Morse told Jas Obrecht of Guitar Player, \u201call that was left was Andy and me, so we were the dregs. \u201d Morse left the Richmond Academy, forced out because of his long hair, but was still allowed to study music at the University of Miami. There he met drummer Rod Morgenstein and violinist Allen Sloan. When the three decided to form a band in 1975, West came to Miami and they recorded their unofficial debut, The Great Spectacular, for a class project. The band added keyboardist Steve Davidowski and decided to take their music public.\n\nAfter graduation, the band moved back to Augusta, living frugally in rental property owned by West\u2019s parents. They played at a local club called the Whipping Post and built a reputation in the South as a potent live act. \u201cProof of the Dregs\u2019 artistry is found in its live recordings,\u201d wrote Patrick McCarty in MusicHound Rock. \u201cWith fast tempo, rhythm, melody and key changes, the group members\u2019 potent musicianship rings clear without a lot of processing or chicanery.\u201d The band\u2019s break came when they opened for Sea Level in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1976. The Dixie Dregs\u2019 set so impressed Chuck Leavell, keyboardist for Sea Level, and Twiggs Lyndon, former road manager to the Allman Brothers, that they contacted Phil Walden of Capricorn Records, who caught a performance in Macon, Georgia. Just before Christmas of 1976 the band signed with Capricorn and hired Lyndon as their road manager.\n\nIn 1977 the Dixie Dregs entered the studio and recorded their official debut, Free Fall. \u201cFreefall (sic) features a good mix of southern rock, bluegrass and jazz styles,\u201d wrote Guitar Nine, \u201cbut sounds more jazz oriented and funky than other Dixie Dregs recordings.\u201d While Stewart Levine\u2019s background in jazz made him a good fit as producer, the band was somewhat disappointed with the album\u2019s sound. Before recording What If in 1978, Mark Parish replaced Davidowski on keyboards and Ken Scott was brought on board as producer. Scott had worked with Mahavishnu Orchestra and Jeff Beck, and his hands-off approach went over well with the band. What If pleased the critics: \u201cThis is music without labels,\u201d wrote Daniel Gioffre of All Music Guide, \u201cemotional and logical at the same time, passionately played and immaculately conceived.\u201d Music-Hound Rock agreed: \u201cWith its funky, shifting tempos on Ice Cakes\u2019; a country, funk grin on \u2018Ginia Lola Breakdown\u2019; and the sweeping \u2018Night Meets Light\u2026,\u2019\u201d wrote McCarty, \u201cthe Dregs flex an impressive amount of creative muscle.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s growing reputation led to an invitation to the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1978. Although they were well received, they felt a certain amount of pressure: this was their first European show and the live tracks would be used for an upcoming album. Scott also produced Night of the Living Dregs, combining the live material with studio tracks for the 1979 release. Tragedy struck that year, however, when road manager and mentor Lyndon was killed in a skydiving accident. As a manager, Lyndon had kept the band disciplined and focused, and his loss signaled a new phase for the band. They switched to Arista Records in 1980, shortened their name to the Dregs, and added an old Miami schoolmate, T. Lavitz, to replace Parrish on the keyboards.\n\nMembers include Stephen Davidowski (left group, 1977), keyboards; T. Lavitz (joined group, 1978), keyboards; Rod Morgenstein, drums; Steve Morse, guitar; Mark O\u2019Connor (joined group, 1981), violin; Mark Parrish (left group, 1977), keyboards; Allen Sloan (left group, 1980), violin; Andy West, bass.\n\nGroup formed in Miami, FL, recording debut The Great Spectacular for a class project at the University of Miami School of Music, 1975; relocated to Augusta after graduation, performed throughout the South; signed with Capricorn Records after opening for Sea Level, 1976; keyboard player Mark Parrish replaced Stephen Davidowski for group\u2019s official debut, Free Fall, 1977; received critical praise for follow-up album, What If, 1978; issued Night of the Living Dregs, featuring live excerpts, 1979; signed to Arista Records, changed name to the Dregs, 1980; recorded Dregs of the Earth, 1980; Unsung Heroes, 1981; added violinist Mark O\u2019Connor for Industry Standard, 1982; group disbanded for six years before reuniting briefly, 1988; reunited, 1992; recorded Bring \u2018em Back Alive, 1992; Full Circle, 1994; and California Screamin\u2019, 2000.\n\nAddresses: Record company \u2014Arista Records, 6 West 57th St., New York, NY 10019, phone: (212) 489-7400, website: http://www.aristarec.com.\n\nWhile the group had a steady following, sales rarely exceeded 100,000 copies. Steve Morse decided to save money by sitting in the producer\u2019s chair for the next three albums, Dregs of the Earth in 1980, Unsung Heroes in 1981, and Industry Standard in 1982. The latter broadened the band\u2019s eclectic style still further with fiddler Mark O\u2019Connor replacing Sloan. \u201cThis incarnation of the band is actually the strongest one musician-wise,\u201d writes Daniel Gioffre of All Music Guide, \u201cwith master fiddler Mark O\u2019Connor\u2026 making strong solo and ensemble statements.\u201d In an effort to please their record company, two tracks on Industry Standard included vocals by Patrick Simmons of the Doobie Brothers and Alex Ligertwood, an ex-Santana member. These changes, however, failed to increase record sales and even alienated some longtime fans. Overworked and mired in management difficulties, the band decided to call it quits after playing a New Year\u2019s Eve show in 1982.\n\nWhile the band occasionally regrouped for performances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they waited until 1994 for a new studio album. \u201cThe stars lined up and the eclipse happened,\u201d manager Frank Solomon told Amusement Business. \u201cThe guys had remained good friends even though they split up to see what else they could do [individually].\u201d Interestingly, Capricorn, the group\u2019s original label, issued both Bring \u2018em Back Alive, an album of live material culled from an earlier tour in 1992, and 1994\u2019s Full Circle. The band also changed its name back to the Dixie Dregs.\n\nIn 2000 the band recorded California Screamin\u2019, something of a reunion that featured past and present members of the band. \u201cThey may not record in the studio very often any more,\u201d wrote Bill Meredith of All Music Guide, \u201cbut CDs like California Screamin\u2019 do what live albums are supposed to\u2014make you remember the event if you were there, and wish you\u2019d been there if you weren\u2019t.\u201d With new recordings, Grammy Award nominations, and live performances, the Dixie Dregs continue to build on their legacy as one of the top jazz-fusion outfits.\n\nFree Fall, Polydor, 1977.\n\nWhat If, Polydor, 1978.\n\nNight of the Living Dregs, Polydor, 1979.\n\nDregs of the Earth, Arista, 1980.\n\nUnsung Heroes, Arista, 1981.\n\nIndustry Standard, Arista, 1982.\n\nBring \u2018em Back Alive, Capricorn, 1992.\n\nFull Circle, Capricorn, 1994.\n\nCalifornia Screamin\u2019, Zebra, 2000.\n\nBooks\n\nFerguson, Jim, editor, The Guitar Player Book, GPI Publications, 1983.\n\nGraff, Gary, and Daniel Durchholz, editors, MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide, Visible Ink Press, 1996.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nAmusement Business, July 11, 1994, p. 6.\n\nOnline\n\nAll Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com (December 7, 2001).\n\n\u201cDixie Dregs \u2018Freefall,\u2019\u201d Guitar Nine, http://www.guitar9.com (December 7, 2001).\n\n\u2014Ronnie D.

There has been a buzz going around the Augusta area ever since this show was announced last year. Everybody was excited to see the hometown band return back to the city that started it all.\n\nThis is the first time in 40 years that the original band \u2013 Steve Morse (guitar) [Interview with Morse], Andy West (bass), Allen Sloan (violin), Steve Davidowski (keyboards) and Rod Morgenstein (drums) \u2013 have all toured together. This was the third show of the \u201cDawn Of The Dregs\u201d Tour. They are currently scheduled for about 35 dates through the end of April.\n\nBefore the show, audience members could be seen reminiscing about growing up with the Dixie Dregs\u2019 music and members.\n\nThe stage was set with a simple backdrop with \u201cDREGS\u201d across it as the members walked onto the stage. They immediately started with \u201cDivided We Stand\u201d and \u201cFree Fall.\u201d\n\nMorse, wearing his signature sleeveless shirt, blazed away with his signature blue guitar. Sloan and Morse harmonized their respective instruments all night long to showcase the Dregs\u2019 signature sound.\n\nWest, the band\u2019s mouthpiece for the night, said, \u201cThis is quite a celebration for probably all of us \u2014 having so much history here in Augusta.\u201d West then dedicated the next song, \u201cTwiggs Approved,\u201d to their late manager Twiggs Lyndon.\n\nMorse had the phase shifter in full effect for \u201cTake It Off The Top,\u201d from 1978\u2019s \u201cWhat If\u201d album. They closed the first set out with \u201cMoe Down\u201d and the epic, elaborate tune \u201cOdyssey.\u201d\n\nSloan, a medical doctor, came out after the break and proudly said that he went to the nearby Medical College of Georgia and is currently practicing in the area (North Augusta). He pointed out that his staff was in attendance and they all had \u201cI\u2019m with the violinist\u201d shirts on. Sloan then went into a solo violin piece he wrote for his daughter, Rachel.\n\nMorse came out and performed an acoustic piece with Sloan called \u201cNorthern Lights.\u201d West and Davidowski came back out for \u201cGo For Baroque.\u201d It sounded just like the title says. West later explained that since the band performs all instrumentals, the song titles are the only way to convey lyrics to the listener.\n\nWest said that this was a special evening because they were going to bring out some former members of Dixie Grit, which predates the Dixie Dregs. Frank Brittingham, guitar, and Johnny Carr, keyboards, came out for \u201cThe Great Spectacular.\u201d\n\nMorse put the wah-wah pedal in full effect for the beginning of \u201cRefried Funky Chicken.\u201d Davidowski got to jam on the keyboards near the end of the song.\n\n\u201cThe Bash,\u201d a foot-stomping tune, was featured. It was a hoedown with a shade of \u201cRocky Top\u201d melded in. They closed the set out with the driving rhythm \u201cCruise Control,\u201d where Morgenstein got a chance to perform a killer drum solo.\n\nFor the encore, they came back out and played the rocking \u201cBloodsucking Leeches.\u201d\n\nThe Dixie Dregs have a hard to explain sound. They are fusing rock with progressive and jazz elements all rolled into one. They never made it into mainstream because they were so unique. But they do have a long lasting legacy thanks to their cult following. Every time they get together, it is special. And when the original band reunites and makes a stop in a place that started it all, Augusta, then it is extra special."}], "Rod Morgenstein moved to Atlanta, Georgia after graduating from the Berklee College of Music in 1981.": [{"url": "https://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Rod_Morgenstein.html", "page_content": "Rod\u2019s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan. The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dreg\u2019s music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\n\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possible the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\n\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beack, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\n\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\n\n\nAnd so, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band\n\n\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. And offshoot of Platypus is Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their first release is due out in 2001.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Premier Percussion (Rod Morgenstein Signature Drumheads), Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been and endorser for many, many years.\n\n\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "http://rodmorgenstein.com/about.html", "page_content": "ABOUT ROD\n\nRod\u0092s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan.

Rod remembers, \u0093One of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u0094\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u0093I was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u0094\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u0093Kip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u0092d be interested in doing the record.\u0094\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u0092s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u0092s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u0093small in numbers yet mighty in sound\u0094 band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u0092s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years."}, {"url": "https://online.berklee.edu/faculty/rod-morgenstein", "page_content": "Berklee Online is the online school of Berklee College of Music, delivering access to Berklee\u2019s acclaimed curriculum from anywhere in the world.

The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dreg\u2019s music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll.

I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beack, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nAnd so, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. And offshoot of Platypus is Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their first release is due out in 2001.\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Premier Percussion (Rod Morgenstein Signature Drumheads), Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been and endorser for many, many years.\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about\n\nthe drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.musictimes.com/articles/84582/20220419/rod-morgenstein-now-2022-age-net-worth-current-work-winger.htm", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein is turning 69 years old today!

Rod\u2019s professional career began in 1975 while he was still a student at the University of Miami, which is where a nascent Dregs\u2014known at the time as Rock Ensemble II of the Studio Music and Jazz curriculum\u2014honed their skills and recorded their album The Great Spectacular (released on CD in 1997). When the band temporarily disbanded in 1983, Morgenstein joined fellow Dreg Steve Morse to form the Steve Morse Band, with whom the drummer recorded two albums.\n\nIn 1986 Morgenstein moved to New York City and soon met singer/bassist Kip Winger and guitarist Reb Beach. Winger\u2019s self-titled 1988 release went platinum in the U.S. and led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. Follow-up In The Heart Of The Young also went platinum. Although the group disbanded in 1993, they have since reunited on several occasions. Morgenstein also appeared on Kip Winger\u2019s solo albums This Conversation Feels Like A Dream (1997) and Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001).

I don\u2019t think a more positive, \u2018life is beautiful\u2019 human being has ever graced this planet of ours. She truly was 'salt of the earth'. Along with my dad, Mel, her soulmate for 84 years, my mom lived a truly happy, content, and fulfilling life. Making it to the tender young age of 97 is a gift unto itself. Clearly, I got my musical abilities from her, as my dad was a clap-on-beats 1 and 3 kind of guy, but she was, instinctively, a backbeat girl, feeling the groove on where it\u2019s supposed to be experienced - beats 2 and 4! This has been a trying year, having experienced so much loss. But, in the end, folks like my mom have instilled in me the belief that there is always a bright side of life to not only dwell on, but to embrace wholeheartedly. 7-13-2020 Hey Everybody,Rod here. After 45 years of amassing an enormous collection of drum sets, snare drums, cymbals, percussion, Winger clothing (from the good ole days), tour laminates, itineraries, posters and awards, drumheads, drumsticks, assorted hardware, and other mementos, I have decided to part with a tremendous amount of these items. Three of the major items I am parting with are drum sets from\u2013 The Dixie Dregs, \u2018Bring \u2018Em Back Alive\u2019, live recording (from The Center Stage in Atlanta, GA in early \u201992) and tour, including an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in December 1992 The 2002 \u2018Hollyweird Summer Tour\u2019 featuring Poison, Cinderella, Winger and Faster Pussycat, plus a Winger tour that followed in the fall of \u201802 The drum set used on several Dixie Dregs tours from the late \u201890\u2019s through 2007\n\nRod It has been an amazing trip down memory lane sorting through hundreds of possessions, each one triggering a smile, a story, or an unforgettable memory I will cherish forever. If you are interested in checking out some of these items, you can contact my friend and fellow drummer, Ed Tucker, at Studio 3T studio3t@icloud.com Or join Ed\u2019s Facebook group: Vintage Drum Collectors & Players.

It has been, and continues to be, an incredible ride.Rock On!Rod 6-6-2020\n\n\n\nI was shocked and saddened this week to learn that my friend and Dixie Dregs drum tech and monitor ace, Skoots Lyndon, passed away. Skoots was the consummate band mate, always seeking perfection in everything he did. He was an extremely kind and generous human being, periodically checking in on me to see how my parents are doing and how life, in general is faring. He also happened to be one of the best storytellers who ever graced our planet. His years of touring the globe with Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, and numerous other acts, created a vast library of colorful stories; truly amazing stories that only a wordsmith like Skoots could impart to an audience lucky enough to be in his presence. My memory is filled with moments like these, where I would be hanging on every word, completely engrossed, often in stitches, for hours on end. RIP Skoots. Your memory will live on in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate to have you in our live 4-26-2020 WINGER - Better Days Comin' - All-Star\n\n4-12-2020 \u2018Hi, this is Mel, how can I help you?\u2019 For years, these were the first words my dad would speak upon answering the phone. I think this phrase pretty much sums up the kind of person he was; always wanting to lend a helping hand in any way he could. My dad passed away yesterday and, almost immediately, the memories of an extraordinary life began flooding my brain. He was a professor by trade, having taught at a handful of colleges and universities in New York, including Columbia University. He would often comment that he never felt like he worked a day in his life, as his love of teaching and being among young, talented, motivated students inspired him to no end. At the age of 10, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show along with my parents and sister, Carol, I knew then and there what I wanted to be when I grew up. From that day on, and continuing to this day, my parents have been my most ardent supporters, having attended nearly every single New York area concert I have played since 1976, be it with Winger, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, Rudess Morgenstein Project, The Jelly Jam, Jazz Is Dead, drum clinics and festivals, you name it. The last show they attended was the Dixie Dregs reunion concert at The Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY on March 15, 2018. After a recent hospital stay, an attendant came into the room with the wheelchair to escort my dad out of the building. I introduced myself to him, and he immediately reminded me that he knew who I was, having helped me a few years ago when I was being treated in the hospital\u2019s ER for kidney stones. He also told me he was a guitarist, a major Dixie Dregs fan, and had seen the Dregs every single time we have played on Long Island since the \u201870\u2019s. I then introduced him to my dad, to which he replied, \u2018What, are you kidding, I know your dad, and I also know your mom. Every Dixie Dregs fan on Long Island knows them. They\u2019re just as famous as the band members, because every Dregs fan who has come to your shows these past 40+ years sees your parents every single time. He then proceeded to tell me exactly where they were sitting at The Paramount Theater concert two years ago! My dad has been an inspiration to me, and many of my friends, for a lifetime. In fact, quite a few of my friends have told me that he has been a role model, playing a major part in how they try to live their lives. I am forever grateful to have had him in my life. The floodgates have opened, and the countless, beautiful memories of this amazingly special man, my dad, are everywhere I look\u2026 1-10-20 Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of Rush. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil\u2019s zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many divergent paths. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when The Steve Morse Band toured with Rush as their opening act on the band\u2019s Power Windows Tour. Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on Rush\u2019s \u201885/\u201986 \u2018Power Windows Tour\u2019 would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for Rush\u2019s sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band\u2019s two-hour concert. After the concert, Neil would usually hang for a short time before excusing himself to go to the band\u2019s tour bus, to work on one of his future literary creations. Sometime during this same time period, when he had some time off from touring, Neil flew to China, where he met up with a handful of bicycling enthusiasts for a 3-week journey through remote parts of the country. With pad and pen in hand (at the time, Neil felt that a camera interfered with the creative process) he would jot down highlights of the day\u2019s experiences, which eventually culminated in one of his first literary works entitled, \u2018Riding The Golden Lion\u2019. In addition to the writing portion of this 39-page journal/book, Neil was involved in every step of the process in putting the book together, including choosing the cover art, font, page color and thickness, etc. I believe it was the first outing in what would become a passion of his, eventually authoring several critically acclaimed books. On the very last day off of The Steve Morse Band\u2019s final leg of the Rush Power Windows Tour Neil, Alex, and Geddy took our band to an exotic restaurant for a memorable band dinner. Sitting cross-legged on pillows on the floor, in our very own private room, sans silverware, we dined on an incredible feast of delicacies using only our fingers. Alex, a wine expert and connoisseur, made sure the nectar of the Gods was flowing. So, there I am sitting next to Neil, chit-chatting while trying to think of something interesting and stimulating to say to this sophisticated, worldly, well-traveled man. Neil beat me to the punch, turning to me and posing the question, \u2018So Rod, have you ever considered the effects of climate on the development of Western Civilization?\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, sums up the ever-inquisitive Neil Peart, always seeking knowledge and new experiences, never happy with the status quo. He is the textbook definition of \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019, seizing every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, sailing, cross-country skiing, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man. RIP Neil. 11/2/19 Hey Everybody, I am part of a very cool project, called The Road Crew, with Billy Sheehan on bass and some very talented musicians from my area. We are performing our first, and at the moment our only, concert on Long Island on December 18. Also on the bill will be Zebra guitarist/vocalist Randy Jackson. The Road Crew came about as a result of the tragic loss of a young child, who was run down in his front yard by someone who was texting while driving. This innocent, precious child, Rocco Cangemi, is the inspiration for his father, Joe Cangemi, putting The Road Crew together. Hope to see you there. 9/10/19\n\nDetroit Drummers Day featuring Rod\n\nSunday 9/15 @ The Token Lounge \u00b7 Westland, Michigan 7/25/17 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The original lineup of instrumental masters the Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in 2018.

Hopefully, it will be completed and released by the end of the year or early 2010.\n\n\n\nSoon to be released from Sonic Reality is The Ken Scott Collection, a series of drum loops by 5 of the drummers Ken Scott has worked with including myself, Billy Cobham, Terry Bozzio, Woody Woodmansey, and Bob Siegerman. Ken's discography reads like a who's who of the recording industry, having been head engineer on the Beatle's White Album, and engineer/producer of such artists as David Bowie, Supertramp, Dixie Dregs and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Further info on this collection can be found at www.sonicreality.com/kenscottcollection.php\n\n\n\nI recently completed my 12th year at Berklee College of Music. The musical talent just seems to be getting better and better every year!!!\n\n\n\nHave a great summer.......... 7/1/08 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nIt's been a while........\n\n\n\nRecently, I was in California recording with legendary producer Ken Scott as part of a massive drum library project for Sonic Reality. Ken chose 6 drummers he has worked with including Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie), Bob Seibenberg (Supertramp), and Nigel Olson (Elton John). Ken engineered and produced two classic Dixie Dregs records, 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs'. His bio reads like a Who's Who of the record biz--The Beatles, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Missing Persons, David Bowie, Supertramp, Elton John, and Stanley Clarke to name a few. The drum library collection, which focuses on recreating the analog drum sounds from the 70's, will also feature a book on Ken's life and his ground-breaking engineering and recording techniques. The release date is scheduled for early 2009.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead guitarist, Jeff Pevar, is in the studio mixing the new Jazz Is Dead cd, finally! This recording will be, believe it or not, the first studio cd in the band's history. Look for the release in the latter part of this year or early 2009.\n\n\n\nWinger toured the US this past Feb/March, and is looking into touring South America this fall. Concert dates will be posted once they are confirmed. ALthough Winger has toured in nearly 25 countries, this will be the band's first tour in SA.\n\n\n\nRudess Morgenstein Project will play in Poland this October as part of the Percussion Festival in Opole, Poland. In addition to each of us performing a clinic, we will play several concerts. Info will be posted when the dates are officially set.\n\n\n\nI have been recording a cd with a phenomenal pianist by the name of Rob Apostle. Rob's music is an incredible blend of classical, jazz, and fusion music. Deceptively simple, this music will touch both musician and non-musician on a very deep and emotional level. No release date is set yet as it is in its early stages. I'll keep you posted as the project nears completion.\n\n\n\nMid-May completed my 11th year teaching at Berklee College of Music. What began in September 1997, filling in for a teacher who went off on a year's Sabbatical leave, has blossomed into an integral and very rewarding part of my professional music career. Also, midway through the semester I became a full professor. I wish to thank my incredible students for always continuing to inspire me.\n\n\n\nHave a COOL, wonderful summer............ 12/9/07 - update from Rod Japan and Australia were amazing! It's been way too long since WINGER played in Japan. The last time were toured there was for the PULL tour in '93. Sold out shows in Tokyo and Yokohama and awesome crowds in Osaka and Nagoya brought back so many great memories of touring in the good ole days! The trip to Australia was our first and I'm sure we'll be back, as the crowds were really enthusiastic there, too. We had a blast touring with Ratt for the 2 weeks, and got to hang out a bunch with those guys. All I can say is it was a TON OF FUN!!!\n\n\n\nWINGER 'LIVE' was just released on Frontiers Records and is available in both dvd and cd. The concert was filmed at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA in March '07 and the reviews have been fantastic.\n\n\n\nMONSTER BALLADS XMAS was just released on Razor and Tie Records. 15 rock/metal artists each contributed a tune. WINGER did a cool version of John Lennon's Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Other bands include Queensryche, Dokken, Skid Row, Twisted Sister, Danger Danger, and Firehouse.\n\n\n\nWINGER will be touring the US in Feb/Mar '08. Tour dates will be posted shortly. Hope to see ya'll there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, and every other holiday which occurs this time of year. See you on tour next year!!!\n\n10/5/07 - update from Rod Hey All, Look for the new Winger 'Live' dvd/cd coming out in November. It was flimed this past March at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA, and is Winger's first live recording ever! Remember 'Monster Ballads', the cd which featured ballads from all the metal bands from the good ole days? Well, here comes 'Monster Ballads Xmas' this November, featuring Christmas songs by lots of the same bands. Winger covers the John Lennon song, 'Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Also in November, Winger is touring in Japan and Australia with Ratt. It will be our first time back to Japan since the Pull tour in '93. And it will be our very first trip to Australia. My last\n\ntime in the 'land down under' was in '94 for a drum clinic tour which took me to both Australia and New Zealand. What a magnificent part of the world! The Dixie Dregs are in the process of setting up gigs for the new year. As soon as dates are confirmed they will go\n\nup on my 'In Concert' page. Jazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of our first stdio cd. No release date yet, but I'll keep you posted. 9/7/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Berklee fall semester is just around the corner, and so next Monday I'll be off and running to Boston to meet this year's crop of amazing students. This semester begins my 11th year teaching at the college.\n\n\n\nWinger played a handful of gigs this summer, the most memorable being The Rocklahoma fest in Pryor, Oklahoma, a 3 day non-stop 70's/80's trip down memory lane with the likes of Skid Row, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Warrant, Dokken, Vince Neil, Poison, Firehouse, Quiet Riot, Enuff's Enuff, Queensryche and a ton of other bands. It was very cool catching up with musicians I haven't seen in years. We were told in excess of 60,000 tix were sold for the event. We're playing in Las Vegas in October and then touring with Ratt in Japan and Australia in November. Check my 'In Concert' page in the next couple of weeks for details.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead played a one-off at Berklee back in July. It's always a blast walking out on stage and jamming to songs you haven't played in a long time. Being on the edge of your seat as a musician stirs the creative side of things in really interesting ways. Our new cd is being mixed at the moment and should be released later this year.\n\n\n\nI played drums on Jordan Rudess' very cool new cd, 'The Road Home', which will be released September 12 on Magna Carta Records. This one's a 'cover' album, with Jordan paying homage to the bands which influenced him as an aspiring musician. Included are songs by Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Gentle Giant, and Genesis. As is always the case when I work with Jordan, this was a very challenging recording! Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined CalProg in Whittier, CA back in May. When time permits, Jordan and I will try to get back to finishing up the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd which we've been working on for the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nSee ya..................... 4/20/07 - update from Rod Life has been a whirlwind since the new year began. First, the Dixie Dregs toured out west in January. While in southern\n\nCalifornia, I raced to the NAMM show in Anaheim during the day to play with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth. For those performances I played on Roland's V-Drums, an amazing electronic drumset which I have future plans of incorporating them into my acoustic Premier kit. From the NAMM show I had to race to another town to play with the Dregs that evening. Nothing like multiple gigs in one day! On a sad note, the Dixie Dregs tour was cut short when sudden news arrived of Steve Morse's dad falling into a coma. Steve raced back to his home in Florida to be by his dad's side, who sadly passed away later that day. Steve's and my friendship goes back many years. I knew his dad, a brilliant man who will be missed by all whose lives he touched. February 1 was the start of a 5+ week Winger tour in support of the new Winger 4 cd. Crowds were considerably larger than anyone anticipated and we all had an amazing time together. There will be some summer touring, so just check my 'In Concert' page periodically. The Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined Baja Prog '07 in Mexicali, Mexico this past March. 1300 seats were filled to capacity each of 4 nights at this amazing festival. Bands and aficionados of progressive rock music come from all over the world for this event. From there Jordan and I travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to play at the Music Messe for Roland. And then we played a concert in London, also for Roland, and once again on the V Drums. In a few weeks Jordan and I will headline CalProg '07, a prog festival in Whittier, California. Also, around this time, I'll be recording with Jordan for his new solo record which will be out later this year. And we're hoping that, time permitting, we can make more headway on the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. The new Jazz Is Dead cd is at the mixing stages and will be completed in the next couple of months. I have heard the rough mixes and this is by far the coolest JID recording since the band's inception. Three weeks left to the Berklee semester. it's been a crazy semester with all my touring. But I tip my hat to my students, who waited patiently until I got back to town. And I've been spending extra days making up for the days I missed earlier in the semester. I truly have some incredible drummers this year. I'm certain I will see them out there doing it Big Time in the coming years! See ya......... 1/8/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody, Happy New Year. WInger played New Years Eve in Pittsburgh, PA....... OUTDOORS in the pouring rain to a couple thousand diehard fans! We were all soaking wet, and I mean completely drenched. All in all it was a ton of fun. Feb 1 Winger begins a 5 week US tour which will take us all around the country. We'll be mixing it up with stuff from the new cd, Winger 4, and of course, all the tunes from the good ole days. The Dixie Dregs begin touring next week out west which will take us through Colorado, Utah, California, and Arizona. While in southern CA, I'll be racing to the NAMM show to jam with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth.\n\n\n\nAll concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Immediatley following the Dregs tour I will fly directly to Boston to begin the spring '07 semester at Berklee College of Music. I always look forward to meeting a new crop of talented, eager students. 9/19/06 - update from Rod Lots going on since we last 'chatted'. The first new Winger cd in 13 years , Winger IV, is slated for release October 20 in Europe on Frontiers Records, Japan on King Records, with a US release to follow shortly thereafter on Shrapnel Records. The recording is a natural progression from 'Pull', which came out in '93. Kip produced the recording, which sounds HUGE! The band will tour Europe in October in support of the cd. Concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Audio clips can be heard at www.myspace.com/kipwingermusic Also, we're setting up a winger myspace page which should be up soon... The Rudess Morgenstein Project played in Caracas, Venezuela and San Jose, Costa Rica back in May. Jordan and I had a blast doing these shows, as they were our first gigs south of the border. The energy of the fans was unbelievable! In Venezuela, we played with Angra, a fantastic band from Brazil, and we spent a good bit of time hanging with them. In Costa Rica, we were the only band on the bill, and so our show was much longer than anything we've done in the past. We did a fair amount of jamming, which inspired us to take that approach on some of the new RPM cd, which is moving along nicely. We will be playing the Baja Progfest in Mexico in March, and are talking to other south American promoters about doing shows in some other countries. Jordan is also working on his next solo cd. I will cut drum tracks for some of this recording sometime before the end of the year. The Dixie Dregs will be touring the west coast in January. Look for tour dates on the 'In Concert' page in the next few weeks. Jazz Is Dead is in the mixing stages of a new cd. Even though it will be the band's fourth release, it actually will be our very first studio recording. All the other cds were live recordings. The Berklee fall semester began last week. After a year of living the life of nomads without 'homes', due to problems with the basement area of the building we taught in, the percussion faculty are quite comfortable in our brand new, sound proofed, incredible facility. Should be a great semester. 9/16/06 - from Rod It has been quite some time since I have posted updates on my site. For those of you who may not be aware, my wife, Michele, passed away this past December. Michele was a warrior's warrior during a 22 year journey battling breast cancer. The vast majority of people in our life knew little or nothing of her condition. She chose to keep it a quiet affair so she would not have it be front and center in every aspect of her daily life. It allowed her to lead a relatively normal life and not be known as 'Michele with breast cancer'. As painfully difficult as living with cancer can be at times, our life together was nothing short of perfection. We learned to smell the roses years ago. There are no regrets, as we told each other how deeply we loved each other virtually every day of our lives. Michele was my childhood sweetheart, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate. I miss her more than anyone can imagine. Thank you to everyone for your e-mails, letters and phone calls which have offered me some level of comfort during this very difficult time. I wish you all happiness and good health. Rod\n\n5/2/05 - Update from Rod The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was awesome, covering 18 cities in 19 days. Travelling highlights included driving through a surprise spring blizzard with virtually NO visiability in the middle of the night after jamming in Cleveland! Ah, the exciting life of a touring musician. Progress continues on the new Jazz Is Dead cd. Luis Conte has added amazing percussion to several tracks and we're hoping to get a few more folks to play on this one. Winger is still looking into a fall tour to record a live dvd and possible\n\nstudio cd. I'm getting ready to do some recording with Marc Muller who has been playing pedal steel and guitar with Shania Twain for the last 10 years. We're also involved in co-writing songs. The Berklee spring semester comes to a close this week and, as always, I've had a great bunch of students who never cease to amaze me.\n\n1/29/05 - Update from Rod Just got home from the Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band west coast tour. As always, it was a lot of fun jamming with my band mates of many years. Steve Morse band drummer Van Romaine and I worked out a two-man drum solo (guess you call that a drum duo)which was really a blast to perform. Looks like we'll be doing an east coast run in mid-March, from Florida all the way up through Chicago, so check my concert calendar in a couple of weeks for tour dates. Winger is discussing the possibility of a live dvd which would involve a week or two of concerts, possibly in May or June. Stay posted for details. The Berklee College of Music spring semester has begun and, as always, I have a wonderful group of students. 9/25/04 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nWell, believe it or not, after nearly 3 years since we first began work on it, The Jelly Jam 2 was just released. We are really beginning to sound like a band! Now we're looking at all of our schedules to see if we can do some live 'Jelly Jamming' in the next few months. I'll keep you posted. If you can't find Jelly Jam 2 in a cd shop, you can go to InsideOutMusic.com to read all about it and get purchase info. Jordan Rudess' new cd, 'Rhythm of Time', was released recently on Magna Carta Records. Like I had said a while back this recording was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and rewarding recordings of my career. The Dixie Dregs will be gearing up for a west coast tour in January. Tour dates will be available on my concert calendar in the next several weeks. We're already 4 weeks into the 2004 fall semester at Berklee College of Music and, as always, I have a great bunch of students. This time around there seem to be several who are into many of the classic rock and fusion bands and drummers, which is totally fine by me. It's right up my alley. Hope you all have an enjoyable fall season....... 7/23/04 - Update from Rod\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Rudess Morgenstein Project will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center at BerkleeCollege of Music in Boston on Thursday, August 5 at 8:15 PM. We will be playing classic RPM tunes as well as music from Jordan's soon-to-be released solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time'. Ty Tabor has completed mixing The Jelly Jam 2 and it is now in the hands of Inside Out Records. I'll keep you all posted regarding the release date. Kip Winger is putting some finishing touches on the recording I did with him and Turkish producer/guitarist Cenk Eroglu earlier this year, and getting ready to shop it for a deal. The recording with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar was incredible. The jam band concept is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my 30+ years as a musician. We need to record a couple more tracks to have a full length cd, so we'll probably get together in the fall to complete it. I'm in the midst of Berklee's 5 week summer program and having a blast with my roughly 75 students. It's amazing how many talented young musicians there are out there! 4/17/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, Kip is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey to finish recording and mix several tunes on his current project with Cenk Eroglu. Talk about a fresh, new killer sound, this is it!\n\n\n\nI just got back from Illinois for a week of recording with\n\nguitarist/keyboardist Brian Moritz and his band Balance. Dave LaRue (Dixie Dregs) played bass, with Joel Kaplan on keyboards and Vince Claps on vocals. With the exception of Dave and I, all these guys have been very active in the Chicago music scene for many years. The recording was engineered by Brian Mitchell, who lives a double life as a forensic pathologist! All in all, it was quite an experience. I'll update you as the recording progresses.\n\n\n\nI'm on my way to meet up with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar in\n\nHartford, CT to record for several days on both Jeff's solo cd and some jam band oriented stuff.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I return from CT, I'll be getting together with Jordan Rudess to pick up where he and I left off with the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. We're looking into the possibility of playing some gigs later this year.\n\n\n\nThe release of Jordan's solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is August 31 on Magna Carta Records.\n\n\n\nWell, yet another Berklee school year has come to a close. I guarantee that somewhere in the future you will see some of these students realizing their musical dreams!\n\n\n\nHave a HOT summer.................... 3/19/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, I just spent the last several days in Nashville recording with Kip Winger. Over the past year, Kip has been making trips to Istanbul, Turkey where he has been writing and recording with Turkish artist/guitarist/producer Cenk Eroglu. The music is an incredible blend of east-meets-west sounds and rhythms, both traditional and high-tech. Kip and Cenk hope to finish it up in the next several months. I'll keep you posted. We're talking about the possibility of recording Winger Live In Concert along with a bunch of archival/ interview footage. Jordan Rudess' solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is set for release in July on Magna Carta Records. What an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience it always is, working with my friend Jordan. Among the guest artists appearing on the recording are Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Vinnie Moore and Greg Howe. Modern Drummer presents 'Drum Nation' was released in mid-January and includes drum performances by 14 drummers. Jordan Rudess played keys on my track 'Faceless Pastiche'. Other members of the cast include Steve Smith, Simon Phillips, Bill Bruford, Trilok Gurtu and Chad Wackerman, to name but a\n\nfew. I recorded a couple of tracks with Jeff Pevar on a solo recording he's working on. I met Jeff when he joined Jazz Is Dead in 2001. He is one of the most well-rounded, musical guitarists around. I recently went to see him perform with CPR, the band he has with David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young fame.) Jeff is the 'P' in CPR. A highlight of the evening for me was meeting David Crosby and having HIM say all these great things about the Dixie Dregs. I felt like a million bucks! Jelly Jam 2's completion is just around the corner, I promise........ Another snow has fallen, with more expected tonight. It sure has been a\n\nLOOOOOOONG Winter. 11/09/03 - Update from Rod Jordan Rudess is in the studio working on his next solo recording for Magna Carta. We're planning on doing drum tracks before the end of the year. January 13 is the Magna Carta release date for 'Modern Drummer Presents: Drum Nation Volume 1', an all-out drummers' cd featuring quite an interesting cast of players. Each participating drummer contributed one track; Jordan Rudess plays keyboards on my tune 'Faceless Pastiche'. Additional info about the cd can be found at Magna Carta'a website. I know it sounds like a broken record but Ty Tabor is planning on mixing The Jelly Jam's next cd before the end of this year, as soon as he gets off the current King's X tour. It seems like only yesterday that the semester began but the Berklee College of Music fall semester is already entering its 10th week. I have some very fine students this year and am sure to hear about them in years to come! 7/19/03 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nI've been meaning to post something ever since I got back from Europe last month. The clinic tour was an absolute blast! I played in 8 countries in 3 weeks and spent some time in the UK visiting Premier Percussion on a break in the middle of the clinic events. Thanks to everyone who came out, the turn-outs were fantastic, and I met so many wonderful drummers, Premier/Sabian/Vic Firth reps, music store personnel and other musicians. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in making these clinics first class events and I look forward to seeing all of you again somewhere down the road. I'm already full steam ahead in the Berklee College of Music 5 week program and have been teaching 11 different classes in addition to many private lessons. And I can say without hesitation that there are some VERY talented young people out there! I'm sure we'll be seeing quite a few of ya'll enrolled as Berklee College students in the years to come. Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, is putting the finishing touches on Jelly Jam 2, my project with him and John Myung, bassist with Dream Theater. Stay posted for a release date. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Talk to you in the fall. Rod 5/16/03 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody,\n\nI leave in a week for a 3 week European drum clinic tour for Premier and Sabian which will take me to some very cool places including, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Iceland, with a trip to the Premier Percussion complex in Leicester, UK thrown in for good measure. The clinics will feature the new line of Premier drums which were showcased at this year's NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA back in January. The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was a lot of fun, and as we didn't hit all of the usual east coast cities, hopefully we'll be able to put another run together this year. Ty tabor is hard at work on the next Jelly Jam recording. I'll keep you posted on a release date as soon as I hear something. And, as I've said before, we really want to tour for this one. Still waiting on a release date for the Magna Carta drummers cd. I played in a very cool blues concert last weekend at the West Hampton Performing Arts Center with Frank Latorre and The King Bees. Frank, an incredible harmonica player, played the harp on Winger's 'Down incognito' on PULL back in '93. The band also featured Richie Cannata of Billy Joel fame and 3 of Frank's longtime buddies- Doug, Paul and Paul who play guitar, bass and guitar respectively. I hope to do some more playing with these guys in the future. Jordan Rudess and I played during Berklee College's Percussion week back in April and the turn out was overwhelming. Thanks for all your support. Some day, I promise, we'll get the next studio cd released. We have interested parties in Puerto Rico and Finland wanting to bring us over to jam. So we're looking into getting it together. Well, another year at Berklee has come to a close and, as always, I had a wonderful time teaching so many talented drummer/musicians. I'll be teaching the 5 Week Summer program beginning the second week in July, so if you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hey. 2/21/03 - Update from Rod Hey everybody.\n\nThe January west coast Dixie Dregs tour was fantastic. The timing enabled us to spend some time at the NAMM Music trade show in Anaheim. It's always a blast going to the show as you meet up with so many friends and acquaintances who you don't necessarily get to see that often.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in late April for an east coast run. Check my site in the coming weeks for concert info. I recently recorded a song for an upcoming 'drummers' cd which will be coming out on Magna Carta sometime in the spring. 10-15 drummers are each contributing a tune. As I understand it, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio and Steve Smith have already submitted their tracks. Should be quite a recording. Ty Tabor is hoping to put the final touches on the new Jelly Jam cd March/April. So, hopefully, it won't be too long after that before it is released by Inside Out Records. Until we meet again.......... 12/2/02 - Update from Rod The Dixie Dregs will be touring in CA, January 10 through the 19th. Check the concert calendar for specific dates. Thanks to everyone who came out to see Winger on the east coast this past October. As is always the case with these guys, it was a tremendous amount of fun both musically and just hanging with Kip, Paul, Reb, and John. Now we'll just have to see where it all leads... Jordan Rudess and I picked up where we left off last summer on our second RPM studio recording. It's awesome working together again with my power duo partner. We're hoping to get it done in the next few months for a 2003 release and some touring. Ty Tabor will put the finishing touches on the next Jelly Jam recording as soon as he gets home from the King's X/ Ronnie Dio tour later this month. The first Jelly Jam cd created a nice buzz at radio and so we're all looking forward to releasing this next one. John Myung, Ty and I are determined to tour with this band. Another semester at Berklee is fast coming to a close. As usual, I have a great bunch of students who continue to keep me on my toes. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you next year.\n\nRod 8/28/02 - Update from Rod Well, it looks like summer is almost over. Man it was a hot one! The Poison, Cinderella, Winger, Faster Pussycat tour was an incredible amount of fun. Being back with the guys was truly an amazing experience. Jamming with them was a blast and I don't think I've laughed this much in years. These people are so much fun to hang with. And it looks like we'll be hanging again, if but for only a short time. We're doing a string of east coast Winger shows beginning October 1. Check the Concert Calendar for the dates. These will be full length shows covering considerably more songs than we did on the Poison tour. We're looking into the possibility of doing some combination Dixie Dregs/ Jelly Jam shows later this year. I'll keep you posted. Jordan Rudess and I have been in communicado trying to nail down a time period to finish up our next studio recording which was begun last summer. I'll keep you abreast of that one, too. The Berklee College of Music fall semester begins shortly and I'm looking forward to meeting lots of new faces as well as the 'veterans'. See you all soon......\n\n5/2/02 - Update from Rod Hey everybody. Well, as you all know by now, Winger is back together and will be touring with Poison, Cinderella, and Faster Pussycat from mid-May through July. I must admit, the adrenaline is beginning to flow as the starting date approaches. This will be the first time we've played as a band live in nearly 9 years. A few Winger Only headline shows will be happening, too. For all tour dates click here. The Jelly Jam debut cd was released in the latter part of March and Ty and I have been doing a good amount of press and radio in support of it. We're hoping to do some touring with this project as soon as our schedules permit. John Myung is currently on tour with Dream Theater, and Ty is on the road with King's X. So, all three of us have our hands full at the moment. But we're determined to make The Jelly Jam a full-fledged, LIVE jamming band. This week was the last week of classes for the spring 2002 semester at Berklee College of Music. Finals are next week, after which I race back to New York to board a plane to Nashville for a week of Winger rehearsals. I had a fantastic group of students this year who really kept me on my toes. I'm sure I'll be seeing many of them in concert with their own bands in the years to come! Have a great summer and I hope to run in to some of you along the way.........

I don\u2019t think a more positive, \u2018life is beautiful\u2019 human being has ever graced this planet of ours. She truly was 'salt of the earth'. Along with my dad, Mel, her soulmate for 84 years, my mom lived a truly happy, content, and fulfilling life. Making it to the tender young age of 97 is a gift unto itself. Clearly, I got my musical abilities from her, as my dad was a clap-on-beats 1 and 3 kind of guy, but she was, instinctively, a backbeat girl, feeling the groove on where it\u2019s supposed to be experienced - beats 2 and 4! This has been a trying year, having experienced so much loss. But, in the end, folks like my mom have instilled in me the belief that there is always a bright side of life to not only dwell on, but to embrace wholeheartedly. 7-13-2020 Hey Everybody,Rod here. After 45 years of amassing an enormous collection of drum sets, snare drums, cymbals, percussion, Winger clothing (from the good ole days), tour laminates, itineraries, posters and awards, drumheads, drumsticks, assorted hardware, and other mementos, I have decided to part with a tremendous amount of these items. Three of the major items I am parting with are drum sets from\u2013 The Dixie Dregs, \u2018Bring \u2018Em Back Alive\u2019, live recording (from The Center Stage in Atlanta, GA in early \u201992) and tour, including an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in December 1992 The 2002 \u2018Hollyweird Summer Tour\u2019 featuring Poison, Cinderella, Winger and Faster Pussycat, plus a Winger tour that followed in the fall of \u201802 The drum set used on several Dixie Dregs tours from the late \u201890\u2019s through 2007\n\nRod It has been an amazing trip down memory lane sorting through hundreds of possessions, each one triggering a smile, a story, or an unforgettable memory I will cherish forever. If you are interested in checking out some of these items, you can contact my friend and fellow drummer, Ed Tucker, at Studio 3T studio3t@icloud.com Or join Ed\u2019s Facebook group: Vintage Drum Collectors & Players. Type in \u201cRod Mo\u201d in the question to join the group.It\u2019s gonna take awhile before each and every item is listed, so make sure to check in over the coming weeks to see what new things have been added.Thanks for all the great years. It has been, and continues to be, an incredible ride.Rock On!Rod 6-6-2020\n\n\n\nI was shocked and saddened this week to learn that my friend and Dixie Dregs drum tech and monitor ace, Skoots Lyndon, passed away. Skoots was the consummate band mate, always seeking perfection in everything he did. He was an extremely kind and generous human being, periodically checking in on me to see how my parents are doing and how life, in general is faring. He also happened to be one of the best storytellers who ever graced our planet. His years of touring the globe with Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, and numerous other acts, created a vast library of colorful stories; truly amazing stories that only a wordsmith like Skoots could impart to an audience lucky enough to be in his presence. My memory is filled with moments like these, where I would be hanging on every word, completely engrossed, often in stitches, for hours on end. RIP Skoots. Your memory will live on in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate to have you in our live 4-26-2020 WINGER - Better Days Comin' - All-Star\n\n4-12-2020 \u2018Hi, this is Mel, how can I help you?\u2019 For years, these were the first words my dad would speak upon answering the phone. I think this phrase pretty much sums up the kind of person he was; always wanting to lend a helping hand in any way he could. My dad passed away yesterday and, almost immediately, the memories of an extraordinary life began flooding my brain. He was a professor by trade, having taught at a handful of colleges and universities in New York, including Columbia University. He would often comment that he never felt like he worked a day in his life, as his love of teaching and being among young, talented, motivated students inspired him to no end. At the age of 10, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show along with my parents and sister, Carol, I knew then and there what I wanted to be when I grew up. From that day on, and continuing to this day, my parents have been my most ardent supporters, having attended nearly every single New York area concert I have played since 1976, be it with Winger, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, Rudess Morgenstein Project, The Jelly Jam, Jazz Is Dead, drum clinics and festivals, you name it. The last show they attended was the Dixie Dregs reunion concert at The Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY on March 15, 2018. After a recent hospital stay, an attendant came into the room with the wheelchair to escort my dad out of the building. I introduced myself to him, and he immediately reminded me that he knew who I was, having helped me a few years ago when I was being treated in the hospital\u2019s ER for kidney stones. He also told me he was a guitarist, a major Dixie Dregs fan, and had seen the Dregs every single time we have played on Long Island since the \u201870\u2019s. I then introduced him to my dad, to which he replied, \u2018What, are you kidding, I know your dad, and I also know your mom. Every Dixie Dregs fan on Long Island knows them. They\u2019re just as famous as the band members, because every Dregs fan who has come to your shows these past 40+ years sees your parents every single time. He then proceeded to tell me exactly where they were sitting at The Paramount Theater concert two years ago! My dad has been an inspiration to me, and many of my friends, for a lifetime. In fact, quite a few of my friends have told me that he has been a role model, playing a major part in how they try to live their lives. I am forever grateful to have had him in my life. The floodgates have opened, and the countless, beautiful memories of this amazingly special man, my dad, are everywhere I look\u2026 1-10-20 Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of Rush. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil\u2019s zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many divergent paths. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when The Steve Morse Band toured with Rush as their opening act on the band\u2019s Power Windows Tour. Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on Rush\u2019s \u201885/\u201986 \u2018Power Windows Tour\u2019 would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for Rush\u2019s sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band\u2019s two-hour concert. After the concert, Neil would usually hang for a short time before excusing himself to go to the band\u2019s tour bus, to work on one of his future literary creations. Sometime during this same time period, when he had some time off from touring, Neil flew to China, where he met up with a handful of bicycling enthusiasts for a 3-week journey through remote parts of the country. With pad and pen in hand (at the time, Neil felt that a camera interfered with the creative process) he would jot down highlights of the day\u2019s experiences, which eventually culminated in one of his first literary works entitled, \u2018Riding The Golden Lion\u2019. In addition to the writing portion of this 39-page journal/book, Neil was involved in every step of the process in putting the book together, including choosing the cover art, font, page color and thickness, etc. I believe it was the first outing in what would become a passion of his, eventually authoring several critically acclaimed books. On the very last day off of The Steve Morse Band\u2019s final leg of the Rush Power Windows Tour Neil, Alex, and Geddy took our band to an exotic restaurant for a memorable band dinner. Sitting cross-legged on pillows on the floor, in our very own private room, sans silverware, we dined on an incredible feast of delicacies using only our fingers. Alex, a wine expert and connoisseur, made sure the nectar of the Gods was flowing. So, there I am sitting next to Neil, chit-chatting while trying to think of something interesting and stimulating to say to this sophisticated, worldly, well-traveled man. Neil beat me to the punch, turning to me and posing the question, \u2018So Rod, have you ever considered the effects of climate on the development of Western Civilization?\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, sums up the ever-inquisitive Neil Peart, always seeking knowledge and new experiences, never happy with the status quo. He is the textbook definition of \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019, seizing every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, sailing, cross-country skiing, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man. RIP Neil. 11/2/19 Hey Everybody, I am part of a very cool project, called The Road Crew, with Billy Sheehan on bass and some very talented musicians from my area. We are performing our first, and at the moment our only, concert on Long Island on December 18. Also on the bill will be Zebra guitarist/vocalist Randy Jackson. The Road Crew came about as a result of the tragic loss of a young child, who was run down in his front yard by someone who was texting while driving. This innocent, precious child, Rocco Cangemi, is the inspiration for his father, Joe Cangemi, putting The Road Crew together. Hope to see you there. 9/10/19\n\nDetroit Drummers Day featuring Rod\n\nSunday 9/15 @ The Token Lounge \u00b7 Westland, Michigan 7/25/17 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The original lineup of instrumental masters the Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in 2018.

The vibe this time around is in-your-face, good old slammin' rock 'n roll.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of the band's first studio recording. Hopefully, it will be completed and released by the end of the year or early 2010.\n\n\n\nSoon to be released from Sonic Reality is The Ken Scott Collection, a series of drum loops by 5 of the drummers Ken Scott has worked with including myself, Billy Cobham, Terry Bozzio, Woody Woodmansey, and Bob Siegerman.

Further info on this collection can be found at www.sonicreality.com/kenscottcollection.php\n\n\n\nI recently completed my 12th year at Berklee College of Music.

Ken chose 6 drummers he has worked with including Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie), Bob Seibenberg (Supertramp), and Nigel Olson (Elton John). Ken engineered and produced two classic Dixie Dregs records, 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs'.

The drum library collection, which focuses on recreating the analog drum sounds from the 70's, will also feature a book on Ken's life and his ground-breaking engineering and recording techniques.

Look for the release in the latter part of this year or early 2009.\n\n\n\nWinger toured the US this past Feb/March, and is looking into touring South America this fall.

ALthough Winger has toured in nearly 25 countries, this will be the band's first tour in SA.\n\n\n\nRudess Morgenstein Project will play in Poland this October as part of the Percussion Festival in Opole, Poland. In addition to each of us performing a clinic, we will play several concerts. Info will be posted when the dates are officially set.\n\n\n\nI have been recording a cd with a phenomenal pianist by the name of Rob Apostle. Rob's music is an incredible blend of classical, jazz, and fusion music. Deceptively simple, this music will touch both musician and non-musician on a very deep and emotional level. No release date is set yet as it is in its early stages. I'll keep you posted as the project nears completion.\n\n\n\nMid-May completed my 11th year teaching at Berklee College of Music. What began in September 1997, filling in for a teacher who went off on a year's Sabbatical leave, has blossomed into an integral and very rewarding part of my professional music career. Also, midway through the semester I became a full professor. I wish to thank my incredible students for always continuing to inspire me.\n\n\n\nHave a COOL, wonderful summer............ 12/9/07 - update from Rod Japan and Australia were amazing! It's been way too long since WINGER played in Japan. The last time were toured there was for the PULL tour in '93. Sold out shows in Tokyo and Yokohama and awesome crowds in Osaka and Nagoya brought back so many great memories of touring in the good ole days! The trip to Australia was our first and I'm sure we'll be back, as the crowds were really enthusiastic there, too. We had a blast touring with Ratt for the 2 weeks, and got to hang out a bunch with those guys. All I can say is it was a TON OF FUN!!!\n\n\n\nWINGER 'LIVE' was just released on Frontiers Records and is available in both dvd and cd. The concert was filmed at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA in March '07 and the reviews have been fantastic.\n\n\n\nMONSTER BALLADS XMAS was just released on Razor and Tie Records. 15 rock/metal artists each contributed a tune. WINGER did a cool version of John Lennon's Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Other bands include Queensryche, Dokken, Skid Row, Twisted Sister, Danger Danger, and Firehouse.\n\n\n\nWINGER will be touring the US in Feb/Mar '08. Tour dates will be posted shortly. Hope to see ya'll there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, and every other holiday which occurs this time of year. See you on tour next year!!!\n\n10/5/07 - update from Rod Hey All, Look for the new Winger 'Live' dvd/cd coming out in November. It was flimed this past March at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA, and is Winger's first live recording ever! Remember 'Monster Ballads', the cd which featured ballads from all the metal bands from the good ole days? Well, here comes 'Monster Ballads Xmas' this November, featuring Christmas songs by lots of the same bands. Winger covers the John Lennon song, 'Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Also in November, Winger is touring in Japan and Australia with Ratt. It will be our first time back to Japan since the Pull tour in '93. And it will be our very first trip to Australia. My last\n\ntime in the 'land down under' was in '94 for a drum clinic tour which took me to both Australia and New Zealand. What a magnificent part of the world! The Dixie Dregs are in the process of setting up gigs for the new year. As soon as dates are confirmed they will go\n\nup on my 'In Concert' page. Jazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of our first stdio cd. No release date yet, but I'll keep you posted. 9/7/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Berklee fall semester is just around the corner, and so next Monday I'll be off and running to Boston to meet this year's crop of amazing students. This semester begins my 11th year teaching at the college.\n\n\n\nWinger played a handful of gigs this summer, the most memorable being The Rocklahoma fest in Pryor, Oklahoma, a 3 day non-stop 70's/80's trip down memory lane with the likes of Skid Row, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Warrant, Dokken, Vince Neil, Poison, Firehouse, Quiet Riot, Enuff's Enuff, Queensryche and a ton of other bands. It was very cool catching up with musicians I haven't seen in years. We were told in excess of 60,000 tix were sold for the event. We're playing in Las Vegas in October and then touring with Ratt in Japan and Australia in November. Check my 'In Concert' page in the next couple of weeks for details.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead played a one-off at Berklee back in July. It's always a blast walking out on stage and jamming to songs you haven't played in a long time. Being on the edge of your seat as a musician stirs the creative side of things in really interesting ways. Our new cd is being mixed at the moment and should be released later this year.\n\n\n\nI played drums on Jordan Rudess' very cool new cd, 'The Road Home', which will be released September 12 on Magna Carta Records. This one's a 'cover' album, with Jordan paying homage to the bands which influenced him as an aspiring musician. Included are songs by Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Gentle Giant, and Genesis. As is always the case when I work with Jordan, this was a very challenging recording! Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined CalProg in Whittier, CA back in May. When time permits, Jordan and I will try to get back to finishing up the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd which we've been working on for the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nSee ya..................... 4/20/07 - update from Rod Life has been a whirlwind since the new year began. First, the Dixie Dregs toured out west in January. While in southern\n\nCalifornia, I raced to the NAMM show in Anaheim during the day to play with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth. For those performances I played on Roland's V-Drums, an amazing electronic drumset which I have future plans of incorporating them into my acoustic Premier kit. From the NAMM show I had to race to another town to play with the Dregs that evening. Nothing like multiple gigs in one day! On a sad note, the Dixie Dregs tour was cut short when sudden news arrived of Steve Morse's dad falling into a coma. Steve raced back to his home in Florida to be by his dad's side, who sadly passed away later that day. Steve's and my friendship goes back many years. I knew his dad, a brilliant man who will be missed by all whose lives he touched. February 1 was the start of a 5+ week Winger tour in support of the new Winger 4 cd. Crowds were considerably larger than anyone anticipated and we all had an amazing time together. There will be some summer touring, so just check my 'In Concert' page periodically. The Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined Baja Prog '07 in Mexicali, Mexico this past March. 1300 seats were filled to capacity each of 4 nights at this amazing festival. Bands and aficionados of progressive rock music come from all over the world for this event. From there Jordan and I travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to play at the Music Messe for Roland. And then we played a concert in London, also for Roland, and once again on the V Drums. In a few weeks Jordan and I will headline CalProg '07, a prog festival in Whittier, California. Also, around this time, I'll be recording with Jordan for his new solo record which will be out later this year. And we're hoping that, time permitting, we can make more headway on the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. The new Jazz Is Dead cd is at the mixing stages and will be completed in the next couple of months. I have heard the rough mixes and this is by far the coolest JID recording since the band's inception. Three weeks left to the Berklee semester. it's been a crazy semester with all my touring. But I tip my hat to my students, who waited patiently until I got back to town. And I've been spending extra days making up for the days I missed earlier in the semester. I truly have some incredible drummers this year. I'm certain I will see them out there doing it Big Time in the coming years! See ya......... 1/8/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody, Happy New Year. WInger played New Years Eve in Pittsburgh, PA....... OUTDOORS in the pouring rain to a couple thousand diehard fans! We were all soaking wet, and I mean completely drenched. All in all it was a ton of fun. Feb 1 Winger begins a 5 week US tour which will take us all around the country. We'll be mixing it up with stuff from the new cd, Winger 4, and of course, all the tunes from the good ole days. The Dixie Dregs begin touring next week out west which will take us through Colorado, Utah, California, and Arizona. While in southern CA, I'll be racing to the NAMM show to jam with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth.\n\n\n\nAll concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Immediatley following the Dregs tour I will fly directly to Boston to begin the spring '07 semester at Berklee College of Music. I always look forward to meeting a new crop of talented, eager students. 9/19/06 - update from Rod Lots going on since we last 'chatted'. The first new Winger cd in 13 years , Winger IV, is slated for release October 20 in Europe on Frontiers Records, Japan on King Records, with a US release to follow shortly thereafter on Shrapnel Records. The recording is a natural progression from 'Pull', which came out in '93. Kip produced the recording, which sounds HUGE! The band will tour Europe in October in support of the cd. Concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Audio clips can be heard at www.myspace.com/kipwingermusic Also, we're setting up a winger myspace page which should be up soon... The Rudess Morgenstein Project played in Caracas, Venezuela and San Jose, Costa Rica back in May. Jordan and I had a blast doing these shows, as they were our first gigs south of the border. The energy of the fans was unbelievable! In Venezuela, we played with Angra, a fantastic band from Brazil, and we spent a good bit of time hanging with them. In Costa Rica, we were the only band on the bill, and so our show was much longer than anything we've done in the past. We did a fair amount of jamming, which inspired us to take that approach on some of the new RPM cd, which is moving along nicely. We will be playing the Baja Progfest in Mexico in March, and are talking to other south American promoters about doing shows in some other countries. Jordan is also working on his next solo cd. I will cut drum tracks for some of this recording sometime before the end of the year. The Dixie Dregs will be touring the west coast in January. Look for tour dates on the 'In Concert' page in the next few weeks. Jazz Is Dead is in the mixing stages of a new cd. Even though it will be the band's fourth release, it actually will be our very first studio recording. All the other cds were live recordings. The Berklee fall semester began last week. After a year of living the life of nomads without 'homes', due to problems with the basement area of the building we taught in, the percussion faculty are quite comfortable in our brand new, sound proofed, incredible facility. Should be a great semester. 9/16/06 - from Rod It has been quite some time since I have posted updates on my site. For those of you who may not be aware, my wife, Michele, passed away this past December. Michele was a warrior's warrior during a 22 year journey battling breast cancer. The vast majority of people in our life knew little or nothing of her condition. She chose to keep it a quiet affair so she would not have it be front and center in every aspect of her daily life. It allowed her to lead a relatively normal life and not be known as 'Michele with breast cancer'. As painfully difficult as living with cancer can be at times, our life together was nothing short of perfection. We learned to smell the roses years ago. There are no regrets, as we told each other how deeply we loved each other virtually every day of our lives. Michele was my childhood sweetheart, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate. I miss her more than anyone can imagine. Thank you to everyone for your e-mails, letters and phone calls which have offered me some level of comfort during this very difficult time. I wish you all happiness and good health. Rod\n\n5/2/05 - Update from Rod The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was awesome, covering 18 cities in 19 days. Travelling highlights included driving through a surprise spring blizzard with virtually NO visiability in the middle of the night after jamming in Cleveland! Ah, the exciting life of a touring musician. Progress continues on the new Jazz Is Dead cd. Luis Conte has added amazing percussion to several tracks and we're hoping to get a few more folks to play on this one. Winger is still looking into a fall tour to record a live dvd and possible\n\nstudio cd. I'm getting ready to do some recording with Marc Muller who has been playing pedal steel and guitar with Shania Twain for the last 10 years. We're also involved in co-writing songs. The Berklee spring semester comes to a close this week and, as always, I've had a great bunch of students who never cease to amaze me.\n\n1/29/05 - Update from Rod Just got home from the Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band west coast tour. As always, it was a lot of fun jamming with my band mates of many years. Steve Morse band drummer Van Romaine and I worked out a two-man drum solo (guess you call that a drum duo)which was really a blast to perform. Looks like we'll be doing an east coast run in mid-March, from Florida all the way up through Chicago, so check my concert calendar in a couple of weeks for tour dates. Winger is discussing the possibility of a live dvd which would involve a week or two of concerts, possibly in May or June. Stay posted for details. The Berklee College of Music spring semester has begun and, as always, I have a wonderful group of students. 9/25/04 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nWell, believe it or not, after nearly 3 years since we first began work on it, The Jelly Jam 2 was just released. We are really beginning to sound like a band! Now we're looking at all of our schedules to see if we can do some live 'Jelly Jamming' in the next few months. I'll keep you posted. If you can't find Jelly Jam 2 in a cd shop, you can go to InsideOutMusic.com to read all about it and get purchase info. Jordan Rudess' new cd, 'Rhythm of Time', was released recently on Magna Carta Records. Like I had said a while back this recording was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and rewarding recordings of my career. The Dixie Dregs will be gearing up for a west coast tour in January. Tour dates will be available on my concert calendar in the next several weeks. We're already 4 weeks into the 2004 fall semester at Berklee College of Music and, as always, I have a great bunch of students. This time around there seem to be several who are into many of the classic rock and fusion bands and drummers, which is totally fine by me. It's right up my alley. Hope you all have an enjoyable fall season....... 7/23/04 - Update from Rod\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Rudess Morgenstein Project will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center at BerkleeCollege of Music in Boston on Thursday, August 5 at 8:15 PM. We will be playing classic RPM tunes as well as music from Jordan's soon-to-be released solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time'. Ty Tabor has completed mixing The Jelly Jam 2 and it is now in the hands of Inside Out Records. I'll keep you all posted regarding the release date. Kip Winger is putting some finishing touches on the recording I did with him and Turkish producer/guitarist Cenk Eroglu earlier this year, and getting ready to shop it for a deal. The recording with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar was incredible. The jam band concept is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my 30+ years as a musician. We need to record a couple more tracks to have a full length cd, so we'll probably get together in the fall to complete it. I'm in the midst of Berklee's 5 week summer program and having a blast with my roughly 75 students. It's amazing how many talented young musicians there are out there! 4/17/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, Kip is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey to finish recording and mix several tunes on his current project with Cenk Eroglu. Talk about a fresh, new killer sound, this is it!\n\n\n\nI just got back from Illinois for a week of recording with\n\nguitarist/keyboardist Brian Moritz and his band Balance. Dave LaRue (Dixie Dregs) played bass, with Joel Kaplan on keyboards and Vince Claps on vocals. With the exception of Dave and I, all these guys have been very active in the Chicago music scene for many years. The recording was engineered by Brian Mitchell, who lives a double life as a forensic pathologist! All in all, it was quite an experience. I'll update you as the recording progresses.\n\n\n\nI'm on my way to meet up with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar in\n\nHartford, CT to record for several days on both Jeff's solo cd and some jam band oriented stuff.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I return from CT, I'll be getting together with Jordan Rudess to pick up where he and I left off with the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. We're looking into the possibility of playing some gigs later this year.\n\n\n\nThe release of Jordan's solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is August 31 on Magna Carta Records.\n\n\n\nWell, yet another Berklee school year has come to a close. I guarantee that somewhere in the future you will see some of these students realizing their musical dreams!\n\n\n\nHave a HOT summer.................... 3/19/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, I just spent the last several days in Nashville recording with Kip Winger. Over the past year, Kip has been making trips to Istanbul, Turkey where he has been writing and recording with Turkish artist/guitarist/producer Cenk Eroglu. The music is an incredible blend of east-meets-west sounds and rhythms, both traditional and high-tech. Kip and Cenk hope to finish it up in the next several months. I'll keep you posted. We're talking about the possibility of recording Winger Live In Concert along with a bunch of archival/ interview footage. Jordan Rudess' solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is set for release in July on Magna Carta Records. What an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience it always is, working with my friend Jordan. Among the guest artists appearing on the recording are Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Vinnie Moore and Greg Howe. Modern Drummer presents 'Drum Nation' was released in mid-January and includes drum performances by 14 drummers. Jordan Rudess played keys on my track 'Faceless Pastiche'. Other members of the cast include Steve Smith, Simon Phillips, Bill Bruford, Trilok Gurtu and Chad Wackerman, to name but a\n\nfew. I recorded a couple of tracks with Jeff Pevar on a solo recording he's working on. I met Jeff when he joined Jazz Is Dead in 2001. He is one of the most well-rounded, musical guitarists around. I recently went to see him perform with CPR, the band he has with David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young fame.) Jeff is the 'P' in CPR. A highlight of the evening for me was meeting David Crosby and having HIM say all these great things about the Dixie Dregs. I felt like a million bucks! Jelly Jam 2's completion is just around the corner, I promise........ Another snow has fallen, with more expected tonight. It sure has been a\n\nLOOOOOOONG Winter. 11/09/03 - Update from Rod Jordan Rudess is in the studio working on his next solo recording for Magna Carta. We're planning on doing drum tracks before the end of the year. January 13 is the Magna Carta release date for 'Modern Drummer Presents: Drum Nation Volume 1', an all-out drummers' cd featuring quite an interesting cast of players. Each participating drummer contributed one track; Jordan Rudess plays keyboards on my tune 'Faceless Pastiche'. Additional info about the cd can be found at Magna Carta'a website. I know it sounds like a broken record but Ty Tabor is planning on mixing The Jelly Jam's next cd before the end of this year, as soon as he gets off the current King's X tour. It seems like only yesterday that the semester began but the Berklee College of Music fall semester is already entering its 10th week. I have some very fine students this year and am sure to hear about them in years to come! 7/19/03 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nI've been meaning to post something ever since I got back from Europe last month. The clinic tour was an absolute blast! I played in 8 countries in 3 weeks and spent some time in the UK visiting Premier Percussion on a break in the middle of the clinic events. Thanks to everyone who came out, the turn-outs were fantastic, and I met so many wonderful drummers, Premier/Sabian/Vic Firth reps, music store personnel and other musicians. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in making these clinics first class events and I look forward to seeing all of you again somewhere down the road. I'm already full steam ahead in the Berklee College of Music 5 week program and have been teaching 11 different classes in addition to many private lessons. And I can say without hesitation that there are some VERY talented young people out there! I'm sure we'll be seeing quite a few of ya'll enrolled as Berklee College students in the years to come. Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, is putting the finishing touches on Jelly Jam 2, my project with him and John Myung, bassist with Dream Theater. Stay posted for a release date. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Talk to you in the fall. Rod 5/16/03 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody,\n\nI leave in a week for a 3 week European drum clinic tour for Premier and Sabian which will take me to some very cool places including, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Iceland, with a trip to the Premier Percussion complex in Leicester, UK thrown in for good measure. The clinics will feature the new line of Premier drums which were showcased at this year's NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA back in January. The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was a lot of fun, and as we didn't hit all of the usual east coast cities, hopefully we'll be able to put another run together this year. Ty tabor is hard at work on the next Jelly Jam recording. I'll keep you posted on a release date as soon as I hear something. And, as I've said before, we really want to tour for this one. Still waiting on a release date for the Magna Carta drummers cd. I played in a very cool blues concert last weekend at the West Hampton Performing Arts Center with Frank Latorre and The King Bees. Frank, an incredible harmonica player, played the harp on Winger's 'Down incognito' on PULL back in '93. The band also featured Richie Cannata of Billy Joel fame and 3 of Frank's longtime buddies- Doug, Paul and Paul who play guitar, bass and guitar respectively. I hope to do some more playing with these guys in the future. Jordan Rudess and I played during Berklee College's Percussion week back in April and the turn out was overwhelming. Thanks for all your support. Some day, I promise, we'll get the next studio cd released. We have interested parties in Puerto Rico and Finland wanting to bring us over to jam. So we're looking into getting it together. Well, another year at Berklee has come to a close and, as always, I had a wonderful time teaching so many talented drummer/musicians. I'll be teaching the 5 Week Summer program beginning the second week in July, so if you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hey. 2/21/03 - Update from Rod Hey everybody.\n\nThe January west coast Dixie Dregs tour was fantastic. The timing enabled us to spend some time at the NAMM Music trade show in Anaheim. It's always a blast going to the show as you meet up with so many friends and acquaintances who you don't necessarily get to see that often.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in late April for an east coast run. Check my site in the coming weeks for concert info. I recently recorded a song for an upcoming 'drummers' cd which will be coming out on Magna Carta sometime in the spring. 10-15 drummers are each contributing a tune. As I understand it, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio and Steve Smith have already submitted their tracks. Should be quite a recording. Ty Tabor is hoping to put the final touches on the new Jelly Jam cd March/April. So, hopefully, it won't be too long after that before it is released by Inside Out Records. Until we meet again.......... 12/2/02 - Update from Rod The Dixie Dregs will be touring in CA, January 10 through the 19th. Check the concert calendar for specific dates. Thanks to everyone who came out to see Winger on the east coast this past October. As is always the case with these guys, it was a tremendous amount of fun both musically and just hanging with Kip, Paul, Reb, and John. Now we'll just have to see where it all leads... Jordan Rudess and I picked up where we left off last summer on our second RPM studio recording. It's awesome working together again with my power duo partner. We're hoping to get it done in the next few months for a 2003 release and some touring. Ty Tabor will put the finishing touches on the next Jelly Jam recording as soon as he gets home from the King's X/ Ronnie Dio tour later this month. The first Jelly Jam cd created a nice buzz at radio and so we're all looking forward to releasing this next one. John Myung, Ty and I are determined to tour with this band. Another semester at Berklee is fast coming to a close. As usual, I have a great bunch of students who continue to keep me on my toes. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you next year.\n\nRod 8/28/02 - Update from Rod Well, it looks like summer is almost over. Man it was a hot one! The Poison, Cinderella, Winger, Faster Pussycat tour was an incredible amount of fun. Being back with the guys was truly an amazing experience. Jamming with them was a blast and I don't think I've laughed this much in years. These people are so much fun to hang with. And it looks like we'll be hanging again, if but for only a short time. We're doing a string of east coast Winger shows beginning October 1. Check the Concert Calendar for the dates. These will be full length shows covering considerably more songs than we did on the Poison tour. We're looking into the possibility of doing some combination Dixie Dregs/ Jelly Jam shows later this year. I'll keep you posted. Jordan Rudess and I have been in communicado trying to nail down a time period to finish up our next studio recording which was begun last summer. I'll keep you abreast of that one, too. The Berklee College of Music fall semester begins shortly and I'm looking forward to meeting lots of new faces as well as the 'veterans'. See you all soon......\n\n5/2/02 - Update from Rod Hey everybody. Well, as you all know by now, Winger is back together and will be touring with Poison, Cinderella, and Faster Pussycat from mid-May through July. I must admit, the adrenaline is beginning to flow as the starting date approaches. This will be the first time we've played as a band live in nearly 9 years. A few Winger Only headline shows will be happening, too. For all tour dates click here. The Jelly Jam debut cd was released in the latter part of March and Ty and I have been doing a good amount of press and radio in support of it. We're hoping to do some touring with this project as soon as our schedules permit. John Myung is currently on tour with Dream Theater, and Ty is on the road with King's X. So, all three of us have our hands full at the moment. But we're determined to make The Jelly Jam a full-fledged, LIVE jamming band. This week was the last week of classes for the spring 2002 semester at Berklee College of Music. Finals are next week, after which I race back to New York to board a plane to Nashville for a week of Winger rehearsals. I had a fantastic group of students this year who really kept me on my toes. I'm sure I'll be seeing many of them in concert with their own bands in the years to come! Have a great summer and I hope to run in to some of you along the way.........

Do you have your work schedule at Berklee and then plan everything around it?\n\nRM: Part of the high profile of a music college like Berklee, is that it has quite a few staff members who continue to \"live the life.\" What better way is there to inspire young musicians by having them study with active recording and touring musicians?\n\nHow did you wind up being part of the faculty at Berklee?\n\nRM: The Rudess Morgenstein Project was hired to perform at Berklee College of Music in the summer of '97. I received a call from the chairman of the Berklee percussion department a few days after the concert to see if I had ever thought about teaching on a college level and, if so, did I have any interest in filling an open position for the coming year beginning the fall of '97. I decided to check it out, and that one-year position turned out to be a nearly 19-year run, which continues to this day. Teaching at a college was never a part of the \"plan,\" it just happened as a result of playing a concert.\n\nWhat's coming up for your career-wise for the rest of 2016?\n\nRM: The Jelly Jam will release Profit on May 27, and the band will tour beginning mid-July. It will be the first time John Myung, Ty Tabor, and I will be performing on stage together as a band. I'm really looking forward to the experience. Winger will most probably tour in the fall and begin recording a new CD. I will also be back at Berklee come September. In addition, I teach an online class called Rock Drums, which I created for Berklee's online division. It is a three-credit college course and I believe it to be the only course of its kind in the world of cyber teaching.\n\nWhen you're not busy with your work, how do you like to spend your free time?\n\nRM: The nature of being a traveling musician is that you are away from home a good deal of the time. When I am in town, I love hanging at any number of beaches and water settings in this area. And there are quite a few spots to choose from, whether its downtown Northport by the harbor, or at one of the beaches. I love riding my bike to these destinations, as I try to do some kind of physical activity on a regular basis. I am also involved in musical projects outside of the teaching and my bands. And so these activities take up much of my free time. But the thing is, anything music-related to me is more like a hobby, as there is still so much enjoyment involved in creative activities.\n\nDo you have a favorite restaurant on Long Island?\n\nRM: I have so many favorite restaurants because I enjoy most cuisines. So it would be really difficult to choose one favorite. Northport alone has a handful of great places -- the one I'd like to mention, because it has special meaning to me, is The Sweet Shop. Owner Pete Panarites, who is the ex-mayor of the town, makes the most amazing blueberry pancakes.\n\nFinally, Rod, what do you wish more people knew about Long Island?\n\nRM: This is a double-edged sword, as Long Island has so many beautiful destinations, yet there are so many people living here -- probably 5 million or so. And so, in answer to your question, sure, I wish everyone could experience some of the magic Long Island has to offer, but the last thing I think it needs is a larger population.\n\nMy family moved to Plainview just before my first birthday in '53. I moved in '73 when I went to the University of Miami, FL. There, as a music major, I met Steve Morse and The Dixie Dregs who, when we left the college, moved in and around Augusta, GA to get the ball rolling. I moved back up north in '86 when the Dregs and Steve Morse Band went on 'hold until further notice'. In search of the next musical project to get involved with, I moved to NYC, eventually meeting what became Winger. I then moved back to Long Island - Northport - in the fall of '91, where I still reside, because it is the most beautiful town on earth!"}, {"url": "https://drummercafe.com/featured/articles/interview-with-rod-morgenstein", "page_content": "The professional music career of Rod Morgenstein began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan. The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004.\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years.\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d"}]}
