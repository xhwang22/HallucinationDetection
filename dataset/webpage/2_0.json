The 18th Amendment established Prohibition - a law against the production, transport, and sale of alcohol. Private consumption and possession were not prohibited. Several months later, the Volstead Act was passed, creating laws to enforce the Amendment. Bootlegging and bathtub gin followed.\n\nIn 1928, when he was only 9 years old, Mickie Mouse was born! He first appeared in Disney's Steamboat Willie, along with Minnie. Although they were in two previous shorts, this was the first to be distributed. Steamboat Willie took advantage of the new technology and was a \"talkie\" - music was coordinated with the animation. It became the most popular cartoon of its day.\n\nIn 1931, at the age of only 12 years old, Richard was alive when in March, \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d officially became the national anthem by congressional resolution. Other songs had previously been used - among them, \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", \"God Bless America\", and \"America the Beautiful\". There was fierce debate about making \"The Star Spangled Banner\" the national anthem - Southerners and veterans organizations supported it, pacifists and educators opposed it.\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 49 years old, Richard was alive when on April 4th, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the civil rights leader, was shot and killed by an assassin in Memphis. James Earl Ray was apprehended and plead guilty to shooting Dr. King.

He was the Opening Day starter for the Braves five times, throwing shutouts three times in that assignment.\n\nThe brother of Mickey Mahler, Rick was signed as a free agent by Atlanta and scout Al LaMacchia on June 16, 1975. He made his pro debut that summer with the Kingsport Braves and reached the majors early in the 1979 campaign. After splitting time between Atlanta and the Triple A Richmond Braves, he joined the Atlanta rotation late in the 1981 season. He started 1982 with a bang, hurling a two-hit shutout against the San Diego Padres on Opening Day and then blanking the Houston Astros in his next outing. Overall, he went 9-10 that year and made one relief appearance in the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nAfter spending most of 1983 in the minors with Richmond, Mahler was back in Atlanta in 1984 and went 13-10 with a 3.12 ERA. The next year, he won a career-best 17 games while losing 15 and leading the National League with 272 hits allowed. On Opening Day 1986, he shut out the Montreal Expos, but he went on to lead the NL with 18 losses that summer. The following season, 1987, he held the Philadelphia Phillies scoreless in the Braves' opener.\n\nFollowing the 1988 season, Mahler became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. After two years in Cincinnati and a brief stint with the Montreal Expos, he ended his career back in a Braves uniform in 1991.\n\nDuring his career, Mahler lost at least 15 games three times. Four times, he led the NL in hits allowed, and twice he paced the circuit in earned runs allowed. He was regarded as a good fielder, and he hit fairly well for a pitcher, posting a .179 batting average for his career.\n\nAfter his playing career, Mahler was a minor league manager and coach. He was the pitching coach for the Spokane Indians in 1998, Kane County Cougars in 1999 and Omaha Golden Spikes in 2000-2001. He was also a coach for the Kingsport Mets in 2003 and St. Lucie Mets in 2004. He died of a heart attack at age 51 during spring training 2005.
