{"Tom Izzo has been the head coach of the Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team since 1995.": [{"url": "https://msuspartans.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/coaches/tom-izzo/616", "page_content": "Tom Izzo was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2016, cementing his status as one of the game\u2019s all-time greats.\n\n\\\n\nNow in his 28th year, Izzo has compiled an impressive list of accomplishments, including the 2000 NCAA National Championship, 10 regular-season Big Ten Championships, six Big Ten Tournament titles, eight Final Four appearances, eight National Coach of the Year awards and a Big Ten-record 24 straight NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\n\n\nThese accomplishments, however, are not what make Izzo one of the best in the game, but rather it is his insatiable desire to accomplish more.\n\n\n\nWith a career record of 666-267, it\u2019s easy to see that Izzo knows how to win, but he also knows how to win the right way. In his 27 years directing the Spartan program, 85 percent of his players who completed their eligibility also left with a degree. In the last 22 years, 65 Spartans have received their undergraduate degrees.\n\n\n\nIn 27 seasons, Izzo has returned Michigan State to national prominence, placed his name in the NCAA record books and become a leader among college basketball coaches.\n\nIzzo\u2019s 666 wins are fifth most by any coach in his first 27 seasons in the history of college basketball. In late November 2009, he passed his mentor Jud Heathcote (340 wins) to become MSU\u2019s all-time winningest coach. When the Spartans beat Ohio State in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Big Ten Tournament, Izzo won his 600th career game. He became one of just two Big Ten coaches with at least 300 conference wins when MSU beat Iowa, 78-70, on Feb. 25, 2020. And when the Spartans beat Maryland on March 6, 2022, the victory gave Izzo 663 overall wins for his career, passing Bob Knight of Indiana for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Izzo is at his best, winning at a clip of .697 to rank third among all active coaches with at least 10 tournament games coached. His 53 NCAA Tournament wins are the most ever for a Big Ten coach, and rank sixth all-time. He has led MSU to 24-straight NCAA Tournament appearances, the longest active streak among Division I coaches and tied for the longest streak all-time.\n\n\n\nA 2015 inductee into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, Izzo led MSU to eight Final Four appearances between 1999 and 2019, becoming just the fourth school in college basketball history to do it in any 21-year span, including just the third since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Izzo is one of just two coaches in NCAA history to reach four Final Fours in his first 10 years of coaching, joining Ohio State\u2019s Fred Taylor, and is just the second coach in NCAA history to appear in eight Final Fours in a 21-year span since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. His eight Final Four appearances rank fifth all-time, first among active coaches and first all-time among Big Ten coaches. Two stats stand out in Izzo\u2019s NCAA Tournament success: 1) MSU is 23-7 in the second game of an NCAA Tournament weekend 2) MSU is 15-12 as the lower-seeded team, while the 15 wins are the most in NCAA Tournament history for any coach.\n\n\n\nThrough 27 seasons, Izzo is one of the most successful coaches in Big Ten history. His .679 winning percentage in Big Ten games ranks fourth all-time among league coaches with at least 10 years of service. In all games, Izzo ranks fourth (.714). With 322 conference victories, Izzo ranks second all-time, trailing just Indiana\u2019s Bob Knight (353 wins). In the 2021-22 regular season finale, the Spartans beat Maryland to give Izzo his 663rd win, passing Knight (662) for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Izzo brings stability to Michigan State basketball. Including 12 years as an assistant, the 2022-23 season is Izzo\u2019s 40th with the Spartans, as he is the longest serving active Big Ten men\u2019s basketball head coach. He is also a leader among his peers, serving as the NABC President from April 2010-April 2011, while currently serving as an emeritus member of the NABC Board of Directors. He\u2019s also held spots on the John R. Wooden Award Board of Governors and the USA Basketball Collegiate Committee.\n\n\n\nOver the past 25 seasons, Izzo has compiled an impressive 633-239 (.726) record. A quick look at other stats further demonstrates the Spartans\u2019 success over that stretch: 304-134 (.694) in the Big Ten; 349-45 (.886) at the Breslin Center, including a Big Ten record 53-game winning streak; 142-126 (.530) against Top 25 teams (including four wins over No. 1-ranked teams); 87-41 (.680) in postseason play and 53-23 (.697) in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIndividually, players have excelled under Izzo. Twelve Spartans (Charlie Bell, Mateen Cleaves, Paul Davis, Draymond Green, Gary Harris, Drew Neitzel, Adreian Payne, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson, Denzel Valentine, Miles Bridges and Cassius Winston) have earned some form of All-America honors. Valentine earned six different National Player of the Year awards in 2016 (Associated Press, Basketball Times, NABC, NBC, Sports Illustrated and USA TODAY Sports), and Green was named National Player of the Year by the NABC in 2012. Chris Hill was a three-time Academic All-American, including being named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2005, while Neitzel also earned Academic All-America accolades. In 2019-20, Winston became the third player in MSU history to earn multiple consensus All-American honors, while Xavier Tillman Sr. was named a Second Team Academic All-American.\n\nForty-two different players have earned all-conference recognition, including 14 different first-team honorees, six Big Ten Players of the Year (Cleaves, Green, Lucas, Peterson, Valentine, Winston), three Big Ten Freshmen of the Year (Gary Harris, Miles Bridges and Jaren Jackson Jr.) and three Big Ten Defensive Players of the Year (Travis Walton, Jackson Jr. and Tillman Sr.).\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to recruit some of the nation\u2019s most talented high school players. During his time as head coach, Izzo has recruited 16 McDonald\u2019s All-Americans (Mateen Cleaves - 1996, Jason Richardson - 1999, Marcus Taylor and Zach Randolph - 2000, Kelvin Torbert - 2001, Paul Davis - 2002, Shannon Brown and Brandon Cotton - 2003, Keith Appling - 2010, Branden Dawson - 2011, Gary Harris - 2012, Deyonta Davis - 2015, Miles Bridges and Joshua Langford - 2016, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2017, Max Christie - 2021). In addition, 12 of the last 23 Michigan Mr. Basketball award winners suited up for the Green and White (1999 - Richardson, 2000 - Taylor, 2001 - Torbert, 2002 - Davis, 2004 - Drew Neitzel, 2009 - Derrick Nix, 2010 - Appling, 2012 - Matt Costello, 2015 - Davis, 2016 - Cassius Winston, 2018 - Foster Loyer, 2021 \u2013 Pierre Brooks), while Shannon Brown won the 2003 Illinois Mr. Basketball Award and Gary Harris won the 2012 Indiana Mr. Basketball Award.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps even more important to Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to take young talent and develop a player\u2019s skills, allowing him to grow as a player and go on to play professionally. Under Izzo, Michigan State has had 23 players selected in the NBA Draft, including 22 since 2000, 11 of whom were first rounders (Mateen Cleaves - 2000 first round, Morris Peterson - 2000 first round, Jason Richardson - 2001 first round, Zach Randolph - 2001 first round, Andre Hutson - 2001 second round, Marcus Taylor - 2002 second round, Erazem Lorbek - 2005 second round, Shannon Brown - 2006 first round, Maurice Ager - 2006 first round, Paul Davis - 2006 second round, Goran Suton - 2009 second round, Draymond Green - 2012 second round, Adreian Payne - 2014 first round, Gary Harris - 2014 first round, Branden Dawson - 2015 second round, Denzel Valentine - 2016 first round, Deyonta Davis - 2016 second round, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2018 first round, Miles Bridges - 2018 first round, Xavier Tillman Sr. - 2020 second round, Cassius Winston - 2020 second round, Max Christie \u2013 2022 second round).\n\nWhile many players were high school All-Americans, Izzo took others who were not ranked in the top-75 coming out of high school and turned them into NBA talent. In addition, Izzo-recruit Charlie Bell played in the NBA during the 2001-02 season after signing a free agent contract. After a successful stint overseas, Bell played seven more seasons in the NBA. Alan Anderson, a member of the 2005 Final Four team, signed a free agent contract and played two years with the Charlotte Bobcats and, after a stint in Europe, returned for five seasons back in the NBA. In more recent years, Kalin Lucas and Bryn Forbes have also played in the NBA after signing free agent contracts, while Aaron Henry signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2021. Numerous other former Spartans have enjoyed lucrative professional careers playing overseas.\n\n\n\nIzzo has also emerged as a teacher, not only to his players, but also his assistant coaches. Three current Division I head coaches served as assistants to Izzo, including Brian Gregory (South Florida), Stan Heath (Eastern Michigan) and Dwayne Stephens (Western Michigan). In total, eight former assistants have earned head coaching jobs. Former long-time assistant Mike Garland spent three seasons as head coach at Cleveland State following an initial seven-year stint at MSU, while Stan Joplin was also head coach at Toledo for 12 seasons, Jim Boylen served as head coach at Utah for four seasons, Heath served as head coach at Kent State, Arkansas and South Florida over 13 seasons and Tom Crean was the head coach at Marquette, Indiana and Georgia. The current coaching staff features two former assistants who were head coaches before returning to East Lansing \u2013 Doug Wojcik spent nine seasons between Tulsa and College of Charleston and Mark Montgomery was the head coach at Northern Illinois for 10 seasons.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans finished the 2021-22 season with a 23-13 overall record and were selected to the NCAA Tournament for the 24th-straight season, extending the longest streak in Big Ten history. The 24-year run also ranked tied for the third-longest in NCAA history and was the second-longest active streak in the nation. Izzo tied former Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski for the most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and entered the 2022-23 season as the active leader for consecutive appearances.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2020-21 season with a 15-13 overall record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the 23rd-straight season, the longest streak in Big Ten history and the third-longest active streak among Division I schools. In a season shortened to just 28 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spartans opened the season with six-straight non-league wins, including a 75-69 win at Duke in the Champions Classic. After starting the Big Ten Conference season with three-straight losses and a 2-7 record through nine games, MSU finished the season with a 7-4 mark against Big Ten opponents and closed out the regular season with five wins in its last seven games, including wins against No. 5 Illinois, No. 4 Ohio State and No. 2 Michigan.\n\n\n\nThe 2019-20 season finished with Michigan State clinching a share of the Big Ten regular season title for the third-straight year. The Spartans won their last five regular season games and six of the last seven overall, to finish 14-6 and claim a share of the title. While the postseason was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MSU finished the season with a 22-9 overall record and a 14-6 record in league play. The Spartans opened the season ranked No. 1 in the country in the Associated Press pre-season poll, the first time in program history the team was the top-ranked team in the preseason. MSU finished the season ranked second in the country in assists per game (17.7), while also ranked fourth in field goal percentage defense (37.9 percent) and ninth in total rebounds per game (40.6). Of the 28 20-win seasons in Michigan State history, Izzo has been involved in 25 of them, 20 as a head coach and five as an assistant.\n\n\n\nThe 2018-19 season was among the most memorable in Michigan State history under Izzo. The Spartans finished with a 32-7 overall record, the fifth 30-win season under Izzo, won a share of the Big Ten regular season championship, won the Big Ten Tournament Championship for a conference-record sixth time and reached the Final Four for the eighth time in 21 years and the 10th time in program history. Along the way, MSU won the Las Vegas Invitational, beat Michigan three times, including a 65-60 decision in the Big Ten Tournament Championship, and toppled No. 1 Duke, 68-67, in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in total rebounds (1,580) and total assists (715), while ranking among the top-10 in the country in six other categories: assists per game (3rd, 18.3 apg), total blocks (3rd, 205), field goal percentage defense (3rd, 38.1%), rebound margin (5th, 8.8 rpg), defensive rebounds per game (6th, 29.72 rpg) and blocked shots per game (7th, 5.3 bpg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2017-18 season with a 30-5 overall record, the fourth 30-win season under Izzo, advanced to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 21st straight season and won the program\u2019s eighth Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans set a school record for most wins in a regular season (28), won their first outright Big Ten Regular Season title since 2009, won 16 Big Ten Conference games for the first time and had the fewest losses in a regular season since the 2000-01 team went 24-3. The New Year started with MSU moving into the No. 1 spot in the national rankings for the fifth time in program history, and the fourth time under Izzo. The Spartans had win streaks of 14 games and 13 games during the season, earning a No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in assists per game (19.1), blocked shots per game (7.2), field goal percentage defense (36.7%) and rebound margin (+10.7).\n\n\n\nThe 2016-17 season saw Michigan State advance to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 20th straight season. It was not an easy road, however, to reach the postseason. Before the season started, the Spartans lost senior forwards Ben Carter and Gavin Schilling to season-ending knee injuries. MSU\u2019s November was arguably the toughest opening month in college basketball history. In addition to games against four ranked opponents, all away from home, the Spartans traveled more than 13,600 miles in 22 days with trips to Hawaii, New York, North Carolina and the Bahamas. In December, the Spartans played seven contests without leading scorer Miles Bridges. Despite all the adversity, including losing a third player, Eron Harris, to a season-ending knee injury in February, the Spartans pulled together and used a 5-2 mark in February to earn their way into the NCAA Tournament. When MSU defeated Miami in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Spartans secured their 20th win of the season. It was quite an accomplishment for a team that was one of the least experienced (321st) and shortest (291st) in the nation according to KenPom.com.\n\n\n\nThe 2015-16 season was a milestone year both for Coach Izzo and the Spartans. Michigan State opened the year by winning its first 13 games, establishing a new school mark for best start to a season. When the Spartans defeated Boston College on November 26, Izzo became the 91st coach in NCAA history to record 500 career wins, with at least 10 seasons in Division I, and just the eighth coach to accomplish the feat in his first 21 seasons. He also became just the 18th coach to win 500 career games in his first collegiate head-coaching stop, and was the eighth-fastest coach to reach 500 wins among those who did it all at one school, accomplishing the feat in 699 games.\n\n\n\nOn December 7, MSU rose to No. 1 in the regular-season polls for just the fourth time in school history, and the third time under Izzo. The Spartans would hold the top spot for a school-record four weeks. Following a perfect 13-0 non-conference slate, Michigan State would finish second in the Big Ten with a 13-5 mark. A victory over Northwestern gave Izzo 513 for his career, moving past Purdue\u2019s Gene Keady for second-most wins at a Big Ten School, trailing only Bob Knight (662). In the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, Maryland and Purdue to become the first school in Big Ten history to hold five conference tournament titles. The Spartans earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they were upset by No. 15 Middle Tennessee. MSU finished the season with a 29-6 record, matching the fourth-best win total in school history, as the Spartans\u2019 26 regular-season victories equaled a school record. Izzo\u2019s Spartans were the only team in the nation to win 27 or more games every year from 2011-12 to 2015-16.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the 2015-16 season was one of the most impressive in school history. Michigan State led the nation in 3-point field-goal percentage (.434), rebound margin (+11.4), assists per game (20.5) and total assists (719). The Spartans ranked in the top three in eight different categories, and in the Top 10 in 11 different categories. It marked the fifth time in Izzo\u2019s career that the Spartans led the nation in rebounding margin. MSU also set school single-season records for assists (719), 3-point field goals made (321) and blocked shots (177). The 719 assists were the 22nd-best total in NCAA history, while MSU recorded an assist on a nation\u2019s-best 71.3 percent of its field goals. At 79.8 points per game, the 2015-16 squad was the highest-scoring team of the Izzo era, and the highest-scoring team since 1985-86. In Big Ten Conference games, MSU led the conference in 12 stat categories and was ranked in the top three in 17 of the 21 stats.\n\n\n\nThe 2014-15 Spartans provided a lesson in resiliency and the power of togetherness. MSU opened the season ranked in the polls, but by Christmas, the Spartans had fallen out of the rankings. Following a home loss to Illinois on Feb. 7, the Spartans stood at 15-8, including just 6-4 in conference. MSU closed the regular season by winning six of its last eight games, including a final week that featured a come-from-behind home finale win over Purdue on Senior Day despite a first-half injury to Branden Dawson, and a regular-season finale victory at Indiana without Dawson. In the Big Ten Tournament, MSU defeated Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland before falling to No. 6 Wisconsin in overtime. The Spartans were disappointed to have let a championship opportunity slip away, but entered the NCAA Tournament on a mission.\n\n\n\nHaving entered March just hoping to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament, the postseason run turned a good season into a great one. As the No. 7 seed, MSU opened with a victory over No. 10 Georgia. In the third round, MSU faced No. 2 Virginia for the second-straight season, defeating the Cavaliers to advance to a nation\u2019s-best seventh Sweet 16 in the last eight seasons. At the East Regional in Syracuse, the Spartans trailed at the half against both No. 3 Oklahoma in the Sweet 16 and No. 4 Louisville in the Elite Eight, before rallying for a pair of victories to reach the Final Four. Making its nation\u2019s-best seventh Final Four appearance in the last 17 seasons, MSU got off to a quick start against No. 1 Duke before falling to the eventual National Champion Blue Devils. MSU would finish 27-12, 12-6 in the Big Ten.\n\n\n\nThe senior class of 2015 finished tied for the second-winningest class in school history with 112 wins. The 2014-15 Spartans established school single-season records for assists (646) and blocks (176), while the 294 made 3-pointers were second-most in school history. Averaging 16.6 assists per game, the Spartans ranked fifth in the nation, while ranking seventh in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5). Defensively, MSU posted a .396 field-goal percentage defense, marking the fourth-straight season that Spartan opponents shot less than 40 percent from the field.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 season was not short of highlights. It started early, with No. 2 MSU knocking off No. 1 Kentucky, 78-74, on Nov. 12 in Chicago, in what was the earliest game ever between No. 1 and No. 2. One week later, MSU ascended to No. 1 in the polls, a position it would hold for three weeks \u2013 establishing a school record at the time for the longest stay at No. 1. In late November, the Spartans captured the Coaches Vs. Cancer Tournament title in Brooklyn, marking MSU\u2019s first regular-season, neutral-site tournament championship since December 1998.\n\n\n\nInjuries proved to be a common storyline during the 2013-14 campaign, as six different players, including each one of MSU\u2019s top four scorers, missed multiple games due to injury or illness for a total of 29 games missed. In 19 of 38 games, including 13 of 18 Big Ten contests, the Spartans were without their full allotment of players due to injury. In nine games, Michigan State was without two of its regular rotation players. In total, 11 different Spartans started at least one game, as Izzo employed 15 different starting lineups. The fluctuation led to inconsistent results through much of the Big Ten slate, but by the end of the regular season, MSU was getting healthy.\n\n\n\nPlaying at full strength, the Spartans played at a different level in the postseason, steamrolling through the Big Ten Tournament. The championship game featured the third meeting of the season between in-state rivals Michigan State and Michigan, marking the first time the Spartans and Wolverines would meet in the conference tournament. Although UM won the two regular-season meetings, this was the first time MSU would feature a complete roster, pulling away early in the second half to capture the fourth tournament championship in school history with a 69-55 victory.\n\n\n\nMSU entered the NCAA Tournament as the No. 4 seed in the East Region, but was also a popular pick to advance to the Final Four and even cut down the championship nets. In the second round, Adreian Payne scored an MSU NCAA Tournament record 41 points to defeat Delaware, 93-78. Two days later, the Spartans advanced to the Sweet 16 with an 80-73 win over Harvard. Playing in the East Regional in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden, Michigan State defeated No. 1 seed Virginia, 61-59. In the Elite Eight, the Spartans held a nine-point lead in the second half against Connecticut, but the eventual National Champion Huskies would rally for a 60-54 victory.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 Spartans finished with a 29-9 record, including 12-6 in the Big Ten, finishing tied for second. The 29 wins tied for the fourth-best total in school history, while MSU established single-season school records for assists (637), made 3-point field goals (307), and blocks (174). Michigan State led the conference in field-goal percentage defense (.397), while ranking second in field-goal percentage (.474) and 3-point field-goal percentage (.392). The Spartans also finished with an all-time low 11.6 turnovers per contest.\n\n\n\nIn 2012-13, the Spartans collected a 27-9 record, including 13-5 in the Big Ten, against perhaps the nation\u2019s most difficult schedule, playing 13 games against ranked opponents. The slate was especially difficult down the stretch as 14 of MSU\u2019s last 18 games (postseason included) were against opponents that participated in the NCAA Tournament. Michigan State advanced to its 16th consecutive NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region, and advanced to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in the last six seasons, tied for the most in the nation.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2013, Izzo recorded his 200th conference victory against Penn State, joining Mike Krzyzewski (Duke) and Jim Boeheim (Syracuse) as the only active coaches in a power conference with 200 conference wins at their current school. In April, Izzo received the Wayman Tisdale Humanitarian Award, honoring an individual in college basketball who has made a significant impact on society.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans proved to be dominant defensively once again in 2012-13, pacing the Big Ten in field-goal percentage defense (.390) and steals (8.0 spg), while ranking second in scoring defense (59.1 ppg) and third in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (.300). MSU also continued to be strong on the glass, ranking second in the Big Ten and 10th in the nation with a +7.6 rebound margin, marking the 11th time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the Top 10 in the nation.\n\n\n\nThe 2011-12 season was one of Izzo\u2019s most rewarding as head coach. The Spartans entered the season unranked, returning only two players who averaged more than 20 minutes a game the previous season. MSU opened the year with neutral-site losses to No. 1 North Carolina and No. 6 Duke, but responded with 15 straight victories, including road wins at No. 23 Gonzaga and No. 18 Wisconsin, marking the Spartans\u2019 first win in Madison since 2001. Keyed by a mid-February win at No. 3 Ohio State, MSU would go on to capture a share of the Big Ten regular-season championship, the seventh of the Izzo era, and head to the Big Ten Tournament where it defeated Ohio State to capture the third Big Ten Tournament title in school history, and the first since 2000. Michigan State was rewarded with a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament, where it would advance to the Sweet 16 for the 10th time in the last 15 years, good for second most in the nation. MSU would finish with a 29-8 record.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the Spartans finished the 2011-12 season ranked second in the nation in field-goal percentage defense (.379), the best effort by a Spartan squad since 1959. Once again, the Spartans were a dominant presence on the glass, ranking fifth in the nation in rebounding margin (+8.0), and pacing the Big Ten for the 12th time in the last 15 seasons, and the 13th time in his career.\n\n\n\nFor his efforts, Izzo was named the 2012 Big Ten Coach of the Year by both the league\u2019s media and coaches. He also was named Division I National Coach of the Year by the NABC, and was CBSSports.com\u2019s pick for national coach of the year as well.\n\n\n\nThe 2010-11 Spartans finished with a 19-15 mark and advanced to a 14th-straight NCAA Tournament. MSU faced a difficult regular-season schedule that included 18 of 33 games against the RPI Top 50 and 23 of 33 against the RPI Top 100.\n\n\n\nMichigan State turned in another great season in 2009-10, capturing a share of a second-straight Big Ten Championship and advancing to a sixth Final Four in 12 seasons. With MSU\u2019s 106-68 victory over UMass in the sixth game of the season, Izzo recorded his 341st victory, becoming Michigan State\u2019s all-time winningest coach. The Spartans opened Big Ten play with a school-best 9-0 start and captured a share of the regular-season crown with a 14-4 mark. Overall, MSU would finish with a 28-9 record.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans opened the 2010 NCAA Tournament as a No. 5 seed and advanced through the first weekend with narrow victories over New Mexico State (70-67) and Maryland (85-83). In the Midwest Regional, the Spartans won two more close games, defeating Northern Iowa (59-52) and Tennessee (70-69) to advance to the program\u2019s eighth Final Four and the sixth in the last 12 seasons under Izzo. Michigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the fourth time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +8.6 margin.\n\n\n\nThe 2008-09 season was one of the best in the history of Spartan basketball. Michigan State advanced to its fifth Final Four in 11 seasons, becoming just the fifth school in the history of college basketball to accomplish that feat. During the regular season, the Spartans won the Big Ten Championship with a 15-3 league record, including a school-best 8-1 mark on the road. MSU won the league title by four games, equaling the second-greatest margin in conference history. Overall, Michigan State finished the season with a 31-7 record, the third-highest win total in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the second time in his career.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Michigan State advanced through the first weekend with wins over Robert Morris and USC. In the Sweet 16, the Spartans took out defending National Champion Kansas. In the Elite Eight, MSU beat No. 1 seed and No. 1 ranked Louisville, marking just the third victory over the top-ranked team in The Associated Press Top 25 in school history. At the Final Four in Detroit\u2019s Ford Field, the Spartans beat No. 1 seed Connecticut before eventually falling to North Carolina in the title game.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the third time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +9.3 margin. It marked the eighth time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the top 10 in the nation. The Spartans also proved to possess a high-powered attack, leading the Big Ten in scoring offense (72.0 ppg).\n\n\n\nIzzo directed Michigan State to a 27-9 record in 2007-08. The season finished with a trip to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, marking MSU\u2019s seventh trip to the regionals in the last 11 years. The 27 wins marked the fifth-largest total in school history at the time, while the 24 regular-season victories were the then third-largest regular-season total for MSU. The Spartans were a perfect 17-0 at home, good for the first perfect home season since 2001 and the fourth in Breslin Center history.\n\n\n\nThe 2007-08 Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+6.8). In league games, MSU paced the conference in field-goal percentage (.474) for the fifth-straight season, becoming the first school in league history to accomplish that feat.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished with a 23-12 mark in 2006-07. The Spartans had to overcome a large amount of adversity and a very difficult Big Ten schedule to advance to a 10th-straight NCAA Tournament. The Spartans also did something for the first time in school history \u2013 recording Michigan State\u2019s first home win over a No. 1-ranked team, with a 64-55 decision over Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe 2006-07 Spartans excelled by getting back to basics \u2013 rebounding and defense. On the glass, the Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+7.0). Defensively, MSU allowed opponents just 57.2 points per game, the lowest total since the 1951-52 squad allowed 56.0 points. Opponents also shot just 38.4 percent from the field, the lowest percentage since 1958-59 (.379). Nationally, the Spartans ranked sixth in scoring defense and field-goal percentage defense and eighth in rebounding margin.\n\n\n\nIn 2005-06, Michigan State finished with a 22-12 mark. The Spartans played one of the nation\u2019s toughest schedules, playing more games against teams ranked in the RPI top-25 (13) and top-50 (18) than any other school. In Big Ten games, MSU led the conference in five stat categories including free-throw percentage (.781), field-goal percentage (.469), rebounding defense (30.1), rebounding margin (+4.2) and assists (15.81 apg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State returned to the Final Four in 2005, becoming the only team to appear in four Final Fours between 1999 and 2005. The Spartans finished the season with a 26-7 mark, including 22-5 in the regular season. Since joining the Big Ten, only three Spartan teams finished the regular season with fewer losses.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, MSU defeated No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kentucky in the Austin Regional, becoming the first team in tournament history to defeat the Blue Devils and the Wildcats in the same year. Despite losing to North Carolina in the Final Four, Izzo was named the 2005 Clair Bee Award winner, recognizing the Division I men\u2019s basketball coach who has made the most significant positive contribution to his sport.\n\n\n\nNot only did the 2004-05 Spartans win, they were also statistically impressive, ranking in the top 15 nationally in six statistical categories, including free-throw percentage (3rd, .777), scoring margin (7th, +13.1), assists per game (10th, 17.1 apg), field-goal percentage (11th, .487), rebound margin (11th, +6.8) and scoring offense (13th, 78.5 ppg). MSU led the Big Ten in scoring for the second-straight year with 78.5 points per game \u2013 its highest scoring average since 1985-86 (83.1 ppg).\n\n\n\nDuring the season, Izzo recorded his 232nd win at MSU, moving past Benjamin Van Alstyne for the second most number of career wins in Spartan coaching history. In the summer of 2005, Izzo traveled to Kuwait to take part in \u201cOperation Hardwood - Hoops With The Troops.\u201d Izzo was one of eight coaches and sports personalities coaching 13-member military basketball teams on Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, from Aug. 27-31. Camp Arifjan defeated the other bases to win the championship under the direction of Coach Izzo. Izzo made a return trip to Kuwait in May 2006.\n\n\n\nIn 2003-04, MSU opened the season with a 5-7 mark after taking on one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in NCAA history. Rather than give up, Izzo and the Spartans rallied to win 12 of the next 15 games, finishing just one game out of first place in the Big Ten at 12-4. For the year, MSU posted an 18-12 mark. Michigan State became the first team in Big Ten history to lead the conference in scoring offense (71.3 ppg), field-goal percentage (.522), 3-point field-goal percentage (.434) and free-throw percentage (.777) in the same season.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2004, MSU defeated Iowa, 89-72, as Izzo recorded the 200th victory of his Spartan career, becoming just the third coach in MSU history to accomplish that feat. He also became the eighth head coach in NCAA history to record 200 wins in his first nine seasons. Ten days later, Izzo became just the third coach in Big Ten history to record 100 league wins in his first nine seasons, joining Bob Knight and Gene Keady as MSU defeated Minnesota, 69-58, on Feb. 14.\n\n\n\nThe 2002-03 season was a study in perseverance. Izzo rallied his team to win the final four regular-season games and eight of the last 10 conference games to finish 10-6 in the Big Ten, good for third place in the league. Michigan State made even bigger noise during the NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 seed Spartans easily dismissed Colorado in the first round, setting up a matchup with the No. 2 seed Florida Gators. The Spartans shocked many experts with a 68-46 victory in the Gators\u2019 home state. In the Sweet 16, MSU defeated defending national champion Maryland in a thrilling two-point game, before eventually falling to the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns in the Lone Star State.\n\n\n\nThe Elite Eight appearance was the fourth for MSU between 1999 and 2003. During that time period, no other school made more than two trips. In fact, since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, just six programs (Duke, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan State, North Carolina and UNLV) have advanced to four Elite Eights in any five-year period.\n\nThe 2001-02 season may prove to be one of Izzo\u2019s finest. Despite losing 81 percent of the scoring load from 2000-01, and having three key players miss several games with injuries, Izzo led the Spartans to a 10-6 Big Ten mark (19-12 overall), finishing just one game out of first place. MSU won 10 of the last 13 regular-season games and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIn 2000-01, Izzo earned NABC National Coach of the Year and District 11 Coach of the Year honors for leading MSU to its third straight Final Four and fourth straight regular-season Big Ten Championship. MSU became just the fourth school in Big Ten history to win four-straight league titles.\n\n\n\nMSU opened the season by winning its first 12 games to establish the best start in school history. On Dec. 25, 2000, the Spartans earned the top spot in The Associated Press Top 25, marking the first time they held the No. 1 position in the AP Poll since 1979. In Big Ten action, Michigan State posted a 13-3 record to win a share of the league crown. The Big Ten finale vs. Michigan marked Izzo\u2019s 100th Big Ten game. Through his first 100 games, Izzo posted a 72-28 mark, the fifth-best record in Big Ten history.\n\n\n\nIn the 2001 NCAA Tournament, Izzo guided the Spartans to a third-straight Final Four. For a third consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed. MSU won the first three games by double figures, establishing a record with nine straight NCAA Tournament victories by double digits. When MSU defeated Temple, 69-62, in the South Regional Final, the Spartans became just the ninth school to reach three-straight Final Fours and just the third since the NCAA Tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. On the season, MSU finished with a 28-5 record.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebound margin for the second straight season at +15.4 boards per game, tying the fifth-largest margin in Division I history (greatest since 1980). The Spartans also ranked 13th in the nation in scoring defense (61.8 ppg).\n\n\n\nIn 1999-2000, Michigan State captured the second NCAA Championship in school history and its third straight regular season Big Ten Championship. MSU also won at least 30 games for the second straight season, posting a 32-7 mark, becoming just the second Big Ten school to accomplish that feat. The 65 wins over the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons were the greatest two-year total in the history of the Big Ten. MSU also repeated as Big Ten Tournament champions.\n\n\n\nIzzo led MSU to consecutive Final Fours for the first time in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named USBWA District V Coach of the Year and NABC District 11 Coach of the Year. Izzo also recorded his 100th career victory in a Jan. 11, 2000, 77-71 overtime win over Indiana in the Breslin Center.\n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. After disposing of Valparaiso and Utah in Cleveland, the Spartans moved on to the Sweet 16 at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where they recorded come-from-behind victories versus Syracuse and Iowa State. In the Final Four, MSU defeated Wisconsin for the fourth time that season. The Spartans then captured their second NCAA title in school history, defeating Florida, 89-76.\n\n\n\nIn 1998-99, Izzo directed the Spartans on a magical run to the program\u2019s first appearance in the NCAA Final Four since 1979. Michigan State posted a record of 33-5, establishing a school record for most wins in a season. For his efforts, Izzo was named the Basketball Times National Coach of the Year and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 11 Coach of the Year. Throughout the Big Ten season, Michigan State established itself as the class program of the conference. Izzo directed the school to its second-straight Big Ten title. The Spartans followed up a 15-1 Big Ten regular season by capturing their first Big Ten Tournament championship. The 15 league wins tied a school record for most victories in conference play, while the Spartans\u2019 93.8 winning percentage established a school record.\n\n\n\nWhereas MSU\u2019s success in 1998-99 was expected, the Spartans took the college basketball world by storm in 1997-98. Izzo became the first MSU coach to earn Associated Press National Coach of the Year honors, leading MSU to a 22-8 record and a share of the Big Ten title. The Spartans posted a 13-3 mark in conference, earning Izzo Big Ten Coach of the Year honors.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the 1997-98 season, Izzo and his team finished the year ranked No. 10 nationally by USA Today/ESPN, marking the first time the Spartans had finished in the Top 10 since 1995. In addition to his AP award, Izzo was named National Coach of the Year by Basketball News and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Basketball Times selected Izzo as its Mideast Coach of the Year.\n\n\n\nDuring Izzo\u2019s first season as head coach in 1995-96, he directed the Green and White to an overall slate of 16-16, including 9-9 in the Big Ten. Izzo recorded four wins over Top 25 teams. In 1996-97, Izzo guided the Green and White cagers to an overall mark of 17-12, including a Big Ten ledger of 9-9. Izzo led the Spartans to the second round of the NIT in each of his first two seasons.\n\n\n\nIn his 40th season as a member of the MSU coaching staff, Izzo has been with the Spartan program since taking a part-time assistant coaching position in 1983. An assistant coach with the Spartans from 1983-86, Izzo left MSU in May of 1986 to become the top assistant and recruiting coordinator at Tulsa. But, on June 10 of the same year, Izzo returned to East Lansing when Spartan assistant Mike Deane left to become head coach at Siena College.\n\n\n\nKnown as a tireless worker both on the recruiting trail and in the office, his hard work and loyalty were rewarded in July 1990, when Jud Heathcote appointed him associate head coach. His dutiful efforts were further recognized when, on March 30, 1993, then-MSU Athletics Director Merrily Dean Baker recommended both a one-year contract extension for Heathcote through the 1994-95 season and that Izzo be appointed head coach upon Jud\u2019s retirement. The MSU Board of Trustees accepted both recommendations on April 9, 1994.\n\nIzzo originally came to MSU from Northern Michigan, where he had been an assistant from 1979-83. He was named a part-time assistant at MSU in September 1983. When former assistant Edgar Wilson left in November 1983, Izzo became a full-time assistant.\n\n\n\nIzzo played guard for NMU\u2019s basketball team from 1973-77, and was voted the team\u2019s MVP as a senior. He was also a third-team Division II All-America pick that year and established the Wildcat record for most minutes played in a season. Following his graduation from NMU in 1977, Izzo took over as head coach at Ishpeming High School and served in that position for the 1977-78 campaign.\n\n\n\nA native of Iron Mountain, Michigan, Izzo and former NFL head coach Steve Mariucci were Iron Mountain High School teammates in football, basketball, baseball and track. As college roommates at Northern Michigan, Izzo walked on to the basketball team, while Mariucci did the same with football. Both would go on to earn Division II All-America honors. Despite their busy schedules, they remain the closest of friends. For 10 years, they co-hosted a golf tournament in Iron Mountain to raise money for the community, including a fitness center for the high school.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Izzo was inducted into the Northern Michigan University Hall of Fame and was selected as an inductee into the Upper Peninsula Hall of Fame during the summer of 1998. He was inducted into the National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2011, and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. He received the sport\u2019s ultimate honor when his election into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was announced on April 4, 2016. He was officially enshrined in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 9, 2016.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Izzo received honorary degrees from both Northern Michigan and Michigan State, delivering the commencement address at both graduation ceremonies.\n\n\n\nIzzo is also an active volunteer in the community. Among his many efforts, he is very active with Coaches Vs. Cancer, Volunteers of America and Sparrow Hospital. In 2009, Izzo was presented the Coaches Vs. Cancer Champion Award, recognizing his work and leadership in the fight to save lives from cancer.\n\n\n\nIzzo and his wife, Lupe, created the Izzo Legacy Fund in 2019 to formalize their commitment to the Mid-Michigan community. The Izzo Legacy Fund helps to raise money and contributions to charitable causes in the area.\n\n\n\nIzzo was born Jan. 30, 1955. His family includes his wife, Lupe, daughter, Raquel, and son, Steven.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/2023/01/30/michigan-state-university-honors-basketball-coach-tom-izzo-on-68th-birthday/", "page_content": "FILE - Michigan State coach Tom Izzo shouts during the second half of the team's NCAA college basketball game against Wisconsin at the Big Ten Conference men's tournament Friday, March 11, 2022, in Indianapolis.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings, File)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. \u2013 On Monday, the Spartans are celebrating the birthday of Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo.\n\nIzzo has been with the Spartans for 28 years and has a long list of accomplishments. Over the past 25 years, he has compiled a 633-239 record, which included a 53-game winning streak.\n\nThe head coach was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2015 after leading the Spartans to eight Final Four appearances.

MSU announced several staff changes to the 2021-2022 staff, including bringing back several former players.\n\nWe are excited to announce some updates to our 2021-22 staff \u2014 Michigan State Basketball (@MSU_Basketball) June 7, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited to make the announcement for our staff for next season,\u201d Izzo said in a press release. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had some change in our staff in a while, but I think we have some great experience and it means even more when former players want to return to campus to be a part of building our future.\n\n\u201cDwayne Stephens is one of our mainstays and will remain as our associate head coach while overseeing the entire staff and bringing together a group I am really excited to work with as we start the new season.\u201d\n\nWhile Stephens remains as associate head coach, and Mike Garland remains as the other assistant coach, Doug Wojcik moves into the third assistant coaching role. Wojcik takes over for Dane Fife, who left to take an assistant coaching job with the Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nWojcik being promoted to assistant coach was reported back in April, but is now official. Wojcik spent the past three seasons with the Spartans as recruiting coordinator. He previously served as an assistant coach on Izzo\u2019s staff for two seasons from 2003 through 2005, and helped lead the Spartans to a 2005 Final Four appearance. He went on to become head coach of Tulsa from 2005 through 2012, and then head coach at the College of Charleston from 2012 until August of 2014, when Wojcik was fired after an investigation into allegations that he verbally abused his players. Despite the allegations, Wojcik is a trusted member of Izzo\u2019s staff.\n\nAs recruiting coordinator, Wojcik was instrumental in helping Michigan State earn a national top-10 class in 2021, which includes Max Christie, Jaden Akins and Pierre Brooks II. Christie and Brooks both recently earned Gatorade Player of the Year honors in their respective states.\n\n\u201cDoug has been a vital part of our success over the last three years since he returned to East Lansing,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cAs our director of recruiting, he was the lead for us with an incoming recruiting class that is among the top in the nation. I\u2019ve known Doug for more than 20 years and he\u2019s one of the best basketball minds I know. It was natural for him to move into our assistant coaching position when that opened. He\u2019s got tremendous experience, is a man of incredible character and has a work ethic that is unmatched.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, former Spartan player and assistant coach Mark Montgomery returns to the program. He will take over Wojcik\u2019s old post as recruiting coordinator, which is quite frankly an excellent hire by Izzo.\n\nMontgomery played at MSU for Jud Heathcote from 1988 through 1992. After playing professionally in Europe for a few years, Montgomery got his start as an assistant coach at Central Michigan for then head coach Jay Smith. Montgomery then returned to his alma mater in East Lansing in 2001 and stayed through the 2011 season. He helped guide MSU to Final Four appearances in 2005, 2009 and 2010. Montgomery went on take the head coaching job at Northern Illinois in 2011, but was fired in January 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen we knew we were going to have openings on the staff after last season, Monty was one of the guys I had in mind,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe played here under Jud and was on my staff for 10 years when we really got things going. As a head coach for 10 years and someone who has more than 20 years of experience recruiting in college basketball, he will be a great fit for us as a recruiting coordinator.\u201d\n\nTwo former Spartan players who played for Izzo are also making a return to Michigan State. As we covered last week, Austin Thornton joins the staff as video coordinator, taking over for Drew Denisco who departed to take an assistant coaching job at Eastern Michigan. Meanwhile, Matt McQuaid is coming on as assistant director of basketball operations.\n\n\u201cAustin Thornton is one of the hardest working and most humble players I have coached during my time at Michigan State,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cI loved having him on staff as a graduate assistant and he\u2019s worked really hard on the high school level to get himself ready to take a college job. It\u2019s great to have him back.\u201d\n\nThornton most recently served as head coach for the freshman and varsity boys basketball teams at Sparta High School in Michigan. He played for MSU from 2007 through 2012 and was a two-time team captain, while being a part of teams that reached two Final Fours and won three Big Ten Championships. He also served as a graduate assistant for Izzo from 2015 through 2017.\n\nMcQuaid was a captain as a senior for the 2019 Michigan State Final Four team, and earned honorable mention All-Big Ten and Big Ten All-Defensive Team honors that season. He was also part of Michigan State squads that won back-to-back Big Ten regular season titles in 2018 and 2019, and two Big Ten Tournament titles in 2016 and 2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to have Matt back with us and he really is excited to be on staff and start his professional career,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great addition and someone who can relate to our players. I think this is the start of what could be a great career for Matt.\u201d\n\nAs assistant director of basketball operations, McQuaid will now work under Garrett Briningstool who takes over for David Thomas as director of operations. Briningstool, who spent the past two seasons as Izzo\u2019s executive assistant, will also serve as chief of staff. The Spartans also announced Julian Stall as director of creative video after working with MSU Athletics Spartan Vision the past four years.\n\nAs for Thomas, who was a member of the 2000 Michigan State men\u2019s basketball national championship team, he is leaving the program after six seasons. Thomas is moving on to work at Podium Risk Management, \u201cone of the leading brands in financial services with a concentrated focus on serving professional athletes.\u201d Paul Davis, another former Spartan standout basketball player, is a partner at the company.\n\nIzzo is sad to see Thomas leave, but excited for his future:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet to see DT leave, but I\u2019m also very happy for him, Toni and his family,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s been such a big part of our program for the last 20 years, first with a successful playing career here and being part of three Final Four teams, four Big Ten Championships, and, of course, a national championship team. Over the last six seasons, since he returned as our director of operations, he has been one of the faces for our program and someone everyone immediately recognizes and loves for the person he is. We\u2019re really going to miss his presence around here, but know that he\u2019ll be back and that he is, truly, forever a Spartan.\u201d\n\nFull staff changes:"}, {"url": "https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state-university/2021/06/07/michigan-state-spartans-mens-basketball-finalizes-coaching-staff/7585713002/", "page_content": "Stability has long been the calling card for Tom Izzo\u2019s staff at Michigan State.\n\nBut when associate head coach Dane Fife left this offseason for Indiana, it forced the Spartans to make some changes.

Over the last six seasons, since he returned as our director of operations, he has been one of the faces for our program and someone everyone immediately recognizes and loves for the person he is. We\u2019re really going to miss his presence around here, but know that he\u2019ll be back and that he is, truly, forever a Spartan.\"\n\nMichigan State also announced the hiring of Julian Stall, who joins the team as director of creative video after serving the last four years as part of the MSU Athletics Spartan Vision Team.\n\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @mattcharboneau"}, {"url": "https://www.theonlycolors.com/2022/8/11/23302117/michigan-state-spartans-mens-basketball-head-coach-tom-izzo-agrees-to-new-contract", "page_content": "Michigan State men\u2019s basketball head coach Tom Izzo is staying in East Lansing for a little while longer.\n\nWhile questions about Izzo\u2019s potential retirement have emerged in recent years, Izzo renewed his \u201cSpartan For Life\u201d commitment, which he declared in 2010, by agreeing to terms on a new five-year rollover contract. Alan Haller, MSU\u2019s vice president and director of athletics, announced the news on Thursday.\n\nBefore the contract becomes official, it requires formal approval by the MSU Board of Trustees at their next meeting on Sept. 9.

When you look at the last 10-12 seasons in men\u2019s basketball and football, both under Coach (Mark) Dantonio and Coach (Mel) Tucker, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a school with more success. But I know the best is yet to come \u2013 not only for our two programs, but for the entire department. This is an exciting time for Michigan State and there\u2019s no better place to be in college athletics, with the support we have from the University, our students, our community and the tremendous Spartan alumni. I love Michigan State and I am proud and excited to continue the hard work to bring another national championship to East Lansing.\u201d\n\nIzzo\u2019s five-year rollover contract includes non-performance related compensation of $5.92 million per year. That includes a $2.43 million base salary, $3.09 million in supplemental compensation and $400,000 from Nike, which provides footwear and apparel. The total compensation of the deal, which includes airplane use and additional fringe benefits, is about $6.2 million per year. Izzo is one of the top-three highest-paid coaches in men\u2019s basketball, along with Bill Self (Kansas) and John Calipari (Kentucky), according to USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cTwelve years ago, Tom Izzo said he would be a Spartan for Life, and today\u2019s announcement further demonstrates and renews this commitment,\u201d Haller said. \u201cWe have worked collaboratively to come up with a contract which benefits the University, Coach Izzo and his family.\n\n\u201cNot only is Tom Izzo a Hall of Fame basketball coach, he\u2019s a terrific ambassador for Michigan State University and Spartan Athletics. He means a great deal to our university, our department, our community and Spartans around the world. Although his legacy is cemented with a championship-filled resume, it\u2019s very clear that Coach Izzo\u2019s hungry to accomplish even more and bring great pride to Spartans everywhere. Michigan State is beyond lucky to have Tom Izzo as our head basketball coach!\u201d\n\nIzzo enters his 28th season at Michigan State in 2022-2023. A Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer (inducted in 2016), Izzo has a career record of 666-267. He holds the record for the most total victories as a head coach at a Big Ten school.\n\nIzzo has won one NCAA national championship (2000), has 10 regular-season Big Ten championships, six Big Ten Tournament titles, eight Final Four appearances and eight National Coach of the Year awards. He has also led MSU to a Big Ten-record 24 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\n\u201cWe greatly appreciate Coach Izzo\u2019s commitment to our outstanding University and his competitive drive to keep Spartan Basketball as a national powerhouse,\u201d Michigan State President Samuel L. Stanley Jr., said. \u201cHe is a committed Spartan, full of pride for all that we do \u2013 for all our athletics programs and student athletes, but also for our academic programs and every single student on our campus. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, we are all grateful for his continued leadership at MSU.\u201d\n\nIzzo has also been strongly working on the future of his program, as Michigan State\u2019s 2023 recruiting class currently ranks No. 3 in the country. It includes commitments from five-star power forward Xavier Booker, four-star forward Coen Carr, four-star point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. and four-star shooting guard/small forward Gehrig Normand.\n\nMichigan State will open the 2022-2023 season at home on Nov. 7 against Northern Arizona, and later, play Gonzaga on the USS Abraham Lincoln in San Diego on Nov. 11. The Spartans then take on Kentucky on Nov. 15 in the Champions Classic in Indianapolis.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 29: Izzo\u2019s contract also includes an option for Izzo to have a post-retirement role with Michigan State University as a \u201cspecial advisor\u201d to the athletic director."}, {"url": "https://www.theonlycolors.com/2021/10/21/22732348/michigan-state-spartans-mens-basketball-tom-izzo-the-old-guard", "page_content": "Tom Izzo has been an integral part of the Michigan State basketball program for almost four decades now and he has been its main man for the better part of 26 years (the 2021-2022 campaign will be his 27th season at the helm). During that time, he has guided the Spartans to almost unprecedented highs, made MSU a national brand and has impacted probably as many lives off of the court as his teams have scored points on it. But even a great man and incredibly successful head coach like Izzo will one day face an opponent that even he won\u2019t be able to outmaneuver \u2014 Father Time himself.\n\nThis formidable foe reminded college basketball of his power most recently when three prominent head coaches in Mike Krzyzewski (following the end of the 2021-2022 season), Roy Williams and Lon Kruger called it quits in a matter of just a few months. These are men who have left their mark on this game in a similar manner or even more so than Izzo did, and they are also the reason why he had to face some questions regarding his own future lately. Much to the excitement of Spartan Nation, though, Izzo was quick to debunk any retirement talk, stating that he has \u201cno intentions in following in some of my compadres\u2018 footsteps\u201d and that he is \u201ca little leery of where our profession is going right now,\u201d but that he has a lot of \u201clove for my job.\u201d\n\nNow the ultimate goal for Izzo is clear as well, and he has said on numerous occasions that he wants to chase that elusive second national championship. Recently he also made it clear that he feels as good physically as he has in about 10 years \u2014 using the downtime during the COVID lockdown to get in better shape \u2014 and that he will only ponder retirement when he doesn\u2019t love what he is doing anymore. While that point seems to be quite a few years away, there is no denying the toll that college basketball takes on a man north of 60 years old (Izzo is 66 years old right now).\n\nIn addition to the actual games, there are things to consider, like flights all across the country, recruiting, keeping up with high school and college students, the practices, the media obligations and many more activities that the public rarely even recognizes. All of these things aren\u2019t only time-consuming, but for a man like Izzo who is heavily invested emotionally in many of his endeavors and into the people he is dealing with, this lifestyle is married with an enormous amount of stress and mental sacrifice. Whoever wants to get an idea of that just has to look at Izzo\u2019s Grand Canyon of eye bags every March when he probably gets about 20 minutes of sleep and studies as much film on a nightly basis as all Academy Award judges in the history of the Oscars combined. If they actually watch the films that is, of course.\n\nYet as of now, luckily for every Spartan, Izzo is enjoying every minute of his job and still has a lot of basketball, accomplishments and years in front of him. With some big names from the coaching profession leaving the sport in recent years, it might be interesting to look at some of them and how they did with their teams after the age of 66. Did age cause them to not win as many games with their teams, or is age also just a number for superstar head coaches?\n\nIs there any limit on where coaches can seriously win in college basketball? Or is it possible for coaches to win big north of the age of 70, maybe? How does Izzo compare to the guys he has battled for many years and who are comparable with him in the sense of their major accomplishments and longevity?\n\nHere is a partial list of the \u201cold\u201d guard and how they did in the \u201ctwilight years\u201d of their careers, if you will. While the situations, of course, aren\u2019t exactly comparable due to roster differences and varying circumstances, it should still nonetheless tell us a bit about what we might expect in the next few years, and that age shouldn\u2019t be a factor, per se, in determining Izzo\u2019s capability of guiding a successful program.\n\nMike Krzyzewski (74 years old)\n\nEver heard of that guy? Following the 2021-2022 season, Coach K is leaving college basketball as one of the most iconic figures that the sport has ever seen, and also as one of its most accomplished coaches. After his age-66 season, he still guided the Duke Blue Devils for eight more seasons and even won a national title when he was 68 years old. On average, Krzyzewski won 26.6 games in the last eight years of his career, even though that number is slightly affected by his last COVID-shortened campaign in 2020-2021. He also reached two Elite Eights and one Sweet Sixteen during that stretch.\n\nRoy Williams (71 years old)\n\nRoy Williams has coached two big time programs during his career with the Kansas Jayhawks and most recently the North Carolina Tar Heels. He like Coach K also won a national championship towards the end of his career (the last of his three) when he was 66 years old. Over the course of his last five seasons in Chapel Hill he averaged 23.6 wins per year, a number clearly affected by the 2019-20 campain where the Tar Heels only amassed 14 wins. Last year UNC also just got 18 wins in total and bowed out in the first year of the NCAAs.\n\nJim Boeheim (76 years old)\n\nBoeheim\u2019s case is a hard one to judge since there are plenty of wins taken away from him in regard to certain NCAA sanctions. Yet, the Syracuse legend still managed to stay extremely steady in recent years, never finishing with less than 18 wins since 2010. While he \u201conly\u201c averaged 21.6 wins over that period, he had remarkable success in the postseason, constantly outperforming his seed with the Orange. Syracuse made two Final Fours, one Elite Eight and two Sweet Sixteens during the last decade. Boeheim has no plans to retire anytime soon.\n\nJim Calhoun (79 years old)\n\nAfter retiring from his position at UConn in 2012 due to fighting spinal stenosis, Calhoun started to coach again in 2018 at the University of Saint Joseph, a Division III school. In regard to Izzo, his last four seasons with the Huskies are fairly interesting since they represented exactly the age years that Izzo is entering now. Calhoun twice won over 30 games and twice finished with 18 wins. He won a national championship in 2011 at the age of 69 and reached another Final Four two years prior, losing to Michigan State in the semifinals in Detroit \u2014 fun to remember for every Spartan.\n\nBob Knight (80 years old)\n\n\u201cThe general\u201c only coached for one-and-a-half seasons after his 66th birthday, and while his last days at Texas Tech didn\u2019t come close to his legendary achievements with Indiana decades earlier, Knight certainly lifted the Red Raiders out of their conference\u2019s basement. His last full season had Knight win 21 games and lose with TTU in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. All in all, Knight coached for 42 seasons, winning 902 games.\n\nLon Kruger (69 years old)\n\nKruger hasn\u2019t won a national championship during his career, but he still created an impressive legacy that also saw him coach in the NBA for a few years. Kruger spent the last three years of his career at Oklahoma and he guided the Sooners to 20, 19 and 16 wins, respectively, after his 66th birthday. He reached the NCAA Tournament twice and most likely would have participated with his team if the 2020 Tourney wouldn\u2019t have been cancelled.\n\nHow does Izzo compare?\n\nThere were other big names coaches like Dean Smith, who retired at the age of 66, or Adolph Rupp who coached six more seasons successfully at Kentucky, averaging 22.8 wins during a time where there were fewer games overall. Rupp also guided his team into three Elite Eights and two Sweet Sixteens during that stretch.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting in regard to Izzo is that in terms of his total number of seasons, he hasn\u2019t been active as long as many of the other legendary coaches. He sits in 45th place overall with 643 wins in 26 seasons, yet of all the coaches in front of him, only Bill Self (28 years, 729 wins) and John Wooden (29 years, 664 wins) have been a head coach for less than 30 years. Meanwhile, 14 coaches have exceeded 40 seasons of coaching and Phog Allen even coached for 50 years while also overseeing the football and baseball programs at Kansas for a few years. Interestingly, the six coaches coming in behind Izzo on the list also have all coached for more than 30 years.\n\nNow as mentioned earlier, these numbers don\u2019t really mean a lot to the individual, but they still show that many men had tremendous success in college basketball not only after their 66th birthday, but also after their 26th season in the profession.\n\nIzzo also seems to still get plenty of strong recruits and is just a few years removed from a Final Four season. A lot can change in the future of course and you\u2019ll never know what circumstances might impact his decision for retirement one day. But all in all, age shouldn\u2019t prevent Tom Izzo from anything he wants to do in East Lansing and certainly won\u2019t keep him from continuing to do all the great things he has done for the majority of 26 years now. And no matter how many years are still to come, Spartan Nation should and most likely will be grateful for every single one."}, {"url": "https://coachtube.com/users/tomizzo", "page_content": "About\n\nNCAA Division I Tournament Championship (2000)\n\n6 NCAA Regional Championships \u2013 Final Four (1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010)\n\n7 Big 10 Championships (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2009, 2010, 2012)\n\n4 Big 10 Tournament Championships (1999, 2000, 2012, 2014)\n\n\n\nAccomplishments\n\n8 Elite Eight (1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2014)\n\n12 Sweet Sixteens (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014)\n\n17 NCAA Tournament bids (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014)\n\n\n\nAwards\n\n1 AP National Coach of the Year (1998)\n\n1 Henry Iba Coach of the Year (1998)\n\n3 Big Ten Coach of the Year (1998, 2009, 2012)\n\n\n\nTom Izzo is the head men\u2019s basketball coach at Michigan State University, a position he assumed in 1995.
