{"Billy Burke died at the age of 86.": [{"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2020/01/billy-burke-golfer.html", "page_content": "Billy Burke was a PGA Tour winner from the 1920s into the 1940s. He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.thecelebritydeaths.com/billie-burkes-death-cause-and-date/", "page_content": "The movie actress Billie Burke died at the age of 85.

Her father was a circus clown, and as a child she toured the United States and Europe with the circus (before motion pictures and after the stage, circuses were the biggest form of entertainment in the world). One could say that Billie was bred for show business. Her family ultimately settled in London, where she was fortunate to see plays in the city's historic West End, and decided she wanted to be a stage actress. At age 18, she made her stage debut and her career was off and running. Her performances were very well received and she became one of the most popular actresses to grace the stage. Broadway beckoned, and since New York City was now recognized as the stage capital of the world, it was there she would try her luck. Billie came to New York when she was 22 and her momentum did not stop. She appeared in numerous plays and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling, which is exactly what happened. She made her film debut in the lead role in Peggy (1916). The film was a hit, but then again most films were, as the novelty of motion pictures had not worn off since The Great Train Robbery (1903) at the turn of the century. Later that year, she appeared in Gloria's Romance (1916). In between cinema work, she would take her place on the stage because not only was it her first love, but she had speaking parts. Billie considered herself more than an actress--she felt she was an artist, too. She believed that the stage was a way to personally reach out to an audience, something that could not be done in pictures. In 1921, she appeared as Elizabeth Banks in The Education of Elizabeth (1921), then she retired. She had wed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. of the famed Ziegfeld Follies and, with investments in the stock market, there was no need to work.What the Ziegfelds did not plan on was \"Black October\" in 1929. Their stock investments were wiped out in the crash, which precipitated the Great Depression, and Billie had no choice but to return to the screen. Movies had become even bigger than ten years earlier, especially since the introduction of sound. Her first role of substance was as Margaret Fairlfield in A Bill of Divorcement (1932). As an artist, she loved the fact that she had dialog, but she had to work even harder because her husband had died the same year as her speaking debut - and work she did. One of her career highlights came as Mrs. Millicent Jordan in David O. Selznick's Dinner at Eight (1933), co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, John Barrymore and Jean Harlow - heady company to be sure, but Billie turned in an outstanding performance as Mrs. Jordan, the scatterbrained wife of a man whose shipping company is in financial trouble and who was trying to get someone to loan his company money to help stave off disaster. Her character loved to give dinner parties because a dinner affair at the Jordans had a reputation among New York blue-blood society as the highlight of the season. With all the drama and intrigue going on around her, her main concern is that she is one man short of having a full seating arrangement. The film was a hit and once again Billie was back on top. In 1937, she had one of her most fondly remembered roles in Topper (1937), a film that would ultimately spin off two sequels, and all three were box-office hits. In 1938, Billie received her first and only Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938). This was probably the best performance of her screen career, but she was destined to be immortalized forever in the classic The Wizard of Oz (1939). At 54 years of age - and not looking anywhere near it - she played Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. The 1940s saw Billie busier than ever--she made 25 films between 1940 and 1949. She made only six in the 1950s, as her aging became noticeable. She was 75 when she made her final screen appearance as Cordelia Fosgate in John Ford's Western Sergeant Rutledge (1960). Billie retired for good and lived in Los Angeles, California, where she died at age 85 of natural causes on May 14, 1970."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/billie-burke", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nBillie Burke (Mary William Ethelbert Appleton Burke) was born on 7 August, 1884 in Washington, District of Columbia, USA, is an Actress, Soundtrack.

Burke died at the age of 85 on May 14, 1970 in Los Angeles, CA and was laid to rest in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County, NY.\n\nEarly Life and London Career\n\n\n\nBillie Burke was born Mary William Ethelbert Appleton Burke on August 7th, 1884 in Washington, D.C straight into the life of show business. Her father, Willy Burke was a successful circus clown and singer who toured with the famed Barnum Bailey circus. Due to her father's vocation, little Billie spent her most formative years touring across the country and Europe with her father. Her family eventually settled in London, where Billie became infatuated with the West End and the theater in general. Burke's early infatuation eventually grew into a burn passion and soon she knew she was meant to follow in her father's footsteps to become an entertainer. In 1902 she made her stage debut as singer in London's famed Pavilion Music Hall. She quickly moved from singing to acting, making her acting debut with a small role in The School Girl. Thanks to her personal charm and excellent comedic timing, Burke was able to follow that up with successful runs in other London shows such as The Duchess of Dantzic and Blue Moon.\n\nBroadway and the Silent Screen\n\nAfter several well-received performances in London, Burke decided to give the Great White Way a shot and moved back to the States. She made her Broadway debut with a strong supporting role in the 1907 Michael Morton penned My Wife. The play was commercial and critical success with many critics praising Burke's performance. She quickly became a regular sight on the comedic stage, starring in a strong of successful Broadway shows such as Mrs. Dot, Suzanne, The Runway and The Land of Promise. During this time Burke also began a romance with the successful producer Florenz Ziegfeld, whom she would marry in 1914.\n\nLike many successful stage star, by the mid-1910s Burke decided to give the burgeoning motion picture business a try. She made silver screen debut in Charles Giblyn/Thomas H. Ince comedy Peggy. The film was a huge success as was Burke with many critics singling her out as the films highlight. She then went on to star in the 15-part serial Gloria's Romance. Although the series as a whole lost money, it was still a popular hit with audiences and critics. Burke quickly became one of biggest stars of the silver screen, right up there with Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, and Irene Castle. She continued to appear in big screen hit such as Arms and the Girl, The Land of Promise, The Make-Believe Wife and Good Gracious, and Annabelle.\n\nAlthough the movie business increased her popularity, Burke's first love was the theatre. She continued to act on Broadway with hits such as A Marriage of Convenience, The Rescued Angel, and The Intimate Stranger. By the 19922 she had abandoned the screen all together to focus on her stage career in plays like Rose Briar, Annie Dear, and The Happy Husband. During this time her cosmopolitan costumes and personal wardrobe also made her fashion trendsetter and beloved member of polite society.\n\nFinancial Distress and a return to the Silver Screen\n\nThanks to their stock market investments, Burke and Ziegfeld were able to live a lavish lifestyle during much of the 1920s. However after the stock market crash of 1929, most of their fortune was wiped out. Burke then returned to the big screen to help their ailing financial state. She made her silver screen return as Katherine Hepburn's mother in the George Cukor drama A Bill of Divorcement. Although she found the new world of talking pictures much more artistically satisfying than the silent pictures she had starred in the past, her husband passed away during the films production. Ever the professional, she quickly returned to filming. The next year she starred as the scatterbrained wife throwing a dinner social in George Cukor's comedy-of-manner Dinner at Eight. The film was great hit with many critics and filmgoers praising Burke's zany performance. Soon she was appearing in multiple films years, often playing a scatterbrained but well-meaning woman of society in films such as Finishing School, Society Doctor, She Couldn't Take It and My American Wife. In 1937 she appeared in one of her more memorable roles as the high society wife of Mr. Topper in Norman Z. McLeod popular comedy Topper. The next year she earned an Academy Award nomination for her role as Emily Kilbourne in the comedy Merrily We Live. During this time she also kept her Broadway ties by producer the Ziegfeld Follies shows after her husbands death.\n\nIn 1939 she appeared in what is no doubt her most memorable big screen role as the cheery Good Witch of the North, Gilda. The film was not only one great hits of 1939, but has since become one of the most iconic pieces of American culture. That year she also appeared four more films, Zenobia, Bridal Suite, Eternally Yours, and Remember?. She would maintain her busy schedule into the next decade, appearing in seven films in 1940 including The Ghost Comes Home, Irene, and Hullabloo.
