It is a cultural and financial centre of the western United States and one of the country\u2019s most cosmopolitan cities. Area 46 square miles (120 square km). Pop. (2010) 805,235; San Francisco\u2013San Mateo\u2013Redwood City Metro Division, 1,776,095; San Francisco\u2013Oakland\u2013Fremont Metro Area, 4,335,391; (2020) 873,965; San Francisco\u2013San Mateo\u2013Redwood City Metro Division, 1,638,407; San Francisco\u2013Oakland\u2013Berkeley Metro Area, 4,749,008.\n\nCharacter of the city\n\nSan Francisco holds a secure place in the United States\u2019 romantic dream of itself\u2014a cool, elegant, handsome, worldly seaport whose steep streets offer breathtaking views of one of the world\u2019s greatest bays. According to the dream, San Franciscans are sophisticates whose lives hold full measures of such civilized pleasures as music, art, and good food. Their children are to be pitied, for, as the wife of publishing magnate Nelson Doubleday once said, \u201cThey will probably grow up thinking all cities are so wonderful.\u201d To San Franciscans their city is a magical place, almost an island, saved by its location and history from the sprawl and monotony that afflicts so much of urban California.\n\nSince World War II, however, San Francisco has had to face the stark realities of urban life: congestion, air and water pollution, violence and vandalism, and the general decay of the inner city. San Francisco\u2019s makeup has been changing as families, mainly white and middle-class, have moved to its suburbs, leaving the city to a population that, viewed statistically, tends to be older and to have fewer married people. Now more than one of every two San Franciscans is \u201cnonwhite\u201d\u2014in this case African American, East Asian, Filipino, Samoan, Vietnamese, Latin American, or Native American. Their dreams increasingly demand a realization that has little to do with the romantic dream of San Francisco. But both the dreams and the realities are important, for they are interwoven in the fabric of the city that might be called Paradox-by-the-Bay.\n\nAlthough San Franciscans complain of the congestion, homelessness, and high cost of living that plague the city and talk endlessly of the good old days, the majority still think of San Francisco the way poet George Sterling did, as \u201cthe cool grey city of love,\u201d one of America\u2019s most attractive, colourful, and distinctive places to live."}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/julia-child-surprising-facts-2020-8", "page_content": "Julia Child later worked as a central intelligence assistant during World War II and developed a shark repellant used in war.\n\nAfter graduating, moving to New York, and being fired from her job in the advertising department of home furnishings company W. & J.
