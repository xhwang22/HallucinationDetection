Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.\n\nView details for DOI 10.4161/auto.19496\n\nView details for Web

Hsu later wrote about Deep Blue\u2019s development and ultimate victory in the book Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion.\n\nFeng-hsiung Hsu was born in Taiwan. While in junior high school he was given the nickname \u201cCrazy Bird\u201d. Feng is a homonym of the Mandarin for \u201ccrazy\u201d, and some classmates perceived him to be eccentric. The nickname would follow Hsu throughout his professional career. Hsu finished college in Taiwan and came to the U.S. in 1985 to pursue a Pd.D. in the field of computer chess at Carnegie Mellon University. After 6 months of intense lab work Hsu developed his first single-chip move generator which he named Chiptest.\n\nHsu\u2019s work on Chiptest became the basis for Deep Thought which won his computer chess team the Fredkin Intermediate Prize in 1988 for achieving grandmaster-level performance. Deep Thought was the first chess-playing computer ever to defeat human grandmasters in actual tournament play.\n\nThe following year IBM recruited Hsu to further develop Deep Thought. It was later renamed Deep Blue, IBM\u2019s play on its corporate nickname Big Blue for the match against world chess champ Garry Kasparov. Hsu\u2019s work on Deep Blue earned him the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1991.\n\nOn February 10, 1966 Deep Blue became the first machine to win a chess game against a reigning world champion. However, in the next five games the 33-year old Garry Kasparov won three and drew two to beat Deep Blue by a score of 4-2.\n\nTaking a brute-force approach for the rematch, Hsu\u2019s team doubled their supercomputer\u2019s processing power and gave it the code name \u201cDeeper Blue\u201d. On May 11 1997 Deeper Blue won the first of six games in the re-match against Kasparov. The next four games were draws, giving each player a half point. In the sixth game, Kasparov made a mistake in the opening, ensuring a draw and a final score of 3 1/2 to 2 1/2. Deep Blue became the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.\n\nAfter his loss Kasparov claimed there were moments when he saw \u201cdeep intelligence\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d in the machine\u2019s moves, implying that human players had intervened during the second game. IBM denied his accusations. Kasparov requested printouts of the machine\u2019s log files. IBM refused and dismantled Deep Blue. The company later published the logs on the internet.\n\nIn his book Behind Deep Blue Hsu claimed that he had the rights to use the Deep Blue design to build a bigger machine to take Kasparov\u2019s rematch offer. Kasparov\u2019s people refused, saying that Hsu\u2019s offer was empty, with no sponsors, no money, no hardware or technical team and no guarantees of fair playing conditions or proper qualification matches. This response led to a series of heated correspondences between Hsu and Kasparov.\n\nHsu left IBM after 10 years to work briefly for Compaq before joining Microsoft to head up the Platform and Device Center at its Asia Research Center in Beijing. He lives with his wife, a venture capitalist. In recent years Hsu appears to have lost interest in \u201cbuilding the ultimate chess machine\u201d. He has turned his professional focus to algorithm design, parallel software design, high performance system architectures, VLSI design and special purpose computing."}, {"url": "https://www.scijournal.org/articles/famous-taiwanese-scientists", "page_content": "This post may contain affiliate links that allow us to earn a commission at no expense to you.

After surviving the cultural revolution of 1966-76, during which he gave many performances of the Yellow River Concerto, he left to pursue his career in the United States.\n\nA Washington Post review in 1989 reported that he played with \"a commanding athleticism born of grace and agility... His instincts run to big sounds and bold statements.\" Those who heard him at the Rubinstein competition in Israel in 1983, where he won the third gold medal, long remembered his sensational performances of the Tarantella from Liszt's Venezia e Napoli, and Chopin's Sonata No 2 in B flat minor.\n\nHis recordings, including mazurkas by Chopin and Beethoven's Moonlight sonata, reveal a spirited approach with an engaging rhythmic instinct and rich tone. He was small of stature and youthful in appearance; his friends describe him as a relaxed, cheerful and generous person, a \"man of faith\" who had a positive influence on all those around him.\n\nHsu was the son of a pastor on Gulangyu island, off the south-east coast of China. An idyllic enclave much influenced by Jesuit missionaries, the area earned the nickname of \"Piano Island\" because of its extraordinary number of pianos - more than 500 in the early 1950s. Hsu was a child prodigy, and, by the age of 14, had already performed Chopin's 24 Etudes.\n\nHe entered the Shanghai Conservatory, then China's most sought-after musical training ground (thanks to the impact of teachers from the great Russian tradition), but his studies came to an abrupt end when the college was closed down during the cultural revolution. His last teacher died in Hsu's arms after being brutally tortured by Red Guards.\n\nBanished to the countryside, Hsu worked on a rice farm and in a factory; his friend, the pianist Hung-Kuan Chen, who won second prize at the Rubinstein competition when Hsu won third, recalled that Hsu never regained the same flexibility in his fingers after his banishment.\n\nHe was, however, summoned back to the piano to perform the Yellow River Concerto - a hybrid piece, based on the Yellow River Cantata by Hsien Hsing-hai, written by a committee of composers from the Central Philharmonic Society of the People's Republic of China, and promoted by Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing, as a suitable \"revolutionary\" work.\n\nFor two years, Hsu and a group of musicians walked across China behind a three-wheeled vehicle carrying an upright piano, playing the Yellow River Concerto several hundred times to soldiers and farm and factory workers. Although this was an arduous task, he was pleased to have been the first Chinese pianist allowed to return to his instrument.\n\nAfter moving to America, Hsu studied at the Eastman School of Music, and with Sasha Grodnitsky at the Juilliard School of Music; he subsequently became a US citizen and settled in New York. After his success at the Rubinstein competition, he made his New York debut in 1984.\n\nHsu was sustained by his strong Christian faith. According to Hung-Kuan Chen, he had been diagnosed with cancer while still in his teens, but had refused treatment, feeling that \"if it was his time to go, he would\". That time came when the van in which he was travelling hit a stationary tractor on a dark road near Qiqihar, in north-eastern China.\n\nHsu is survived by his wife and daughter.\n\n\u00b7 Fei-Ping

As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. By the time he was twelve, he played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic. Hsu was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, and she invited him to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. He was not allowed to accept because of the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. He survived the labor camps and became known in China and toured throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic.[2]\n\nHe was a Gold Medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition. He also garnered top prizes in other competitions. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East.\n\nIn 1979, Hsu attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Philharmonic, and the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestraope. Hsu also played with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan. Since the early 1970s, Hsu had recorded for labels such as the Columbia Records, the RCA Victor Records, the Hugo Records, the ROI Productions, and the MA Recordings in Japan.\n\nHe died in a car

He had started out life in 1936 in the province of Shandong (also known as Shantung) in eastern China. His father was a professor of pathology at Beijing University. Kwang-Ping Hsu grew up during the brutal Japanese occupation of that region of China during what is now known as the Second Sino-Japanese War (a bloody military conflict that soon became a major part of World War II), and he and his family ultimately fled Beijing for the comparative safety of the city of Kunming in southwestern China.\n\nAt around the time that World War II ended in 1945, Hsu\u2019s father emigrated from China to the United States to teach at the University of Virginia. He was joined in Charlottesville, Virginia, a couple of years later by Hsu, his sister, and their mother. As the only Asian children in Charlottesville at the time, Kwan-Ping Hsu and his sister were subjected to derogatory nicknames and other forms of racism by their classmates. With great drive and determination, however, he eventually began to overcome that discriminatory treatment by excelling in both academics and athletics. Hsu earned high grades, for example, and won additional praise as a formidable soccer player.\n\nHsu\u2019s test scores, along with his similarly exemplary accomplishments both in the classroom and on the soccer field, led to his being accepted for admission to the USCGA. Hsu\u2019s pioneering status as the first foreign-born cadet at that institution was underscored when, while filling out his application, he had to scratch out the word \u201cstate\u201d in the place-of-birth section and replace it with \u201cCountry: China.\u201d While Hsu encountered racism to some extent during his years as a cadet, his overall experience at the USCGA was highly positive.\n\nAfter graduating from the USCGA, Hsu reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for flight training. He successfully completed that training and went on to fly various types of fixed-wing, amphibian, and rotary-wing aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). His friend and fellow USCG pilot Montgomery \u201cMont\u201d Smith recalled, \u201cI think he loved flying whatever the Coast Guard had and truly appreciated being in a service that allowed him to do that.\u201d\n\nHsu took part in numerous air rescue efforts during his long and eventful military career. In addition, he served as a helicopter detachment commander for icebreakers in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Hsu also served as commander of Coast Guard Air Station Washington in Arlington, Virginia, and in that capacity he routinely flew the USCG\u2019s Gulfstream executive jet to transport commandants and government officials to meetings and other events. Hsu was commander of Coast Guard Air Station Washington when an Air Florida 737 plane crashed into the Potomac River in 1982, and he oversaw the search-and-rescue efforts in the immediate aftermath of that disaster.\n\nAs a key part of his last tour of duty, Hsu was the USCG\u2019s liaison to the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the First Gulf War in 1990-91. He retired from the USCG in 1992. Hsu died 15 years later at the age of 71 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His son David has noted, \u201cDad always viewed his life as nothing less than extraordinary\u2014a journey beyond any he could have imagined due to the opportunities of America and the Coast Guard.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Kwang-Ping Hsu, please check out https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2017/05/the-long-blue-line-capt-kwang-ping-hsu/\n\nAdditional information on Asian American pioneers in the USCG is available at https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2018/05/tlbl-asian-american-history-of-the-coast-guard/"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Fei-Ping-Hsu", "page_content": "Fei-Ping Hsu (b. 1952 - d. 2001) is a renowned Chinese American pianist who is known for his sensitive, brilliant, and poetic interpretations.\n\nMr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve-years-old, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic. Feiping was invited to perform for the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Feiping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation because of the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China and toured extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic which was the foremost leading orchestra.\n\nHe was a Gold Medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition\u2019s history from the People\u2019s Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O\u2019Shea International Competition (Spain). Mr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestra including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestra in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan. Since the early 1970s Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as the Columbia Records, the RCA Victor Records, the Hugo Records, the ROI Productions, and the MA Recordings in Japan.\n\nHighly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and the Romantic traditions, Hsu is also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun.\n\nHis life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001 and is remembered by many to this day. He is survived by his wife and daughter."}, {"url": "https://www.hsu.edu.hk/en/teaching-learning/academic-staff/", "page_content": "dr wong yin cheung, eugene \u9ec3\u5f65\u748b\u535a\u58eb associate
