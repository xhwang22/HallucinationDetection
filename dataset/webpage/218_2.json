The initial fellowship was selected by a committee headed by the Principal of McGill University, Sir John William Dawson, and by the former Premier of Quebec, Pierre J.O. Chauveau, who served respectively as the first two Presidents of the Society. This founding cohort of Fellows included Sir Sandford Fleming, the originator of the world system of Standard Time, and Sir William Osler, one of the greatest physicians of his day. Since 1882, new Fellows have been nominated and elected by their peers who are themselves Fellows of the Society. Over 3,700 scholars and artists have been inducted into to the fellowship over the past hundred and thirty years.\n\nWhile the early fellowship was drawn primarily from Quebec and Ontario, since that time its geographic reach has expanded to include scholars and artists drawn from every region of Canada.\n\nApproximately 20 per cent of the fellowship indicates French as their first language. Most Fellows hold, or have held, positions in Canadian universities, although many are primarily affiliated with research institutes, government agencies, or private sector laboratories and think tanks. Today the By-laws provide that up to 111 nominees may be elected each year. In addition to Regularly Elected Fellows, the Society also inducts up to seven Specially Elected Fellows per year for contributions to the objectives of the Society other than by scholarship and research.\n\nAnnually, the Society also elects up to four Foreign Fellows who, at the time of their election, are neither residents nor citizens of Canada and who, by their exceptionally distinguished intellectual accomplishments in the arts, humanities and sciences, have helped promote the object of the Society in ways that have clear relevance for Canadian society. Finally, the By-laws envisage the election by the Council of the Society of up to two Honorary Fellows upon recommendation of the President during each presidential term.\n\nTHE ACADEMIES\n\nThe RSC consists of three bilingual Academies embracing a broad range of scholarly disciplines and artistic fields.\n\nAcademy I is the Academy of the Arts and Humanities. There are three Divisions of Academy I: an Anglophone Division (1) - Humanities; a Francophone division (2) - Lettres et sciences humaines; and a bilingual Division for the Arts (3) - embracing architecture, creative writing, and the arts.\n\nAcademy II is the Academy of Social Sciences. There are two Divisions of Academy II: an Anglophone Division (4) - Social Sciences; and a Francophone Division (5) - Sciences sociales.\n\nAcademy III is the Academy of Science. There are five Divisions of Academy III: Applied Sciences and Engineering (6); Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (7); Biological Sciences (8); Medical Sciences (9); and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (10). Each Division of Academy III is comprised of both English-speaking and French-speaking Fellows."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Paul-Y-R-Waddington", "page_content": "Sous Lieutenant Paul Yvan Robert Waddington was a French World War I flying ace credited with twelve aerial victories.\n\nWaddington joined the 141e Regiment d'Infanterie on 15 December 1914 as a Soldat de 2e classe.

(Brouncker was to become the Royal Society\u2019s first president.) The initiative had various more or less close precursors, including a group that met in London in 1645, the Oxford \u201cExperimental Philosophy Club\u201d in the 1650s, and correspondence networks such as that of the reformer and philanthropist Samuel Hartlib; but the body set up in 1660 was consciously new, with ambitions to become a truly national society devoted to the promotion of science. These ambitions were put into effect over the next few years, particularly through a charter of incorporation granted by Charles II in 1662 and revised in 1663. The royal charter provided an institutional structure for the society, with president, treasurer, secretaries, and council. Though it had royal patronage almost from the start, the society has always remained a voluntary organization, independent of the British state.\n\nBritannica Quiz Science at Random Quiz\n\nFrom the outset the society aspired to combine the role of research institute with that of clearinghouse for knowledge and forum for arbitration, though the latter function became dominant after the society\u2019s earliest years. A key development was the establishment in 1665 of a periodical that acted as the society\u2019s mouthpiece (though it was actually published by the secretary, initially Henry Oldenburg, and was only officially adopted by the society in 1753): this was the Philosophical Transactions, which still flourishes today as the oldest scientific journal in continuous publication.\n\nIn the subsequent history of the society, various episodes are of particular significance. The presidency of Sir Isaac Newton from 1703 to 1727 saw this great mathematician and physicist asserting the society\u2019s dominant role in science in Britain and farther afield. (Earlier, Newton\u2019s Principia had been published with the society\u2019s imprimatur.) Endowments from the 18th century onward made possible prizes for various aspects of science that are still awarded today\u2014most notably the Copley Medal, which, stemming from a bequest by Sir Godfrey Copley in 1709, became the most prestigious scientific award in Britain. In the late 18th century the society played an active role in encouraging scientific exploration, particularly under its longest-serving president, Sir Joseph Banks, who earlier had accompanied James Cook on his great voyage of discovery of 1768\u201371. However, in general the 18th and early 19th centuries saw the society tending to rest on its laurels and become slightly amateurish. This was rectified in the 1830s by a reform program that reinvigorated the society and restored it to a prominence that it has retained ever since. In 1919 the society sent expeditions to photograph the solar eclipse of May 29 from Pr\u00edncipe Island in the Gulf of Guinea and from Sobral in Brazil, verifying Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and helping to make Einstein famous.\n\nElection to the Royal Society\u2019s Fellowship is a coveted accolade for scientists; since 1945 women as well as men have been eligible for this honour. Today there are approximately 1,300 fellows and 130 foreign members. Since 1967 the society has occupied premises in Carlton House Terrace, London, where meetings are held and the society\u2019s extensive archival and other resources are housed. The society\u2019s role now includes the provision of independent advice on issues of current concern, and it also administers large sums of public money through grants aimed to support innovative research, foster international scientific cooperation, and encourage better communication between scientists and the public."}, {"url": "https://catalogues.royalsociety.org/CalmView/default.aspx", "page_content": "The Royal Society Collections Catalogues\n\nSearch the catalogues of the Royal Society for printed or archival material and biographical records of past Fellows.\n\nFind tips on searching in our guide how do I search the catalogue?\n\nFor more in-depth information on our picture and object collection use our picture library.\n\nThe Philosophical Transactions, the scientific periodical of the Royal Society since 1665, is also available online.\n\nThe library and archive are open to the public.
