But in an interview published today in The Guardian, he has spoken of the moment in 2002 when Pete Townshend called. John Entwistle had passed away: would Palladino fill in on the tour?\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs,\u201c said Palladino. Townshend was prepared, presenting him with a stack of CDs.\n\nThat\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2018\n\nAs a session player who had overcome imposter syndrome to sit in with the likes of David Gilmour and Elton John, there was no question Palladino would get The Who's set down pat. But only after some helpful advice from Townshend.\n\n\u201cAt the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket,\u201c said Palladino. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino also speaks about his career through the 80s, when he was on speed dial for any pop star who needed some four-string flair in the low end. But in a career that saw him play on some of the top-selling albums of all time, Palladino considers his collaboration with neo soul pioneer D'Angelo, as bassist of the Soulquarians, the personal highlight.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone,\u201c said Palladino. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played.\u201c\n\nPalladino has just released Notes With Attachments with the Californian guitarist and composer Blake Mills, available now through New Deal Records. You can read his interview with The Guardian here."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/06/pino-palladino-pop-greatest-bassist-adele-elton-the-who", "page_content": "By his own admission, Pino Palladino is not a man much accustomed to giving interviews. \u201cVery reticent,\u201d he nods during a Zoom call, his accent speaking noticeably louder of his childhood in Cardiff than his current home in LA. \u201cYou know, there was a time when I was featured in all sorts of musicians\u2019 magazines, and then I just thought to myself, \u2018Move over, there\u2019s people out there that actually need the publicity.\u2019 Not to blow smoke up my own arse,\u201d he adds hurriedly, \u201cbut really I just didn\u2019t want to see or hear from myself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a remark in keeping with the astonishing career of one of the most celebrated bass players in the world. It\u2019s hard not to blanche when you consider the sheer number of records that have been sold featuring his work. He played on not one but two of the biggest selling albums of the 21st century: Adele\u2019s 21 and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide, as well as with Rod Stewart, Elton John, Bryan Ferry, Simon and Garfunkel and Keith Richards. They\u2019re the biggest names in a startlingly diverse back catalogue of collaborations: Palladino\u2019s playing is the thread that links Perfume Genius with Phil Collins, Harry Styles with Chris de Burgh, and Nine Inch Nails with De La Soul. Indeed, his versatility and omnipresence is a running joke within the music industry. When another fabled bass player, Pink Floyd\u2019s Guy Pratt, got married, he opened his groom\u2019s speech with the words: \u201cI\u2019m only here today because Pino couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nFor a musician who seems to have turned up everywhere over the last 40 years, Palladino has remained a remarkably anonymous figure outside of musicians\u2019 circles. Indeed, he somehow contrived to spend 14 years as a member of the Who without really losing what he calls an \u201cinvisible stance\u201d. He certainly stands out in photographs of the Soulquarians, the experimental collective assembled by D\u2019Angelo for his legendary album Voodoo, the solitary lanky Welshman among a crowd of African-American musicians including Questlove and the late J Dilla \u2013 but you would still struggle to recognise him in the street.\n\nCardiff\u2019s finest \u2026 Palladino in 1985. Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nThis is presumably how Palladino likes it. He\u2019s drily funny and self-deprecating \u2013 he says his default setting when working with a new artist is \u201cdo not fucking spoil it\u201d \u2013 but doesn\u2019t seem terribly frustrated by life in the background. Which makes it all the more surprising that he\u2019s releasing an album on which he shares billing with Blake Mills: Notes With Attachments, a fascinating, head-turning collection of experimental instrumentals that sits somewhere between jazz, global music and ambient. He and Mills, who has produced for Fiona Apple and Laura Marling, met while working on a John Legend album. \u201cWe hit it off and the next thing you know, he\u2019s saying to me \u2018Have you thought about a solo album?\u2019 Well, I\u2019ve thought about it, obviously,\u201d he laughs. \u201cFor 40 years I\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019ve never really had an idea how I could do it.\u201d\n\nStudded with guest appearances \u2013 from avant-garde saxophonist Sam Gendel and jazz drummer Chris Dave, among others \u2013 Notes With Attachments foregrounds the sound that made Palladino\u2019s name: the none-more-80s sprrroing of the fretless bass put through a chorus pedal. He first used it while working with Gary Numan, but it was Paul Young\u2019s 1983 hit Wherever I Lay My Hat that introduced it to a mass audience: pushed up in the mix, the bass effectively became a lead instrument. It was so striking that Palladino suddenly found himself playing with everyone from Go West and Don Henley to Tears for Fears: he turned up on Top of the Pops with alarming regularity, the musical equivalent of a hip item of designer clothing. \u201cThere was a lot of it around in those days,\u201d he says of the sound. \u201cI was so lucky \u2013 it resonated with people, captured their imagination and it took on a life of its own. It did get to the point where I was getting booked for sessions and feeling like a performing monkey: \u2018Yeah, bring your fretless, make that funny sound and maybe we\u2019ll get a hit out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also found himself becoming the sideman of choice for the rock aristocracy. \u201cThe first call I got like that was from David Gilmour. I could not believe it: am I going to the studio with this guy and pretend I actually belong there? I was nervous as fuck, but the drummer on the session was Jeff Porcaro [famed for playing with Toto and on Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller album], and he was really sweet: \u2018Come on, man, chill out, have a smoke on this.\u2019 So I did, and that seemed to work for me. I just had to keep that attitude through all of that period: phone calls from Elton John and Phil Collins \u2013 you have to keep that headspace that you belong, even if you think you\u2019re going to be found out any minute.\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll have to play louder!\u2019 \u2026 performing with the Who at the 2016 Desert Trip festival in California. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nHe says another phone call, this time from D\u2019Angelo \u2013 who had heard his playing on a BB King album \u2013 changed his life. \u201cMy roots are in Motown, reggae, R&B. I didn\u2019t get much of an opportunity to express that side of music and then I met the don \u2013 how lucky was that? D\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone. When I was in the studio with D and Questlove, James Poyser, all those guys, I don\u2019t even have to think about what I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played. From a personal satisfaction point of view, it was as good as it ever got, probably will get.\n\n\u201cIt took people 10 years, 20, to really get the first album we made, Voodoo, but I absolutely knew it was unique and really special \u2013 I was probably more aware of it than the rest of them, because I\u2019d been working for a long time. I knew this kind of thing didn\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nThe Soulquarians went on to record with Erykah Badu, Mos Def and Talib Kweli; the influence of their loose approach can be heard on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s epochal 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly. They had just wrapped up a session with Common when Palladino learned that the Who\u2019s bassist, John Entwistle, had died \u2013 and that the band had declined to cancel their forthcoming tour and wanted Palladino to replace him \u2026 on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, in two days.\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs. Pete Townshend was waiting for me at the hotel, with a big stack of CDs. \u2018You don\u2019t know much of the catalogue? Fair enough. You\u2019re going to know it tonight, then, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 At the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino says he\u2019s \u201cnot exactly crazy about touring any more\u201d \u2013 he stopped playing live with the Who in 2016 \u2013 but is considering doing some gigs around Notes With Attachments, pandemic permitting. Until then, there are still sessions to attend to in LA, with Covid tests in the car park for anyone taking part. \u201cFilm and music studios are considered essential to the economy here \u2013 you\u2019ve got to love that, right?\u201d he laughs. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s better than Britain telling you if you\u2019re a musician or an artist you might have to look for a new job.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/pino-palladino-interview/", "page_content": "Photo: Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAll musicians are the same, we all think we\u2019re rubbish,\u201d Pino Palladino told a British television interviewer in 2013, adding a gentle laugh. It was a typically massive understatement from the quietly affable Welsh bassist, among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry. In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it. That\u2019s really nice to hear.\n\nListen to Pino Palladino and Blake Mills\u2019 Notes with Attachments here."}, {"url": "https://mixdownmag.com.au/news/pino-palladino-blake-mills-nubiyan-twist-more-our-five-favourite-records-of-the-week/", "page_content": "Words by Will Brewster\n\nExplore the freshest sounds of the week.\n\nFriday is here, which means it\u2019s release day for a bunch of artists at home and around the world.

Across his career, he\u2019s collaborated with everyone from D\u2019Angelo, Erykah Badu and John Mayer through to Eric Clapton, Adele and The Who, with his thumping flatwound tone and less-is-more approach towards groove totally revolutionising the way the bass is both performed and mixed on record.\n\nFor Notes With Attachments, which stands as his first-ever record of originals, the Welsh session giant has enlisted the assistance of six-string virtuoso and lauded producer Blake Mills to deliver eight avant-garde compositions that hold testament to the uncanny instrumental talents of both men. It\u2019s spontaneous, ambiguous and ultimately enthralling, and serves as a must-listen for any keen guitarist or bassist looking to pick up a few tricks from two masters of the game.\n\n\u2018Just Wrong\u2019 sets a fine tone for Notes With Attachments with Sam Gendel\u2019s harmonised saxophones and Pino\u2019s creeping polyrhythmic basslines, with \u2018Soundwalk\u2019 and \u2018Ekut\u00e9\u2019 acting as another showcase of Palladino\u2019s irresistible feel across the fretboard \u2013 the latter also serving as a flex for Mills\u2019 knowledge of chord inversions and production nuances.\n\nMeanwhile, \u2018Djurkel\u2019 is a masterfully arranged and mixed track that stands up as one of the record\u2019s strongest moments with its heavy horns and staccato strings, while \u2018Chris Dave\u2019 sees Mills and Palladino spotlight the percussive talents of the song\u2019s titular genius in spectacular fashion. \u2018Man Form Molise\u2019 holds up as Notes With Attachments\u2019 most spacious moments and boasts some great off-kilter playing from Mills, while \u2018Off The Cuff\u2019 ends things in style with Pino dishing out a short-yet-sweet chord progression to once again remind you of his mastery over the instrument.\n\nTo hear these two work together so fluidly on such a wonderful full-length project is a true treat for any musician to experience \u2013 hopefully, there\u2019s a lot more from where this came from.\n\nNubiyan Twist \u2013 Freedom Fables\n\nA slinky, head-snapping collaborative affair from UK Afro-Jazz nonet Nubiyan Twist, Freedom Fables pairs the grooves of the London-based group with a smattering of feature vocalists such as Pat Thomas, Ego Ella May and Soweto Kinch. It\u2019s as much as a celebration of Africa\u2019s rich musical diaspora as it is a stone cold dance party, and should serve to satisfy the palate of all those who find solace in funk, soul, Afrobeat, jazz and all things in between.\n\n\u2018Morning Light\u2019 kicks off the party with a stank neo-soul stomp packed with liquid guitars and rising synth pads, while \u2018Tittle Tattle\u2019 and \u2018Ma Wonka\u2019 see Nubiyan Twist delve right into Afrobeat territory, with scattered percussion and punishing horns complementing the presence of respective guests CHERISE and Pat Thomas.\n\n\u2018Buckle Up\u2019 sees the group take a Dilla-tinged detour with an impeccably performed groove, while \u2018Keeper\u2019 marks one of the album\u2019s most jazzy moments before \u2018If I Know\u2019 and \u2018Flow\u2019 offers two back-to-back Afrobeat and neo-soul jams, the latter marking CHERISE\u2019s third and finest feature appearance. As great as these guest appearances might be across Freedom Fables, ultimately, it\u2019s Nubiyan Twist who shine brightest here, with their dynamic chemistry and musical interplay going the distance to make this one worthy of remembering.\n\nMindy Meng Wang \u738b\u840c & Tim Shiel \u2013 Nervous Energy \u4e00\u89e6\u5373\n\nA collaborative affair pieced together over the course of the pandemic, Nervous Energy sees the worlds of Mindy Meng Wang and Tim Shiel collide in spectacular fashion. Constructed around Mindy\u2019s transcendental guzheng playing and bolstered by Shiel\u2019s dance music sensibilities, the project combines Eastern melodies with skittish breakbeats and slippery synths and samples for a truly intriguing sonic affair.\n\n\u2018Sleeping Tiger On The Bund\u2019 fuses a rollicking Four Tet-esque rhythm with gentle guzheng plucks and flurries of reversed arpeggios to create icy textures, while \u2018Body of Water (What Is Love)\u2019 delivers a delicious breakbeat and some killer synth work to reinforce Mindy\u2019s sparse melodies. \u2018Hidden Qi\u2019, meanwhile, verges on dub and trip-hop territory with its stoned drum programming, with the song unpredictably darting between keys to make it all the more enticing.\n\nFinishing up on the slow-burning build of \u2018My Love Is Not What It Was\u2019 \u2013 yet another breakbeat tour-de-force for Shiel, and a stellar showcase of Mindy\u2019s traditional technique \u2013 Nervous Energy is a magical collision of sound and style that offers something new with every fresh listen.\n\nTulliah \u2013 Fre$h Hugs\n\nTulliah is a 19 year old singer-songwriter hailing from the Mornington Peninsula, who carries a knack for writing emotionally heightened songs in the vein of Aldous Harding and Whitney. On her debut EP Fre$h Hugs, she seeks to solidify her emerging status as one to keep an eye on, fusing soft instrumentation with narrative-based lyricism over six pleasantly performed and produced tracks.\n\n\u2018Just My Type (A Little Bit Lonely)\u2019 pairs Tulliah\u2019s blissful, smooth harmonies with a twisting bassline and textured acoustic guitar, while a sparse piano accompanies the young songwriter on \u2018Take It Off Now Boy\u2019 to construct one of the EP\u2019s most harrowing moments.\n\n\u2018Okay\u2019 follows things with another sparse cut that\u2019s made all the more unique with its soaring string arrangements and well-laid harmonies, with \u2018Distant Dreams\u2019 rounding out the project with a fairly conventional pop number that features some unsuspecting production tricks courtesy of Dean Tuza. A fine introduction to an artist who seems poised to churn out some very strong songs ahead.\n\nEhsan Gelsi \u2013 Ephemera\n\nEhsan Gelsi is a Melbourne-based producer and synth wrangler who\u2019s previously worked alongside everyone from Calvin Harris and Carl Cox all the way to Snoop Dogg. He\u2019s an acclaimed master of modular synthesis \u2013 his many YouTube jams with a hulking Moog System 55 will prove that for you if you harbour any doubts \u2013 yet his latest project spotlights a much more unique instrument: the gargantuous 6024 pipe organ that sits within Melbourne\u2019s Town Hall.\n\nEphemera, which arrives tomorrow after Gelsi takes to the Town Hall to perform it in full tonight, consists of two sprawling compositions that make heady use of the organ in addition to other synths and live percussion. As Gelsi discovered, the organ boasts MIDI in and out, enabling him to feed it into a vast array of synchronised hardware to harvest its enormous sounds and embed them within his own electronic context.\n\nGiven how unique this project really is, I don\u2019t want to give too much away as to how it sounds just in the off chance you choose to attend tonight\u2019s show. That being said \u2013 it\u2019s fucking fantastic. Make sure to listen to it when it drops tomorrow, and if you can, get down and see it in action tonight: it\u2019ll be an experience you\u2019ll likely never forget.\n\nDon\u2019t miss a beat \u2013 keep up to date with all the latest music news here."}, {"url": "https://www.radioswisspop.ch/en/music-database/musician/113328f03f18e37f9ea1690603e52e56c3109", "page_content": "Giuseppe Henry \"Pino\" Palladino[1] (born 17 October 1957) is a Welsh bassist. A prolific session musician, he is probably best known for playing with The Who (following the death of founding member John Entwistle[2]) from 2002 to 2016, D'angelo from 1996 to present, and the John Mayer Trio from 2005 to present.\n\nPalladino plays a late-1970s, fretless, Music Man StingRay bass guitar, a fretted Fender Precision, and a Jaguar bass. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Cardiff to an Italian father from Campobasso and a Welsh mother,[4] Palladino began playing electric guitar at age 14 and bass guitar at 17. He bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae with a rock and roll backbeat.[5]\n\nCareer\n\nPalladino was drawn to Motown and jazz at an early age. He attended Catholic school and took classical guitar lessons. He liked Led Zeppelin and Yes and started a rock band.[6]\n\nIn 1982, Palladino recorded with Gary Numan on the album I, Assassin. The producer of the album asked him to contribute to Paul Young's debut album. Young's cover version of \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\" by Marvin Gaye became a hit in Europe,and subsequently joined Young's band the Royal family and Palladino received offers to record with Joan Armatrading, Go West, and David Gilmour. He cites as early influences James Jamerson, Danny Thompson, and Norman Watt-Roy and also admires Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins, Larry Graham, Michael Henderson, Anthony Jackson, Marcus Miller, and Rocco Prestia.[7]\n\nIn 1983, he joined The Law with Paul Rodgers, formerly of Bad Company, and drummer Kenney Jones, who succeeded Keith Moon in The Who after Moon died, and recorded the album The Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino alternated between fretless bass and fretted and 4-string and 6-string bass. He played with Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Elton John, and Eric Clapton.\n\nHe played on Mike Lindup's first solo album, Changes with Dominic Miller on guitar and Manu Katch\u00e9 on drums.[8]\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft of The Verve on Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody.[9]\n\nThe Who's bassist John Entwistle died the night before the start of their first tour in two years. Palladino became the band's bass guitarist on tour. In 2006, he joined the remaining band members on their first album in twenty-four years, Endless Wire. He played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show in 2010 with Simon Townshend on guitar, Zak Starkey on drums, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick on keyboards. In 2012, he toured with The Who on their Quadrophenia revival.\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session musicians, which blossomed into a friendship. Jordan credits Palladino's apparent ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an embrace of genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he had planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January 2005 to perform Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope for victims of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix song \"Bold as Love\", the three found a chemistry together. They recorded an album and toured as a trio.[10]\n\nThey released the album Try!, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover versions of \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" by Jimi Hendrix and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's album Heavier Things, and new songs by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs: \"Good Love Is on the Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\".[3] Palladino appeared on Mayer's third album Continuum, fourth album Battle Studies and seventh album The Search for Everything.\n\nIn March and April 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck and played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido. In 2009, he formed a trio with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips.\n\nHe played with Simon and Garfunkel on their Old Friends reunion tour.[10]\n\nIn January 2011, he entered the studio with D'Angelo to finish recording Black Messiah.[11]\n\nIn 2013 he played on the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks and was a member of the touring band.\n\nTechnique\n\nPalladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass on many 1980s albums. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\", Palladino preferred a different sound, combining fretless tone with an octaver effect, and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines, and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument. Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's Wherever I Lay My Hat. His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nSignature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modelled after two of Palladino's Fender Precision Basses. The body features faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint, based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass, while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fretboard are based on his 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.[12]\n\nPersonal life\n\nPino married Marilyn (Maz) Roberts, a former backing singer with the Fabulous Wealthy Tarts, in 1992 in Wales. They have three children: Fabiana, Giancarla and Rocco, who are all involved in the music industry.[13]\n\nSelect discography\n\nWith Paul Young\n\n1983 No Parlez (Columbia)\n\n(Columbia) 1985 The Secret of Association (Columbia)\n\n(Columbia) 1990 Other Voices (Columbia)\n\nWith David Knopfler\n\n1983 Release (Peach Tree)\n\n(Peach Tree) 1985 Behind the Lines (Paris)\n\n(Paris) 1987 Cut the Wire (Paris)\n\nWith Don Henley\n\n1984 Building the Perfect Beast (Geffen)\n\n(Geffen) 1989 The End of the Innocence (Geffen)\n\nWith Go West\n\n1985 Go West (Chrysalis)\n\n(Chrysalis) 1987 Dancing on the Couch (Chrysalis)\n\nWith Elton John\n\n1985 Ice on Fire (Rocket/Geffen)\n\n(Rocket/Geffen) 1992 The One (Rocket/MCA)\n\nWith John Mayer\n\n2005 Try!\n\n2006 Continuum\n\n2017 The Search for Everything\n\nWith Jeff Beck\n\n1999 Who Else!

It\u2019s an experimental, jazz-leaning project that blew Rick Rubin\u2019s mind. Pino Palladino is a bass player who has played on records with everyone from D\u2019Angelo to The Who to Adele. Guitarist Blake Mills co-founded the band Dawes in 2005, and he has gone on to release critically acclaimed solo albums and produce records for the Alabama Shakes, John Legend and Fiona Apple.\n\nThree years ago, Pino and Blake started collaborating on what would become Notes With Attachments. The album features other incredible session musicians and pulls from influences as diverse as West African, Cuban, and English folk music.\n\nRick talks first with Pino Palladino on today\u2019s episode about those wide array of influences, and how hearing Motown music as a young boy in Wales changed his life. Pino also walks us through his evolution to becoming one of the most in-demand session players. Later Blake Mills joins the conversation to talk about collaborating with Pino and why he feels bad for the touring musicians who have to play his bass parts on the road."}, {"url": "https://www.withbassinmind.com/the-transcriptions", "page_content": "Song: Dean Town Artist: Vulpeck Bassist: Joe Dart\n\nJoe Dart's impact on the worldwide bass community has been immense - the collective impression that Vulfpeck have left has been so large that it's resulted in Ernie Ball Musicman commissioning their first ever signature bass guitar. I was working for EBMM in LA when Joe took delivery of the instrument - his smile said a thousand words.\n\nSong: Vultures Artist: John Mayer Bassist: Pino Palladino\n\nFrom The Who to John Mayer, D'Angelo to Nine Inch Nails, Pino Palladino is one of the most sort after session musicians on the planet - and a total gentleman! I was fortunate enough to meet him while I was tutoring his son, Rocco. He proved to be a perfect role model for anyone who wishes to question the myth about 'never meeting your heroes'. Although I've featured his fretted playing here, be sure to check out his fretless endeavours with Paul Young!\n\nTranscription: Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick Artist: Ian Dury and the Blockheads Bassist: Norman Watt-Roy\n\nNorman Watt-Roy has always been one of my biggest influences. Back in '98, Ian Dury's 'Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick' was the first tune that I ever studied - which literally took months, it's a wonderful bassline which requires a great deal of plucking hand discipline. In more recent years I was fortunate enough to tutor Norman's nephew Alan, another fine bassist, during his time at The ICMP, London.\n\nTranscription: Come Together Artist: The Beatles Bassist: Paul McCartney\n\nPaul McCartney's playing is simply magnificent, but the amount of bassists that have named this recording as a seminal part of their own development is quite substantial - For example, I remember hearing Nathan Watts losing his mind whilst trying to describe the first time he heard 'Come Together'. It's worth noting that at this time in his career McCartney was using both a Fender Jazz ('69) and a Rickenbacker in the studio.\n\nTranscription: Country Boy Artist: Albert Lee Bassist: Emery Gordy Jr.\n\nMCA studio musician, Emery Gordy is one of those unsung heroes. A prolific resum\u00e9 boasts appearances with Elvis Presley, Neil Diamond, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Billy Joel, Tom Petty, Vince Gill and but of course, Albert Lee. I was honoured to perform this very bassline with Albert back in '17 - a career highlight of mine.\n\nTranscription: Cissy Strut Artist: The Meters Bassist: George Porter Jr.\n\nInducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2011, Cissy Strut was first released back in 1969 on The Meter's debut album. Back then the composition only managed to reach #23 in the Billboard Hot 100, but since has grown to be recognised as a pioneering, seminal R&B instrumental. P-Bass at the ready...\n\nTranscription: Master Blaster (Jammin') Artist: Stevie Wonder Bassist: Nathan Watts\n\nI wish I could describe to you the feeling of meeting Nathan for the first time - but I'm afraid it was all a bit of a blur (I can honestly tell you I was properly star struck). Amazingly, he remembered me when we bumped into one another in LA. I'm not sure the 19 year old me would believe the adult me if I told him one day you'll be perching at the bar chatting with Nathan Watts.\n\nTranscription: Under The Bridge Artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers Bassist: Flea\n\nNot just the Red Hot Chili Pepper's bassist; Michael Balzary has collaborated with 'Fear', 'Jane's Addiction', 'Atoms for Peace', 'Tom Waits', 'Alanis Morissette' and believe it or not, even 'Johnny Cash'. An incredibly melodic musician, this bassline is one of my favourites - Taken from the seminal '91 album, 'Blood, Suger, Sex, Magik'. EBMM StingRay 5's at the ready!\n\nTranscription: Slegehammer Artist: Peter Gabriel Bassist: Tony Levin\n\nA long term associate of Ernie Ball Musicman, Tony Levin pulled out all the stops for his performance on Peter Gabriel's seminal recording; 'Slegehammer'. Originally recorded on a fretless Musicman Sabre, you'll need both an Octave and Chorus pedal in your arsenal if you'd like to accurately reproduce to required tonality.\n\nAl McKibbon was notoriosuly known for his rich, resonant tone and metronomic precision. Hired by Dizzy Gillespie to replace Ray Brown, McKibbon\u2019s carrer had numous highlights, from playing on Miles Davis\u2019 groundbreaking 'Birth of the Cool' sessions, to briefly backing Count Basie. He joined Nat King Cole's main backing, the George Shearing Quartet, in 1951.\n\nTranscription: Let There Be Love Artist: Nat 'King' Cole Bassist: Al McKibbon\n\nWith the likes of Roger Hawkins, Bobby Womack and The Sweet Inspirations joining her at Atlantic Studios - Aretha Franklin was in fine company for the undertaking of her 13th studio album; 'Aretha Now' Jerry Jemmott's playing on this recording is deceptive, what initially sounds quite straightforward, is actually dense in melodic detail.\n\nTranscription: I Say A Little Prayer Artist: Aretha Franklin Bassist: Jerry Jemmott\n\n'Don't Change Horses (In The Middle Of A Stream)' is taken from Tower of Power's fourth studio album, 'Back to Oakland' - released in the spring of 1974, on Warner Bros. To authentically duplicate Prestia's seminal approach to fretting hand articulation, take the time to watch his 1993, 'Fingerstyle Funk' VHS (now available on digital formats and YouTube).\n\nTranscription: Don't Change Horses Artist: Tower of Power Bassist: Francis Rocco Prestia\n\nJohn Bentley was part of Squeezes' original lineup from 1980 until the the band initially split up in 1982. His playing was featured alongside that of Glenn Tilbrook, Chris Difford and Jools Holland's on; 'Argybargy', 'East Side Story' and 'Sweet's from a Stranger'. When the band reformed in 1985, Keith Wilkinson took over bass duties. Today, the wonderful Yolanda Charles MBE holds the bass chair, touring with the band since 2017.\n\nTranscription: Tempted Artist: Squeeze Bassist: John Bentley\n\nTranscription: Good Vibrations Artist: The Beach Boys Bassist: Carol Kaye\n\nWhat can you say that hasn't already been said about one of the most prolific session musicians ever. Carol Kaye is estimated to have featured on over 10,000 recordings during a career spanning over five decades. As a fundamental member of the Los Angeles' 'Wrecking Crew' her list of session appearances is phenomenal and includes the likes of Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, The Monkees and but of course, The Beach Boys! www.carolkaye.com\n\nTranscription: Lovely Day Artist: Bill Withers Bassist: Jerry Knight\n\nAlong with Ray Parker Jr, Jerry Knight was a founding member of the group 'Raydio', who's early hits included 'Jack and Jill'. Together as session musicians, both Knight and Parker appeared on the 1977 Bill Withers album, 'Menagerie' - performing on this timeless classic 'Lovely Day'. Surprisingly the single never reached #1 - however Withers did go on to win three Grammy Awards and also be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nTranscription: Son of a Preacher Man Artist: Dusty Springfield Bassist: Tommy Cogbill\n\nOften hired by Jerry Wexler at Atlantic records, Tommy Cogbill's list of recording credits is something quite special; from Wilson Pickett to Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield to Elvis Presley. For me, some of his stand out performances can be heard on such recordings as Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' and but of course this one, Dusty's Springfield's soul masterpiece 'Son of a Preacher Man'\n\nTranscription: Shining Star Artist: Earth, Wind & Fire Bassist: Verdine White\n\nFounded in Chicago by Maurice White; Earth, Wind & Fire's lustrous legacy has spanned over fifty years. Named \u2018one of the greatest bands ever\u2019 (VH1), the ensemble has won six Grammy awards, been nominated for seventeen, four American Music Awards and have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame...they even have a star on the \u2018Hollywood Walk of Fame\u2019.\n\nTranscription: Soul Mann Artist: Sam & Dave Bassist: Donald 'Duck' Dunn\n\nKnow for his work as the principle bassist at STAX records - Donald 'Duck' Dunn was a true force of nature, recording with everyone from Booker T & the M.G.'s to Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Albert King, Bill Withers and even Elvis Presley. In 1992, he was rightfully inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nTranscription: Reach Out (I'll Be There) Artist: Four Tops Bassist: James Jamerson\n\nCollectively, The Funk Brothers, have played on more than 100 number ones - that\u2019s more hit singles than Elvis, The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones put together. I can\u2019t urge you enough to purchase the \u2018Standing in the Shadows of Motown\u2019 text, it\u2019s killed. Watch the documentary, read the book and get lost in this seminal part of music history.\n\nTranscription: Get On The Floor Artist: Michael Jackson Bassist: Louis Johnson\n\nBest known for his work Michael Jackson, Louis Johnson has also collaborated with the likes of Aretha Franklin, George Benson, Michael McDonald, Bill Withers and but of course, the Brothers Johnson. The catalyst for my own love affair with Music Man\u2019s Sabre bass, Johnson is more heavily associated with another Leo Fender design, the StingRay. If you get time, check out Star Lick\u2019s Bass Master Session DVD, it\u2019s monster!\n\nTranscription: Tears of a Clown Artist: Smokey Robinson & The Miracles Bassist: Bob Babbitt\n\nBabbitt's career at Motown was often over shadowed by James Jamerson\u2019s legacy - But his time there saw him record with the likes of Stevie Wonder, Edwin Starr, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations and Diana Ross. When Motown headed to LA, Babbitt headed to New York, continuing his career with everyone from Frank Sinatra to Alice Cooper! Here\u2019s a fun transcription of his playing on Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u2018The Tears of a Clown\u2019 - As a student, my mentor Rob Burns, taught us to play the bassoon part featured in the opening four-bars - for nothing but fun, you can include it, if not, just remain tacet!\n\nTranscription: Virtual Insanity Artist: Jamiroquai Bassist: Stuart Zender"}, {"url": "https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-bassists-of-all-time-13565/pino-palladino-13579/", "page_content": "From funk masters to prog prodigies and beyond, we count down the players who have shaped our idea of the low-end theory\n\n\u201cThe bass is the foundation,\u201d session legend Carol Kaye once said, \u201cand with the drummer you create the beat. Whatever you play puts a framework around the rest of the music.\u201d\n\nA great bass line, whether it\u2019s Paul McCartney\u2019s hypnotic \u201cCome Together\u201d riff, Bootsy Collins\u2019 sly vamp from James Brown\u2019s \u201cSex Machine,\u201d or Tina Weymouth\u2019s minimal throb on Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cPsycho Killer,\u201d is like a mantra: It sounds like it could go on forever, and it only feels more profound the more you hear it. Guitarists, singers, and horn players tend to claim the flashiest moments in any given song, while drummers channel most of the kinetic energy, but what the bassist brings is something elemental \u2014 the part that loops endlessly in your head long after the music ends.\n\nBassists are often overlooked and undervalued, even within their own bands. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the number-one job,\u201d McCartney once said, reflecting on the fateful moment when he took over the four-string after Stu Sutcliffe exited the Beatles. \u201cNobody wanted to play bass, they wanted to be up front.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the instrument has its own proud tradition in popular music, stretching from the mighty upright work of Jimmy Blanton in Duke Ellington\u2019s orchestra and bebop pioneers like Oscar Pettiford to fellow jazz geniuses like Charles Mingus and Ron Carter; studio champs like Kaye and James Jamerson; rock warriors like Cream\u2019s Jack Bruce and the Who\u2019s John Entwistle; funk masters like Bootsy and Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s Larry Graham; prog prodigies like Yes\u2019 Chris Squire and Rush\u2019s Geddy Lee; fusion gods like Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius; and punk and postpunk masters like Weymouth and the Minutemen\u2019s Mike Watt. The alternative era brought new heroes on the instrument, from Sonic Youth\u2019s intuitive Kim Gordon to Primus\u2019 outlandish Les Claypool, and more recently, a fresh crop of bass icons \u2014 including Esperanza Spalding and the ubiquitous Thundercat \u2014 have placed the low end at the center of their musical universes.\n\nAs with our 100 Greatest Drummers list, this rundown of the 50 greatest bassists of all time celebrates that entire spectrum. It\u2019s emphatically not intended as a ranking of objective skill; nor does it assign any one set of criteria as a measure of greatness. Instead it\u2019s an inventory of the bassists who have had the most direct and visible impact on creating, to borrow Kaye\u2019s term, the very foundation of popular music \u2014 from rock to funk to country to R&B to disco to hip-hop, and beyond \u2014 during the past half-century or so. You\u2019ll find obvious virtuosos here, but also musicians whose more minimal concept of their instrument\u2019s role elevated everything that was going on around them.\n\n\u201cYou grab it, slide around on it, and feel it with your hands,\u201d Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Flea once said of his signature instrument. \u201cYou slap, pull, thump, pluck, and pop, and you get yourself into this hypnotic state, if you\u2019re lucky, beyond thought, where you\u2019re not thinking because you\u2019re just a conduit for this rhythm, from wherever it comes from, from God to you and this instrument, through a cord and a speaker.\u201d\n\nHere we pay tribute to 50 musicians who have found that same exalted state via the bass, and changed the world in the process."}, {"url": "https://analogalien.com/artists/pino-palladino/", "page_content": "Pino Palladino is a bass legend.

It was a typically massive understatement from the quietly affable Welsh bassist, among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry. In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it. That\u2019s really nice to hear.\n\nListen to Pino Palladino and Blake Mills\u2019 Notes with Attachments here."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pino-palladino-mn0000292499/biography", "page_content": "Biography Pino Palladino Follow Artist +\n\nSince the 1980s, this session and live bassist is among the most prolific, gifted, and sought after by musicians of all genres.\n\nRead Full Biography"}, {"url": "https://whereseric.com/faq/palladino-pino/", "page_content": "Palladino, Pino\n\nPino Palladino was born in Cardiff, Wales.

At 17, he moved onto electric bass.\n\nAt 23, he moved to London where he joined Jools Holland\u2019s band The Millionaires, with whom he toured the UK and the US. Jools Holland had initially gained fame with Squeeze. In 1983, Pino recorded the classic No Parlez album with Paul Young and joined Young\u2019s band, The Royal Family, for 5 years.\n\nPino has maintained an active session calendar since the early 1980s. He has worked with artists as diverse as Ronan Keating, Bob James, Zucchero, David Gilmour, Pete Townshend, Don Henley, Tears For Fears, Rod Stewart, Elton John, Joan Armatrading, Gary Moore, Peter Cetera, Jeff Beck, Erykah Baduh, Go West, B.B.

His touch, his sound, his feel, Pino\u2019s got the whole thing going on.\n\nIf you discuss influences with any R&B, pop or jazz electric bassist, I guarantee that the name Pino Palladino will appear 99.9% of the time. During the past four decades, Pino has spread his colossal bass grooves into all corners of contemporary music, in almost every conceivable style and genre. Hailed by many as the British Jaco, his early recordings with Paul Young put expressive fretless bass playing back on the map. He reinvented himself as an R&B wizard in the 90s and evoked the spirit of John Entwistle with The Who in 2002, before easing into his current vintage-vibe with The John Mayer Trio.\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales, in 1957, Pino started out on classical guitar aged 14, moving over to electric bass three years later after discovering Motown and Stax Records, along with players like James Jamerson and Jaco Pastorius.\n\n\n\nIn the early 80s he moved to London and landed the bass gig with ex-Squeeze keyboard player, Jools Holland. This was followed by a stint with synth-pop star Gary Numan, before getting his big break as a member of Paul Young\u2019s band. His groundbreaking bass work on the 1983 album No Parlez culminated in a truly mesmerizing piece of fretless playing on Paul Young\u2019s cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Wherever I Lay My Hat.\u2019\n\nHere's Pino demonstrating the famous intro to that track.\n\nA steady flow of top session gigs followed working with the likes of Go West, Elton John and David Knofler, peaking with another standout fretless performance on Don Henley\u2019s \u2018New York Minute\u2019...\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Pino opened up about this part of his career.\n\nIt's about the song, the timing, all sorts of factors, but there are quite a few artists I've worked with where I've contributed more than they would have expected, such as coming up with sub-hooks that make the record better. It certainly worked for me; for a few years people were phoning from all over the world wanting that sound.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close the sound of Pino\u2019s fretless MusicMan StingRay had become almost mandatory among studio producers of the day, with Pino often called in purely to overdub his sound over existing fretted bass tracks. One of the world\u2019s premier fretless bassists had well and truly arrived.\n\n\n\nNow it's easy to think that Pino is simply what we could refer to as a \"groover\". A bass player that is happiest in the background simply holding down the lowend and making the band, well, groove. And while that may be somewhat true, unknown to some, Pino has formidable chops and facility on the bass and can certainly solo with the best of them.\n\n\n\nJust check out Pino's blazing solo fretless lines on his 5 string Musicman Stingray with Manu Katche on drums and Dominic Miller on guitar.\n\nAnd here you can hear that soloing is not something he only saves for his 5 string, as he weaves his way around his trusty Musicman 4 string with ease.\n\n\n\nPino has played a number of basses during his career, but his trademark fretless sound came from his much loved Music Man StingRay, which he bought from Sam Ash music in NYC. He\u2019d tried out a few fretted Music Man basses before but thought they sounded too trebly, but with this particular bass, which I think is a 1979 sunburst model with a rosewood board, he found a warmer more versatile sound and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nOther basses in his early career included a fretless Pedulla and a Warwick Thumb, but his move back to playing more vintage-style fretted basses was led by a number of P Basses from the early 60s, one of which the Fender Custom Shop chose to reproduce for his signature model, complete with Thomastik-Infeld strings. He also plays a Moon Bass, which he used extensively for the D\u2019Angelo Voodoo tour back in 2002. And as for his strings, he uses Rotosound Swing Bass stainless steel mediums, which he prefers for the fretless sound, and Thomastiks or La Bella heavy gauge flatwounds for the P Bass.\n\nPino's Fender Signature P-Bass\n\nAside from his StingRay, Pino\u2019s fretless sound also became synonymous with a Boss 0C-2 octave pedal, which can really be heard on Paul Young\u2019s I\u2019m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down.\n\nPino continued to bolster his CV during the 1990s with sessions for the likes of Eric Clapton, Seal, Elton John, Tears for Fears, David Gilmour, Chaka Khan, Pete Townsend and Joan Armatrading, and jazzers such as Al Di Meola, John McClaughlin, David Sanborn and Chris Botti.\n\n\n\nIt was also around this time that he resurfaced in full on R&B groove mode, hitting unbelievable new heights with the epic 2000 recording, Voodoo by D\u2019Angelo.\n\n\n\nThe album\u2019s greasy, laid back feel caused a huge buzz among rhythm sections everywhere, and led to a who\u2019s who of hip hop artists summoning Pino and his 1963 P Bass to their studios. Just listen to how Pino's killer bass line on Chicken Grease sits so lazily in the back of the pocket. Pino is also all over D\u2019Angelo\u2019s 2014 album, Black Messiah, Erykah Badu\u2019s Mama\u2019s Gun and Aijuswanaseeing by Musiq (Soulchild) which all serve as an amazing schooling in the way of the lowend.\n\n\n\nAs the world ushered in the year 2000 Pino was about to reinvent himself yet again. Here's a quote directly from Pino:\n\nIt's important to be able to reinvent what you do. When the call came to play with The Who I was working with Erykah Badu and D'Angelo, and I had to change my whole style. The manager said: 'John [Entwistle] is dead.

Pete Townshend's direction was, 'Play whatever you want, just as long as you play loud!'\n\nThe early 2000's saw Pino filling the bass chair with Simon and Garfunkel on their 2003 reunion tour and he was also drafted in for heavyweight album sessions with the likes of Adele, Ed Sheeran and even Nine Inch Nails. It was during this steady schedule of studio work that Pino took a call that would once again cement his place as one of the most admired bassists in contemporary music.\n\n\n\nWhen bassist Willie Weeks was unable to make a John Mayer gig for the Tsunami Aid benefit concert in 2005, drummer Steve Jordan suggested they call Pino and the rest is history.

Pino\u2019s ability to fit his unique style into any type of music and not only make it work but make it sound great is a rare skill indeed. It\u2019s the combination of these qualities that make Pino Palladino a bass superman.\n\nThe complete package, Pino can make it funky, melodic, and anything in between all the while serving the song perfectly. Never getting in the way of the other musicians, Pino always adds just the right feel to the track.\n\nPino Palladino\u2019s early years\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales on October 17, 1957, Palladino originally started on guitar, but at age 16 he picked up a friend\u2019s bass and realized that this was the instrument for him. Soon after, he bought a Fender Precision. Not long after that, he begins his journey as a professional bass player.\n\nHeavily influenced by James Jamerson , Stevie Wonder, Michael Henderson, Jaco Pastorius, and Paul Jackson, Pino begins to develop his own personal style and technique. After playing for a local Cardiff television station, Pino moves to London in 1980 to join a band led by Jools Holland of Squeeze. As Pino began to make a name for himself in London, he soon became a highly sought after session player.\n\nIt was around this time that Pino began using a fretless Music Man Stingray (another company started by Leo Fender). His highly expressive lead fretless bass line for Paul Young\u2019s cover of \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat (That\u2019s My Home)\u201d became an instant classic. Pino also worked with Gary Numan on his album I, Assassin. Numan has stated that he was blown away by Palladino\u2019s amazing bass playing. He\u2019s also said that his unusual fretless tone defined the album with its atmospheric and dreamy quality.\n\nPino leaves the fretless behind and meets D\u2019Angelo\n\nIn the early 1990s, Pino switched from his fretless Musicman Stingray to a fretted sunburst 1963 Fender Precision bass with La Bella flatwound strings. The change was both a musical and personal decision. Pino had grown tired of the lead fretless sound, and he also felt the need to return to his love of the old R&B and soul bass sound.\n\nAfter recording an album with Tom Jones and B.B. King, Pino caught the attention of neo-soul artist D\u2019Angelo who was looking for a certain bass sound for his new album, Voodoo. Palladino\u2019s greasy, fat, laid-back grooves on his \u201963 P-Bass gave the recording an old-school vibe that had a large impact not only on bassists but on entire rhythm sections in general. This led to many more session jobs in the neo-soul style for the now very in-demand bassist.\n\nPino\u2019s uncanny ability to adapt to any style and make it his own is what truly sets him apart from the ordinary session bassist. His amazing feel and intuition allow him to be both expressive and tasteful with his bass lines. Pino has stated that he has something he calls \u201ctrust chops,\u201d instincts that help him figure out what to play through difficult sections.\n\nNew Directions with The Who\n\nAfter the untimely 2002 death of the great bassist John Entwistle, the surviving members of The Who asked Palladino to play bass for the remainder of their tour. He\u2019s now their permanent bassist. Having played with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey previously made this very daunting task a little easier for him, Palladino also personally knew Entwistle.\n\nFor The Who gig, Pino started with both Fender Precision and Jazz basses, finally settling on Fender Jaguar basses, which he likes for their powerful cutting tone. He has said many times that playing with The Who is like a dream come true, and sometimes he can hardly believe that he\u2019s on stage with them.\n\nPino has stated that Pete Townshend had given him full freedom with the bass lines, although he tries to keep them as faithful to John\u2019s original lines as possible. In 2003, Pino started working with Paul Simon for his tour and recorded an album with him in 2006. For this gig, he used his fiesta red 1961 Fender Precision with flatwound strings.\n\nPino\u2019s recent work \u2013 and into the future\n\nPino Palladino\u2019s signature Precision Bass\n\nPalladino has also had the great honor of having Fender issue a signature bass in his name. The Fender Pino Palladino Precision Bass is a Custom Shop creation featuring a body modeled after his \u201961 Precision and the neck shape after his \u201963 P-Bass. The bass is finished in fiesta red over desert sand and given the relic treatment by the Custom Shop craftsmen.\n\nThe John Mayer Trio and many others\n\nDuring the Tsunami Aid benefit concert in 2005, Pino met guitarist John Mayer through drummer Steve Jordan. After original bassist Willie Weeks was unable to perform, Pino was asked to fill in for the concert. The three hit it off well in the studio. Pino later stated that there was instant chemistry between the three musicians. They later decided to form a power trio and set up some tour dates. The John Mayer Trio was born, and this gave Palladino a new opportunity to add creatively in a band context.\n\nIn 2006, Pino joined Jeff Beck for a tour and also worked with Eric Clapton, J.J. Cale, Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston on an album. He\u2019s also played with Robbie Robertson and Herbie Hancock and worked on a follow up to the Voodoo album with D\u2019Angelo entitled Black Messiah.\n\nAs clear evidence of Palladino\u2019s vast range and versatility, in 2013 he played on the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks and toured with the band as well.\n\nPino Palladino is probably the most sought after bassist in music today and for good reason. His bass chops, great tone, and musical instincts are unparalleled in the industry. We look forward to more great work from Pino for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://www.soundonsound.com/people/alan-douglas-recording-eric-clapton", "page_content": "Interview | Engineer Recording By Richard Buskin\n\nWith his fame and status as a world\u2011class musician and recording artist, Eric Clapton can afford to spend as much time as he thinks necessary honing his next release. Richard Buskin talks to engineer Alan Douglas about the lengthy sessions and changes of heart surrounding the recording of the new Clapton album, Pilgrim.\n\n\"The conventional way of making an album is often to record the backing tracks and then do the overdubs, so you're always cycling through the songs,\" says engineer Alan Douglas. \"On this album, however, we could literally go for six weeks and maybe only touch on four songs. It was incredibly intense.\"\n\nThe album: Pilgrim. The artist: Eric Clapton. The recording procedure: not exactly the norm.\n\n\"We'd work on one song until Eric couldn't stand working on it any more, and then we'd work on another, before returning to the first one,\" Douglas recalls. \"It was certainly a little unusual.\"\n\nFor Alan Douglas, certainly. A man who thrives on live recording, staking his reputation on being able to acquit himself quickly and competently, Douglas was involved at both ends of the recording spectrum on the Pilgrim project: the live and the programmed, the improvised and the extensively reworked. It was, as he puts it, \"always evolving, always interesting\".\n\nDouglas started out as a tape operator at The Manor studios in Oxfordshire in 1976, and when Virgin Records opened The Townhouse in London two years later, he moved there and began engineering for artists ranging from Queen to The Jam. Eventually he progressed to Chief Engineer status, oversaw the installation of new studios within the Townhouse facility, and, together with Sam Toyoshima, helped redesign Olympic Studios in Barnes. Remaining with Virgin until the EMI buyout in 1991, he then went freelance.\n\n\"The period during which I worked on Olympic in the mid\u2011'80s was when sequencers were beginning to make the first inroads, and I just hated it,\" Douglas recalls, giving a fair indication of where his professional tastes lie. \"The problem with working with machines and bad programmers was that nothing ever changed, and of course these were also very poor sequencers that we were using. I can clearly remember doing a session at Townhouse 2 with some act or other; we started at about 11.30 in the morning, they began running this sequencer and quickly got some sounds to work with, and we just worked and worked and worked, and I sat there and basically did nothing all day and all night. Finally, at about 2.30 in the morning, one of the guys said, 'OK, let's just run it one more time before we go to bed.' Now, nothing had been recorded at this stage, the sequence was just running live, and I sat there and thought, 'That sequence is exactly the same as it was when we started this morning!' Nothing had changed, nothing had happened.\n\nWe could literally go for six weeks and maybe only touch on four songs. It was incredibly intense.\n\n\"For me, the buzz has always been live musicians \u2014 and preferably great live musicians \u2014 interacting, because there's a spark that happens when you get great people in the room together. So, I just became very disillusioned and basically buried myself in projects, which was a way of keeping working without anyone saying, 'Hang on a second, what does he actually do?' When the Olympic project came along I threw myself into that.\"\n\nAs long as Douglas was involved with design and installation projects he was relatively contented. However, once the projects were finished, tedium set in. \"By the time the Olympic project was finished I basically hadn't done much engineering for nearly three years,\" he says. \"That was apart from some sessions with Steve Lillywhite, and I was bored senseless. Also, the other problem with being the Chief Engineer at places like Townhouse and Olympic is that, because of their stature, all of the great clients they attract come in with their own engineers, and so you tend to end up just filling in and doing all of the crap.\"\n\nClearly, it was time for Alan Douglas to branch out on his own. This he did.\n\n\"When EMI bought out the record company and discovered that the studios were all part of the package I found myself with a golden opportunity to be made redundant, get a payoff and go freelance,\" he says. The fact that he took that opportunity represents a decision he wouldn't regret, and he's now forged a reputation based on live band recordings and an ability to work calmly and efficiently with sometimes complicated situations. \"If people are pushed for time, they know that I'm not going to be messing around, taking ages to get sounds,\" he says. \"I'll work quickly to get the drum sound and set everything else up, and then I'll be running tape in 'record'.\"\n\nFast\u2011forward to September 2, 1996, and the start of sessions for Pilgrim. Previously, Douglas had worked with Eric Clapton on the Grammy Award\u2011winning From The Cradle, in addition to a couple of soundtracks. This time around, the venue was Ocean Way recording in Los Angeles, and, initially, Clapton was acting as producer for his own material, which Marcus Miller was producing some songs that he himself brought to the project, whilst also working on the music for a Giorgio Armani fashion show. Such are the demands made on one of the world's great white blues guitarists. Nevertheless, somewhat out of his milieu with the Armani assignment, Clapton had turned to songwriter/producer Simon Climie (formerly of Climie Fisher) for assistance. The two men had worked on the Armani songs at Climie's small Pro Tools\u2011equipped facility in the UK, and Climie had then travelled with Clapton to LA where, it was intended, they could continue their collaboration in conjunction with Alan Douglas, while Douglas, Clapton and Marcus Miller would also be working on Pilgrim. However, as time progressed, Climie became more and more involved with this record as well \u2014 a somewhat informal start to what would turn out to be an increasingly convoluted production.\n\nRecording originally took place in the large studio at Ocean Way. There the control room houses a custom 80\u2011input Neve 8078 console which, constructed from two 8078s in a single frame, and courtesy of 32 additional monitor mix inputs and 64\u2011channel metering, is one of the largest desks of its type anywhere in the world. \"That room sounds fantastic,\" asserts Douglas. \"In fact, it's one of the best live rooms I've ever worked in.\" Sony 48\u2011track digital machines were employed there and elsewhere throughout the project.\n\nPositioned at the far end of the live room was drummer Steve Gadd, who was miked with an AKG D112 on the bass drum, a Shure SM57 or AKG 414 on top of the snare, with a 57 on the bottom, 414s on the four toms, a Neumann KM254 on the ride cymbal, a Schoeps CMC5 on the hi\u2011hat, Neumann U67s for the overheads, an AKG C24 for close ambience, and Neumann M50s for the room. Nathan East was playing bass, and was recorded with a combination of DI and a valve Neumann U47 on an Eden World Touring Series cabinet. Also DI'd was Greg Phillinganes on keyboards, while Eric Clapton's guitar contributions \u2014 performed mainly with his signature series custom Fender Strats \u2014 were recorded in the way that Alan Douglas prefers to deal with all guitars: a Beyer M88 on the center of one speaker, an Electrovoice RE20 off\u2011centre on the same speaker, and an SM57 on the centre of another speaker of a custom 1950s Fender Tweed Twin. Guitar ambience was recorded with a C24 (in LA) or a Neumann M49 or U67 (in London).\n\n\"I've done things that way for years,\" Douglas says, \"because I can get pretty much any guitar sound in the control room just by moving faders. So, in other words, if you want it very middly, you go for more of \u2014 or exclusively \u2014 the 57; the 88 does the high, bright stuff; and the RE20 gives you the bottom end and the grunge. Ever since I started recording I've always had one microphone in the brightest spot in the center of the cone and another offset, and it's just evolved into three microphones. I invariably use the same microphones \u2014 they're also microphones that studios always have \u2014 and it's a case of just moving the faders without having to move the actual microphones on the guitar cabinets.\"\n\nA Beyer M88, going through a Summit dual tube pre\u2011amp, and an AKG C28 were employed for Clapton's vocals, which were recorded at the same time as the band played live together in the studio. As for the main man's guitar playing, according to Alan Douglas there was no difficulty in coaxing a performance out of him. Indeed, it was sometimes almost a case of stopping him when more than enough was already in the can. \"Sometimes I'd be mixing or doing whatever and he'd be sitting at the back of the room,\" Douglas recalls, \"and he'd just get bored, so he'd pick up a guitar \u2014 like he always does \u2014 and start playing, and he'd come up with a part! Not necessarily for the song I was working on, but for another song!\"\n\nOut of about 20 numbers that were worked on in various guises as the project progressed, 14 made it onto the finished album, most of them written by Clapton himself. A couple were also co\u2011written with Simon Climie, while 'Born In Time' is a Bob Dylan composition that was originally offered to Clapton back in 1987. At that time the guitarist was enthusiastic to record it, only to have his nose put slightly out of joint when he discovered that Dylan had just recorded it for an album of his own. Nonetheless, nearly 10 years later Bob had the nerve to send him the original demo of the song once again, and this time his perseverance paid off.\n\nIn terms of songwriting, arrangements, guitar parts, styles of singing and styles of guitar playing, every single avenue was explored on every song.\n\n\"Aside from a couple of songs that Eric had already played live, none of the material had been demo'd or rehearsed with a band when we entered the studio,\" Alan Douglas recalls. \"It mostly consisted of ideas, around which Eric could develop guitar or lyrical ideas, so everything kept evolving and nothing was fixed until the record reached the shops. It was all in a constant state of flux until he was absolutely happy with something and we hadn't touched it for a couple of months. Only then could we be fairly sure that the arrangement of the song and the style of the vocal and guitar were here to stay.\"\n\nNote that Douglas says \"fairly sure,\" not \"totally sure,\" which is highly significant in the light of how things eventually turned out. More about this in a moment, but suffice to say that, even in the short term, a tune that started out with, say, a funky rhythm could turn into quite the opposite, courtesy of EC adding new and varied guitar parts. Then, at an even later stage, the funk element might well reappear. There was no way of knowing what direction the material \u2014 or, indeed, the album \u2014 would be going in from one month to the next.\n\n\"After we'd returned to England, 95% of the material that we'd recorded in LA was basically scrapped,\" says Douglas. \"Let's just say that Eric didn't feel it was 'different' or current enough. I mean, as a band recording it sounded fantastic, but he just decided that it wasn't what he wanted the record to be. I think he considered it to be too ordinary and, since he really loves contemporary American R&B and hip hop records, he wanted to get that type of feeling on the record... As time went on it became much more of an Eric album, with his own compositions largely replacing those of other people.\"\n\nFortunately, since this was the middle of November 1996 and June of 1997 had been mentioned only as a rough delivery date to the record company, there still wasn't too much pressure on Clapton to come up with the finished goods. It was just as well. Work on a film soundtrack and the much\u2011touted TDF project (more on this shortly) had to take place before sessions could resume in mid\u2011January 1997 for the Pilgrim album. These took place in Olympic's Studio 1, which was newly equipped with a 72\u2011channel SSL J\u2011Series console that Douglas asserts is \"sonically brilliant. I think it's the best sounding analogue console I've ever heard. I just love it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Olympic 2, with its 56\u2011channel G\u2011Series, Townhouse 1, with its 72\u2011channel G\u2011Plus, and a Focusrite\u2011equipped room at Metropolis also came into play.\"We'd originally intended to do the whole album in Olympic 1,\" Douglas points out, \"but it was booked, so we went to LA.\"\n\nThe subsequent re\u2011recordings (and re\u2011re\u2011recordings) would eventually last until November of '97: \"For the new sessions the initial idea was to keep the tracks and simply add programmed drums. Almost everything had been recorded to a click, so there was a tempo. However, it rapidly became apparent that, for a variety of reasons, this alone wasn't going to be enough to make it work. All of the keyboards and bass were programmed, although, apart from one song, the bass was re\u2011played by Nathan [East], Pino Palladino and Dave Bronze. Chris Stainton also played some piano, Paul Carrack played Hammond and Luis Jardim was on percussion, while Tony Rich, Kenny Edmonds and an English singer named Chyna added backing vocals. Then there were the strings \u2014 24 to 30 pieces \u2014 arranged by Nick Ingman and played by the London Session Orchestra.\n\n\"In essence, the programmed bass and keyboards were really intended to kick\u2011start things, but in many cases they stayed, while in others we ended up with the real thing.\"\n\n'Broken Hearted' is the only one of the live band tracks to have survived, and to have made it onto the finished album, albeit with the addition of programmed drums. Still, in charting the development of particular songs on Pilgrim, a number entitled 'River Of Tears' encapsulates the mayhem that normally surrounded the evolutionary process. Initially, Clapton came up with a song idea based on a pair of contrapuntal guitar parts. These were duly recorded, while Simon Climie produced a fretless bass arpeggio on a Korg Trinity, to the accompaniment of sleigh bells, snare and bass drum samples. Paul Waller \u2014 a programmer who is particularly good at finding obscure loops that are perfect for a track \u2014 did the programming and Emagic's Logic Audio 2.62 was the sequencer employed. Simplicity was the key here, but then...\n\n\"We ended up working on that track for weeks and weeks and weeks,\" reports Alan Douglas. \"I mean, nothing's that simple! We'd had the bones of the song recorded in about four hours and it was in shape \u2014 which, on this album, was a completely alien concept \u2014 but then we spent several weeks rearranging and editing it, so in that way it joined the rest of the cast... We actually needed to edit it, because it was something like 30 minutes long at one point! Pino ended up playing roots for the arpeggio \u2014 which is probably an octave above where a bass would play \u2014 while Eric contributed slide guitar and vocals. Still, the guitars and the original arpeggio never changed, other than any amendments that were necessitated by the changing arrangement.\n\nThere are no words to describe how great it is to be in the engineer's seat when Eric is improvising a solo.\n\n\"This kind of approach really originated with the TDF project. The basic concept for that was simple; Eric had written music for a show with Simon Climie and, since it was far too good to leave hanging around, he decided to do an anonymous record so as not to clash with his own album's release. I did a mix of a short piece for the Armani show during a lunchbreak at Ocean Way, and, inspired by the Underworld track on the Trainspotting album, I had a very close repeat on the bass drum. Then, because I was getting bored, I started to feed it back in a mad dub style and it made this great sound, like a helicopter. I didn't think much more about it, but then a loop of those mad, fed\u2011back drums became the basis for the TDF track 'Sno\u2011God' \u2014 this stupid thing that I'd done in half an hour during the lunch break! However, because of that attitude towards working, everything pretty much had to be arranged in Pro Tools or Logic Audio.\n\n\"Anyway, when were mixing one of the TDF tracks, on the second day Eric said, 'You know, I've never liked the way that bit follows that bit. Why don't we try...' At that point everything stopped. It was the second day of the mix and we had to rearrange the entire song. Simon sorted out the new arrangement in Pro Tools and, because we always worked digitally, it was very easy to transfer in and out of Pro Tools digitally and avoid the level and speed problems that you'd normally get with analogue. So the song was rearranged, and then it would be a case of 'I think it needs a guitar.' The capacity within Pro Tools to do something, get it so that you liked it and then say, 'Well, actually, I don't know if I ever did really like it. Why don't we try this...' sort of set the scene for how the Pilgrim album would be done.\n\n\"Sonically things were always pretty straightforward \u2014 I didn't have to put microphones down toilet pans or anything like that. However, in terms of songwriting, arrangements, guitar parts, styles of singing and styles of guitar playing, every single avenue was explored on every song, giving me the opportunity to work with some of the best musicians on the planet. There are no words to describe how great it is to be in the engineer's seat when Eric is improvising a solo. Still, even though it may sound self\u2011indulgent, with a lot of over\u2011refining, it really wasn't as overblown as you might think; it was much more of a groove thing, where something would feel good and Eric would just keep playing... After all, Eric was enjoying himself and the drum machine would never get tired!\""}, {"url": "https://www.seance-centre.com/other-releases/pino-palladino-blake-mills-sam-gendel", "page_content": "sold out\n\n$28.00\n\n\u201cLive at Sound City\u201d is an instrumental collaboration between bassist Pino Palladino, guitarist/multi-instrumentalist/producer Blake Mills, and LA-based saxophonist Sam Gendel.

During the past four decades, Pino has spread his colossal bass grooves into all corners of contemporary music, in almost every conceivable style and genre. Hailed by many as the British Jaco, his early recordings with Paul Young put expressive fretless bass playing back on the map. He reinvented himself as an R&B wizard in the 90s and evoked the spirit of John Entwistle with The Who in 2002, before easing into his current vintage-vibe with The John Mayer Trio.\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales, in 1957, Pino started out on classical guitar aged 14, moving over to electric bass three years later after discovering Motown and Stax Records, along with players like James Jamerson and Jaco Pastorius.\n\n\n\nIn the early 80s he moved to London and landed the bass gig with ex-Squeeze keyboard player, Jools Holland. This was followed by a stint with synth-pop star Gary Numan, before getting his big break as a member of Paul Young\u2019s band. His groundbreaking bass work on the 1983 album No Parlez culminated in a truly mesmerizing piece of fretless playing on Paul Young\u2019s cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Wherever I Lay My Hat.\u2019\n\nHere's Pino demonstrating the famous intro to that track.\n\nA steady flow of top session gigs followed working with the likes of Go West, Elton John and David Knofler, peaking with another standout fretless performance on Don Henley\u2019s \u2018New York Minute\u2019...\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Pino opened up about this part of his career.\n\nIt's about the song, the timing, all sorts of factors, but there are quite a few artists I've worked with where I've contributed more than they would have expected, such as coming up with sub-hooks that make the record better. It certainly worked for me; for a few years people were phoning from all over the world wanting that sound.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close the sound of Pino\u2019s fretless MusicMan StingRay had become almost mandatory among studio producers of the day, with Pino often called in purely to overdub his sound over existing fretted bass tracks. One of the world\u2019s premier fretless bassists had well and truly arrived.\n\n\n\nNow it's easy to think that Pino is simply what we could refer to as a \"groover\". A bass player that is happiest in the background simply holding down the lowend and making the band, well, groove. And while that may be somewhat true, unknown to some, Pino has formidable chops and facility on the bass and can certainly solo with the best of them.\n\n\n\nJust check out Pino's blazing solo fretless lines on his 5 string Musicman Stingray with Manu Katche on drums and Dominic Miller on guitar.\n\nAnd here you can hear that soloing is not something he only saves for his 5 string, as he weaves his way around his trusty Musicman 4 string with ease.\n\n\n\nPino has played a number of basses during his career, but his trademark fretless sound came from his much loved Music Man StingRay, which he bought from Sam Ash music in NYC. He\u2019d tried out a few fretted Music Man basses before but thought they sounded too trebly, but with this particular bass, which I think is a 1979 sunburst model with a rosewood board, he found a warmer more versatile sound and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nOther basses in his early career included a fretless Pedulla and a Warwick Thumb, but his move back to playing more vintage-style fretted basses was led by a number of P Basses from the early 60s, one of which the Fender Custom Shop chose to reproduce for his signature model, complete with Thomastik-Infeld strings. He also plays a Moon Bass, which he used extensively for the D\u2019Angelo Voodoo tour back in 2002. And as for his strings, he uses Rotosound Swing Bass stainless steel mediums, which he prefers for the fretless sound, and Thomastiks or La Bella heavy gauge flatwounds for the P Bass.\n\nPino's Fender Signature P-Bass\n\nAside from his StingRay, Pino\u2019s fretless sound also became synonymous with a Boss 0C-2 octave pedal, which can really be heard on Paul Young\u2019s I\u2019m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down.\n\nPino continued to bolster his CV during the 1990s with sessions for the likes of Eric Clapton, Seal, Elton John, Tears for Fears, David Gilmour, Chaka Khan, Pete Townsend and Joan Armatrading, and jazzers such as Al Di Meola, John McClaughlin, David Sanborn and Chris Botti.\n\n\n\nIt was also around this time that he resurfaced in full on R&B groove mode, hitting unbelievable new heights with the epic 2000 recording, Voodoo by D\u2019Angelo.\n\n\n\nThe album\u2019s greasy, laid back feel caused a huge buzz among rhythm sections everywhere, and led to a who\u2019s who of hip hop artists summoning Pino and his 1963 P Bass to their studios. Just listen to how Pino's killer bass line on Chicken Grease sits so lazily in the back of the pocket. Pino is also all over D\u2019Angelo\u2019s 2014 album, Black Messiah, Erykah Badu\u2019s Mama\u2019s Gun and Aijuswanaseeing by Musiq (Soulchild) which all serve as an amazing schooling in the way of the lowend.\n\n\n\nAs the world ushered in the year 2000 Pino was about to reinvent himself yet again. Here's a quote directly from Pino:\n\nIt's important to be able to reinvent what you do. When the call came to play with The Who I was working with Erykah Badu and D'Angelo, and I had to change my whole style. The manager said: 'John [Entwistle] is dead. Can you do a gig at the Hollywood Bowl in three days' time?' You don't turn down something like that. It was only afterwards that I thought about the consequences. Pete Townshend's direction was, 'Play whatever you want, just as long as you play loud!'\n\nThe early 2000's saw Pino filling the bass chair with Simon and Garfunkel on their 2003 reunion tour and he was also drafted in for heavyweight album sessions with the likes of Adele, Ed Sheeran and even Nine Inch Nails. It was during this steady schedule of studio work that Pino took a call that would once again cement his place as one of the most admired bassists in contemporary music.\n\n\n\nWhen bassist Willie Weeks was unable to make a John Mayer gig for the Tsunami Aid benefit concert in 2005, drummer Steve Jordan suggested they call Pino and the rest is history. Countless tours and stadium gigs followed, with the band\u2019s chemistry captured brilliantly on the 2005 live album, Try! And again on the 2008 live DVD, Where The Light Is.\n\n\n\nJust check out the amazing chemistry between Pino, John and Steve on \"Who do you think I was\" to say it's a perfect demonstration of how in the pocket a trio can be would be an understatement, and please, let's just give it up for Steve Jordon on this one, surely one of the coolest drummers in history."}], "Pino Palladino worked with John Mayer.": [{"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/watch-john-mayer-trio-steve-jordan-pino-palladino-play-live-first-time-in-six-years", "page_content": "John Mayer has covered a lot of musical ground since first album, Inside Wants Out.

It was a typically massive understatement from the quietly affable Welsh bassist, among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry. In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it. That\u2019s really nice to hear.\n\nListen to Pino Palladino and Blake Mills\u2019 Notes with Attachments here."}, {"url": "https://www.guitarplayer.com/news/watch-john-mayer-reunite-with-the-john-mayer-trio-and-his-jimi-hendrix-monterey-stratocaster", "page_content": "Back in 2018, John Mayer \u2013 previously a Fender endorsee \u2013 rocked the guitar universe when he and PRS introduced the Silver Sky, a signature electric guitar that sought to build upon the Fender Stratocaster template.\n\nControversial upon its introduction, the six-string has since become a smashing success, quickly becoming one of the best-selling electric guitars on the market.\n\nIn the years since its introduction, Mayer has almost exclusively used the Silver Sky onstage for his solo shows and with Dead & Co.\n\nLast week (March 9), though, during the Love Rocks Benefit Concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, Mayer not only picked up a Stratocaster again, he did so with a reunited John Mayer Trio.\n\nMayer, session legend Pino Palladino on bass guitar, and now-Rolling Stones drummer Steve Jordan performed together for the first time in six years, easing their way through a scintillating three-song set, the entirety of which you can see below.\n\nThe trio opened with \"Who Did You Think I Was,\" a Mayer original that featured on their 2005 live album, Try!, followed by \"Vultures,\" which also featured on Try!, and, later, Mayer's hit 2006 album, Continuum.

But only after some helpful advice from Townshend.\n\n\u201cAt the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket,\u201c said Palladino. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino also speaks about his career through the 80s, when he was on speed dial for any pop star who needed some four-string flair in the low end. But in a career that saw him play on some of the top-selling albums of all time, Palladino considers his collaboration with neo soul pioneer D'Angelo, as bassist of the Soulquarians, the personal highlight.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone,\u201c said Palladino. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played.\u201c\n\nPalladino has just released Notes With Attachments with the Californian guitarist and composer Blake Mills, available now through New Deal Records.

His touch, his sound, his feel, Pino\u2019s got the whole thing going on.\n\nIf you discuss influences with any R&B, pop or jazz electric bassist, I guarantee that the name Pino Palladino will appear 99.9% of the time. During the past four decades, Pino has spread his colossal bass grooves into all corners of contemporary music, in almost every conceivable style and genre. Hailed by many as the British Jaco, his early recordings with Paul Young put expressive fretless bass playing back on the map. He reinvented himself as an R&B wizard in the 90s and evoked the spirit of John Entwistle with The Who in 2002, before easing into his current vintage-vibe with The John Mayer Trio.\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales, in 1957, Pino started out on classical guitar aged 14, moving over to electric bass three years later after discovering Motown and Stax Records, along with players like James Jamerson and Jaco Pastorius.\n\n\n\nIn the early 80s he moved to London and landed the bass gig with ex-Squeeze keyboard player, Jools Holland. This was followed by a stint with synth-pop star Gary Numan, before getting his big break as a member of Paul Young\u2019s band. His groundbreaking bass work on the 1983 album No Parlez culminated in a truly mesmerizing piece of fretless playing on Paul Young\u2019s cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Wherever I Lay My Hat.\u2019\n\nHere's Pino demonstrating the famous intro to that track.\n\nA steady flow of top session gigs followed working with the likes of Go West, Elton John and David Knofler, peaking with another standout fretless performance on Don Henley\u2019s \u2018New York Minute\u2019...\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Pino opened up about this part of his career.\n\nIt's about the song, the timing, all sorts of factors, but there are quite a few artists I've worked with where I've contributed more than they would have expected, such as coming up with sub-hooks that make the record better. It certainly worked for me; for a few years people were phoning from all over the world wanting that sound.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close the sound of Pino\u2019s fretless MusicMan StingRay had become almost mandatory among studio producers of the day, with Pino often called in purely to overdub his sound over existing fretted bass tracks. One of the world\u2019s premier fretless bassists had well and truly arrived.\n\n\n\nNow it's easy to think that Pino is simply what we could refer to as a \"groover\". A bass player that is happiest in the background simply holding down the lowend and making the band, well, groove. And while that may be somewhat true, unknown to some, Pino has formidable chops and facility on the bass and can certainly solo with the best of them.\n\n\n\nJust check out Pino's blazing solo fretless lines on his 5 string Musicman Stingray with Manu Katche on drums and Dominic Miller on guitar.\n\nAnd here you can hear that soloing is not something he only saves for his 5 string, as he weaves his way around his trusty Musicman 4 string with ease.\n\n\n\nPino has played a number of basses during his career, but his trademark fretless sound came from his much loved Music Man StingRay, which he bought from Sam Ash music in NYC. He\u2019d tried out a few fretted Music Man basses before but thought they sounded too trebly, but with this particular bass, which I think is a 1979 sunburst model with a rosewood board, he found a warmer more versatile sound and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nOther basses in his early career included a fretless Pedulla and a Warwick Thumb, but his move back to playing more vintage-style fretted basses was led by a number of P Basses from the early 60s, one of which the Fender Custom Shop chose to reproduce for his signature model, complete with Thomastik-Infeld strings. He also plays a Moon Bass, which he used extensively for the D\u2019Angelo Voodoo tour back in 2002. And as for his strings, he uses Rotosound Swing Bass stainless steel mediums, which he prefers for the fretless sound, and Thomastiks or La Bella heavy gauge flatwounds for the P Bass.\n\nPino's Fender Signature P-Bass\n\nAside from his StingRay, Pino\u2019s fretless sound also became synonymous with a Boss 0C-2 octave pedal, which can really be heard on Paul Young\u2019s I\u2019m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down.\n\nPino continued to bolster his CV during the 1990s with sessions for the likes of Eric Clapton, Seal, Elton John, Tears for Fears, David Gilmour, Chaka Khan, Pete Townsend and Joan Armatrading, and jazzers such as Al Di Meola, John McClaughlin, David Sanborn and Chris Botti.\n\n\n\nIt was also around this time that he resurfaced in full on R&B groove mode, hitting unbelievable new heights with the epic 2000 recording, Voodoo by D\u2019Angelo.\n\n\n\nThe album\u2019s greasy, laid back feel caused a huge buzz among rhythm sections everywhere, and led to a who\u2019s who of hip hop artists summoning Pino and his 1963 P Bass to their studios. Just listen to how Pino's killer bass line on Chicken Grease sits so lazily in the back of the pocket. Pino is also all over D\u2019Angelo\u2019s 2014 album, Black Messiah, Erykah Badu\u2019s Mama\u2019s Gun and Aijuswanaseeing by Musiq (Soulchild) which all serve as an amazing schooling in the way of the lowend.\n\n\n\nAs the world ushered in the year 2000 Pino was about to reinvent himself yet again. Here's a quote directly from Pino:\n\nIt's important to be able to reinvent what you do. When the call came to play with The Who I was working with Erykah Badu and D'Angelo, and I had to change my whole style. The manager said: 'John [Entwistle] is dead. Can you do a gig at the Hollywood Bowl in three days' time?' You don't turn down something like that. It was only afterwards that I thought about the consequences. Pete Townshend's direction was, 'Play whatever you want, just as long as you play loud!'\n\nThe early 2000's saw Pino filling the bass chair with Simon and Garfunkel on their 2003 reunion tour and he was also drafted in for heavyweight album sessions with the likes of Adele, Ed Sheeran and even Nine Inch Nails. It was during this steady schedule of studio work that Pino took a call that would once again cement his place as one of the most admired bassists in contemporary music.\n\n\n\nWhen bassist Willie Weeks was unable to make a John Mayer gig for the Tsunami Aid benefit concert in 2005, drummer Steve Jordan suggested they call Pino and the rest is history. Countless tours and stadium gigs followed, with the band\u2019s chemistry captured brilliantly on the 2005 live album, Try! And again on the 2008 live DVD, Where The Light Is.\n\n\n\nJust check out the amazing chemistry between Pino, John and Steve on \"Who do you think I was\" to say it's a perfect demonstration of how in the pocket a trio can be would be an understatement, and please, let's just give it up for Steve Jordon on this one, surely one of the coolest drummers in history."}], "Pino Palladino worked with The RH Factor.": [{"url": "https://analogalien.com/artists/pino-palladino/", "page_content": "Pino Palladino is a bass legend.

It was a typically massive understatement from the quietly affable Welsh bassist, among the highest-regarded session players in the music industry. In this case, Palladino was referring to hearing Paul Young\u2019s \u201cWherever I Lay My Hat\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1983 \u2013 particularly his casual contribution, one of the most recognizable bass lines of the 1980s. \u201cI was worried that it sounded a bit out of tune,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a decades-long career, Palladino has not only provided low-end support for several musical revolutions, he\u2019s helped stoke a few of them himself, undergirding pioneering sounds in pop, New Wave, neo-soul, electronic, rock, jazz, funk, and even industrial with an ever-inventive foundation. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most influential bass players ever, with just as much name recognition in certain quarters as the superstars he\u2019s backed.\n\nBeginning with Gary Numan in 1982 and continuing through work with artists like Young, Phil Collins, Tears for Fears, Go West, and Chris de Burgh, Palladino helped define the coolly emotive 80s sound with his trademark fretless technique. In the 1990s he backed Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, Joan Armatrading, B.B. King, and many more, before joining the legendary Soulquarians artists collective, reviving cosmic soul and funk sounds with Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Questlove, and J. Dilla.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom there, it was on to stints with Mika, Nine Inch Nails, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Paul Simon, and Keith Urban, among a wealth of others, as he also embarked on longtime touring associations with Jeff Beck and John Mayer. Palladino\u2019s most famous stretch came with The Who, when he stepped in after John Entwistle\u2019s untimely death in 2002 to tour and record for two decades, playing probably the most famous bass solo in pop \u2013 1965\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d \u2013 for arena-sized crowds. Most recently, he\u2019s played for Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend. You can\u2019t talk about Pino Palladino without mentioning a few names.\n\nNow, at last, Pino Palladino is releasing an album of his own, collaborating with guitarist Blake Mills. Called Notes with Attachments, the record summons intimate, cinematic moods, bristling with sophisticated patterns, atmospheric woodwinds, and surprising electronic touches. It\u2019s a compendium of several decades\u2019 worth of Palladino\u2019s compositional ideas, complex, and contemporary yet warm with nostalgia \u2013 paying homage to the classic film soundtracks, cool jazz, and Burt Bacharach arrangements he loves.\n\nIn honor of the new release, we accompanied the lauded bassist on a trip down memory lane, revisiting some of his best-known album and tour appearances.\n\nTear for Fears, Seeds of Love (1989)\n\nPino Palladino: I have a lot of great memories of that album, not least because my daughter Fabiana was born around the time we were recording it. My life was changing in a big way. I had been doing a lot of session work with the French drummer Manu Katch\u00e9, who toured with Peter Gabriel. We were becoming known as a rhythm section together, and a bit in demand. I believe that\u2019s how Roland Orzabal heard of us and invited us onto the album.\n\nThe actual recording was unusual for the time; the tracks were cut live with a full band. We holed up together for a few weeks in Townhouse Studios in London, and went through each of the songs, experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement. There were some days when we just jammed and extended parts of the songs. Roland then took the whole bundle and edited it down into what you hear on the album. We must have recorded \u201cBadman\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWoman in Chains\u201d a dozen different ways with different transitions. Roland\u2019s choices and his taste as the composer, defined the amazing end results.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOne of my fondest memories: When I first got there, I was going into the control room and I heard this incredible piano-playing in the studio. I was wondering, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I went round the corner and there was Oleta Adams, sitting at the grand piano and singing so beautifully, jamming away on gospel and blues. I\u2019m honored to have played on her solo album Circle of One.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love can be bought here.\n\nElton John, The One (1992)\n\nPino Palladino: We recorded in Paris at Studio Guillaume Tell. Well, the food in Paris was excellent. We would end every day going out to dinner at high-end restaurants with the table piled up with dishes. It was really something to keep up with\u2026but I rose to the challenge!\n\nWorking on that record and spending time with Elton was humbling. I remember one day, Bernie Taupin faxed some song lyrics over in the morning, and Elton took them into the next room and had an amazing song written within an hour\u2026incredible! At this time I was really known for my fretless bass sound, it was something people specifically hired me for. Elton encouraged me to develop my ideas for the basslines and let me do my thing on the record.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nErykah Badu, Mama\u2019s Gun (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: This was during the Soulquarians period, it was a real fun time. I made the connection because Ahmir [\u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson] had called me in to add to one of the songs he was working on. We thought I would just overdub the bass on one track, but it felt really good and we built up a vibe. Erykah had booked time at The Lady and we reconvened at a later date.\n\nErykah\u2019s way of working was refreshing. For Mama\u2019s Gun, Erykah had sketched out a couple ideas for the album, and had a vision of what she wanted, but otherwise it was pretty undetermined at that point. We all assembled, the whole band, and Erykah just came around, so cool in her way, and asked \u201cOK, Pino, what you got?\u201d That was it. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d We played around with some different ideas, and it turned into a collaboration, developing the songs together. I played a bassline I had in my mind for a while, and that became the first song on the album, \u201cPenitentiary Philosophy.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it reminded me of when I was getting started, working with Gary Numan on the I, Assassin album in 1983. Back then, I showed up and Gary had recorded his songs but didn\u2019t have bass parts on them. He wanted me to come up with ideas and gave me complete freedom to compose the parts for the songs. I played my fretless bass and that sound became the sonic signature for the record. What made it different with Erykah, is that this time I got a songwriting and production credit.\n\nListen to Mama\u2019s Gun here.\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Voodoo (2000)\n\nPino Palladino: Being a part of that moment when this album and Mama\u2019s Gun came out almost back to back was thrilling. After meeting D on a session with B.B. King, he invited me to meet him and his engineer, Russ Elevado, at Electric Lady Studios with a view to me playing some bass on the songs for his upcoming record, Voodoo.\n\nWhen they played some of the songs for me, I was mesmerized by the unique feel of the grooves and D\u2019s otherworldly vocal arrangements. D\u2019Angelo had written the songs for Voodoo at the keyboard and while his left hand would play what would become the blueprints for the basslines, his right hand plays the chords and flourishes that accompany the main melody. It all fits together in such a unique way\u2026 The basslines are woven into the fabric of the composition from the start.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAlthough some songs were established when I got there, others were left more open to develop ideas and for me, some freedom of expression, from adding in passing notes to flurries up to the top of the bass neck to complement his vocals. Because the album is so bass- and rhythm-driven, everything mattered, it was all at the top of the mix, he encouraged me to bring my thing to the music and, through him, I met Erykah, Quest, James Poyser, Roy Hargrove, J Dilla, Common, and all the Soulquarian collective.\n\nListen to Voodoo here.\n\nAdele, 21 (2011)\n\nPino Palladino: I was back in London when [producer] Rick Rubin reached out to me about recording a new album for Adele. She had already made a name for herself in the UK before she broke worldwide, so I had heard of her. Rick told me, \u201cI want to get you into this fantastic band, with drummer Chris Dave, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on guitars, James Poyser on piano, and really give her the strong backing she deserves.\u201d I flew out to Shangri-La studios in California where they were recording, and she just killed it on the vocals from the start. I remember hearing her voice for the first time through my headphones and being blown away by how she could sing. The songs were really great and I knew we were recording something special.\n\nMika, The Origin of Love (2012)\n\nPino Palladino: Mika has certainly got some incredible energy, he would bounce around the studio with all these ideas. Mika brought a lot of curiosity to the process, he would come up with things while I was playing. He was interested to hear fretless bass on some of the songs and liked how it fitted in. I believe I was hooked up with him through Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun. Working on a more electronic-oriented pop album was interesting. It\u2019s great to get the opportunity to expand what you do, and try out different directions.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nNine Inch Nails, Hesitation Marks (2013)\n\nPino Palladino: Trent [Reznor] reached out to me, out of the blue, and asked if I would be interested in collaborating on a couple of tracks for the album. I was really curious how I would fit in with his sound. Trent is a very good communicator, with clear ideas. He is a fan of Voodoo and of Gary Numan, so for me that was interesting as I could maybe bring two different sides of my playing to the music. I played a couple of takes on each song and just did my thing. Later, Trent\u2019s manager called and asked if I would be interested in touring. It turned out that the band had already been rehearsing for a month. It was a real challenge to learn the songs in a short amount of time before we went on the road. And I had no idea how his fans would react to me. But Trent gave me a lot of room, and that ended up being a memorable tour. The whole band was so tight, and the light show, along with the visual effects, was on another level from anything I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe Who, Endless Wire (2006) and touring after John Entwistle\u2019s death\n\nPino Palladino: In 2002, I was working on Common\u2019s Electric Circus album and I was about to fly home to London from Philadelphia, when my wife called me at the hotel and said, \u201cYou just got a call from the Who\u2019s management\u201d She gave me the tragic news that John Entwistle had just died, and they wanted to know if I could step in so they could continue the tour. There was going to be a concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few days later. After speaking to their management, I flew to LA later that day to rehearse for the gig and the following tour.\n\nI had spent some time with John. He was smart, funny, charismatic. He was a superstar. And, of course, an idol as far as bass-playing goes. I had worked with Pete [Townshend] as well, and Roger [Daltrey]. When I flew into LA, Pete was waiting for me at the hotel with a stack of CDs. \u201cJust learn what you can,\u201d he told me. Stylistically, I was not in that space at all at the time \u2013 I was doing hip-hop, funk, soul. So it was a complete reset for me. The first thing I did was change the strings on my bass to get a brighter sound, like John had. I pretty much didn\u2019t sleep that night, and learned as much as I could. I think I pulled it off, because they kept me on!\n\nI just worked on their recent record [2019\u2019s WHO]. Endless Wire was the first studio record they made after John\u2019s tragic death, and that was less of a \u201cband\u201d experience. Pete had done a number of demos, obviously some with John in mind to a certain degree. I\u2019d ask Pete if I was doing all right, and he would turn to me and say, \u201cPlay more.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just \u201cplay more.\u201d And I understood. Some people would think of it as overplaying, but the classic sound of The Who is Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass just making this unholy racket. So that\u2019s what I aimed for.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d (2020)\n\nPino Palladino: I was rehearsing with John Mayer at Henson Studios in Hollywood, which was the former A&M Studios, and before that the Charlie Chaplin Studios. Beautiful history there. Harry was recording in the same studios, down the hall. John knew him and introduced me to Harry. Harry and his producers played me a few songs to see which ones I felt I could add to, including \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d If you listen to the bass line in that song, it\u2019s very well-defined and echoed by the guitar line. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of room to move. Well, I started getting a little free with it, trying stuff, and Harry jumped up and said, \u201cThat! Can you do more of that?\u201d It\u2019s an honor that I get invited to play on these songs. It\u2019s going to be a hit with or without me. So I feel very fortunate to be asked to contribute.\n\nPino Palladino and Blake Mills, Notes With Attachments (2021)\n\nPino Palladino: This record is a culmination of what I\u2019ve been thinking about through much of my career. I\u2019ve been recording many of these ideas over a long period of time as I\u2019ve toured and collaborated with many musicians and artists that I admire. What interested me in making my own album was having the chance to focus on compositional elements, rather than the bass taking the lead. Maybe some listeners have been surprised that there are woodwinds and other instruments in the foreground. It\u2019s not me showing particular prowess on my instrument, but to define the role of the bass as a signature part of a song is the challenge I enjoy. I\u2019ve always loved instrumental music, from jazz to film soundtracks. I want my music to invoke some of those qualities.\n\nSome of the ideas on the album evolved from my time touring with D\u2019Angelo and the Soultronics, that kind of beat-driven music, but with beautiful elements and touches, but also from many other types of music that I love. When I played some of these ideas originally for Blake, he was very encouraging and, as we started working on the songs, it quite naturally became a collaboration. Blake, along with all the incredible musicians on the record, have all given so generously to the project, I\u2019m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this album. It\u2019s a very interesting process for me, having my own music released. It feels like part of my DNA is suddenly out there. The album was recorded two years ago. But people have told me that it speaks to the moment, that they\u2019re listening to it through this complex time and enjoying it.

But in an interview published today in The Guardian, he has spoken of the moment in 2002 when Pete Townshend called. John Entwistle had passed away: would Palladino fill in on the tour?\n\n\u201cI flew to LA, thinking, what are you doing? You don\u2019t even know many Who songs,\u201c said Palladino. Townshend was prepared, presenting him with a stack of CDs.\n\nThat\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2018\n\nAs a session player who had overcome imposter syndrome to sit in with the likes of David Gilmour and Elton John, there was no question Palladino would get The Who's set down pat. But only after some helpful advice from Townshend.\n\n\u201cAt the first rehearsal, Pete comes over and says: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to play louder\u2019 \u2013 because I\u2019m used to being the sympathetic musician, who fills in, doesn\u2019t make a racket,\u201c said Palladino. That\u2019s the one instruction you keep getting when you work with the Who: \u2018Fucking turn it up, we can\u2019t hear you!\u2019\u201d\n\nPalladino also speaks about his career through the 80s, when he was on speed dial for any pop star who needed some four-string flair in the low end. But in a career that saw him play on some of the top-selling albums of all time, Palladino considers his collaboration with neo soul pioneer D'Angelo, as bassist of the Soulquarians, the personal highlight.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Angelo \u2013 I\u2019d mention him in the same breath as Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway and Sly Stone,\u201c said Palladino. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, to be a Welsh guy, having no real connections to these guys other than music that we loved and played.\u201c\n\nPalladino has just released Notes With Attachments with the Californian guitarist and composer Blake Mills, available now through New Deal Records.

Palladino rose to public notice playing primarily rock and roll, blues rock, and rhythm and blues music, although he has been lauded for his ability to play most genres of popular music, including jazz, neo soul, and funk. Adding to his eclectic grasp and melodic approach on his instrument, he has become one of the most sought-after session players on the bass in the music industry. He has played on a large number of recordings by some of the world's most successful entertainers, in part, by mastering a variety of techniques on both his late 1970s fretless Music Man StingRay bass guitar and later in his career, adding fretted Fender Precision and Jaguar basses. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.\n\nPalladino has joined several bands and ensembles through which he is most visible. He joined jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove in forming The RH Factor, a band that mixes elements of soul, jazz, and R&B. He is a member of the John Mayer Trio, and was the first choice by Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey to fill the position left by John Entwistle as the current bassist for The Who.\n\nBiography\n\nPalladino began playing the electric guitar at age 14. By age 17 he decided to play the bass guitar, and bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B, funk, and reggae within a rock and roll backbeat. His first professional gig was at a local television station in Cardiff, where he began playing in 1978. That same year, at age 20, he joined Jools Holland's band and recorded with Holland on his album entitled, Jools Holland and His Millionaires. Palladino toured with Jools to support the album, which gave him the opportunity to purchase his own Music Man StingRay Fretless Bass. Holland was touring with another new band; the Q-Tips, whose frontman, Paul Young made acquaintance with Palladino whilst they were on tour, who would, a year later offer Pino a place in his own backing band.\n\nPino Palladino was featured on Gary Numan's 1982 album I, Assassin, in which his fretless bass sound made a prominent contribution to the overall sound of the album. He went on to play fretless bass with a healthy number of high-profile artists that include (on the short list), David Gilmour, Tears for Fears, Pete Townshend, Peter Gabriel, Joan Armatrading, Phil Collins, Chaka Khan and Don Henley.\n\nAfter vocalist Paul Young landed his own solo contract, Palladino was brought in as part of his backing band \"The Royal Family\" in 1983 with noticeable chart success with the No Parlez album, and major hit singles both in the UK and Europe. Examples of Young's new found success were the band's cover of the Marvin Gaye classic \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\", which reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart for three weeks in the summer of 1983, and \"Love of the Common People\". Palladino toured extensively at this time with Paul Young, remaining in the band for five years. 1983 additionally proved to be the year of another ensemble featuring Palladino, Paul Rodgers (formerly of Bad Company, drummer Kenney Jones, along with a rotating cast of other celebrity performers. The band only released one album through Atlantic; The Law, although there were enough out-takes that another bootleg-styled album followed in 1991. Sales were unremarkable, despite the names of those who recorded on the album.\n\nThroughout the 1980s Palladino was noted for his R&B roots on the fretless bass, even when supporting pop and rock heavy performers. One reviewer from Bass Player magazine points to Paul Young\u2019s cover of the Bobby Womack/Rufus tune \"Stop On By\" (on 1990\u2019s Other Voices), with its \"pre-hip-hop, swung funk groove\" as the precursor to Palladino's later neo-soul focus.\n\n1990s\n\nChanges in instrument\n\nIn the 1990s, Palladino began to alternate between the sounds achieved in playing the fretless bass to one with frets, as well as the 4-string and 6-string bass. At the time, he was well known within the industry for his fretless bass sound. However, now, depending on which artist he was supporting, and the song to be played, he began gravitating towards fretted bass. He was maturing as a musician, and played with artists as diverse as Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Sir Elton John and Eric Clapton. Also in 1991 he joined Paul Rodgers (of Free, Queen+ Paul Rodgers, and Bad Company fame) to form the band The Law. In the mid 1990's, Palladino played bass for The London Metropolitan orchestra during their recording of \"An American Symphony\", soundtrack for the movie Mr Hollands Opus.\n\nPalladino supported Phil Collins, as a member of the house band for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, which played with Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett, among other notable performers. He later wrote that he felt privileged to have been amongst the others on stage in such an event.\n\nIn 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft, of The Verve, during the recording sessions of Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody. Richard proved to be mightily impressed by Pino's natural bass playing ability;\n\nThis Pino Palladino, I can say a Meters record and he can play me the bass line. He can play anything. He's one of the only people in the world who can totally replicate that kind of Beach Boys/scratch/Walker Brothers bass. You can get that sound if you want it, dead on. So it was very liberating working with him.\n\nPino also joined Ashcroft's touring band for the singer's first major solo outing throughout 2000.\n\nNeo Soul\n\nBy the mid- 1990s, Palladino had established himself as a busy, highly desirable bassist and a studio worker in many genres, but finally became visible to those artists who played largely left of center, and demand for his session playing grew within a different quarter. Palladino began moving from blues-rock toward neo soul projects. Palladino and Steve Jordan found themselves performing on the same session for B.B. King\u2019s 1997 duets CD Deuces Wild. It was the first time soul singer D'Angelo first heard Palladino, who had just switched from a signature sound fretless bass sound to that of performing with fretted basses. The result was an invitation to \"use Pino\u2019s big, behind-the-beat bass to help cast a neo-soul spell on his Grammy Award-winning Voodoo album\". It would not be his first uncredited Grammy performance.\n\nAs the word spread throughout the genre, Palladino found an increasing demand within the neo-soul genre. Examples of his bass work in this genre (in addition to D'Angelo) includes Mama's Gun, and \"Penitentiary Philosophy\" found on Erykah Badu\u2019s 2000 CD. Other albums using Pino's sound include 1st Born Second for Bilal, Like Water for Chocolate and Electric Circus for Common. Palladino has been described by Steve Jordan, who got his own professional start playing the drums for Stevie Wonder as having a \"deep funk\" side and a \"melodic\" side. Palladino admits, that \"Of all my influences, I would say what\u2019s always in the back of my mind is early Stevie Wonder, like Talking Book and Innervisions; that music is really in my blood.\"\n\n2000s\n\nFollowing the death of The Who's bassist John Entwistle in 2002, the eve before the band were to kick off their first world tour in years, Palladino was their first choice to become the band's full-time touring bass guitarist, and by 2006, he was invited to join the remaining original band members in recording their first album in twenty-four years. Pete Townshend, the band's composer, recorded the bassline on the majority of the songs to get the effect he himself wanted, with Palladino doing so on the other six of them. Released in October 2006, the album was named Endless Wire.\n\nPalladino also recently played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show, in February, 2010, alongside other backing artists: Simon Townsend on guitar, Zak Starkey, drums and percussion, and John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, on keyboard instruments.\n\nPaul Simon\n\nIn 2003, Palladino intended to go down to see his old friend Paul Simon and meet Brian Eno for the first time. He was asked to record with them, and had to borrow a bass guitar to play. The result was that he played with Simon and Garfunkel on their \"Old Friends\" reunion tour and in an interview with Bass Player Magazine he mentions drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Jamey Haddad \"had laid down some great grooves for me to add bass\". He had kept the recordings, and by the time that he appeared on the Old Friends: Live on Stage CD and DVD from the tour, he was able to use some of the material. He played on Paul Simon's 2006 release, Surprise.\n\nOther appearances\n\nPalladino has toured in the backing band for Joe Walsh. In 2004 he appeared to be playing with Gary Moore at the Wembley Arena.\n\nEmergence of the John Mayer Trio\n\nPalladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session players on many occasions, which blossomed into a friendship. When their work brought them to the same place, they would meet, usually jam together, and introduce other musicians to one another, forming friendships which sometimes blossomed into good working relationships. Jordan has remained keen about Pino since he met him, and only grows more enthusiastic about his talents, which he describes partly as his love for, and ability to \"feel\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an amazing connection with genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he'd planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January, 2005 to perform a benefit concert on a NBC sponsored telethon Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope to raise funds and public awareness benefiting victims in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work, and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix classic, \"Bold as Love\", the three all agreed that they experienced such chemistry that they began talking right away about arranging their schedules to record a CD and a tour. The trio released the album Try!, on November 22, 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover songs, such as Jimi Hendrix's \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's release Heavier Things, as well as new songs written by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan wrote three songs on the album: \"Good Love Is On The Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\". Along with John Mayer on guitar and vocals, and Steve Jordan on drums, Palladino has toured and recorded as a member of the John Mayer Trio, and on Mayer's third album Continuum.\n\nRecent tours\n\nIn spring of 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck. He also played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido, alongside other notable musicians, including Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston. It was to be Preston's last work before he died only days afterward.\n\nInfluences on bass guitar\n\nInfluences for Palladino for bass guitar include Motown bassist James Jamerson; Stevie Wonder\u2019s keyboard-bass, jazz innovator Jaco Pastorius; British folk/rock upright bassist Danny Thompson; Norman Watt-Roy (of Ian Dury & the Blockheads); Larry Graham; Michael Henderson; Bootsy Collins; Paul Jackson; Anthony Jackson; Doug Rauch (of Carly Simon and Santana), and Billy Cobham.\n\nTechnique\n\nPino Palladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass in many 1980s chart records. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\" Palladino preferred a different sound (combining fretless tone with an octave effect) and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument as opposed to simply the aforementioned \"low notes\". Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's biggest chart hits, in particular his bass solo on \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\". His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nPino Palladino signature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modeled after two of Pino's Fender Precision Basses. The body featuring faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint is based on Pino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fret board are based on Pino's 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.\n\nRecent projects\n\nPalladino joined Eric Clapton's touring band for 11 dates in the Eastern U.S. and Canada in May 2008. Current work has included work on an with Clapton and Robbie Robertson, and Palladino guested on bass for Amos Lee on his third album, Last Days at the Lodge.\n\nIn 2009, Palladino joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips to form an instrumental trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, an instrumental jazz/funk rock ensemble, which have toured Europe through 2009 into 2010, playing songs that spotlight the talents of each performer, in the manner of many jazz outfits."}, {"url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/rh-factor/about/pac-20394960", "page_content": "Overview\n\nRh factor is an inherited protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood has the protein, you're Rh positive. If your blood doesn't have the protein, you're Rh negative. The \"+\" or \"\u2013\" you might see after your blood type refers to Rh positive or Rh negative.\n\nRh positive is much more common than Rh negative. Having an Rh negative blood type is not an illness, and it usually does not affect your health. But it can affect pregnancy. Your pregnancy needs special care if you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive. That's called Rh incompatibility. A baby can inherit the Rh factor from either parent.\n\nYour health care provider will advise that you have a blood type and Rh factor screening test during your first prenatal visit. This will show whether you are Rh positive or Rh negative.\n\nWhy it's done\n\nDuring pregnancy, problems can happen if you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive. Usually, your blood doesn't mix with your baby's blood during pregnancy. However, a small amount of your baby's blood could come in contact with your blood when the baby is born. It can also happen if you have bleeding or trauma to your abdomen during pregnancy.\n\nIf you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive, your body might produce proteins called Rh antibodies if your blood and the baby's blood mix. Those antibodies aren't a problem during the first pregnancy. But problems can happen if you become pregnant again.\n\nIf your next baby is Rh positive, the Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and damage the baby's red blood cells. This could lead to life-threatening anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the baby's body can replace them. Red blood cells are needed to carry oxygen throughout the body.\n\nIf you're Rh negative, you might need to have another blood test \u2014 called an antibody screen \u2014 several times: during your first trimester, during week 28 of pregnancy and when your baby is born. Some people need the test more often.\n\nThat test is used to detect antibodies to Rh positive blood. If you haven't started to produce Rh antibodies, you'll likely need a shot (injection) of a blood product called Rh immune globulin. This prevents your body from producing Rh antibodies during your pregnancy.\n\nIf your baby is born Rh negative, you don't need any other treatment. If your baby is born Rh positive, you'll need another injection shortly after delivery.\n\nIf you're Rh negative and your baby might be or is Rh positive, your health care provider may recommend an Rh immune globulin injection after situations in which your blood could come into contact with the baby's blood, including:\n\nMiscarriage\n\nEctopic pregnancy \u2014 when a fertilized eggs implants somewhere outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube\n\nAbortion\n\nRemoval of a molar pregnancy \u2014 a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops in the uterus\n\nAmniocentesis \u2014 a prenatal test in which a sample of the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby in the uterus (amniotic fluid) is removed for testing or treatment\n\nChorionic villus sampling \u2014 a prenatal test in which a sample of the wispy projections that make up most of the placenta (chorionic villi) is removed for testing\n\nCordocentesis \u2014 a prenatal test in which a sample of the baby's blood is removed from the umbilical cord for testing\n\nBleeding during pregnancy\n\nInjury or other trauma to your abdomen during pregnancy\n\nThe external manual rotation of a baby in a breech position \u2014 such as buttocks first \u2014 before labor\n\nDelivery\n\nIf the antibody screen shows that you're already producing antibodies, an injection of Rh immune globulin won't help. Your baby will be carefully monitored during your pregnancy. The baby might be given a blood transfusion through the umbilical cord during pregnancy or immediately after delivery if necessary.\n\nMother's Rh factor Father's Rh factor Baby's Rh factor Precautions Rh positive Rh positive Rh positive None Rh negative Rh negative Rh negative None Rh positive Rh negative Could be Rh positive or Rh negative None Rh negative Rh positive Could be Rh positive or Rh negative Rh immune globulin injections\n\nWhat you can expect\n\nAn Rh factor test is a basic blood test. The blood sample usually is taken during the first prenatal visit and sent to a lab for testing. No special preparation is necessary.\n\nResults\n\nIf you're Rh positive, you don't need to do anything.\n\nIf you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive, your body could make antibodies that might be harmful during another pregnancy.

Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix classic, \"Bold as Love\", the three found a chemistry together and set about their schedules to record a CD and a tour as a power trio.[13] They released the album Try!, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover songs, such as Jimi Hendrix's \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got A Woman\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's release Heavier Things, as well as new songs written by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs on the album: \"Good Love Is On The Way\", \"Vultures\", and \"Try!\".[2] Along with John Mayer on guitar and vocals, and Steve Jordan on drums, Palladino rounded out the outfit, touring and recording as the bass guitarist of the John Mayer Trio, and on Mayer's third album Continuum.\n\nInfluences on bass guitar\n\nInfluences for Palladino for bass guitar include The Shadows Jet Harris; Motown bassist James Jamerson; Stevie Wonder's keyboard-bass, jazz innovator Nathan Watts; British folk/rock upright bassist Danny Thompson; Norman Watt-Roy (of Ian Dury & the Blockheads); Larry Graham; Michael Henderson; Bootsy Collins; Jaco Pastorius; Paul Jackson; Anthony Jackson; Doug Rauch (of Carly Simon and Santana), and Billy Cobham.[13]\n\nTechnique\n\nPalladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass in many 1980s chart records. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \"playing the low notes\" Palladino preferred a different sound (combining fretless tone with an octaver effect) and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines and counter melodies in the higher range of the instrument as opposed to simply the aforementioned \"low notes\". Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's biggest chart hits, in particular his playing on Wherever I Lay My Hat. His equipment at that time included a fretless Music Man StingRay Bass 1979 and Boss Octave pedal (OC-2).\n\nPino Palladino signature model\n\nThe Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modelled after two of Palladino's Fender Precision Basses. The body featuring faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint is based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fret board are based on Pino's 1963 sunburst Precision Bass. He has also been known to prefer Thomastik-Infeld flat-wound bass strings.[15] Although as instruments change depending on the desired result (the Fender Japan Jaguar has featured on many stage and recordings since about 2006), strings brands and type ( round/flat/semi) may change too.\n\nAfter 2005\n\nIn spring of 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck. He also played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido, alongside other notable musicians, including Derek Trucks, and Billy Preston. It was to be Preston's last work before he died only days afterward. Palladino joined Eric Clapton's touring band for 11 dates in the Eastern US and Canada in May 2008.\n\nIn 2008 he recorded 3 tracks for London's The Herbaliser for their album \"Same As It Never Was\" released on k7! in 2009\n\nIn 2009, Palladino joined with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips to form an instrumental trio: Phillips Saisse Palladino, an instrumental progressive jazz/funk rock ensemble, which have toured Europe through 2009 into 2010, playing songs that spotlight the talents of each performer, in the manner of many jazz outfits. He has also worked on an album with Clapton and Robbie Robertson, and played on Amos Lee's third album, Last Days at the Lodge. He appears on Jeff Beck's 2010 album, Emotion & Commotion. As of August 2010, Palladino has been touring with Herbie Hancock.\n\nPalladino also appears on Manu Katch\u00e9's third jazz album, Third Round. Both had already played together several times, particularly on Paul Young's Other Voices, as Stephan Eicher's rhythm section in the first half of the 1990s, and on stage with Manu Katch\u00e9's jazz band The Tweeters. Currently in the studio recording with Steve Gadd; Edie Brickell; Andy Fairweather Low; who have formed a group the Gaddabouts.\n\nIn January 2011, he entered the studio with D'Angelo to finish recording the long overdue follow up to Voodoo.[16]\n\nIn January 2011, Palladino played on the second album of Adele: 21, while in May in the same year he played on the last EP of Revolver, Parallel Lives.\n\nIn January and February 2012, he joined D'Angelo's live band for a short European tour, alongside drummer Chris 'Daddy' Dave and guitarist Jesse Johnson. The tour included performances at London's Brixton Academy.\n\nIn late 2012, he toured with the Who on their Quadrophenia \"revival\" tour and in 2013 he played on several tracks from the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks as well as being a member of the Nine Inch Nails live touring band.\n\nDiscography (selected)"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/science/Rh-blood-group-system", "page_content": "Rh blood group system, system for classifying blood groups according to the presence or absence of the Rh antigen, often called the Rh factor, on the cell membranes of the red blood cells (erythrocytes). The designation Rh is derived from the use of the blood of rhesus monkeys in the basic test for determining the presence of the Rh antigen in human blood. The Rh blood group system was discovered in 1940 by Karl Landsteiner and A.S. Weiner. Since that time a number of distinct Rh antigens have been identified, but the first and most common one, called RhD, causes the most severe immune reaction and is the primary determinant of the Rh trait.\n\nThe Rh antigen poses a danger for the Rh-negative person, who lacks the antigen, if Rh-positive blood is given in transfusion. Adverse effects may not occur the first time Rh-incompatible blood is given, but the immune system responds to the foreign Rh antigen by producing anti-Rh antibodies. If Rh-positive blood is given again after the antibodies form, they will attack the foreign red blood cells, causing them to clump together, or agglutinate. The resulting hemolysis, or destruction of the red blood cells, causes serious illness and sometimes death.\n\nA similar hazard exists during pregnancy for the Rh-positive offspring of Rh-incompatible parents, when the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive. The first child of such parents is usually in no danger unless the mother has acquired anti-Rh antibodies by virtue of incompatible blood transfusion. During labour, however, a small amount of the fetus\u2019s blood may enter the mother\u2019s bloodstream. The mother will then produce anti-Rh antibodies, which will attack any Rh-incompatible fetus in subsequent pregnancies. This process produces erythroblastosis fetalis, or hemolytic disease of the newborn, which can be fatal to the fetus or to the infant shortly after birth. Treatment of erythroblastosis fetalis usually entails one or more exchange transfusions. The disease can be avoided by vaccinating the mother with Rh immunoglobulin after delivery of her firstborn if there is Rh-incompatibility. The Rh vaccine destroys any fetal blood cells before the mother\u2019s immune system can develop antibodies.\n\nUnderstand the Rh factor and why pregnant women should be routinely tested for the Rh factor See all videos for this article\n\nAlthough the Rh-negative trait is rare in most parts of the world, it occurs in about 15 percent of Caucasians in Europe, Canada, and the United States. The trait\u2019s highest incidence is among the Basques of the Pyrenees (25\u201335 percent) and the Imazighen (Berbers) of Africa and the Bedouins of the Sinai Peninsula (18\u201330 percent)."}]}
