The amiable, chatty Collis has more in mind: reinventing the way independent film is made and financed.\n\nRELATED:Arizona-based 'Car Dogs' familiar but fun\n\nCollis, a film professor at Arizona State University, made the movie with 85 ASU interns, as part of the school\u2019s Film Spark program. The film premiered in Scottsdale on Monday, March 20. If it does well in Phoenix, the hope is that other markets will pick up the film.\n\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\n\n\u201cThe really important idea for me is that the people of Phoenix have the chance to enjoy a super entertaining film that has Phoenix all over it \u2026 and in addition to going and watching an entertaining movie that has so much Phoenix in it, there\u2019s also this opportunity to launch a national release that didn\u2019t get launched out of LA or New York,\u201d Collis said. \u201cWe can do it right here. To me that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nAnd more than that.\n\n\u201cThat is a transformative idea for independent cinema,\u201d Collis said, \u201cif we launch this movie out of Phoenix and all of a sudden Detroit says, what the heck is happening over there in Phoenix, we want to put the movie on our circuit, and all of a sudden a theater chain in Wisconsin says, what\u2019s that \u201cCar Dogs\u201d thing, I want that over here \u2013 and it starts here, at ASU and Phoenix? That changes the game for independent cinema, because that can create a model that we here in Phoenix will be the first mover on, and be able to replicate, but then other markets and other universities could do the same.\u201d\n\nThe film, whose cast includes George Lopez, Nia Vardalos, Octavia Spencer and several other actors whose faces you would recognize, if not their names, is set in a Scottsdale dealership owned by a jerk, played by Chris Mulkey, who will only offer his son (Patrick J. Adams) his own dealership if he and his team can sell 300 cars. In a lengthy interview recently, Collis talked about how the film, written by Mark Edward King, of Scottsdale, came about, and how high his hopes are for it.\n\nQuestion: What made you want to make the film?\n\nAnswer: First and foremost, it\u2019s always great to have a fun movie about a team of car salesmen trying to accomplish this impossible task of trying to sell more cars than have ever been sold in a single day. I go to the movies to be entertained, so to have the opportunity to do a movie that sat at the nexus between \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d and \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven,\u201d that sounded like a lot of fun.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole variety of other reasons, not the least of which was the opportunity to explore the moral question of what are you willing to do? Are you willing to do whatever it takes to get what you want in business and in life? And what does that really mean? That\u2019s a big part of what motivated me to do the film.\n\nQ: It\u2019s certainly a relatable experience for most people.\n\nA: One of the most-compelling reasons was because I knew it was a movie everyone can relate to, because nearly everyone has bought a car. It\u2019s an emotional touch point for nearly every American. It\u2019s baseball, hot dogs and buying cars. That what it means to be an American, and the relatability of this car-buying experience was one of the things that really drew me to the material. But I don\u2019t want to be too highfalutin ... I do think that there is a compelling metaphor that the movie makes about the free-market society in which we live and the moral obligation that each of us has to do the right thing in order to have the freedom to preserve that free-market opportunity.\n\nQ: And you had ASU students helping on the set.\n\nA: We didn\u2019t just make a movie and give 85 students the chance to learn feature filmmaking from an Oscar-winning cast and crew. We built an entire supply chain. We built out soup-to-nuts a way to finance movies; the balances, risk and reward; a way to make a movie, where we have a teaching hospital for aspiring filmmakers; but the most important one is we built out an entire launch pad, which is effectively its release mechanism, where we\u2019re partnering with ASU and Harkins \u2026 to launch a movie that, if it gets into orbit, we have the opportunity to expand the release.\n\nQ: Do you have a memorable car-buying experience?\n\nA: The first time I ever bought a car, I actually brought \u2026 my best friend from film school with me. He grew up on a car lot. I said I\u2019ve never done this. I\u2019d just done \u201cSunset Strip\u201d (the first film Collis directed, released on 2000) and made a whole bunch of money and I need to get a vehicle, can you walk me through this? And sure enough, he was guiding me through every step, down to where the car salesman said, \u201cExcuse me, I need to go talk to my manager.\u201d He went to go talk to his manager and (his friend) turned to me and said, \u201cWhat are you willing to pay for this Subaru Outback?\u201d I said this much money. He said write that amount on a check, and when he comes back he\u2019s going to give you a number that\u2019s higher than that, almost certainly and you just need to slide the check across the table and say, \u201cThis is what I am prepared to pay for the car today.\u201d And it literally happened exactly like that. I slid the check across the table and (his friend) knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist having the check right there, and sure enough, they took it. And so that was a time that I actually had some guidance. But I think one of fun parts of the movie is making this fun for people who actually buy cars.\n\nQ: Yeah, as fun as that could ever be.\n\nA: What\u2019s been awesome, whether it was at the Phoenix Film Festival or other places we\u2019ve screened the film, is the universal response that I get when I see people walking out of the film and they know that I\u2019m the director and they kind of walk up to me with a big smile on their face and say, oh my God, that\u2019s exactly what happened to me! Or they walk up to me with that big grin on their face because they\u2019ve enjoyed the film and they say, oh my God, I\u2019m so glad I watched your film, I\u2019m about to buy a new car.\n\nQ: Did working with students ever slow down production?\n\nA: There\u2019s no question that it made the production longer. I think that Car Dogs LLC and our amazing investors were inspired by the opportunity to give students the chance to learn filmmaking from an Oscar-winning cast and crew, and they were incredibly generous in allowing us to make the film in Arizona, as opposed to making it in a state with a tax incentive. But the opportunity to give students this incredible experiential learning opportunity \u2026 was inspiring to people, and ASU really owes a debt of gratitude to our \u201cCar Dogs\u201d investors.\n\nYou know, there were some things that came up, just even like loss and damage, students dropping equipment, slowing down production, that we knew could be part of that equation.\n\nQ: They are students, but they\u2019re also part of a real production.\n\nA: By being able to learn in an academic environment, and also to be able to make mistakes without it costing you your job, that\u2019s huge. That\u2019s something I would tell students all the time. They\u2019d make a big gaffe, and it might even cost the production a little something, and I would look at them and I would say, \u201cWhat I\u2019m really happy about right now is that you got to learn from that mistake without having to lose your job. But I want you to know that in the real world that mistake might have cost you your job. And that\u2019s OK in this environment. And if you learn from it and it makes you a better professional when you get out in the real world, then this was all worth it.\u201d\n\nQ: Did it put extra pressure on you, as both director and professor?\n\nA: Day two, for whatever reason my amazing assistant director, Sean Hobin, for reasons that are still a little confusing to me, scheduled our most-complex day, and we had like 40 set-ups, it was the second day, the students were still working it out, and that was a moment where I was like, \u201cOh my God, with all these students are we going to get through this?\u201d But we got through that day and we made our day, and at the end of the production we got everything we wanted shot, and we made our budget, even with the students.\n\nQ: That\u2019s impressive. And the crew must have had to work a little differently, too, at least at first.\n\nA: Our cinematographer on day one asked one of the students to go get a sandbag about 50 yards away. And on a film set you never run, it\u2019s dangerous to run on a film set, but you have to walk with purpose. There is a briskness and speed at which you walk on a set. And so the student took the direction of the cinematographer, David Stump, and went sort of sidling off to get the sandbag as if they might be walking to go get a hoagie. And David just cupped his hands around his mouth and said, \u201cWALK WITH PURPOSE!\u201d\n\nThe students might cost you a little time, but at least they\u2019re excited to be there. They\u2019re really fired up, and they really want to be there. I think that while, sure, you had some on-the-job training that was going on, you had a bunch of students that were pumped.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

The film, which was shot in Scottsdale and features fierce competition between car salesmen, opens up a unique opportunity for the movie business in The Grand Canyon State.\n\nOur conversation has been edited for length:\n\nRyan Bordow: It\u2019s so surreal to see a film set in a familiar area of Phoenix. Is the screenwriter of \u201cCar Dogs\u201d from Arizona as well? Why did this story need to be told here?\n\nAdam Collis: This is a movie that is handcrafted for Phoenix, Arizona. And the culmination of this story is that the people of Phoenix get to decide whether this is a movie that gets to have a national release. Here you have this script set in Scottsdale, written by a Scottsdale native, shot in Scottsdale, made with 85 ASU student interns \u2014 a film that\u2019s going to be exhibited in Phoenix\u2019s own Harkins Theaters across the valley. What we\u2019ve done that\u2019s really special is designed our release with Phoenix as the launch pad. We\u2019re all going to gather around opening weekend to see if this rocket that we\u2019ve built is going to actually take flight so that people across the country will see it. If, of course, the good people of Phoenix come out and watch this really entertaining movie that was basically made for them! We shot right under the Papago Buttes! This has got Arizona in it through and through.\n\nRB: I remember the notice that \u201cCar Dogs\u201d was looking for interns going out when I was a freshman film student at ASU four years ago. What was it like to see these students grow on set?\n\nAC: Gosh, they were like the Three Stooges at the beginning: just bumping into each other, hardly knowing what to do. By the end of it, you wouldn\u2019t know that these student interns were student interns! I\u2019ve had so much feedback from the cast and crew, from people that visited set \u2014 they really got to learn how to be a professional on a film set from these working Hollywood professionals.\n\nRB: That\u2019s awesome.\n\nAC: And now they\u2019ve taken that into their own professional lives. Not just what they learned, but they also have their first feature film credit: that\u2019s always the hardest one to get because breaking in is the hardest thing to do. And in addition to that, because they got to work with this Oscar-winning cast and crew, they\u2019ve got somebody to call when they go to Hollywood \u2014 or, if Hollywood filmmakers come to Phoenix! It\u2019s a launch pad for those careers, and we\u2019ve got to launch this movie out of Phoenix, man. That\u2019s the big story here. What\u2019s really at stake here is that Phoenix has the chance to not launch the national release of a major motion picture. If it does well in Phoenix, man: [explosion noise].\n\nRB: It expands to other theaters.\n\nAC: And that\u2019s why as part of ASU \u2014 the most innovative school in the nation, above MIT and Stanford \u2014 this is as good of an example of ASU innovation as you will get. This is no different in the creative arts than the innovation that the School of Earth and Space Exploration is doing to launch satellites around the moon! They\u2019re launching a satellite around the moon; we\u2019re launching a rocket for independent film so that everyone in this nation can see that rocket up in the sky. That requires everybody supporting the effort: the good news is they\u2019re not doing charity work; they get to come watch a really fun movie about their hometown!\n\nRB: Yeah. So, since you\u2019re helping ASU students pursue the film world: why do you think it\u2019s important that Arizonans pursue artistic endeavors?\n\nAC: You know, some things you just do because they\u2019re right. It kills me that Arizona is not Hollywood\u2019s backlot.\n\nRB: Me too!\n\nAC: That\u2019s what I always say: Arizona should be Hollywood\u2019s backlot. And you can attribute that quote to me!\n\nRB: [Laughs]\n\nAC: We\u2019re an hour Southwest flight away from Hollywood! Hollywood\u2019s money is Arizona\u2019s to lose! You think a producer would rather go all the way to Atlanta and be half a country away from their family and friends in Los Angeles? No, man! If they were shooting their TV or film project in Arizona, they could skip back that night to tuck their kids into bed. This is too good of an opportunity for the Arizona economy, and for filmmakers because there\u2019s so much creative opportunity in this state.\n\nRB: Makes sense to me. One of the actresses in \u201cCar Dogs\u201d is Octavia Spencer, who was just nominated for her second Oscar. What was it like for the interns to work with such a successful actress?\n\nAC: The scene that she\u2019s in is the pivotal scene of the movie. It\u2019s worth going to see this movie just to watch that scene alone. She was grace personified. She was incredibly generous to our students with her time and spirit; she was wildly enthusiastic about what we were doing with the students. She gave our film a gravitas that I will forever be grateful to her for. You can just point the camera at Octavia Spencer and she could read the alphabet, and you could not take your eyes off of her!\n\nRB: [Laughs] Lastly: March 24th is the release date of \u201cCar Dogs\u201d. Is there anything else in the future that Arizonans should be on the lookout for?\n\nAC: If the good people of Phoenix can light a rocket on March 24th, you\u2019re going to see all kinds of movies being made in Arizona."}, {"url": "https://cocofinder.com/name/adam-collis", "page_content": "Disclaimer: CocoFinder's mission is to give people easy and affordable access to public record information, but CocoFinder does not provide private investigator services or consumer reports, and is not a consumer reporting agency per the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

My father was a Realtor in Calgary for almost 10 years before moving to Vancouver where he is currently a licensed agent. After only 6 months in the Real Estate industry, my mom had to quit her day job to become my dad\u2019s full time Assistant. I consider myself a Calgarian having lived here since 1989. Before moving to Calgary, we immigrated to Brandon Manitoba.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but my training actually started in high school. Over dinner my parents would discuss real estate stories and news excessively. My dad had the most amazing stories, some I still tell my clients today. My meticulous father is one of the most competent, dutiful and loyal Agents I\u2019ve ever worked with. He truly put his clients first in business. I\u2019m proud to have him as my first mentor stepping into this industry.\n\nAlthough I officially launched my Real Estate career in 2005, I would say the seed of my passion for Real Estate was planted when I purchased my home in 2001. I was 21. Like most buyers, I made extensive sacrifices to buy my first home, including selling my first beloved motorcycle, and working 3 jobs simultaneously for a full year to save up. I couldn\u2019t sleep the night before my possession. I was giddy and excited, overdosed on Better Homes & Garden magazines (Pinterest did not exist in 2001). When my Agent/dad handed me the keys to my first house, the exhilaration I felt is a high a chase through my clients until this very day. When I hand my clients their keys for the first time, I feel the same giddiness and excitement for them. Every hurdle my clients have crossed to buy a home, all the hours spent scrutinizing properties with me by their side, all their dreams come into fruition in this very moment. Whether is a purchase or sale, it\u2019s a big deal. I take my job with all of it\u2019s giddiness seriously.\n\nPrior to obtaining my license to be Realtor, I was a bilingual assistant (ESL), server & bartender, entrepreneur with phone books (if you meet me, ask me about this hilarious 3 year period of my life), and a 3rd year university drop out \u2013 computer science major. I finally had to accept that hours in a lab working on assignments and programming was not me. I craved interaction and found I enjoyed my shifts at Red Lobster more than heading to lectures at the University. Oh and in 2012 I took most of that year off of full time Real Estate. I went back to College. This time Fairview College for my motorcycle mechanics certificate. After I finished, I was employed to work on motorcycles as a junior mechanic 4 days a week while working part time as a Real Estate Agent around those hours. I learned a lot from that experience but mostly my appreciation for my Real Estate career was solidified by the end of 2012.\n\nAt the end of 2012 I joined a mega team. Although I benefited from the success of consistently being one of the top producers on that team, and achieving multiple awards, I was missing something. Remember, I value interaction. Being that busy and closing that many deals in a year, the quality of relationship I had with my clients was not to my satisfaction. There\u2019s a difference between service and relationship. You can have the best of both with the right Agent.\n\nAs of January 1st 2017, I\u2019m a proud Realtor and Managing Partner of The Good Agent Inc. We are well aware of all the reasons people shy aware from Realtors \u2013 we are here to change that!\n\nIn June of 2017, from the help of my wonderful new found work/life balance I was able to achieve, I got married and started a family all at once. I now have one more skill to add to my list of Real Estate Agent skills \u2013 being able to see a home through practical mom eyes. Life is good!"}]}
