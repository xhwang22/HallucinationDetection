Whenever Beaver's mom, June (the late Barbara Billingsley), went to her husband, Ward (played by the late Hugh Beaumont), with concerns about their son, viewers knew they were in for some sort of \"golly, gee\" predicament poor Beaver had inevitably gotten himself into \u2014 and that dear old Dad would have to fix.\n\nWe can look back on \"Leave It to Beaver\" as a quintessential image of mid-20th-century aesthetics \u2014 the good, which changed television forever, and the cringe, which wasn't OK then and isn't now. On the one hand, the show's sitcom format was foundational for the genre in a way countless other shows have emulated since. On the other hand, its rosy-tinted, picture-perfect suburban America was a filtered view, one in which its citizens were overwhelmingly white and gender roles were unwaveringly rigid.\n\nWith \"Leave It to Beaver\" airing in the infancy of television itself, many decades have passed and much of its adult cast has unfortunately passed away.
