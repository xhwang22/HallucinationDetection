Epstein is the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law at New York University Law School, and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago. He has taught a vast wealth of subjects ranging from property rights to Roman legal systems, and is particularly known for his ability to incorporate both law and economics into his analysis. Some might even say that he is not a legal scholar, but an economist with a Yale law degree.\n\nOne of his most famous books, Takings, outlined a radical departure from the current Progressive status quo regarding property rights, towards a more traditional and coherent view of private property. The book argued that much of the policies of President Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal were unconstitutional and was famously waved around by then-Senator Joe Biden, during Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearing. Senator Biden, in an attempt to paint Justice Thomas as extremely ideological to the point of being unqualified, declared that if he subscribed to the ideas in that book, he was not qualified to be on the Court. Thankfully, in recent years there has been movement towards Epstein\u2019s side and not Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe topic of this podcast, however, was not Takings, but another one of his radical and important works, Simple Rules for a Complex World. A written summary can be found here. Although the title may suggest that the book is about self-help or life advice, it is actually a completely novel but highly reasonable prescription for an alternative form of governance. At least compared to the modern American state. What Epstein argues for in this book is a return to a classical liberal model of governance, where the government simply sets simple ground rules and allows a natural order to arise from that foundation. Today the government has entangled itself into countless areas of private life, spewing regulation and red tape as far as the eye can see. This has come at a drastic cost, not just to our checkbooks, but to our innovative spirit. Such a system is also contrary to the basic tenets of sound economics and a recipe for further decay.\n\nAlthough some would say that the government needs this complicated regulatory system because the world has become very sophisticated, Epstein\u2019s book posits the exact opposite. The larger and more complicated systems become, the more simple the rules must be. That is because private discretion and decision-making, such as in the construction of an international credit system or the operation of a trillion-dollar corporation, is far preferable to government control. The world has become sophisticated and prosperous, not because of the omnipresent hand of government but because of the institutions of a free and open society. It simply does not follow that killing the goose that laid the golden egg by subsequently regulating the fruits of a free society into oblivion is an optimal strategy for governance.\n\nEpstein\u2019s radical, yet commonsense departure from the status quo of having a law for every conceivable problem in society is a masterful fusion of law and economics. He is able to skillfully leverage legal theory and cite precedent, while also weaving in important economic concepts such as Coasian bargaining and incentive structures, which form the foundation for many of his views.\n\nDuring the interview, Epstein first opens with an explanation about why law and economics is a recent innovation in the academy, not a longstanding practice. Much of that stems from the historical aversion of legal scholars to the ideas of economics, which has subsequently led to many of the economically illiterate laws we have today. He then moves to further elaborate on his views regarding the use of simple rules, rather than complex regulation, to solve issues such as environmental protection. Rather than the use of public management, he cites evidence and theory to suggest that a greater emphasis on private property rights and market interactions would be far superior. Another important topic he touches on is the need to reduce administrative costs, which stem not only from the physical upkeep of the state but also from interacting with regulation whether that be compliance fees or efficiency losses. On that note, Epstein proceeds to give his opinions on whether or not the modern administrative state is even congruent with the rule of law. Finally, he leaves us with some key takeaways on the value and challenges of implementing the ideas in his book.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRichard Epstein will easily go down as one of the great legal minds in the classical liberal canon, if not the broader academy in general. His book, Simple Rules for a Complex World, is simply a must read for those interested in imagining a far better regulatory order than the one that exists today. Cutting past the dense legal and economic theory, one can find a clear prescription for an embrace of the seemingly forgotten principles that made the world prosperous in the first place. That is confidence and respect for the power of free and voluntary interacting individuals, rather than the dictate of the mob or the leviathan."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/richard_allen_epstein", "page_content": "\u201cNegro history must be studied, not only because it is the history of over 19 millions, but American life as a whole cannot be understood without knowing it.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dorothy Allen Conley (b. 1904)\n\n\u201cOf all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.\u201d\n\n\u2014Julius J.

Tisch Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law. He is also an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute, the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law Emeritus and a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, and a policy advisor for The Heartland Institute. Epstein became a permanent faculty member at NYU School of Law in 2010. Epstein was chosen in a poll as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times.\n\nViews\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1997), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work, arguing that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable however, according to Epstein, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if repealed. Consistent with libertarian principles, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, DOMA, should be repealed, stating:\n\nUnder our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.\n\nHowever, in the two cases under discussion (Gill and Massachusetts, both of which had been heard by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro), Epstein observed that:\n\nTo strike down DOMA, Judge Tauro had to reject all state justifications for its definition of marriage. Congress advanced four such justifications for this statute: \"(1) encouraging responsible procreation and child-bearing, (2) defending and nurturing the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage, (3) defending traditional notions of morality, and (4) preserving scarce resources.\" The Justice Department disavowed them all. So much for tradition. Its sole defense of DOMA was that it was needed to preserve the status quo until matters were sorted out politically. Given that open invitation Judge Tauro concluded that all of the justifications offered in DOMA flunked even the lowest \"conceivable\" standard of rationality. Religious people will surely take umbrage at his one-sentence rebuttals of centuries of tradition.\n\nEpstein\u2019s criticism of these two decisions concluded:\n\nNow there is no reason for principle to yield to pragmatism. We don\u2019t need a judicial precedent that will spark a nation-wide rerun of California\u2019s Proposition 8. We need courts to back off to democratic processes, imperfect as they are.\n\nEpstein views market incentives against discrimination as sufficient to regulate the acknowledged evil, and attempting to give everyone a court hearing only encourages excessive litigation.Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995) 171-176\n\nIn Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (1985) Epstein argues the government should be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. Though then U.S. Senator Joseph Biden denounced the book during the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, the book served as a focal point in the argument about the government\u2019s ability to control private property. The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights and has been cited by the United States Supreme Court in four cases, including Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council from 1992. Epstein\u2019s defense of tobacco companies during the 1990s was controversial. Epstein serves on the advisory board of the New York University Journal of Law and Liberty, and introduces the keynote speaker every year at the sponsored Annual Friedrich A. von Hayek Lecture."}, {"url": "https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/05/who-are-the-newly-revealed-jeffrey-epstein-associates.html", "page_content": "Photo: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nRecent reports from The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have revealed a number of additional prominent people who were associates of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s. Their ties to the notorious sex trafficker and longtime high-society hobnobber were not previously known, having not appeared in Epstein\u2019s infamous black book or in the public flight logs of passengers who traveled aboard his private jet before his jailhouse death in 2019 while awaiting trial.\n\nThe new reports also deepen public understanding of the ties between Epstein and some boldfaced names who he had previously been associated with. And they underscored just how frequently Epstein met with his high-flying pals. The Journal delved into his packed itinerary for just one day \u2014 September 8, 2014 \u2014 and found that he planned to meet with four extremely wealthy men: Bill Gates, Leon Black, Thomas Pritzker, and Mortimer Zuckerman.\n\nThe Journal discovered the names after it obtained a previously unreported trove of documents, including thousands of emails and Epstein\u2019s private schedules dating from 2013 to 2017. (The New York Times says it obtained Epstein\u2019s scheduling documents through a public records request to the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general.) The documents all pertain to the time period after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution in Florida, and at least some of the period was after Epstein was publicly accused of sex trafficking by victim Virginia Giuffre in 2015.\n\nThe schedules include details of numerous meetings Epstein planned and with whom \u2014 but the Journal notes that it could not verify whether all of the meetings actually took place. Many of the meetings took place at Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse, one of the locations where he is alleged to have sexually abused women and girls.\n\nIn 2019, New York published an exhaustive list of all of Epstein\u2019s alleged high-society contacts, according to public documents available at the time. Below, a look at the new names contained in the Journal\u2019s reporting and what we know about how and why they were linked to him.\n\nEhud Barak, former Israeli prime minister\n\nAccording to the documents, the longtime Israeli politician was a regular guest of Epstein\u2019s at his Upper East Side townhouse in the years from 2013 to 2017, meeting with the financier monthly for large stretches of that time. He also flew on Epstein\u2019s jet. Reached by the Journal, Barak acknowledged that he met with Epstein when visiting New York City and that Epstein \u201coften brought other interesting persons, from art or culture, law or science, finance, diplomacy or philanthropy.\u201d He said he never met Epstein \u201cwith girls or minors, or even adult women in improper context or behavior,\u201d\n\nBill Gates\n\nThe connection between Epstein and Gates has been well known for years, but in late May, the Journal published a revelatory new story on their relationship. The paper reported that Gates had an affair with a bridge player named Mila Antonova in the early 2010s and that Epstein attempted to leverage his knowledge of the situation against the Microsoft co-founder.\n\nBy Antonova\u2019s account, Gates, an avid bridge player, had met her at a tournament in 2010 while Gates was still married to his ex-wife, Melinda. Antonova later sought money to fund a start-up that would help people learn the game online. Boris Nikolic, a friend and then\u2013scientific adviser to Gates, introduced Antonova to Epstein in 2013. Epstein didn\u2019t agree to fund the venture but did pay for Antonova to go to software-coding school.\n\nThen, in 2017, well after the Gates-Antonova relationship had ended, Epstein reportedly emailed Gates requesting that he reimburse him for the cost of the schooling. That message came shortly after Gates rebuffed Epstein\u2019s efforts to get a major charitable fund with JPMorgan Chase off the ground. From the Journal:\n\nThe implication behind the message, according to people who have viewed it, was that Epstein could reveal the affair if Gates didn\u2019t keep up an association between the two men.\n\nBut Gates reportedly never paid Epstein.\n\n\u201cI had no idea that he was a criminal or had any ulterior motive,\u201d Antonova told the Journal of Epstein. \u201cI just thought he was a successful businessman and wanted to help.\u201d She said, \u201cI am disgusted with Epstein and what he did.\u201d And Nikolic said, \u201cI deeply regret that I ever met Epstein. His crimes were despicable. I never saw anything like his illegal behavior. My heart goes out to his victims and their families.\u201d\n\nLeon Botstein, president of Bard College\n\nEpstein had roughly two dozen meetings scheduled with Botstein over the four years covered in the documents, mostly at his townhouse. Regarding his relationship with Epstein, Botstein told the Journal he was only interested in Epstein\u2019s money: \u201cI was an unsuccessful fundraiser and actually the object of a little bit of sadism on his part in dangling philanthropic support.\u201d\n\nBotstein said he first met with Epstein in 2012 to thank him for making unsolicited donations to the college\u2019s high schools, then he continued meeting with him to try to secure more. Epstein donated 66 laptops to Bard in 2015, according to the documents, and Botstein twice invited Epstein to musical performances at the college, but the longtime Bard president said he ultimately concluded that Epstein wasn\u2019t interested in making more donations and \u201che was simply stringing us along.\u201d\n\nA follow-up report from the Journal found that Botstein accepted$150,000 in checks from an account linked to Epstein in 2016. Botstein claims that money was then donated to Bard, which was confirmed by the school. A spokesperson for Botstein added that the money was for his year-long role on an advisory board for Gratitude America, Epstein\u2019s charity.\n\nThat Epstein was a convicted sex offender who had admitted to procuring a child for prostitution didn\u2019t dissuade Botstein and Bard from seeking his financial support. \u201cWe looked him up, and he was a convicted felon for a sex crime,\u201d Botstein told the Journal, but \u201cwe believe in rehabilitation.\u201d He said they kept his criminal history in mind when Epstein visited the school: \u201cBecause of his previous record, we had security ready. He did not have any free access to anybody.\u201d According to the plans in the documents, Epstein brought some of his young female assistants on his trips to Bard.\n\nWilliam Burns, CIA director\n\nThe documents indicate that Epstein had three scheduled meetings in 2014 with Burns, who was at that point the deputy security of state in the Obama administration. They met both in Washington, D.C., and New York, per the Journal:\n\nA lunch was planned that August at the office of law firm Steptoe & Johnson in Washington. Epstein scheduled two evening appointments that September with Mr. Burns at his townhouse, the documents show. After one of the scheduled meetings, Epstein planned for his driver to take Mr. Burns to the airport.\n\nThe longtime diplomat left the State Department in October of that year and became president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he remained until President Biden nominated Burns to run the CIA in 2021.\n\nCIA spokesperson Tammy Kupperman Thorp released a statement to the Journal denying Burns had any kind of relationship with Epstein: \u201cThe director did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector and offered general advice on transition to the private sector,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had no relationship.\u201d\n\nNoam Chomsky\n\nAccording to the documents, Epstein arranged several meetings with Chomsky in 2015 and 2016, when he was teaching at MIT, where Epstein had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars. The scheduled meetings included a gatherings of academics as well as a flight with Epstein aboard his private jet to New York to have a dinner at his townhouse with film director Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn.\n\nWhen the Journal asked Chomsky about the meetings, the 94-year-old replied in an email that his \u201cfirst response is that it is none of your business. Or anyone\u2019s. Second is that I knew him and we met occasionally.\u201d Chomsky said he and Epstein discussed politics and academics, and \u201cif there was a flight, which I doubt, it would have been from Boston to New York, 30 minutes. I\u2019m unaware of the principle that requires that I inform you about an evening spent with a great artist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was known about Jeffrey Epstein was that he had been convicted of a crime and had served his sentence,\u201d Chomsky told the Journal. \u201cAccording to U.S. laws and norms, that yields a clean slate.\u201d He also said Epstein arranged for him to meet Barak so they could talk about \u201cIsrael\u2019s policies with regard to Palestinian issues and the international arena.\u201d\n\nA follow-up report from the Journal showed that Chomsky received a transfer of around $270,000 from an account linked to Epstein in March 2018. \u201cMy late wife died 15 years ago after a long illness. We paid no attention to financial issues,\u201d Chomsky explained by email. \u201cWe asked Epstein for advice. The simplest way seemed to be to transfer funds from one account in my name to another, by way of his office.\u201d\n\nTerje R\u00f8d-Larsen, noted ex-diplomat\n\nR\u00f8d-Larsen may not be a household name, but he\u2019s a big deal in diplomatic circles, having helped put together the landmark Oslo Accords in the early 1990s. Per the Journal, he was such a fixture at Epstein\u2019s New York townhouse between 2013 and 2017 that the staff knew to have cucumbers ready for his gin. He also received a personal loan from Epstein, as well as a donation to his nonprofit.\n\nR\u00f8d-Larsen stepped down from that nonprofit when his ties to Epstein were initially revealed in 2020. He gave no additional comment to the Journal this week.\n\nJoshua Cooper Ramo, a FedEx board member\n\nThe Journal reports that Epstein scheduled more than a dozen meetings over the four years with Ramo, who was at that point a co-CEO of Henry Kissinger\u2019s consulting company. Ramo also served on the board of Starbucks and still serves on the board of FedEx. Most of the meetings were scheduled in the evening at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan townhouse. Epstein also invited him to a 2013 breakfast at the townhouse that Barak attended.\n\nRamo didn\u2019t respond to the Journal\u2019s requests to comment on the meetings.\n\nAriane de Rothschild, chairwoman of Edmond de Rothschild Group\n\nIn 2019, the private Swiss bank Edmond de Rothschild Group falsely claimed it and its chairwoman, Ariane de Rothschild, had no ties to Epstein. According to the documents reviewed by the Journal:\n\nMrs. de Rothschild, who married into the famous banking family, had more than a dozen meetings with Epstein. He sought her help with staffing and furnishings as well as discussed business deals with her, according to the documents. In September 2013, Epstein asked Mrs. de Rothschild in an email for help finding a new assistant, \u201cfemale \u2026 multilingual, organized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask around,\u201d Mrs. de Rothschild emailed back.\n\nShe bought nearly $1 million worth of auction items on Epstein\u2019s behalf in 2014 and 2015, the documents show. Mrs. de Rothschild was named chairwoman of the bank in January 2015. That October, she and Epstein negotiated a $25 million contract for Epstein\u2019s Southern Trust Co. to provide \u201crisk analysis and the application and use of certain algorithms\u201d for the bank[.]\n\nIn a response to the Journal, the bank admitted that its 2019 statement was inaccurate and said that de Rothschild had business-related meetings with Epstein from 2013 to 2019, that he had introduced the bank to U.S. finance leaders, provided tax and risk consulting, and had recommended law firms. The bank also said that Epstein \u201csolicited her personally on a couple occasions for advice and services on estate management\u201d and that she \u201cwas similarly unaware of any questions regarding his personal conduct\u201d at the time.\n\nKathryn Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs general counsel\n\nThe documents reveal that Epstein scheduled more than three dozen meetings with Ruemmler, starting in 2014, after she left the White House counsel\u2019s office and joined the private sector as a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins. Epstein also scheduled her to fly with him to Paris in 2015 and to his now-notorious island estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands, he looked at apartments she was interested in, and he discussed with his staff whether the young women working at his Manhattan townhouse would make Ruemmler uncomfortable.\n\nIn 2020, Ruemmler took a job as a top lawyer at the Goldman Sachs Group, where she co-chairs the firm\u2019s reputational-risk advisory committee. A Goldman spokesperson told the Journal that Ruemmler\u2019s relationship with Epstein was professional and related to her work at Latham & Watkins:\n\nIn the normal course, Epstein also invited her to meetings and social gatherings, introduced her to other business contacts and made referrals. It was the same kinds of contacts and engagements she had with other contacts and clients.\n\nThe spokesperson also said that Ruemmler never noticed anything untoward at his townhouse, that she never flew anywhere with him, that she never visited his island, and that her comment was \u201cI regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\nLawrence Summers\n\nTies between Epstein and the ex-treasury secretary and Harvard president were already well-known. But the Journal provides more detail about their connection. Though Harvard stopped accepting donations from Epstein after his 2008 conviction, Summers continued to meet with him frequently.\n\nThe paper uncovered an email Summers sent to Epstein in 2014, in which he asked the financier\u2019s advice on how to raise money for a nonprofit poetry initiative spearheaded by his wife, Harvard Professor Elisa New. \u201cI need small scale philanthropy advice. My life will be better if i raise $1m for Lisa,\u201d Summers wrote. \u201cMostly it will go to make it a pbs series and for teacher training. Ideas?\u201d Epstein and Summers made plans for dinner near Summers\u2019s Massachusett\u2019s home two days later, and in 2016, an Epstein-linked nonprofit gave $110,000 to New\u2019s project.\n\nIn a statement to the Journal, Summers and New said that Summers \u201cdeeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction,\u201d New \u201cregrets accepting funding from Epstein,\u201d and that New\u2019s nonprofit had made a donation \u201cexceeding the amount received\u201d it had received from Epstein to an anti-sex trafficking group.\n\nPeter Thiel\n\nThe New York Times reports that according to Epstein\u2019s scheduling records, Epstein had several meetings with Thiel in 2014:\n\nThe records \u2014 in the form of emails that Mr. Epstein\u2019s assistant sent to remind him of upcoming events \u2014 show that in September 2014 Mr. Thiel was scheduled to meet with Mr. Epstein on at least three occasions, either in one-on-one meetings or with others over lunch or dinner. Two other times, Mr. Thiel was listed among more than a dozen other well-known people Mr. Epstein should try to see while at his New York mansion. It\u2019s unclear from the records whether all the meetings with Mr. Thiel took place. Some were listed as tentative or \u201cTBD\u201d \u2014 for \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

A deployment of charm. An aura of invincibility. A five-figure donation to a New York Times reporter's favored nonprofit. A bullet delivering a message. Even, it is alleged, a cat's severed head in the front yard of the editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair.\n\nSuch were the tools the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein is said to have used to try to soften news coverage and at times stave off journalistic scrutiny altogether.\n\nBefore his death earlier this month, Epstein owned the largest townhouse in Manhattan, little more than a mile from many of the nation's leading news organizations. He counted a former and a future president among his friends. He partied with royalty and supermodels. He was said to advise billionaires.\n\nEpstein killed himself, authorities say, in federal prison as he faced criminal charges alleging sex trafficking of underage girls, some as young as 14, in his mansions in New York and Florida. And yet with a few notable exceptions, the national media infrequently covered Epstein's behavior and rarely looked at the associates who helped him evade accountability for his actions \u2014 at least, not until the Miami Herald's Julie K. Brown's investigative series late last year.\n\n\"We count on the press to uncover problems, not merely to report on when problems have been prosecuted and when people have been indicted, but to uncover problems before they reach that stage,\" says David Boies, an attorney for several of Epstein's accusers. \"And here you had a terrible problem. A horrific series of abuses.\"\n\nBoies' firm helped file lawsuits in 2015 and 2017 for clients alleging that Epstein and his associates had sexually trafficked underage girls, at his various homes. The suits were publicly available documents but received little attention in the press.\n\n\"We spread them out in two public complaints. We would go to the media to try to explain what was going on,\" Boies tells NPR. \"With the exception, really, of the Miami Herald and the Daily Beast, prior to the arrest [of Epstein this summer] there was almost no substantive coverage.\"\n\nIn some cases, Epstein successfully scared off some accusers and struck confidential settlements with others, making it harder for reporters to get them to recount their experiences on the record.\n\nJournalists who have tracked the story say attitudes in society at large and newsrooms themselves shifted with the #MeToo movement that burst forth in the fall of 2017. Some of those cases involved prominent actresses who command resources and media attention.\n\nSome critics of the press's performance say ruefully there may have been a class element at play. As described in court documents, Epstein and his associates recruited young women from working-class backgrounds and disrupted families.\n\n\"We need to look at ourselves, too,\" the Miami Herald's Brown tells NPR. \"We need to understand why this wasn't scrutinized in this way before.\"\n\nSeparate instructive episodes stretch from 2003 to 2018 and involve three major American media outlets \u2014 Vanity Fair, ABC News and The New York Times. And taken together, they may help illuminate Epstein's drive to avoid tough journalistic scrutiny and the media's reluctance to take the story on.\n\nVanity Fair\n\nEarly one morning in the winter of 2003, Vanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter arrived at his magazine's offices to find an unexpected visitor standing alone in the reception area behind its glass doors. It was Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn 2002, Carter had read a gossip item in the New York Post's Page Six column and decided to assign a reporter to answer the pressing question: Who exactly was Epstein and why was he flying former President Bill Clinton and other celebrities around on his jets?\n\nUnder Carter, Vanity Fair was known for eagerly dissecting the nation's elites and just as eagerly rubbing shoulders with them.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Peter Kramer/AP Peter Kramer/AP\n\nPeople had gossiped about Epstein's influence and his sexual appetite. Also in 2002, future President Donald Trump told New York magazine: \"It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nCarter assigned the reporter Vicky Ward to write the story. This summer, she told NPR's Morning Edition she wanted to pinpoint the source of Epstein's wealth and to figure out why very young women were always spotted around him.\n\nWard interviewed two sisters, Maria and Annie Farmer. They alleged Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, lured them into his orbit for sexual exploitation. (Maxwell denies this and all related allegations.)\n\nMaria, an aspiring artist, alleged Epstein and Maxwell sexually assaulted her together in an Ohio apartment. Annie was just 15 years old, the sisters allege, when Epstein sexually assaulted her at his vast New Mexico ranch. (Maria later detailed these allegations in an affidavit for a lawsuit filed in 2019.)\n\nAnd so that morning when Epstein had materialized at the magazine's offices, he was there to press Carter not to devote any attention to Epstein's apparent interest in very young women.\n\n\"He was torturing Graydon,\" says John Connolly, then a Vanity Fair contributing editor, who reported on crime and scandal.\n\nEpstein beseeched Carter and berated him, Connolly says, that morning and subsequently, in a flood of phone calls. Epstein denied to Carter any misconduct and wanted him to steer away from the subject.\n\nIn March 2003, Vanity Fair did publish Ward's piece. Titled \"The Talented Mr. Epstein,\" it took a tough look at Epstein's lavish lifestyle and questioned the origins of his fortune.\n\nIt did not report the Farmers' accusations of abuse.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robin Marchant/Getty Images Robin Marchant/Getty Images\n\nIn a statement, Carter says Vanity Fair takes its legal obligations seriously, especially when the subject is a private person rigorously protected under libel laws.\n\nCarter previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Ward did not have three sources on the record, which he said he considered necessary for the story. This week, Carter amended that: He says Ward did not have three sources that met the magazine's \"legal threshold.\"\n\nFor the first time, in comments to NPR, Maria and Annie Farmer are publicly confirming they gave interviews to Ward. They say they both spoke about their abuse on the record, by name, back in 2002. Their mother, Janice Farmer, tells NPR she did too. And she says they were crestfallen Vanity Fair didn't report their allegations.\n\n\"We decided to share our story about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell with a writer for Vanity Fair in 2002 because telling other people what happened to us, as we had already done, did not lead to either of them being held accountable,\" they wrote in a statement for this article. \"We spoke on the record. Our mother spoke on the record.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Richard Drew/AP Richard Drew/AP\n\n\"It was terribly painful,\" the Farmer sisters wrote in a statement for this article. \"We hoped the story would put people on notice and they would be stopped from abusing other young girls and young women. That didn't happen. In the end, the story that ran erased our voices.\"\n\nBoies, a lawyer for the Farmer sisters, says the omission made it more difficult to get victims and witnesses to speak out. \"I think it helped create the impression among many of the victims that the media was under Epstein's control, that Epstein had all this power,\" he says.\n\nSoon after publication, Connolly says, Carter called to share an ominous development: a bullet placed right outside his front door at his Manhattan home.\n\n\"That wasn't a coincidence,\" Connolly says.\n\nEven in the absence of any evidence Epstein was involved, Connolly says, both Carter and he considered the bullet a clear warning from Epstein. Another former colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalls receiving an anguished call from Carter linking the bullet to Epstein. (NPR asked Carter repeatedly over the course of a week for his recollections of the bullet incident along with other elements presented here. After this story was broadcast and posted, his spokeswoman wrote to say Carter recalled the bullet appearing in 2004, not 2003.)\n\nIn 2006, federal authorities compiled accusations against Epstein in Florida. Connolly says he headed south to see if there was a story there for Vanity Fair.\n\nAs Connolly pursued interviews with women who had worked for Epstein, he says, Carter called him once more. The editor had found another intrusion, this time in the front yard of his Connecticut home: the severed head of a dead cat.\n\n\"It was done to intimidate,\" Connolly tells NPR. \"No question about it.\" (Others who worked for Vanity Fair at the time said the cat's head was the talk of the office.)\n\nConnolly tells NPR he voluntarily decided to stop pursuing the subject for the magazine. He later wrote a nonfiction book about Epstein with the bestselling crime novelist James Patterson.\n\nIn statements to NPR, Carter says the magazine never held back on reporting on Epstein because of any sense of threat.\n\nAlthough federal investigators had identified nearly three dozen victims, Epstein's legal team was able to strike a controversial deal letting him plead guilty to reduced state charges of soliciting prostitution from a teenager.\n\nAfter release from jail, Epstein was accepted back into society by many leading social figures in Manhattan and beyond. He donated generous amounts to top scientists and scholars at Harvard and MIT and became a philanthropist for leading institutions of art and music.\n\nIn 2010, a group of media heavyweights joined a dinner in honor of Britain's Prince Andrew. It was arranged by a Hollywood publicist and hosted by Epstein at his Manhattan townhouse. Attendees included ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos and CBS anchors Katie Couric and Charlie Rose.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Mazur/VF14/WireImage Kevin Mazur/VF14/WireImage\n\nThe next year, Ward posted an essay about Epstein and his circle. In that 2011 essay, she referred glancingly to Epstein's \"sexual peccadilloes.\"\n\nAnd Ward wrote about Maxwell in glowing terms as \"always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about the Third World at a bar until two a.m. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious.\"\n\nWard concluded: \"In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.\"\n\nIn March 2014, a society photographer captured a snap of Maxwell as a guest at a black-tie party held after the Academy Awards in Hollywood. The party was sponsored by Vanity Fair. It was hosted by Graydon Carter.\n\nABC News\n\nIn recent months, a photograph of Virginia Roberts Giuffre has ricocheted around the world. It shows a young woman with a broad smile on her face, and Prince Andrew's hand rests on her hip next to her exposed midriff. The prince is smiling too.\n\nGiuffre is about 17 in the photograph, taken in 2001 at Maxwell's London home. Other pictures of Giuffre published by tabloids are from a party for the supermodel Naomi Campbell. Epstein and Maxwell stand just a few feet from Giuffre in pictures from that night.\n\nGiuffre had become part of Epstein's household. Her presence at Campbell's party, Giuffre later testified, was part of a six-week trip Epstein took her on throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. After a later party she attended for Campbell, she said, Epstein told her to have sex with a businessman, and she said she performed a sexual act upon him. Epstein later procured her for sex with other associates as well, she said, Prince Andrew among them \u2014 a charge he and Buckingham Palace sharply reject.\n\nMaxwell had come across Giuffre while the younger woman worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, according to allegations in court documents. Giuffre was a locker room attendant there. Maxwell spied her reading a book about anatomy and massage therapy as she happened by.\n\nIn May 2009, Giuffre sued Epstein and accused Maxwell of recruiting her to a life of being sexually trafficked while she was a minor. She alleged it took years to escape. (Maxwell rejects her allegations.)\n\nIn 2015, the ABC News team of Amy Robach and Jim Hill secured an interview with Giuffre. In a sequence of events confirmed by the network, producers paid for Giuffre and her family to fly from Colorado, where they lived, to New York City and put them up at the Ritz-Carlton hotel on Central Park South. Robach and her news crew interviewed Giuffre on tape for more than an hour about Epstein and his entourage.\n\n\"At the time, in 2015, Epstein was walking around a free man, comparing his criminal behavior to stealing a bagel,\" Giuffre writes in an email to NPR. \"I really wanted a spotlight shone on him and the others who acted with him and enabled his vile and shameless conduct against young girls and young women.\"\n\n\"I viewed the ABC interview as a potential game-changer,\" she writes. \"Appearing on ABC with its wide viewership would have been the first time for me to speak out against the government for basically looking the other way and to describe the anger and betrayal victims felt.\"\n\nThe story never aired. And Giuffre has said she was never directly told why.\n\nABC News would not detail its editorial choices.\n\nOne ABC News staffer with knowledge of events says the network received a call from one of Epstein's top lawyers: Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz. And Giuffre and her lawyers placed great significance on that call.\n\nDershowitz had been part of the powerhouse legal team that earlier kept Epstein from facing serious federal charges in Florida, which also included former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and renowned Miami defense attorney Roy Black.\n\nDershowitz tells NPR he intervened after learning ABC was on the brink of broadcasting its interview with Giuffre. He says he believes he spoke with two producers and a lawyer within the same 24-hour period.\n\n\"I did not want to see [Giuffre's] credibility enhanced by ABC,\" Dershowitz says.\n\nIn a December 2014 court filing in another accuser's lawsuit, Giuffre had alleged Dershowitz was among the prominent men Epstein had instructed her to have sex with when she was a teenager. In early 2015, Dershowitz had rejected her account out of hand in his own court filings. (The nature of his denials were such that Giuffre sued Dershowitz for defamation earlier this year. Dershowitz has asked the court to dismiss that lawsuit.)\n\nBy September 2015, ABC soon had another possible news hook. Giuffre filed a defamation lawsuit against Maxwell in which she alleged specifics of just how, in her account, she was recruited and abused by Epstein and Maxwell. (Maxwell, again, denies those claims.) Boies, who represents Giuffre, told the Miami Herald that case was settled in 2017.\n\nABC episodically covered the various lawsuits. Yet it did not broadcast the interview with Giuffre.\n\n\"I found [Giuffre] to be very truthful and credible,\" says the Herald's Brown, who interviewed her several years later for the paper's coverage. \"There were other things in the record that supported her story. So I didn't have any qualms about it.\"\n\nBrown said a fear of being sued was a constant for reporters on the Epstein story.\n\nThe network says its decision not to broadcast the interview four years ago reflected proper journalistic care.\n\n\"At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we never stopped investigating the story,\" ABC News spokeswoman Heather Riley said in a statement sent to NPR this week. \"Over the past year we have put a whole team on this investigation, which will air in the coming months.\"\n\nThe #MeToo movement has affected journalistic practices in handling such circumstances.\n\nIn October 2017, more than two years after the Giuffre interview, ABC's Diane Sawyer interviewed the actor Ashley Judd about her accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAt that time, Judd had not yet filed a lawsuit against Weinstein and he did not yet face criminal charges. Yet ABC viewers heard Judd's accusations in full.\n\nGiuffre now lives in Australia with her husband and children.\n\n\"I was defeated, once again, by the very people I spoke out against and once again, my voice was silenced,\" Giuffre tells NPR. \"I could not believe that a formidable network like ABC had backed down and given in.\"\n\nThe New York Times\n\nLast August, reporters at The New York Times and other publications received word Tesla founder Elon Musk was relying on Epstein to advise him on whom to consider hiring as board chair or chief executive.\n\nEditors at the Times sent business columnist James Stewart to talk to Epstein. \"I wondered why would Musk, if this is true, be using a registered sex offender to recruit new members to the board,\" Stewart recently told The Kicker, a podcast from the Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nGiven Epstein's criminal history, the off-the-record conversation took a surprising turn. As Stewart wrote last week: \"He said that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable.\"\n\nYet Stewart was not the editors' first choice to interview Epstein further.\n\nInitially, they had asked Landon Thomas Jr., a veteran financial correspondent who had been at the Times for 16 years.\n\nThomas knew Epstein fairly well \u2014 having first written about the financier, back in 2002, just before he joined the paper. Thomas had considered him a valued source ever since, even after Epstein's release from jail for sex offenses. Just how valued turned out to be a problem for the reporter and the paper.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with five current and former New York Times staffers with knowledge of the episode. They spoke on condition they not be directly named; while the Times confirmed the contours of the incident, it declined to authorize its journalists to comment. Thomas also declined to comment for this story.\n\nBut Thomas flagged a problem. He told his editors Epstein had been a great source for years and had become something of a friend as well. How close? Thomas had solicited a $30,000 contribution from Epstein for a Harlem cultural center, he told them.\n\nThomas suggested Epstein was just a source of information, not someone he would report on or investigate. His editors were aghast. They rejected the distinction he was trying to make.\n\nAnd his editors benched him instantly from any professional contact with Epstein.\n\n\"Soliciting a donation to a personal charity is a clear violation of the policy that governs Times journalists' relationships with their sources,\" said the Times Co.'s chief spokesperson, Eileen Murphy. \"As soon as editors became aware of it, they took action.\"\n\nNPR found tax records that reflect a $30,000 donation in 2017 to a Montessori preschool called O'Gorman Garden in Harlem from a foundation based in the U.S. Virgin Islands that had previously been controlled by Epstein.\n\nColleagues pulled up his clippings. Thomas had not written frequently about Epstein. But several Times staffers say they were appalled by a piece they found.\n\nFor a 2008 profile, Thomas had traveled to Epstein's private isle in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The piece ran just before Epstein submitted to authorities in Florida for incarceration.\n\nIt included this lyrical passage: \"As his legal troubles deepened, Mr. Epstein gazed at the azure sea and the lush hills of St. Thomas in the distance, poked at a lunch of crab and rare steak prepared by his personal chef, and tried to explain how his life had taken such a turn,\" Thomas wrote. \"He likened himself to Gulliver shipwrecked among the diminutive denizens of Lilliput.\"\n\nThe article largely presented Epstein as someone who solicited prostitutes, not committed sex crimes against minors. (Federal agents had by then identified several dozen possible victims.)\n\nRereading the story in August 2018, Thomas' colleagues recalled the exclusives their paper broke that propelled the #MeToo awakening. This, they say, was an embarrassment.\n\nBy early January 2019, Thomas was gone from the Times, though the inspiration for his departure was not shared with the public.\n\nLast weekend, the paper reported on a public apology by one of its corporate directors, Joichi Ito, who had landed millions of dollars from Epstein for the institute he leads, the MIT Media Lab. In a tweet, the paper's media editor, Jim Windolf, said that Ito had sought funds from Epstein \"a few years after Epstein got out of the Palm Beach County Jail.\"\n\nNPR's Cat Schuknecht contributed reporting to this story."}, {"url": "https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/epstein", "page_content": "\"The Private Law Connections to Public Nuisance Law: Some Realism about Today's Intellectual Nominalism,\" 17 Journal of Law, Economics and Policy 282 (2022).\n\n\"The Application of Antitrust Law to Labor Markets \u2014 Then and Now,\" 15 New York University Journal of Law and Liberty 327 (2022). ssrn www\n\n\"A Rational Immigration Policy,\" 22 Hoover Digest 91 (2022).\n\n\"The Excessive Ambitions of Stakeholder Ideology,\" 77 Business Lawyer 755 (2022).\n\n\"Antitrust Overreach in Labor Markets: A Response to Eric Posner,\" 15 New York University Journal of Law and Liberty 407 (2022). www\n\n\"Market Competition as a Constitutional Virtue: A Defense of Lochner and a Revitalized Dormant Commerce Clause,\" 16 New York University Journal of Law and Liberty 308 (2022).\n\n\"Rules and Reasons, Public and Private: On the Use and Limits of Simple Rules 25 Years Later,\" 52 European Journal of Law and Economics 363 (2021). www\n\n\"Getting It Right: The push for open borders ignores the hard questions.

Tisch Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law. He is also an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute, the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law Emeritus and a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, and a policy advisor for The Heartland Institute. Epstein became a permanent faculty member at NYU School of Law in 2010.[1] Epstein was chosen in a poll as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times.[2] Contents [show] Biography[edit]\n\nEpstein was born in New York. He graduated summa cum laude from Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in 1964. He received a B.A. in jurisprudence from Oxford in 1966 (with first-class honours). He graduated cum laude from Yale Law School with an LL.B. in 1968. He began his teaching career at the University of Southern California Law School. Views[edit]\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work, arguing that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable however, according to Epstein, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if repealed. Consistent with the principles of Classical-Liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, DOMA, should be repealed,[3] stating: Under our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits. However, in the two cases under discussion (Gill and Massachusetts, both of which had been heard by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro), Epstein observed that: To strike down DOMA, Judge Tauro had to reject all state justifications for its definition of marriage. Congress advanced four such justifications for this statute: \"(1) encouraging responsible procreation and child-bearing, (2) defending and nurturing the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage, (3) defending traditional notions of morality, and (4) preserving scarce resources.\" The Justice Department disavowed them all. So much for tradition. Its sole defense of DOMA was that it was needed to preserve the status quo until matters were sorted out politically. Given that open invitation Judge Tauro concluded that all of the justifications offered in DOMA flunked even the lowest \"conceivable\" standard of rationality. Religious people will surely take umbrage at his one-sentence rebuttals of centuries of tradition. Epstein's criticism of these two decisions concluded: Now there is no reason for principle to yield to pragmatism. We don't need a judicial precedent that will spark a nation-wide rerun of California's Proposition 8. We need courts to back off to democratic processes, imperfect as they are. Epstein views market incentives against discrimination as sufficient to regulate the acknowledged evil, and attempting to give everyone a court hearing only encourages excessive litigation.[4] In Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (1985) Epstein argues the government should be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. Though then U.S. Senator Joseph Biden denounced the book during the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, the book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property.[5] The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights[6] and has been cited by the United States Supreme Court in four cases, including Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council from 1992.[5] Epstein's defense of tobacco companies during the 1990s was controversial. Epstein serves on the advisory board of the New York University Journal of Law and Liberty, and introduces the keynote speaker every year at the Journal of Law and Liberty sponsored Annual Friedrich A. von Hayek Lecture. Politics[edit]\n\nEpstein has said that when voting, he chooses \"anyone but the Big Two\" who are \"just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors\"; he has voted Libertarian.[7] Epstein says he is \"certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy\".[7] Epstein agreed to serve on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force in December 2010.[8][9][10] Personal life[edit]\n\nEpstein is the first cousin of comedian Paul Reiser.[11] Publications[edit]\n\n2013.
