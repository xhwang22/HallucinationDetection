As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $4 million, earned through a successful career in acting. She\u2019s also appeared in numerous other television shows and feature films throughout her career, and as she continues her endeavors even well into her \u201870s, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nWhile virtually no information is available about Jeannine\u2019s early life, it is known that she developed an interest in acting at a young age. She started her career in the early 1960s, appearing in small or uncredited roles in projects such as \u201cFive Finger Exercise\u201d. In 1963, she was cast in the sitcom \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d in the role of Billie Jo Bradley, set in the Shady Rest Hotel run by Kate Bradley, her three daughters and her uncle. The series was created after the success of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the success of this show led to the spin-off entitled \u201cGreen Acres\u201d.\n\nShe stayed with the show until 1965, then decided to leave the series to pursue more film work, replaced by Gunila Hutton and later Meredith MacRae during the latter seasons. Jeannine then started to do film work in the late 1960s, appearing in \u201cThe Big Mouth\u201d as Bambi Berman, filmed in San Diego and featuring Frank De Vol as an on-screen narrator.\n\nThe 3 original Bradley Sisters\u2026Betty Jo {Linda Kaye Henning}, Bobbi Jo {Pat Woodell}, and Billie Jo {Jeannine Riley.} Posted by Debbie Spivey on Saturday, January 26, 2019\n\nCareer Prominence\n\nThe following year Riley was cast in \u201cFever Heat\u201d, which was directed by Russell S. Doughten and starring alongside Nick Adams and Norman Alden. In 1969 she was cast in the film \u201cThe Comic\u201d, co-written and co-produced by Carl Reiner and starring Dick Van Dyke, Michele Lee and Mickey Rooney in a film inspired by the end of the silent film era.\n\nAfter that she returned to television, as she was cast in a regular role in the comedy variety series entitled \u201cHee Haw\u201d during the same year, which was set in fictional rural Kornfield Kounty, and inspired by \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d. The show centered on rural culture and country music, with hosts Buck Owens as well as Roy Clark, but would often feature scantily clad women in stereotypical farmer\u2019s daughters attire, who came to be known as the Hee Haw Honeys. She stayed with the show for three years, and then joined another show in \u201cDusty\u2019s Trail\u201d, in which she played Lulu McQueen, a western-theme take-off of Ginger Grant from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, also starring Forrest Tucker and Bob Denver.\n\nLater Career\n\nOver the next few years, Jeannine had small roles in television shows such as \u201cThe Wild Wild West\u201d, \u201cRoute 66\u201d, and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d She then featured in the film \u201cElectra Glide in Blue\u201d, which starred Robert Blake as a motorcycle cop alongside Billy \u201cGreen\u201d Bush, and based on the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle used by traffic police. During the same year, she had an uncredited role in \u201cThe Outfit\u201d, actually appearing as a prostitute in an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Richard Stark under the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake.\n\nAs the years progressed, Jeannine took fewer roles; she was a part of the 1980s project entitled \u201cLone Star Bar & Grill\u201d as Arlene, and one of her last projects was the 1991 film entitled \u201cTimebomb\u201d, which starred Michael Biehn, Richard Jordan and Patsy Kensit.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFor her personal life, it is known that Riley married Gary Groom in 1965 but their marriage ended in divorce in 1972. She married once more in 1974 to Irwin Radnitz but it was also a marriage that ended in divorce. There are no reported children from her marriages.\n\nSince retiring from acting work, very little information has been shared about her. One of the reasons is due to the fact that she does not have any accounts on major social media websites. In 2016, a book was released entitled \u201cX Child Stars: Where Are They Now\u201d, written by Kathy Garver and Fred Ascher, which contained a profile of her along with her career. Many sources speculate that since ending her acting career, she focused more on other endeavors, and likely another marriage and a family, but there is no evidence to confirm these speculations.\n\nFacts # Fact 1 Jeannine Riley and Steve Ihnat co-starred together in the play, \"The Fourposter\", put on by the Sherman Oaks Playhouse for two months, from mid-April to mid-August, 1953.

She appeared on the show\u2019s first two seasons which lasted up until the mid-1960s and then had memorable stints in a string of other productions, including Route 66, The Man From U.N.C.L, Fever heat, and The Comic.\n\nHowever, she probably stopped enjoying acting as she started to scale back on her appearances in the \u201990s and soon, she left the limelight completely. Her last film role was as Landlady in the 1991 film Timebomb. Since this role, Jeannine has not appeared in any film or does she plan to do so soon. However, her exit from the spotlight without officially announcing her retirement has many people wondering where she is now and what lead to her disappearance.\n\nJeannine Riley\u2019s Biography\n\nJeannine Riley was born in Madera, California USA, on 1st October 1940 and named Jeannine Brooke Riley. From the look of things, the actress must\u2019ve been one of the most enigmatic actresses in her time as there is no information about her. Not even her educational history, or childhood, despite the terrific fame she enjoyed during her active years in the film industry. The much that is known about her is that she began her acting career professionally in 1962 with a role in the Rosalind Russell drama Five Finger Exercise.\n\nShe followed the role up with an appearance in Father of the Bride, My Three Sons and Route 66. At age 23, she appeared in the suspense drama Strike Me Deadly with Gary Clarke and Steve Ihnat. She went on to work with Ihnat in The Fourposter \u2013 a stage play.\n\nAt this point, she had started to gradually climb the prestigious career ladder. Her performances in Wagon Train and The Virginian helped to solidify her position in the limelight and drew the interest of CBS. It also prepared a stage for her star-making role in Petticoat Junction (1963) as one of the daughters of Kate Bradley \u2013 played by Bea Benaderet. The role remains what she is known for to date.\n\nMeanwhile, she was not the first choice for the role. Sharon Tate was chosen for it but the actress lost the slot when she got involved in nude photoshoots, mostly because explicit contents were seen as somewhat a taboo at that time. Luckily, Jeannine was picked to replace Tate when her role was recast.\n\nAfter two seasons of the series, Jeannine Riley left and was replaced by Gunilla Hutton. Even after she left the show, life stayed kind to her acting career as she made more TV appearances including guest-starring on Ozzie and Harriet. She also played a part on the Smothers Brothers Show. In 1967, she secured roles in different films; The Big Mouth, The Wild, Gomer Pyle and a lot more.\n\nThe following year, she worked with Nick Adams in Fever Heat (1968), which is among the last films of the actor before his demise. After a few more acting works in the 1960s, her next appearance was in 1973 \u2013 in Electra Glide in Blue. At this point, Hollywood was beginning to accept nudity and Jeannine was willing to show some skin. Her nude scenes in the movie made her an instant star but Jeannine probably wanted something else as her presence on TV started to reduce following this role. In 1991, she left completely after starring in the film, Timebomb.\n\nHer Family\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Jeannine Riley doesn\u2019t let people into matters concerning her private life. So, nothing is known about her siblings, parents, or any other relative. It is, however, known that she has been married twice and none of her marriages survived the test of time. Her first marriage was to Gary Grom in 1965. It failed in 1972 and in less than two years after their divorce, Jeannine married Irwin Radnitz which ended in a similar manner. None of her marriages or past relationships produced a child and since then, her love life has been blurred from the public.\n\nRead Also: Who Was Ann Sothern?\n\nWhere Is Jeannine Riley Now?\n\nNobody is sure of what Jeannine has been up to since 1991 when she left the spotlight. She probably wants nothing more than people knowing less about her as she is not even active on social media either, making it very difficult to dig out anything about her. But there are rumors that she left the acting scene possibly to focus on her family while others have taken the view that she pursued a different career. Nonetheless, these rumors haven\u2019t been confirmed to-this-date. In this regard, her whereabouts remain a mystery."}, {"url": "https://doyouremember.com/157936/jeannine-riley-career-then-now", "page_content": "Billie Jo Bradley was a model of ambition and unbridled hope and awe in Petticoat Junction and none other than Jeannine Riley debuted the role in 1963. Two others would follow, but not before Riley left a permanent mark on the show and set the stage for seven seasons of Billie Jo greatness. But what about Riley herself? What trajectory did her career follow? In short, one her character would have been proud of.\n\nJeannine Riley was born on October 1, 1940, and grew up in California for much of her upbringing after her father left for the Army and her family planted roots in Madera. She learned acting and the ways of show business in the Pasadena Playhouse while also performing ballet. She started working on television and an uncredited role in the 1962 movie Five Finger Exercise before television work arose in greater succession. Early credits included Father of the Bride, My Three Sons, Route 66, and The Beauty Contest. Indeed, her easy, approachable grace helped pave the way for more and more prominence on TV not long into her career.\n\nWhy did Jeannine Riley leave \u2018Petticoat Junction\u2019?\n\nHer career had just begun in 1962 and still Jeannine Riley managed to turn some important heads. Namely, CBS producers noticed her while she acted in Wagon Train and The Virginian and as rural shows dominated televisions, they wanted Riley for their next big project: Petticoat Junction. With the rural purge still a decade away, the wholesome series joined the ranks of Beverly Hillbillies and The Andy Griffith Show as a recipe for success. Initially, actress and model Sharon Tate was slated to originate the role of Billie Jo, but after a nude photoshoot, she was deemed too risque for a series sponsored by Ivory Soap; Riley ended up winning the role of 300 other hopefuls.\n\nRiley channeled that easy charisma into her role and won hearts on-screen and off. But just like her character possessed endless aspirations, so too did Riley, and after two years she bowed out of the series to pursue a film career, as well as try out some other shows, including Gilligan\u2019s Island and Hee Haw. She did make it into movies as planned, such as The Big Mouth and Fever Heat. One of her most prominent roles came in 1973 as Lulu McQueen in Dusty\u2019s Trail, which saw Riley as a kind of Ginger Grant in a western reimagining of Gilligan\u2019s Island complete with Bob Denver himself and Lori Saunders.\n\nIt\u2019s about time to be a bolder woman\n\nRiley wanted to break away from roles that cast her on the basis of her looks alone but found this a difficult endeavor. New opportunities grew fewer. Her final film came with 1991\u2019s Timebomb, a science-fiction action movie starring Michael Biehn. She retired that same year but stays involved in the industry in other ways; the 2016 book X Child Stars: Where Are They Now? offers a look at her life and career. Her personal life included marriage first to Gary Groom from 1965 to 1972, then Irwin Radnitz in 1974 until they too divorced.\n\nWhile Riley is not reported to have any children, she has still used her life\u2019s experiences to guide the next generation. In typical Billie Jo fashion, she wants to see women be successful, something she herself is familiar with. In 2020, she penned the book The Bolder Woman: It\u2019s About Time, all about encouraging and instructing women on how they can follow their dreams at any age. \u201cCome along with me as I reveal how I overcame my own fear of aging and being labeled an old woman just because I\u2019d reached a certain number of years,\u201d Riley invites readers. \u201cYour many years of living has brought you this far, so why stop now?\u201d\n\nWe certainly hope Riley doesn\u2019t stop for a long time!"}, {"url": "https://marriedbiography.com/jeannine-riley-biography/", "page_content": "She is currently single and doesn\u2019t plan on getting romantically involved with someone anytime soon.\n\nRiley later married Irwin Radnitz on 1 June 1974.
