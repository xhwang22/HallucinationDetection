Widely acknowledged for his work on rocket propulsion and his contribution to the US missile programme during the Second World War, Qian was deported at the height of the McCarthyism hysteria on dubious charges of being a communist, only to become the driving force behind China's rise to the first rank of space nations.\n\nQian was born in the eastern city of Hangzhou in 1911, as China's 2,000-year-old feudal system was overthrown, and he was destined to encounter both turbulent historic events and social upheaval. After graduating from Shanghai Jiao Tong University as an engineer, in 1935 he went to study aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Theoretically inclined, he was dissatisfied with the practical emphasis that MIT placed on its curricula at the time, and soon moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. During his time there, he rose to become one of the most prominent rocket scientists in the United States.\n\nAt Caltech, Qian was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the legendary theoretical aerodynamicist Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, and became a renowned theoretician in high-speed flight. The two men were the leading members of a group of rocket experimenters known as the Suicide Squad because of the dangerous nature of their work. In 1939, their research attracted the attention of the US Army Air Corps, which tasked Caltech, including Qian, with developing jet-assisted take-off technology \u2014 a means of helping heavy aircraft to take off by providing additional thrust in the form of small rockets.\n\nThe 1943 discovery of German rocketry development led to the acceleration of the US missile programme and the creation of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, which appointed Qian as a director. Two years later, Qian received high-grade security clearance from the Pentagon and, as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board, began advising on the latest classified technologies for military development. By 1949, he had laid the theoretical groundwork for a spaceplane with winged rockets, a predecessor of the space shuttle.\n\nMeanwhile, Sino\u2013US relations had deteriorated with the onset of the cold war, and this had devastating consequences for Qian's career. In 1950, he was accused of being a communist spy \u2014 allegations that have never been substantiated \u2014 and his security clearance was revoked. Deeply hurt by the accusations, and realizing that he was no longer welcome in the United States, Qian attempted to return to China, whereupon he was arrested and imprisoned by the US Immigration Service for two weeks. He spent the next five years living under partial house arrest, enduring constant humiliation and harassment, although he was able to continue teaching and to conduct limited research at Caltech. He was eventually allowed to leave the United States in 1955, as part of the conditions of China's release of eleven American soldiers captured during the Korean War.\n\nQian received a hero's welcome in China, and was soon asked to create a missile programme \u2014 a daunting challenge in a country where even telephones were luxuries. He began by retraining Chinese scientists and engineers, attracting Western-trained Chinese researchers to return, and building an efficient education and management system for research and development, all of which were to have lasting effects on the country's rocketry development. He joined the Communist Party in 1958 and became a trusted, high-ranking party official. With access to the top Chinese leaders, including Chairman Mao Zedong, he was able to persuade officials to support whatever measures he felt China needed to progress.\n\nIn 1956, Qian founded the Institute of Mechanics in Beijing, now one of the world's leading aeronautics institutions, and influenced the teaching of engineering at many Chinese universities. Under his leadership, China progressed from copying the intermediate-range Soviet R-2 missile (a version of the V-2 rocket developed by Nazi Germany) to launching Dongfeng-2 in 1964 (a medium-range ballistic missile based on home-grown technology), and successfully tested its first atomic bomb a few months later. China's first nuclear ballistic missile was launched using Dongfeng-2 two years later, and the first Chinese satellite went into orbit using Long March-1, a three-stage space-launch version of Dongfeng-4, in 1970.\n\nQian's endeavours were responsible for the development of the Haiying family of anti-ship missiles, widely known in the West as Silkworms. They also paved the way for a succession of increasingly ambitious space programmes. For example, Shenzhou-5, China's first manned space mission, was launched in 2003, and Chang'e-1, the first Chinese lunar probe, was sent into orbit in 2007, using the Long March family of rockets.\n\nIt is extraordinary that China's missile and space programmes took off against a backdrop of economic and political turmoil. They were postponed several times during the Great Leap Forward \u2014 a social and economic plan enacted in 1958 that brought the country's economy to a standstill and triggered widespread famine. In an ironic twist of fate, Qian also endured the Cultural Revolution, an 'anti-revolutionary' witch-hunt launched by Mao in 1966. Some of Qian's friends and colleagues were removed from their positions as a result; Qian himself, although largely unaffected, was forced to write letters of 'confession'.\n\nDespite the grave injustice Qian suffered in the United States, it is clear that his time at Caltech was one of the most enjoyable periods of his life. He revelled in the great relationship he had with von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, enjoying his mentor's jokes and their often heated arguments. He also reminisced, with great affection, about the intellectual ethos and creative spirit fostered at Caltech. He contrasted these with China's academic culture and science infrastructure, which he thought had not, and would not, lead to any real scientific innovation."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fei-Ping_Hsu", "page_content": "Fei-Ping Hsu (Chinese: \u8bb8\u6590\u5e73; July 20, 1952[1]\u2013November 27, 2001) was a Chinese-American pianist.\n\nPianist\n\nHsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China.

His grandparents were wealthy merchants. His father, Qian Jiachi, was an educational reformer and administrator, and his mother, Zhang Lanjuan, studied the Confucian classics. Qian\u2019s family history engendered powerful emotional connections to a transforming Chinese culture that would define Qian\u2019s professional life and make him an icon of 20th-century China.\n\nQian placed third in mechanical engineering in the national college entrance examination and won a coveted slot studying railroad engineering at Shanghai\u2019s Jiaotong University, but as the promising young scientist was developing, his homeland collapsed. Failed governments had left China impoverished and weak; Shanghai was bombed and invaded by Japan in 1932. Qian graduated from Jiaotong in 1934, and the following year he left China for graduate study in aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship from the U.S. government.\n\nThe focus of the MIT program on practical applications was ill-suited to Qian, and in 1936 he left for the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) to study under research engineer Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n. In an age before computers, Qian\u2019s ability to quickly perform complex calculations flawlessly was an invaluable asset to von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n and a nascent group of rocket scientists at Caltech, where Qian became a recognized expert in the study of aerodynamics and jet propulsion. He received his doctorate in aeronautics from Caltech in 1939.\n\nIn 1943, during World War II, Qian helped prepare an analysis of the German rocket program for the U.S. Army, and at the war\u2019s end he traveled to Germany as a U.S. Army colonel to debrief captured German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun. He helped create and organize the U.S. long-range rocket research program and directed research on the country\u2019s first successful solid-fueled missile, the Private A. In 1947 Qian left Caltech with von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n for MIT. He then surrendered his tenured professorship in aeronautics to follow von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n back to Caltech in 1949, and that same year he succeeded von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n as the Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion and as the director of the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Center.\n\nQian\u2019s difficulty adjusting to American culture and his strong personal attachment to China engendered suspicions during the McCarthy era that abruptly ended his career. In 1950 he was detained on charges of espionage. (It is still undetermined if there was any basis to these charges.) After five years under house arrest, Qian was allowed to return to China with his wife, Jiang Ying, and his two American-born children, son Yonggang and daughter Yongzhen. He received a hero\u2019s welcome from the Chinese government, which had negotiated with the Eisenhower administration for his release in exchange for Americans imprisoned in China.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Qian was not directly responsible for the development of any specific missile, rocket engine, or satellite. He earned the imprimatur \u201cthe father of Chinese aerospace\u201d because he personally trained the first generation of revolutionary China\u2019s aerospace engineers. Qian\u2019s loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and his commitment to the revitalization of his homeland cemented his legacy as a scientific leader. His unquestioned political integrity and patriotic zeal were indispensable in helping the aerospace program acquire critical institutional and financial support throughout the turbulent political struggles of the Maoist era.\n\nQian was a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He held several overlapping leadership positions over the years, including the director of the Institute of Mechanics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the director of the Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, and the vice-minister of the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building.\n\nQian\u2019s career as a scientist was cut short by his administrative duties as well as by China\u2019s international isolation and technological immaturity. After his retirement in 1970, Qian turned to music, the martial arts, and traditional Chinese philosophy for intellectual stimulation. He spent the last two decades of his life in relative isolation, occasionally appearing in public to attend events or make pronouncements in support of government policies."}, {"url": "https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/news/18/career-profile-how-hui-su-became-an-atmospheric-scientist-at-nasa-jpl/", "page_content": "Hui Su is an earth scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who studies clouds and storms.\n\nWhat\u2019s your topic of research?\n\nI study any sort of storm where scurrying clouds, strong winds, lightning, thunder, and heavy rain move in an organized way. Hurricanes are an example. I\u2019ve been at JPL since 2005.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were little?\n\nMy parents were both meteorologists. In fact, they even met and got married at their jobs. So I had an early interest in that, and basically, I\u2019ve been studying weather all my career.\n\nWhen I was young, the meteorologists in China lived with their families in the same complex where the office buildings were. So, I grew up in a complex like that with about 20 other kids who were just my age. We used to all bike together to and from school, stopping to play on the roadside. And when we got back to the complex, we would watch the weather balloons being released. They were huge white hydrogen balloons, and as they rose, they measured temperature, wind, and pressure.\n\nWhat was the weather like in your hometown?\n\nMy hometown, Chengdu, is famous for its clouds. You rarely see blue skies. It\u2019s because we\u2019re in a basin surrounded by mountains, right by the Tibetan Plateau. Because of our location, in the summer, we would get a lot of thunderstorms and flooding, and one time we even had a huge flood in our own meteorology complex that caused a lot of damage.\n\nWhat were your college days like?\n\nI was at Peking University, where doing further studies abroad was very popular. So, I followed in those same footsteps and was admitted to the atmospheric dynamics doctoral program at the University of Washington in Seattle. I really liked Seattle. Like Chengdu, it's also famous for its rainy days, and that reminded me of home. It\u2019s a beautiful city with lots of lakes, and the skyline is just lovely. I\u2019d buy seafood at the famous Pike Place Market, and although I\u2019m not that good at cooking, we\u2019d have potlucks with groups of friends. We did many outdoors activities together, from skiing in the winter to beach trips in the summer, to crab-hunting in the Puget Sound.\n\nHui Su on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle during her second year there.\n\nHow did you end up at JPL?\n\nI first came to Los Angeles to do research at UCLA. I focused on El Ni\u00f1o, and eventually that led to my job at JPL. I\u2019ve been researching clouds and hurricanes this whole time, often using satellite data to draw conclusions. Hurricanes cause so much damage, and we\u2019re still not very good at predicting how powerful they will be. That\u2019s a big reason I\u2019m drawn to studying them \u2013 I want to help improve the forecast.\n\nHow do you like Los Angeles?\n\nInitially, it was a blast, because I felt, wow! I really love all the palm trees and the sunny skies! But now, twenty years later, I really miss the rain. There are too many dry days here, and I really feel the drawback of not having enough water in California. Otherwise, I feel that JPL is a great place. I\u2019m constantly impressed by the missions we launch into space \u2013 they are all miracles to me. I\u2019m constantly inspired by what I see happening.\n\nWhat do you do for fun?\n\nI like hiking, and I like dancing \u2013 not really on the stage, but as a work-out. I have a group of friends and we all like to exercise to Chinese folk-dancing. Then one time, we performed at the Lunar New Year party at JPL. We made the top news on the JPL internal newsletter, \u201cUniverse\u201d!\n\nWhat\u2019s one of the hardest parts of your job?\n\nHui in the cockpit of a DC-8 plane -- a plane used to chase hurricanes.\n\nThere\u2019s a tremendous pressure to always stay at the top. I think that\u2019s a positive thing, but it can also add a lot of stress to always maintain yourself at the forefront of research. I\u2019m worried about being not competitive enough for funding grants. A way to relieve the pressure is to form teams and work together with others. That\u2019s a way to share the burdens. We\u2019re constantly exploring new directions and making our research diversified.\n\nWhat if someone can\u2019t see a clear career path from their childhood like you did?\n\nMy career path was almost too simple! I stayed in my major and have been doing that ever since. But for people with a more winding path, it\u2019s okay. People do change, and I\u2019d advise them to follow their heart and do what they\u2019re passionate about and then stick to it."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/18/guardianobituaries3", "page_content": "The Chinese-American pianist Fei-Ping Hsu, who has died aged 51 in a road accident while on a concert tour of China, had the misfortune to live in \"interesting times\". After surviving the cultural revolution of 1966-76, during which he gave many performances of the Yellow River Concerto, he left to pursue his career in the United States.\n\nA Washington Post review in 1989 reported that he played with \"a commanding athleticism born of grace and agility... His instincts run to big sounds and bold statements.\" Those who heard him at the Rubinstein competition in Israel in 1983, where he won the third gold medal, long remembered his sensational performances of the Tarantella from Liszt's Venezia e Napoli, and Chopin's Sonata No 2 in B flat minor.\n\nHis recordings, including mazurkas by Chopin and Beethoven's Moonlight sonata, reveal a spirited approach with an engaging rhythmic instinct and rich tone. He was small of stature and youthful in appearance; his friends describe him as a relaxed, cheerful and generous person, a \"man of faith\" who had a positive influence on all those around him.\n\nHsu was the son of a pastor on Gulangyu island, off the south-east coast of China. An idyllic enclave much influenced by Jesuit missionaries, the area earned the nickname of \"Piano Island\" because of its extraordinary number of pianos - more than 500 in the early 1950s. Hsu was a child prodigy, and, by the age of 14, had already performed Chopin's 24 Etudes.\n\nHe entered the Shanghai Conservatory, then China's most sought-after musical training ground (thanks to the impact of teachers from the great Russian tradition), but his studies came to an abrupt end when the college was closed down during the cultural revolution. His last teacher died in Hsu's arms after being brutally tortured by Red Guards.\n\nBanished to the countryside, Hsu worked on a rice farm and in a factory; his friend, the pianist Hung-Kuan Chen, who won second prize at the Rubinstein competition when Hsu won third, recalled that Hsu never regained the same flexibility in his fingers after his banishment.\n\nHe was, however, summoned back to the piano to perform the Yellow River Concerto - a hybrid piece, based on the Yellow River Cantata by Hsien Hsing-hai, written by a committee of composers from the Central Philharmonic Society of the People's Republic of China, and promoted by Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing, as a suitable \"revolutionary\" work.\n\nFor two years, Hsu and a group of musicians walked across China behind a three-wheeled vehicle carrying an upright piano, playing the Yellow River Concerto several hundred times to soldiers and farm and factory workers. Although this was an arduous task, he was pleased to have been the first Chinese pianist allowed to return to his instrument.\n\nAfter moving to America, Hsu studied at the Eastman School of Music, and with Sasha Grodnitsky at the Juilliard School of Music; he subsequently became a US citizen and settled in New York. After his success at the Rubinstein competition, he made his New York debut in 1984.\n\nHsu was sustained by his strong Christian faith. According to Hung-Kuan Chen, he had been diagnosed with cancer while still in his teens, but had refused treatment, feeling that \"if it was his time to go, he would\".
