Before they graduated high school, they had toured Japan. A deal with Lookout! Records led to the band signing to Atlantic in 2001. Albums such as 2002's Spend The Night and 2004's Gold Medal garnered critical raves and won the band fans at all points on the globe, but not enough of them to maintain a major-label deal. Unbowed, The Donnas formed their own Purple Feather Records label, and in 2007 released their most bracing album yet, Bitchin'.\n\nThrough it all, the driving force behind The Donnas is Torry Castellano. The petite powerhouse rocks her Pearl kit with an almost tectonic force. Perhaps the reason she plays with such passion is the fact that she's lucky to be playing at all: In 2003 an acute case of wrist tendinitis (caused by holding her sticks wrong) almost ended her musical career. But through surgery, physical therapy, and a new approach to drumming, Castellano is back on the throne, and better than she's ever been.\n\nMusicRadar caught up with Torry Castellano backstage for a podcast interview before a recent Donnas show in New York City. Listen to the podcast below, and there's more information on The Donnas' official website.\n\nPart one - Torry discusses the band's formation, growing pains, and being tagged as 'punk.'\n\nPart two - She talks about maturing musically, her almost career-ending tendinitis, and future plans."}, {"url": "https://www.moderndrummer.com/2008/01/torry-castellano-2/", "page_content": "Torry Castellano: The Grip Of Death\n\nAlthough Donnas drummer Torry Castellano still encourages the idea of being a self-taught musician, she\u2019s quick to admit that she had to learn the hard way that improper technique can cause serious problems. A few years ago after a bout with tendinitis rendered Torry out of commission for several months. After touring for over a year on her pop-punk band\u2019s 2002 release, Spend The Night, Castellano\u2019s problems became so severe that she had to undergo surgery and physical rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to physical therapy, they called it \u2018the grip of death,\u2019\u201d Torry recalls. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh no, you do that?\u2019 But it all ended up being really good. I learned a different technique, and I think I\u2019m a better drummer because of it. It\u2019s all about letting the stick do the work. That way you\u2019re not going crazy, holding the stick so tightly that you\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d\n\nBesides applying the new technique, Torry began doing warm-up exercises and reconfigured her four-piece Pearl kit. Since then she\u2019s successfully (read: pain-free) recorded and toured behind two more Donnas albums, including 2004\u2019s Gold Medal and their latest, the arena rock\u2013flavored Bitchin\u2019.\n\nCastellano credits producer Jay Ruston (Meatloaf, Polyphonic Spree) for helping to shape her performance on this latest recording. \u201cHe definitely encouraged that four-on-the-floor type beat,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich was a really good direction because I love that beat. But I was asking, \u2018Should I really put it in more than one song?\u2019 He was like, \u2018It sounds great.\u2019 And when we play those songs live, the rhythm really gets into people.\u201d\n\nWaleed Rashidi"}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Torry%20Castellano", "page_content": "Torry Castellano\n\ndr, bvoc, perc, *1979 US, San Francisco\n\nMusician of Rock and Alternative\n\nA.k.a.

Her musical influences include jazz, gospel, pop, noise, folk and even classical music. She is a founding member of the band Toto. In her younger years, she was a substitute dancer for the cast of Broadway\u2019s \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d and as a teenager, she appeared in the movie \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d\n\nTorry Castellano has been described as a \u201cpopular musician\u201d due to her versatile talents as a percussionist, singer/songwriter and actress. Torry began playing drums when she was young and continued playing them until she was twenty-one years old. Torry then played bass in many early rock bands before going solo and discovering her true singing talent. She has been described as a very talented \u201cfolk artist\u201d due to her interesting vocal style which incorporates a range of tones and pitch variations. Torry has also opened for numerous popular musicians including George Harrison, Eric Clapton and Johnny Jenkins.\n\nTorry Castellano has made twenty-four studio albums and twelve self-written songs. One of her most popular songs \u201cDonna Jane\u201d from her album \u201cTroublemaker\u201d was inspired by the death of her friend and fellow musician Patti LaBelle. This song became a huge hit for Torry and is still currently being used in many schools and churches to this day. Torry Castellano also appeared in the movie \u201cThe Social Network\u201d as an attractive and sexy lead character.\n\nTorry Castellano was previously a professional volleyball player. As a player, she was known for her powerful forearms, arm swings, and powerful knees. She lost her ability to play volleyball due to carpal tunnel syndrome, but she has retained her love of sports and is still as passionate as ever. Torry has also drummed for some of the best known American percussionists such as Les Claypool, Paul McCartney, Pino Palladino, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea of the Bluegrass, Dave Matthews and Yngwie Malmsteen. Torry states that she currently plays drums professionally for about four hours each day.\n\nTorry states that she is presently working as a freelance writer and internet marketer. Her most recent endeavor has been developing a website and blog for her personal financial and career growth as an artist and musician. The website and blog features articles on topics such as how to make money as a musician and what type of music licensing she holds. It also features a section on her views on the global economics and power structures that are currently affecting the world of music today. In addition, she also states that she intends to develop her own music distribution company and offers her musicians and publishers songwriting and recording deals through her company.\n\nTorry states that she is not exactly sure how old she is since at this time in her life she is in the early twenties, but she feels that since she is only a few years older than my son, she might be a few decades older. She states that she has always had long brown hair that is tied back. During our online interview, I noticed that Torry wears glasses and has light skin. This is typical for a musician that has achieved worldwide recognition."}], "Torry Castellano is known for being the drummer for The Donnas.": [{"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/musicradar-podcast-torry-castellano-142129", "page_content": "Since forming in 1993 to perform for an eighth-grade lunchtime talent show, The Donnas (Brett Anderson, vocals; Maya Ford, bass; Allison Robertson, guitar; and Torry Castellano, drums) have been handing it back to the boys big-time with their kick-ass, let's-party brand of rock and roll.\n\nBig breaks came easy for the California-based band. Before they graduated high school, they had toured Japan. A deal with Lookout! Records led to the band signing to Atlantic in 2001. Albums such as 2002's Spend The Night and 2004's Gold Medal garnered critical raves and won the band fans at all points on the globe, but not enough of them to maintain a major-label deal. Unbowed, The Donnas formed their own Purple Feather Records label, and in 2007 released their most bracing album yet, Bitchin'.\n\nThrough it all, the driving force behind The Donnas is Torry Castellano. The petite powerhouse rocks her Pearl kit with an almost tectonic force. Perhaps the reason she plays with such passion is the fact that she's lucky to be playing at all: In 2003 an acute case of wrist tendinitis (caused by holding her sticks wrong) almost ended her musical career. But through surgery, physical therapy, and a new approach to drumming, Castellano is back on the throne, and better than she's ever been.\n\nMusicRadar caught up with Torry Castellano backstage for a podcast interview before a recent Donnas show in New York City. Listen to the podcast below, and there's more information on The Donnas' official website.\n\nPart one - Torry discusses the band's formation, growing pains, and being tagged as 'punk.'\n\nPart two - She talks about maturing musically, her almost career-ending tendinitis, and future plans."}, {"url": "https://stanfordmag.org/contents/drummer-hits-the-books", "page_content": "When the day arrived last summer for new transfer students to visit Stanford, the sense of anticipation grew. \"I am looking forward to meeting the former rock star,\" an admissions staffer told Sally Mentzer, who coordinates the advising program for transfers.\n\nAs Mentzer notes, that was perfectly accurate, yet someone still could have gotten the wrong impression. To meet Torry Castellano, whose career as a drummer has spanned recording studios, the set of Saturday Night Live and stages in Barcelona, Paris and Tokyo, is to realize how unconcerned she is with popular acclaim.\n\nIn fact, Castellano, '13, was somewhat intimidated by her new surroundings, and she recognized similar feelings among the other 18 transfers. To help cope, she tried to bring them together for karaoke, but then found a better lure: dinner at Mom's. \"Pasta and meatballs,\" explains Castellano. \"About 15 of them were there.\"\n\nMom is a Palo Altan, as was Castellano when she was growing up with the three female friends who became her bandmates, the Donnas. A pop-punk act reminiscent of the Runaways, an all-girl band of the 1970s, the Donnas have been recording and touring since the mid '90s. Plans were announced at the start of the year for a new album, but it will have to be made without Castellano. The victim of uncorrectable shoulder pain from tendonitis and repetitive strain injury, Castellano became one of rock's most youthful retirees last year. She turned 32 in January.\n\nShe didn't surrender her drumsticks easily. But months of rest hadn't worked. Over time, another part of her Los Angeles-based life grew in importance. She had enrolled at Santa Monica College\u2014she took one final online when the band was on tour in Brazil\u2014and began giving serious thought to full-time studies at a university, where she could reinvent herself. She applied to various schools that seemed like reasonable objectives, plus Stanford.\n\n\"I really didn't think I was going to get in,\" says Castellano. \"When I got the acceptance email, I was shaking. And I didn't totally trust it, because it was email. I was crying. I had my mom read it.\"\n\nNo matter how accomplished transfers are before arriving on the Farm\u2014Castellano's contingent includes a former Green Beret, a former radio DJ and a former professional dancer\u2014there's enormous apprehension that comes with entering such an imposing environment. \"That's particularly true,\" says Mentzer, \"if they are transferring from a community or junior college,\" as Castellano did.\n\nWith the Donnas (www.thedonnas.com), Castellano shared a juicy image: \"Pabst-swilling, sex-crazed party animals\" was how a Los Angeles Times writer once distilled it. In reality, the article went on to disclose, they appeared to be \"just regular girls\" who liked iced tea, candy and watching TV.\n\nLooking back, Castellano says, \"There have been many crazy nights, many crazy tours. I don't want to kill the fantasy image of rock 'n' roll life. But there's also a lot of work that goes into being successful, and I was always involved in the business decisions.\"\n\nThe fall quarter at Stanford was partly about solitary nights of keeping up with assignments. But the rest of the experience, in class or almost any conversation on campus, played to her like an intellectual concert. \"Politics, or religion, or philosophy. Everything!\" Her first set of grades: an A and two A-minuses.\n\nBy winter quarter, she had declared a major in political science. That made sense, she said, because she now is thinking ahead\u2014drum roll, please\u2014about possibly applying to law school."}, {"url": "https://www.moderndrummer.com/2004/05/torry-castellano/", "page_content": "Torry Castellano of The Donnas\n\nEach member of The Donnas has all just barely passed the mile marker of twenty-one years old.

A few years ago after a bout with tendinitis rendered Torry out of commission for several months. After touring for over a year on her pop-punk band\u2019s 2002 release, Spend The Night, Castellano\u2019s problems became so severe that she had to undergo surgery and physical rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to physical therapy, they called it \u2018the grip of death,\u2019\u201d Torry recalls. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh no, you do that?\u2019 But it all ended up being really good. I learned a different technique, and I think I\u2019m a better drummer because of it. It\u2019s all about letting the stick do the work. That way you\u2019re not going crazy, holding the stick so tightly that you\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d\n\nBesides applying the new technique, Torry began doing warm-up exercises and reconfigured her four-piece Pearl kit. Since then she\u2019s successfully (read: pain-free) recorded and toured behind two more Donnas albums, including 2004\u2019s Gold Medal and their latest, the arena rock\u2013flavored Bitchin\u2019.\n\nCastellano credits producer Jay Ruston (Meatloaf, Polyphonic Spree) for helping to shape her performance on this latest recording. \u201cHe definitely encouraged that four-on-the-floor type beat,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich was a really good direction because I love that beat. But I was asking, \u2018Should I really put it in more than one song?\u2019 He was like, \u2018It sounds great.\u2019 And when we play those songs live, the rhythm really gets into people.\u201d\n\nWaleed Rashidi"}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/torry-castellano.html", "page_content": "About\n\nFormer drummer with the rock group The Donnas, the band known for the single \"Take it Off.\"\n\nBefore Fame\n\nShe attended Santa Monica College and Stanford University; her major was political science and she decided to go on to law school.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe had to prematurely retire from The Donnas as a result of a shoulder injury.\n\nFamily Life\n\nShe grew up in San Francisco.\n\nAssociated With\n\nShe is a fan of Jason Schwartzman."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/torry.castellano/1793915", "page_content": "Torry Castellano\n\nmusician\n\nJanuary 8, 1979 San Francisco, California, United States of America\n\nShe met future bandmates Maya Ford, Brett Anderson and Allison Robertson in junior high school.
