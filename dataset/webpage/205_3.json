McIntosh\n\nPublic Historian\n\nBrewminate\n\nIntroduction\n\nHephaestion (c.356 BCE \u2013 October 324 BCE), son of Amyntor, was an ancient Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \u201cby far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\u201d[3] This relationship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nHis military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander\u2019s ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia.\n\nWhen he died suddenly at Ecbatana[4] around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon.[5] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion\u2019s memory.\n\nYouth and Education\n\nThe emblema of the Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic, along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander\u2019s companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[7] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201cone day when Alexander was 15 years old \u2026 sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa \u2026 and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[8] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[9] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[10] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his alleged pupil to send letters throughout Alexander\u2019s expanding empire to converse with him.\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[11] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[12] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.\n\nCareer\n\nOverview\n\nSharing Alexander\u2019s upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II\u2019s Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander\u2019s Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander\u2019s other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\nWars in Persia\n\nThe Battle of Issus by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1529. / Photo courtesy Alte Pinakothek, Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \u201cauthorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office\u201d.[13] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion\u2019s choice.\n\nAfter the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[14] Hephaestion\u2019s task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.\n\nPlutarch, while writing about Alexander\u2019s correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[15] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens\u2019 inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \u201cIf he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\u201d[15]\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander\u2019s governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \u201cIt is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus\u2019 reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\u201d[16]\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion\u2019s rank. He is called the \u201ccommander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes)\u201d.[17] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[18][19]\n\nAfter Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \u201cThe following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\u201d[20] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion\u2019s tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[21]\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas\u2019 former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander\u2019s policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip\u2019s older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[22] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[23]\n\nExpedition into India\n\nA painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes. / Photo courtesy The Pipe Organ Project, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion\u2019s orders were to \u201ctake over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing\u201d.[24] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[25]\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion\u2019s, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[26] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[27] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[28] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \u201chonorary trierarchs\u201d, indicating his leading position at this time.[29] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion\u2019s section marched \u201cfive days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which \u2026 might be rapidly moving forward\u201d.[30] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[31] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[32]\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[33] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[34] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander\u2019s de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \u201cto command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held\u201d.[35]\n\nRelationships\n\nAlexander\n\nThe family of Darius in front of Alexander with Hephaestion behind him, by Justus Sustermans and preserved in the Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer. In this picture we can see Hephaestion point out Alexander. / Photo courtesy Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer, Wikimedia Commons\n\nLittle is known of Hephaestion\u2019s personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[3] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander\u2019s becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages.\n\nTheir tutor Aristotle described friendship in general as \u201cone soul abiding in two bodies\u201d.[36] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the Battle of Issus. Diodorus,[37] Arrian[38] and Curtius[39] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying \u201cYou were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\u201d[39] Their affection for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander\u2019s mother, Olympias, said \u201cyou know that Alexander means more to us than anything\u201d.[40] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion\u2019s death, described him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life\u201d.[41] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \u201cAlexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\u201d[42]\n\nAside from their strong personal bond, theirs was also a working partnership in that all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. It is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion\u2019s career, of Alexander\u2019s constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[43] a lack of sympathy with Alexander\u2019s aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[44] and of sheer incompetence.[45] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.\n\nHephaestion played a full part in Alexander\u2019s regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes, and plans. Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets;[46] and Plutarch describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented.[47] According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander\u2019s first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch-bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander\u2019s policies as Alexander\u2019s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one among the Macedonians.\n\nBy the time they returned to Persia, Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander\u2019s second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship as follows: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\u201d,[48] and \u201cAt the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\u201d[49]\n\nBusts of Alexander (left) and Hephaestion (right). / Photo courtesy Getty Museum, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers, though hardly any of Alexander\u2019s extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refers to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander\u2019s friend,[51][52] consistent with Hephaestion\u2019s epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[53] It has been observed, however, that the ancient Greek word for friend \u201c\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\u201d (Philos) was also applied to lovers in the homo-erotic or sexual sense. [54]\n\nFurthermore, Arrian and Plutarch describe the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with the Homeric figures of Achilles and Patroclus. At the onset of the campaign in Asia, Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland and Hephaestion did the same with the tomb of Patroclus,[55] and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes.[56] Arrian and Plutarch draw no conclusions from this; however, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being in a homosexual relationship as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and Patroclus had sexual relations. Martin and Blackwell further suggest this concept was theorized by unspecified \u201clater authors\u201d,[51] who include, however, such eminent writers as Aeschylus[57] and Plato[58] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s time. Attic orator Aeschines, who was contemporary with them (albeit somewhat older), explicitly addressed the question in these terms: \u201c\u2026Homer, though he often speaks of Patroclus and Achilles, is silent about love and gives no name to their friendship; he thinks that the remarkable strength of their affection is obvious to the cultivated among his audience.\u201d[59] Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn from Martin and Blackwell\u2019s: \u201cIt was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion\u2019s first mention in Alexander\u2019s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander\u2019s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\u201d[60]\n\nHephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time in which, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of htheir time.[51] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others[61] show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. For the Greeks \u201chomosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\u201d.[62] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes), and the other was the beloved (eromenos).\n\nThe former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \u201cRumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\u201d[63] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \u201cAlexander laid a garland on Achilles\u2019 tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus\u2019, indicating that he was Alexander\u2019s eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\u201d[64]\n\nHowever, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \u201cdescendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry\u201d.[65] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[66] Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue, describes an occasion when Hephaestion\u2019s conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander\u2019s tent all night,[67] and Plutarch describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander\u2019s letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion\u2019s lips.[68] There also exists a letter, spuriously attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, heavily hinting at Alexander\u2019s yielding to \u201cHephaestion\u2019s thighs\u201d.[69]\n\nNo other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. As Andrew Chugg says, \u201cit is surely incredible that Alexander\u2019s reaction to Hephaestion\u2019s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable\u201d.[70] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cflung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions\u201d.[71]\n\nOthers\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAmong Alexander\u2019s other officers, it is possible that Hephaestion was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander\u2019s effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[72] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[73]\n\nHowever, outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command, he was not universally admired. This is clear from Arrian\u2019s comment about Alexander\u2019s grief: \u201cAll writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\u201d[74]\n\nYet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the Western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[75] mentions a quarrel with Alexander\u2019s secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[76] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion\u2019s even greater closeness.\n\nIn only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander\u2019s policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \u201cFor this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows \u2026\u201d[77] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander\u2019s wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander\u2019s own second wife Stateira.[2] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death, eight months after Hephaestion\u2019s, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[78]\n\nFor Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cwanted to be uncle to Hephaestion\u2019s children\u201d.[79] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[79]\n\nDeath and Funeral\n\nDeath\n\nIn spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[80] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice: As soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast, consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[81]\n\nPiecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion\u2019s fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \u201cThis sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\u201d[82] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.\n\nFollowing Hephaestion\u2019s death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[83][84] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion; this was later done.[84]\n\nHephaestion\u2019s death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says that \u201cAlexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable\u201d and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[85] Besides the account reported in a previous section about the immediate manifestations of despair by Alexander on his friend\u2019s body, Arrian also relates that \u201cuntil the third day after Hephaestion\u2019s death, Alexander neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning,\u201d and that he had the doctor, Glaucias, hanged for his lack of care.[86] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[87] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[88] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles\u2019 last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre:Thus o\u2019er Patroclus while the hero prayed,on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:And now the sun had set upon their woe.[89]\n\nAnother hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion, and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit with Achilles\u2019 killing of \u201ctwelve high-born youths\u201d beside Patroclus\u2019 funeral pyre.[85]\n\nAlexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire and \u201cmany of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man\u201d.[90] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion\u2019s place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \u201cwished Hephaestion\u2019s name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion\u2019s Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion\u2019s image continued to be carried before it\u201d.[91]\n\nMessengers were sent to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \u201cfrom that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero\u2019s rites\u201d.[92] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion\u2019s memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \u201cTo the Hero Hephaestion\u201d.[93][94]\n\nFuneral\n\nHephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents, about $200,000,000 or $ 240,000,000 in the early 21st century\u2019s money.[95] Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion\u2019s friend Perdiccas.[87] At Babylon, funeral games were held in Hephaestion\u2019s honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[96] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \u201cas this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation\u201d, to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[97]\n\nThe pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[98] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death.[99]\n\nOne final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[100]\n\nBased on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb in northern Greece, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325\u2013300 BC.[101]\n\nAppendix\n\nEndnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nOriginally published by Wikipedia, 03.30.2003, under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}, {"url": "https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv2597910/", "page_content": "\uff08\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e3b\u89c2\u610f\u8bd1\uff0c\u5982\u6709\u8c2c\u8bef\u671b\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9b\u540c\u597d\u53c2\u8003\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u6709\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u79c1\u804a\u83b7\u53d6\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u539f\u7248\u6743\u5c5e\u4e8e\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\uff0c\u65e0\u6388\u6743\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\n\n\u539f\u7f51\u5740\uff1ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestion#Modern_sources\n\n\n\n\n\nHephaestion\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\n\n\n\n\n\nHephaestion (Ancient Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Hephaist\u00edon; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was an ancient Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great.

A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.\n\n\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u519b\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5927\u5e1d\u8d34\u8eab\u8fd1\u536b\u56e2\u7684\u4e00\u5458\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ed6\u4e5f\u6307\u6325\u7740\u8fd1\u536b\u9a91\u58eb\u56e2\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u8fdc\u5f81\u4e9a\u6d32\u7684\u5341\u5e74\u6218\u5f79\u4e2d\u80a9\u8d1f\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u804c\u8d23\u3002\u5305\u62ec\u5916\u4ea4\u804c\u8d23\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6cb3\u6d41\u7684\u6865\u6881\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u56f4\u57ce\u6218\u5f79\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u6b96\u6c11\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u4fee\u5efa\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u519b\u4eba\uff0c\u4e00\u4f4d\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u5916\u4ea4\u5b98\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u8fd8\u548c\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u9f50\u8bfa\u514b\u96f7\u8482\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u5730\u652f\u6301\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5bf9\u5e0c\u814a\u4eba\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\u7684\u6c11\u65cf\u878d\u5408\u4e3e\u63aa\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6b63\u5f0f\u4efb\u547d\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u3001\u5e1d\u56fd\u5343\u592b\u957f\u4e00\u804c\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5c06\u5fb7\u8389\u6bd4\u5a23\u4e1d\u5ac1\u7ed9\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\uff0c\u4f7f\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u6210\u4e3a\u7687\u5ba4\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u800c\u5fb7\u8389\u6bd4\u5a23\u4e1d\u7684\u59d0\u59d0\u5ac1\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4efb\u59bb\u5b50\uff0c\u4e24\u4f4d\u516c\u4e3b\u90fd\u662f\u6ce2\u65af\u5e1d\u56fd\u56fd\u738b\u5927\u6d41\u58eb\u4e09\u4e16\u7684\u5973\u513f\u3002\u5f53\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b8932\u5c81\u5728\u57c3\u514b\u5df4\u5766\u90a3\u57ce\u7a81\u7136\u53bb\u4e16\u65f6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u60b2\u75db\u6b32\u7edd\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6d3e\u4eba\u524d\u5f80\u897f\u74e6\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u57c3\u53ca\u57ce\u5e02\uff09\u8be2\u95ee\u795e\u8c15\uff1a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5c06\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u4f9b\u5165\u795e\u5e99\uff1f\u56e0\u6b64\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4ee5\u82f1\u96c4\u7684\u8363\u8000\u8eab\u4efd\u5f97\u4ee5\u4f9b\u5949\u5728\u795e\u5e99\u4e2d\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u88ab\u706b\u4e86\uff0c\u9aa8\u7070\u9001\u56de\u6545\u4e61\u5df4\u6bd4\u4f26\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u53bb\u4e16\u516b\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u8ffd\u968f\u4ed6\u800c\u53bb\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6b7b\u524d\u8fd8\u5728\u8ba1\u5212\u7740\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u4fee\u5efa\u4e0d\u673d\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891\u3002\n\nYouth and education\u9752\u5e74\u65f6\u671f\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u7ecf\u5386\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise\uff08\u7b80\u660e\u7684\uff09 biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\n\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u786e\u5207\u5e74\u9f84\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u6089\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4f20\u8bb0\u8bb0\u8f7d\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u6b7b\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u4e4b\u524d\u8fd9\u4e00\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u8bb0\u8f7d\u4ed6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e4b\u4e2d\u518d\u63d0\u62d4\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5b66\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u548c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u4eff\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u51fa\u751f\u4e8e\u516c\u5143\u524d356\u5e74\u3002\u636e\u8bf4\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5728\u516c\u5143\u524d343\u5e74\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u540d\u7537\u4f8d\u8005\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u8d35\u65cf\u4e2d\u9752\u6625\u671f\u7537\u5b69\u6240\u5171\u6709\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bab\u5ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5458\uff0c\u4ed6\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u3002\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201c... one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201dThat Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle. Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences. The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.\n\n\u552f\u4e00\u7559\u5b58\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5927\u5e1d\u7684\u8da3\u95fb\u8f76\u4e8b\u90fd\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5e74\u8f7b\u65f6\u5411\u4ed6\u732e\u6bb7\u52e4\u7684\u6d6a\u6f2b\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u8a00\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u4e00\u65e5\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u592715\u5c81\u65f6\u2026\u2026\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e00\u8d77\u822a\u884c\uff0c\u4ed6\u5f88\u5feb\u5230\u8fbe\u4e86\u6bd4\u8428\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u610f\u5927\u5229\u57ce\u5e02\uff09\u2026\u2026\u4ed6\u548c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e00\u8d77\u6f2b\u6b65\u8857\u5934\u3002\u201d\u8fd9\u91cc\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5e74\u9f84\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u572815\u5c81\u65f6\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u7c73\u8036\u8428\u57ce\u63a5\u53d7\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u7684\u6559\u5bfc\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u63d0\u5230\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u540d\u5b57\u7684\u662f\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u7684\u4e66\u4fe1\u76ee\u5f55\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e66\u4fe1\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0d\u590d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u65e2\u7136\u88ab\u8bb0\u5f55\u5230\u4e86\u5b98\u65b9\u76ee\u5f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5b83\u4e00\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u67d0\u79cd\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u7ed9\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6269\u5c55\u5e1d\u56fd\u7248\u56fe\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u8fd8\u4e0d\u95f4\u65ad\u7684\u7ed9\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5199\u4fe1\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon. The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be due to the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince. Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\n\u5728\u7c73\u8036\u8428\u63a5\u53d7\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6f58\u8fbe\u6d1b\u65af\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5bc6\u53cb\u906d\u5230\u6d41\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u8bd5\u56fe\u5047\u626e\u7537\u4ec6\u5931\u8d25\u540e\uff0c\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u4e8c\u4e16\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\uff09\u5c06\u6258\u52d2\u5bc6\u3001\u5c3c\u963f\u5e93\u65af\u3001\u54c8\u5e15\u9c81\u65af\u3001\u827e\u5229\u5409\u4e9a\u65af\u548c\u62c9\u4fc4\u58a8\u51ac\u6d41\u653e\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u6ca1\u6709\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\uff0c\u906d\u5230\u6d41\u653e\u7684\u90fd\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5e74\u957f\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\uff0c\u827e\u5229\u5409\u4e9a\u65af\u5c31\u6bd4\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u738b\u5b50\u8981\u592724\u5c81\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u540c\u9f84\u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ed6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8981\u6bd4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u4e3a\u6210\u719f\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u8981\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u6545\u800c\u5a01\u80c1\u4e5f\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u4e0d\u8bba\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5728\u6574\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5176\u4ed6\u7ae5\u5e74\u73a9\u4f34\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u6d41\u653e\u3002\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.\n\n\u867d\u7136\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u7ae5\u5e74\u7ecf\u5386\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7ecf\u5386\u6709\u7740\u975e\u5e38\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4ed6\u540e\u534a\u751f\u7684\u8bb0\u8f7d\u5374\u8bed\u7109\u4e0d\u8be6\u3002\u4ed6\u548c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u53cb\u8c0a\u6301\u7eed\u7ec8\u8eab\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728\u4f69\u62c9\u6cd5\u5ead\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u7f57\u9a6c\u7b2c\u4e09\u884c\u653f\u90e8\u95e8\u9996\u5e9c\uff09\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u804c\u4f4d\u4e00\u6837\u3002\u4ed6\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4e9a\u6d32\u548c\u5e0c\u814a\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u541b\u738b\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u666f\u5149\u660e\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u540c\u6837\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5438\u5f15\u7740\u963f\u660e\u6258\u5c14\u4e4b\u5b50\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u9760\u8fd1\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c06\u6765\u67d0\u4e00\u5929\u6210\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5e1d\u56fd\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6b64\u4e8e\u56fd\u738b\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6743\u529b\u62e5\u6709\u8005\u3002\n\nCareer\u751f\u6daf\n\nSharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander's other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\n\u5728\u548c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5171\u540c\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u751f\u6daf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5728\u5e74\u5e7c\u65f6\u5c31\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u6218\u6597\u548c\u9a91\u9a6c\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u519b\u4e8b\u884c\u4e3a\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6267\u653f\u671f\u95f4\u4e0e\u8272\u96f7\u65af\u4eba\u7684\u6218\u4e89\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u662f\u516c\u5143\u524d342\u5e74\u7edf\u7387\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u4e8c\u4e16\u7684\u519b\u961f\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u591a\u7459\u6cb3\u6218\u5f79\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53c2\u4e0e\u516c\u5143\u524d338\u5e74\u5728\u4ed6\u9752\u5e74\u65f6\u671f\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u7684\u5580\u7f57\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6218\u5f79\u3002\u5728\u516c\u5143\u524d335\u5e74\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u591a\u7459\u6cb3\u6218\u5f79\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u5e76\u672a\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u519b\u5b98\u540d\u5355\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u53ca\u6ce2\u65af\u519b\u961f\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u3002\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5176\u4ed6\u540c\u9f84\u4f19\u4f34\u548c\u5bc6\u53cb\u7684\u540d\u5b57\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u664b\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u6765\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u4f9d\u9760\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u529f\u7ee9\u8d62\u5f97\u7684\u3002\n\nHephaestion's career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \"... authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office.\" Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener.

Hephaestion's task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength.

The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens' inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \"If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\"\n\n\u5728\u666e\u9c81\u5854\u514b\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u5e0c\u814a\u5386\u53f2\u5bb6\uff09\u5199\u7ed9\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u4fe1\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u63d0\u5230\u8fc7\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7ed9\u4ed6\u7684\u56de\u4fe1\u4e2d\u8868\u660e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u53e6\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd9\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u57c3\u53ca\u5883\u5185\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5fb7\u9c81\u00b7\u67e5\u683c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u548c\u4ed6\u5bf9\u8230\u961f\u7684\u6307\u6325\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u96c5\u5178\u7684\u5916\u4ea4\u6709\u5173\u3002\u4ed6\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u66fe\u4e0e\u96c5\u5178\u8d35\u65cf\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u96c5\u5178\u8d35\u65cf\u8bd5\u56fe\u4fc3\u6210\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u548c\u5fb7\u6469\u65af\u68af\u5c3c\uff08\u53e4\u4ee3\u5e0c\u814a\u7684\u96c4\u8fa9\u5bb6\uff09\u7684\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u65af\u5df4\u8fbe\u56fd\u738b\u963f\u5409\u65af\u53db\u4e71\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u67e5\u683c\u6240\u8a00\u201c\u5982\u679c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u80fd\u591f\u529d\u670d\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u5fb7\u6469\u65af\u68af\u5c3c\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5728\u5f53\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u52bf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c31\u80a9\u8d1f\u4e86\u633d\u6551\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u738b\u56fd\u5728\u5e0c\u814a\u7684\u5371\u9669\u5c40\u52bf\u2014\u2014\u963b\u6b62\u963f\u5409\u65af\u7684\u53db\u4e71\u8513\u5ef6\u5230\u96c5\u5178\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u76df\u53cb\u2014\u2014\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u3002\u201d\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander's governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \"It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus' reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\"\n\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u662f\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4ece\u57c3\u53ca\u7387\u9886\u5148\u9063\u90e8\u961f\u8fdb\u5165\u5e7c\u53d1\u62c9\u5e95\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df\u3002\u6ce2\u65af\u738b\u5927\u6d41\u58eb\u6d3e\u9063\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u524d\u5f80\u5bf9\u5cb8\u4fee\u5efa\u6865\u6881\u3002\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u6307\u6325\u5b98\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5143\u524d331\u5e74\u7684\u5361\u5854\u7c73\u57c3\u62c9\u6218\u5f79\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c06\u6ce2\u65af\u5373\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u80dc\u5229\u62f1\u624b\u76f8\u8ba9\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u4ed6\u6210\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u5df4\u6bd4\u4f26\u603b\u7763\u3002\u7f57\u5bbe\u00b7\u83b1\u6069\u00b7\u798f\u514b\u65af\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5728\u8c08\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u201c\u53ef\u4ee5\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u5361\u5854\u7c73\u57c3\u62c9\u6218\u5f79\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u5e7c\u53d1\u62c9\u5e95\u6cb3\u4e24\u5cb8\u80dc\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u7684\u5b98\u590d\u539f\u804c\u4e0e\u5176\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bbd\u5b8f\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u5148\u7ea6\u5b9a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u201d\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion's rank.

One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\" Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.\n\n\u5728\u5361\u5854\u7c73\u57c3\u62c9\u6218\u5f79\u540e\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8ba8\u597d\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u5728\u5df4\u6bd4\u4f26\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u591c\u665a\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fa\u8eab\u9ad8\u8d35\u7684\u5973\u4eba\u5fc5\u987b\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u8df3\u821e\u53d6\u4e50\u3002\u5e93\u5c14\u4fee\u65af\u89e3\u91ca\u9053\uff1a\u201c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\uff08\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u4fd8\u864f\u5e26\u5230\u5bab\u5ef7\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e00\u4e00\u67e5\u9a8c\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u8840\u7edf\u3002\u201d\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d35\u65cf\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u4e0d\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u5f85\u9047\u5e76\u4e14\u60f3\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4ef6\u4e8b\u3002\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u673a\u667a\u548c\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u575a\u5b9a\u4e0d\u79fb\u4e5f\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6240\u501a\u4ed7\u7684\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u573a\u9488\u5bf9\u4ed6\u7684\u523a\u6740\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u9ad8\u7ea7\u519b\u5b98\u83f2\u6d1b\u5854\u65af\u4e5f\u88ab\u5377\u5165\u6b64\u4e8b\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u3001\u514b\u62c9\u7279\u9c81\u65af\u548c\u79d1\u7eb3\u65af\u575a\u6301\u6309\u7167\u60ef\u4f8b\u5b9e\u65bd\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus. The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais[dubious \u2013 discuss] rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.\n\n\u516c\u5143\u524d330\u5e74\uff0c\u83f2\u6d1b\u5854\u65af\u88ab\u5904\u6b7b\u540e\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u88ab\u4efb\u547d\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u2014\u2014\u548c\u514b\u96f7\u5854\u65af\u4e00\u8d77\u2014\u2014\u4ee3\u66ff\u4e86\u83f2\u6d1b\u5854\u65af\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cc\u91cd\u4efb\u547d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6ee1\u8db3\u519b\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u50cf\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u575a\u5b9a\u4e0d\u79fb\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u6307\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\u548c\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u4eba\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff09\u653f\u7b56\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u8ffd\u968f\u8fc7\u524d\u738b\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u7684\u65e7\u90e8\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6028\u6068\u5e76\u65e0\u60c5\u7684\u5bf9\u5f85\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\uff0c\u50cf\u514b\u96f7\u5854\u65af\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u3002\u9a91\u5175\u56e2\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e26\u9886\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u80dc\u5229\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u585e\u897f\u4e9a\u7684\u6e38\u7267\u6c11\u65cf\u548c\u9547\u538b\u53db\u4e71\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u516c\u5143\u524d328\u5e74\u6625\u5929\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6218\u5f79\u3002\u519b\u961f\u4ece\u5927\u590f\uff08Balkh\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u5965\u514b\u65af\u548c\u5854\u7eb3\u65af\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c71\u8c37\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e94\u5217\u7eb5\u961f[\u6b64\u5904\u5b58\u7591]\uff0c\u6e21\u6cb3\u5e73\u5b9a\u7d22\u683c\u5e95\u4e9a\u90a3\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7387\u9886\u4e00\u5217\u7eb5\u961f\u5230\u8fbe\u9a6c\u62c9\u574e\u8fbe\u540e\uff0c\u53c8\u9a6c\u4e0a\u7740\u624b\u5efa\u7acb\u5c45\u4f4f\u70b9\u3002\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"... take over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing.\" They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.\n\n\u516c\u5143\u524d327\u5e74\u6625\uff0c\u519b\u961f\u8fdb\u5165\u5370\u5ea6\u540e\u5175\u5206\u4e24\u8def\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7387\u5175\u5f80\u5317\u8fdb\u5165\u65af\u74e6\u7279\u5c71\u8c37\uff0c\u800c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u548c\u4f69\u5c14\u72c4\u5361\u65af\u7387\u9886\u5927\u534a\u519b\u961f\u7a7f\u8fc7\u5f00\u4f2f\u5c14\u5c71\u53e3\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u662f\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u6cbf\u9014\u6240\u6709\u5730\u65b9\u901a\u8fc7\u6b66\u529b\u5360\u9886\u6216\u8005\u534f\u8bae\u540c\u76df\uff0c\u6cbf\u9014\u505a\u597d\u5230\u8fbe\u5370\u5ea6\u6cb3\u540e\u8de8\u8d8a\u8fb9\u5883\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u201d\u5728\u964c\u751f\u7684\u5730\u57df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5730\u7406\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5fc5\u987b\u53ca\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u826f\u906d\u9047\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u5230\u8fbe\u5370\u5ea6\u6cb3\u7554\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u8fc7\u4e4b\u5883\u7686\u4e3a\u81e3\u5c5e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56f4\u653bPeuceolatis\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u53ea\u5728\u8be5\u8bcd\u6761\u6709\u8be5\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e94\u4e3a\u5730\u540d\uff09\uff0c\u519b\u961f\u82b1\u8d39\u4e86\u4e09\u5341\u5929\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e76\u5efa\u9020\u8fc7\u6cb3\u7684\u6e21\u8239\u3002\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\n\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6218\u4e89\u4e2d\u5c06\u519b\u961f\u548c\u6307\u6325\u6743\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u519b\u5b98\u624b\u4e2d\u3002\u4e3e\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u524d\u51e0\u5468\uff0c\u514b\u62c9\u7279\u9c81\u65af\u53d7\u547d\u7387\u9886\u4e00\u652f\u5927\u519b\u9547\u538b\u6700\u540e\u4e24\u5904\u5927\u590f\u53db\u4e71\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u5207\u5f62\u52bf\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4ed6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u9700\u8981\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f9d\u9760\u53c8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u4e8b\u4e8b\u6307\u793a\u7684\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u3002\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC). Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes. Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \"honorary trierarchs\", indicating his leading position at this time. On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion's section marched \"... five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward\".

After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.

He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.\n\nDuring his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River.\n\nAlexander endeavored to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi: Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.\n\nAlexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history."}, {"url": "https://www.dafato.com/en/history/biographies/hephaestion", "page_content": "Hephaestion\n\nEyridiki Sellou | Jul 11, 2022\n\nSummary Hephaistos, son of Amintore (Pella, c. 356 B.C.E. - Ecbatana, 324 B.C.E.), was an ancient Macedonian nobleman and general, though of probable Athenian ancestry, in the army of Alexander the Great.He was \"by far the dearest of all the king's friends, reared as equals with him and keeper of all his secrets.\" Their intense relationship, for several sources a true love affair, lasted a lifetime and was compared by others, but before that by the two concerned themselves, to the mythical one between Achilles and Patroclus. In particular, among contemporary authors, one of the most internationally credited is Robin Lane Fox, historian, professor emeritus of classical studies at Oxford University and biographer of Alexander, who writes, \"Hephaestion was the one whom Alexander loved, and for the rest of their lives their relationship remained as intimate as to this day it is irretrievable: Alexander fell only once, the philosophers of the cynical current said long after his death, and it was by Hephaestion's thighs.\" His military career was notable: a member and then head of Alexander the Great's honor guard (the seven somatofylakes), he later went on to command the cavalry of the Etherians and was entrusted with many other prominent tasks throughout the decade of Alexander's Asian campaign, including (and certainly no less important) diplomatic missions, major river-crossing works, sieges, and founding of new settlements of habitation. In addition to his military, engineering and political activities, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Senocrates, and actively supported Alexander's policy aimed at the integration of Greeks and Persians. The king eventually made him his own second-in-command, conferring on him the office of kylarch of the empire, and wanted him a member of the royal family by giving him in marriage Dripetide, younger sister of his second wife Statira II, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. At the time of his sudden death in Ecbatana (today's Hamadan), Alexander was overcome with grief and wished to appeal to the oracle of Zeus-Ammon in the Libyan oasis of Siwa in order to ascribe divine status to his deceased friend, and Hephaestion was consequently honored as a hero. At the time of his own death only eight months later, Alexander was still planning the erection of great monuments to celebrate the memory of his life's companion. Also read, Biographies Spice trade\n\nYouth and education Hephaestion's exact age has not been handed down: no biography of him was ever written probably also due to the fact that Alexander survived him for a very short time, and the other diadoks, hard-pressed to fight over the partitioning of the huge inheritance, had no interest in celebrating anyone other than themselves. According to most scholars, Hephaistion's age must not have been very different from Alexander's, and it is therefore possible to assume that he was born around 356 B.C.E.: it is said that he became a page at the Macedonian court in 343, following the fate common to so many other scions of the aristocracy, and it is therefore likely that his meeting with the future conqueror took place around this time. One of the few anecdotes relating to Hephaistion's youth is owed to the Romance of Alexander, where, in connection with the fabled participation of the future king of Macedonia in the chariot race of the Olympics, we read that \"... one day when Alexander was fifteen years old sailing with Hephaistion, his friend, he reached Pisa with ease . The fact that Alexander's exact age is mentioned provides an additional clue as to Hephaestion's education, since, at that age, Alexander was with his companions in the Macedonian locality of Mieza studying with Aristotle, and, although the son of Amintore is never explicitly mentioned among them, his close friendship with the then fifteen-year-old future king of Macedonia suggests that he too should, in all likelihood, be counted among Aristotle's pupils. Even more significant in this regard is the fact that Hephaistion's name was later included in a list of correspondents of the great philosopher The letters have not come down to us, but the fact that they are quoted in a historical list suggests that their contents must have been of some significance: Hephaistion evidently had received a respectable education and one such as to induce Aristotle to entertain a not easy correspondence with him through the expanding empire of Alexander the Great. A few years after Mieza's lectures, Hephaistion's name does not appear in the list of several of Alexander's friends who were exiled by Philip II of Macedon as a result of the young prince's failed attempt to replace his half-brother Arrideus as a suitor for the hand of the daughter of the lord of Caria, Pixodar: there is to be noted, however, that the exiles, Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigius and Laomedon of Mytilene were generally older than Alexander, Erigius even by about a quarter of a century, while Hephaistion was a contemporary of his age and thus his influence might not have been considered as suspect by Philip. In any case, whatever his views on the whole affair, Hephaestion, like many of Alexander's other childhood companions, was not sent into exile. In conclusion, however, if very little can be reconstructed of Hephaestion's boyhood and education, what is found is worth accrediting what is known of his later life: his friendship with Alexander was long lasting, as was his stay at the court of Pella, where he too shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would later help make Hephaistion son of Amintore one day the most powerful man in Alexander's empire, second only to the king himself. Also read, Biographies Alexander Rodchenko\n\nCareer Having shared the kind of education imparted to Alexander, Hephaistion certainly learned to fight and ride from a very young age and probably had his first taste of military life during Philip II's Danubian campaign in 342 BC, or at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, when he was not even 20 years old, but his name is still not mentioned in the lists of high-ranking officers during the battles of Alexander's Danubian campaign in 335 B.C., or in the first phase of the invasion of Persia (as, for that matter, are those of the king's other youthful friends). The first time Hephaestion's name appears in war reports is on the occasion of a political mission of considerable importance: after the Battle of Issus (333 B.C.), as Alexander proceeded southward along the Phoenician coast, the city of Sidon surrendered to the Macedonian king, and Hephaestion was even given \"...charge to appoint as king the one of the Sidonians whom he considered the most deserving of such a high office.\" He then assumed the appropriate information and selected a man, Abdalonymus, who was indeed of distant royal ancestry, but whose integrity had reduced him to working as a gardener. The popularity of the choice in Sidon and the valor subsequently demonstrated by the chosen one would indeed testify to considerable discernment skills on the part of the young Macedonian. After the siege and overthrow of Tyre (332 B.C.), Alexander gave Hephaistion command of the fleet, with the task of following the coast by heading south to Gaza, their next target, while he himself continued overland at the head of the army. Hephaistion's task was not the easiest, as the one entrusted to him was a regimented fleet made up of the naval craft of a variety of disparate allies that had to be held together with a great deal of patience and energy. The fleet carried the war machines essential for the conduct of the siege, which had to be unloaded by makeshift means, transported over rough terrain, and finally properly reassembled. According to Andrew Chugg, who cites the testimony of Marsyas of Pella, one of Alexander's friends, as reported by Harpocration in the second century CE, and who nonetheless finds substantial confirmation for it in an oration by Aeschines contemporaneous with the events, Hephaestion may then have been involved, during his subsequent stay in Egypt, in a complex diplomatic game, acting as an intermediary between Demosthenes, head of the anti-Macedonian party in Athens, and Alexander. Indeed, he appears to have been approached by a messenger of the Athenian politician for the probable purpose of examining the possibility of some reconciliation. The exact terms of the matter, and Hephaistion's role in it, are not known, but Athens' inactivity during the subsequent war proclaimed by the king of Sparta, Agides III, would seem to argue in favor of a positive outcome to the contacts. Chugg concludes by noting that, \"if Hephaestion succeeded in persuading Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was responsible to a significant degree for saving the situation in Greece for Macedonia by preventing Agides' revolt from spreading to Athens and its allies.\" It is almost certain that, on his return from Egypt, it was Hephaestion who led the Macedonian vanguard sent to build bridges across the Euphrates so as to make passage possible for Alexander's army. Darius III of Persia sent his own satrap, Mazeus, to occupy the opposite bank of the river while the Macedonian genius was at work building the bridges. Mazeo, after abandoning his position on the Euphrates, rather inopinently, and allowing Alexander to cross, would shortly thereafter be, at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 B.C.), that commander of the Persian right wing who threw to the nettles an almost certain victory by abandoning the area he was supposed to hold, and would later become the trusted satrap of Babylon, in the name of Alexander. British historian Robin Lane Fox has good play in advancing the very plausible hypothesis that Hephaistion may have made diplomatic contacts with Mazeus during the Euphrates confrontation to essay his willingness to change sides: \"It is presumable that the battle of Gaugamela was won in part on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazeus' restoration was, rather than an act of magnanimity, a previously agreed compensation.\" It is on the occasion of Gaugamela that Hephaestion's rank is first mentioned as \"...chief of the somatof\u00eclakes\" (\u03c3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, bodyguards) of Alexander. This was not the royal squadron, called the \"\u00e0ghema\" (\u1f05\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1), charged with protecting the king during battles (at the time probably commanded by Cleitus the Black), but a small group of seven close companions of Alexander who were specifically given the honor of fighting alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of the fighting along with Alexander, since Arrian relates that he was wounded, and Curtius Rufus specifies that it was a spear wound in one arm. After Gaugamela there are the first indications of Alexander's willingness to initiate an integration effort with the Persians, and of Hephaistion's agreement with this policy, so unpopular among the Macedonians. In particular, it is recounted that one evening in Babylon, Alexander noticed a local noblewoman as she was being urged, against her dignified reluctance, to perform in a show for the victorious troops. He not only ordered that she be freed and her property returned to her, but \"...on the following day he instructed Hephaistion to have all the prisoners taken to the palace. Here, after examining the nobility of each, he had those who emerged by social background separated from the mass. \"Alexander had noticed that the Persian nobles were being treated with little dignity and wanted to remedy this. That he chose Hephaistion to help him shows that he could rely on his young friend's tact and understanding.However, Alexander could also lean on Hephaistion when it came to bringing firmness and decisiveness to bear. On the occasion of a plot against his life in 330 B.C.E., the possible involvement of a high-ranking official like Philota caused much concern, but it was Hephaestion himself, along with Craterus and Ceno, who insisted that torture, which was customary on such occasions when all the background was to be uncovered, should be carried out, and indeed dealt with it personally. After Philota's execution, Hephaistion, despite having no previous experience in the matter, was appointed commander (Hipparchus)-alongside the experienced Clitus, as second Hipparchus-of the cavalry of the Ethers, a position previously occupied by Philota alone. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two different tendencies that were gaining strength in the army: one, personified by Hephaistion, largely in favor of the integration policy pursued by the king; the other, supported in particular by the veterans of Philip's time and well represented by Cleitus, stubbornly refractory to the Persian world. The cavalry fared well under the new command and showed itself equal to the new tasks given it, from the unusual tactics needed against the Scythian nomads to the initiatives taken in 328 to combat revolts in the steppes of Central Asia. The army moved from Balkh, the capital of Bactria, in five columns, deploying its action through the valleys between the Amu Darya (Osso) and Syr Darya (Iassarte), with the aim of pacifying Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after his arrival in Samarkand (called by the Greeks, Marakanda), he took charge of the colonization of the region. In the spring of 327 B.C.E., the army moved toward India, and Alexander divided his forces, personally leading one part of it north through the Swat Valley (then called, U\u1e0d\u1e0diyana), and entrusting the other to Hephaestion and Perdiccas to lead it through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"...conquer, by force or by diplomacy, all the territories on their march, and, when they reached the Indus, to arrange what was necessary for the crossing.\" They were then in unfamiliar territory, whose political and geographical horizons were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion nevertheless managed to arrive on the Indus after conquering all the territory they crossed, including the city of Puskalavati, which endured a thirty-day siege and whose governor was then routinely put to death as was the rule for those who opposed Macedonian conquest manu militari. Once on the Indus, Hephaestion proceeded to build the boats and bridge necessary for the crossing. Alexander had on repeated occasions the need to divide his forces, and the command was, from time to time, given to several of the highest-ranking officers, but it appears that Hephaistion was chosen when the objectives were not perfectly clear from the outset and Alexander therefore felt the need for someone capable of making autonomous choices, but in accordance with the general needs of the expedition. Hephaestion took part in a memorable cavalry charge in the battle on the Idaspe River (326 B.C.), and then, when the army began its return journey, he was again entrusted with one half of it, including elite troops and two hundred elephants, to lead it overland to the southwest along the banks of the Idaspe itself. The rest of the army, commanded directly by Alexander, traveled by ship, on the river, with a fleet whose construction had been financed by the most eminent courtiers. Arrian places Hephaestion first among these honorary trierarchs, indicating the position of pre-eminence he had now acquired at court. Upon entering hostile territory, after the river fleet had been damaged by the rapids, Alexander decided to divide his forces again, this time into three parts, and Hephaistion was instructed to take the leadership of what was left of the fleet and \"continue the navigation to cut off the fugitives,\" while Alexander would follow overland with the fighting forces, and Ptolemy led, in the rear guard, armies and elephants. In the assault on the fortress of Multan, however, Alexander was very seriously wounded in the chest, with probable lung involvement, and, this time, Hephaistion had to assume de facto command of the expedition at least in the first stage of the journey to the sea along the course of the Indus. Upon reaching the coast, he arranged for the construction of a fortress and port for ships on the river delta (Pattala). Hephaestion followed Alexander in the subsequent disastrous crossing of the Makran Desert in the coastal area of present-day Belucistan, during which the inveterate Macedonian army was severely decimated along with its entire sizeable retinue of civilians, and after their desperate arrival in Susa, he was decorated for his valor. After that, he would never fight again, with only a few months remaining to him by then, and, after rising to the rank of de facto deputy military commander of Alexander, he instead acquired a formal role as deputy to the king in the civilian sphere, incidentally probably much more conducive to him than the military one, and was appointed \"chiliarch\" (Greek term for the Persian hazarapatish) of the empire, a kind of grand vizier, second only to the king. Also read, Biographies Lezgins\n\nPersonal relationships Very little is known about Hephaestion's personal relationships, apart from his exceptionally close relationship with Alexander the Great. The latter was an extraordinary and charismatic figure who had many friends, but none comparable with Hephaistion: theirs was a friendship through and through, one that was forged in boyhood and would later last beyond adolescence, passing unscathed through Alexander's ascension to the throne, the harshness of military campaigns, the blandishments of court life, and even through their marriages. Their old master, Aristotle, described the friendship, speaking of \"...one soul dwelling in two bodies,\" and that they themselves considered their friendship to be such is evidenced by an incident that occurred in the aftermath of the battle of Issus and reported concordantly by Diodorus Siculus. According to their accounts, Alexander and Hephaistion went together to visit the royal family of Darius III that had been captured at the end of the battle, intending to reassure the captive queens of their fate. As they entered the tent, the noblewomen made an act of honor in the Persian manner toward the dashing Hephaestion, very handsome and certainly taller than Alexander, taking him for the king. Immediately put somewhat on notice, the queen mother, Sisigambi, threw herself at Alexander's feet begging forgiveness for the mistake, but the king heartened her by saying, \"You were not mistaken, mother, since he too is Alexander.\" Their mutual affection was in no way kept secret, as is confirmed by their own words. Hephaestion, responding to a letter from Alexander's mother Olympias, had occasion to write, \"... You know that Alexander means more to us than anything else.\" Arrian reports that the king, after Hephaestion's death, called him \"...the friend I valued as my own life.\" Paul Cartledge describes their intimacy by saying, \"Alexander seems in affect to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\" Their friendship also resulted in close operational cooperation; in everything Alexander undertook he found Hephaistion systematically at his side. The two worked very well together, and if one studies Hephaistion's career, one easily finds the trace of Alexander's constant and growing confidence in him. As the expedition to India began, after the generals of the older generation were gone, there were examples among the officers of the new generation of betrayal, of failure to share Alexander's aspirations for a growing integration of the Persians into the army. Repeatedly, when Alexander found himself in need of dividing his forces, he entrusted a part of them to Hephaistion, perhaps flanking him with someone equipped with greater military skills, knowing full well that in him he found a person of unquestionable loyalty, who understood and shared his aspirations from the depths and who, not least, was also capable of carrying out the tasks entrusted to him to a successful conclusion. Hephaestion always participated, in the front row, in the council meetings that the king regularly held with his principal officers, but he was the only one with whom Alexander also confronted in private, exposing to him his innermost thoughts, hopes, and hidden plans. Curtius Rufus claims that Hephaistion was a sharer of all his secrets, while Plutarch describes the occasion when Alexander tried to impose, in a kind of test banquet, the extension to the Greeks as well of the obligation to pay tribute to the king, in the Persian manner, the kind of greeting termed prosk\u00fdnesis (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, Italianized into the rare proscin\u00e8si), and insinuates that Hephaistion was the only one in advance privy to the matter and probably the organizer himself of the banquet and of the whole ceremony to be performed at it. According to Aezione's depiction of Alexander's first marriage, in the description handed down by Lucian, Hephaistion was his \"flashlight bearer\" (best man), thus demonstrating not only his friendship alien to jealousy, but also his support for Alexander's policies, since the king's choice of an Asian bride was certainly not popular among his European retinue. With their return to Persia, Hephaistion, by virtue of the position of chilarch entrusted to him, became officially, after having long been de facto, the second highest authority in the empire, and also Alexander's brother-in-law. Hammond summarizes their public relationship very well: \"At the time of his death Hephaistion held the highest military command post, that of the cavalry of the Ethers, and had repeatedly been Alexander's deputy in the hierarchy of the Asiatic court, eventually assuming the post of chiliarch that had been Nabarzane's under Darius III. In this way Alexander honored Hephaistion both as the closest of friends and as the most distinguished of his field marshals.\" It has been suggested that, in addition to being close friends, Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers. None of the ancient histories seem to state this explicitly, and by the time those that have come down to us were written (at least three centuries later) homosexual relationships were looked upon less favorably than in ancient Greece and the process of erasing Hephaestion's role from history had already begun, a process that has continued, albeit intermittently, into modern times. Yet Arrian very significantly described the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion wanted to solemnly identify themselves with Achilles and Patroclus, whom the public opinion of the time, Plato first, acknowledged to have been lovers. The episode occurred at the beginning of the expedition to Asia, when Alexander led a military contingent to visit Troy, the stage for the events narrated in his beloved Iliad. He ran naked, along with his companions, to the tombs of the heroes and laid a wreath on Achilles' tomb, while Hephaistion did the same with that of Patroclus. Arrian, very discreetly, draws no conclusions, but Robin Lane Fox, writing in 1973, argues, \"It was a very remarkable tribute, spectacularly rendered, and it is also the first time in Alexander's career that Hephaestion is mentioned. Already the two were on intimate terms and called them Patroclus and Achilles. The comparison would last until the end of their days, indicating their love affair, for in Alexander's time it was commonly admitted that Achilles and Patroclus were in a relationship, which Homer never mentioned directly,\" although from a simple reading of the twenty-third canto of the Iliad, it is hard not to detect, even without the aid of psychoanalysis, how the words uttered by Patroclus' shadow or those of Achilles, as well as his behaviors, demonstrate an obvious character that is not simply amicable, however profound, but actually betrays a substratum of an erotic, albeit not \"overtly\" sexual, character. Hephaistion and Alexander grew up in a time and environment in which male bisexuality was widely permitted and even regulated by law, and in any case not frowned upon by common opinion, at least to the extent that it was contained within the limits, legal and social, that were set for it. The Greeks \"experienced relationships between men very differently from the way in which (obviously, with exceptions) those who make a homosexual choice today do: for the Greeks and Romans, in fact (again with exceptions), homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option outside the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of the life experience: it was the manifestation of both a sentimental and a sexual drive that in the span of existence alternated with and complemented (sometimes at the same time) love for a woman...\" While, however, the possibility of same-sex relationships was generally admitted, the pattern followed by such relationships differed from place to place. Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian model as a point of reference, tended to assume either that love relationships between the two were limited to adolescence and later left alone, or that one of the two was older, and thus acted as erast\u00e8s (lover) while the younger acted as eromenos (beloved). The former thesis has continued to be in vogue to the present day, with fiction writers, such as Mary Renault, and professional historians, such as Paul Cartledge, among the supporters. The latter stated, \"Rumor ran - and for once the rumor was surely correct - that he and Alexander 'had once been' more than just good friends.\" Elianus, on the other hand, makes his own the second hypothesis, where, in describing the visit to Troy, he uses an expression of this kind: \"Alexander placed a wreath on the tomb of Achilles and Hephaistion one on that of Patroclus, intending by this to signify that he was the her\u00f3menos of Alexander, just as Patroclus had been of Achilles.\" However, what was at home in Athens and Attica, was not necessarily so in Dorian circles and in Macedonia, where, as Lane Fox says, \"...the descendants of the Dorians were thought and indeed expected to be openly homosexual, all the more so if they belonged to the ruling class; moreover, the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian lineage.\" And this was not the result of a tendency \u00e0 la mode, but belonged to the intrinsic Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, way of being, and had far more to do with the sacred Battalion of Thebes (or the customs of the Spartiates or Cretans), than with Athens. In light of the above, it should come as no surprise that there are indications that their love affair lasted a lifetime. Lucian, in his work Pro lapsu inter salutandum (In defense of a lapse in salutandum), tells of a morning when Hephaestion expressed himself in a way that gave the impression that he had spent the night in Alexander's tent; Plutarch describes the intimacy that existed between the two by recounting that Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander's letters together with him, or that once when he happened to find a confidential letter from Olympias open, the king ideally sealed his lips by resting his ring on it, indicating that the contents of the missive were to remain secret; in an apocryphal letter attributed to the philosopher Diogenes and addressed to a now made man Alexander, heavy allusion is made to his tendency to allow himself to be commanded \". .. by the thighs of Hephaestion.\" No other circumstance better shows the nature and duration of their relationship than Alexander's superhuman grief at the time of his friend's death. As Andrew Chugg says, \"...it is surely incredible that Alexander's reaction to Hephaistion's death could signify anything other than the closest of relationships imaginable.\" The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and intentional, in which Alexander externalized his distress are detailed further below, but with reference to the nature of their relationship, one stands out over the others in significance: Arrian relates that the king\"...threw himself on the body of his friend and lay there in tears for most of the day, refusing to detach himself from him until he was dragged away by force by his ethereals.\" Such all-encompassing love often leaves little room for other feelings. Hephaistion had a lover who was also his best friend, his king, his commander, and so it is no wonder that we have not heard of any other great affection or friendship in his lifetime. Nor is there any indication, however, that he was less than popular and well-liked in the group of the king's companions and friends, who had grown up together and worked together so well for so many years.It is possible that he was very close to Perdiccas, since it was in collaboration with him that he led the mission to the Indus during which Puskalavati was conquered, and, at the time, his position next to Alexander would have enabled him, at the very least, to exclude unwelcome companions in adventure. The two achieved all the goals that had been set for the expedition, which indicates that they worked well together and that Hephaistion found in the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It should also be noted that it was their two cavalry regiments that were chosen by Alexander for the crossing of the Idaspe River before the battle against the Indian king Poro. On that occasion the superb teamwork would prove to be of supreme importance. However, it would be erroneous to infer from the above that Hephaistion was loved and appreciated by all. Outside the inner circle of the Macedonian high command, he too had his enemies, and this is clear from Arrian's comment on Alexander's grief: \"All writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against either Hephaestion or Alexander himself, has differently colored the accounts of how he externalized it.\" However, given the factions and jealousies that tend to breed in every court, and given that Hephaestion was enormously close to the greatest, perhaps, of monarchs the Western world has ever known, it should be emphasized how little enmity he was able, in the end, to arouse. Arrian again makes mention of a quarrel with Alexander's secretary, Eumenes, but, because of a missing page in the manuscript of the text, we do not know the details of the affair, except that Hephaistion was eventually induced, unwillingly, to make peace. It is, however, Plutarch (who dedicated one of his parallel Lives to Eumenes) who reminds us that it was a matter of housing granted to a flute player, which suggests that the quarrel, which erupted over trifles, was in fact an expression of a deeper antagonism brooding over time. What motivated the antagonism is not known with certainty, but it is not hard to imagine that the powers or, depending on one's point of view, the meddling, of the new chiliarch may well have vexed the king's jaded secretary. Only in one instance is Hephaistion known to have clashed with one of the old officers of the Aethians, and that was with Craterus. In this case it is easier to argue that the resentment might have been mutual, since that one was one of the officers who most vociferously opposed Alexander's policy tending toward the integration of Greeks and Orientals, whereas Hephaistion was a staunch supporter of it. Plutarch tells the story this way, \"For this reason a feeling of hostility arose and deepened between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once, during the expedition to India, they even crossed swords and exchanged blows ...\".Alexander, who also held Craterus in high esteem as an extremely competent officer, was forced to intervene and publicly had some very harsh words for both of them. The fact, however, that the physical clash had occurred, stands as an indication of the extent to which the question of integration was making tempers boil, and also the extent to which Hephaistion, who was treated on the occasion harshly by the king, identified Alexander's aspirations with his own. It was, however, in the spring of 324 that Hephaistion gave the ultimate proof of this identification, when he agreed (nothing suggests less than willingly) to marry Dripetides, daughter of Darius III and sister of Statira II, who had also contextually gone to marry Alexander himself, in the course of the Susa marriage ceremonies. Up to this time Hephaestion's name had never been attached to any woman, nor, for that matter, to any man other than Alexander. Of her very short married life nothing is known except that, at the time of Alexander's subsequent death, which occurred eight months after Hephaestion's, Dripetides still mourned the bridegroom to whom she had been united for only four months. For Alexander, marrying a daughter of Darius (and, together, as a third wife, Parisatides, daughter and sister of the previous Great Kings, Artaxerxes III and IV) constituted an important political act, allowing him to more firmly forge ties with the Persian ruling class, but, as far as Hephaestion was concerned, receiving in marriage the sister of the new co-queen was yet another proof of the exceptional esteem in which he was held by Alexander, who thus called him to be part of the royal family itself. They thus became brothers-in-law, but there was more: Alexander, says Arrian, \"...wanted to become the uncle of Hephaestion's children ...,\" and it is therefore even possible to imagine that the two hoped that their respective lineages might one day be joined, and that, eventually, the crown of Macedonia and Persia might be borne by a descendant of both.

He was \"... by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\"[2] This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army.[3] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.Contents [hide]1Youth and education2Career3Relationships4Death and funeral4.1Amphipolis Tomb5Portrayals of Hephaestion in fiction6Notes7References7.1Ancient sources7.2Modern sources8Further reading9External linksYouth and education[edit]The emblema of the Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion.[4]Hephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[5] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.The only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201c... one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[6] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[7] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[8] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.A few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[9] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be due to the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[10] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.While it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.Career[edit]Sharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander's other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.The Battle of Issus by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1529Hephaestion's career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \"... authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office.\"[11] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion's choice.After the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[12] Hephaestion's task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.Plutarch, while writing about Alexander's correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[13] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens' inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \"If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\"[13]It is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander's governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \"It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus' reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\"[14]It is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion's rank. He is called the \"... commander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes).\"[15] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[16][17]After Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\"[18] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[19]After the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[20] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais[dubious \u2013 discuss] rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[21]In spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"... take over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing.\"[22] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[23]Alexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[24] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes.Hephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[25] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[26] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \"honorary trierarchs\", indicating his leading position at this time.[27] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion's section marched \"... five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward\".[28] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[29] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[30]Hephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[31] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[32] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander's de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \"... to command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held.\"[33]Relationships[edit]Little is known of Hephaestion's personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[2] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander's becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages. Apart from Diogenes of Sinope's alleged letter quoted below, heavily hinting at Alexander's yielding to Hephaestion's thighs, ancient sources do not generally mention that Hephaestion and Alexander may have been lovers, as some modern scholars have theorized. Overall direct evidence is non-existent and, at least according to Thomas R. Martin, this was a practice which was uncommon by majority Greek standards of their time.[34]Alexander and Hephaestion enter the tent of the captive royal family of Darius. From a 1696 edition of Curtius.Their tutor Aristotle described friendship as \"... one soul abiding in two bodies\".[35] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus,[36] Arrian[37] and Curtius[38] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives mistaking him for Alexander because he was the taller and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed but Alexander reassured her with the words, \"You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\"[38] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said \"... you know that Alexander means more to us than anything.\"[39] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as \"... the friend I valued as my own life.\"[40] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \"Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\"[41]Their friendship was also a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; it is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[42] a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[43] and of sheer incompetence.[44] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.Hephaestion played a full part in Alexander's regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes and plans. Curtius[45] states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets. And Plutarch[46] describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented. According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander's first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander's policies as Alexander's choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one. By the time they returned to Persia Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander's second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship well: \"It is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\",[47] and \"At the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\"[48]Alexander, left, and Hephaestion, right. The Getty Villa Museum.It has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers despite the fact that hardly any of Alexander's extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refer to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander's friend,[34][49] consistent with Hephaestion's epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[50] The ancient sources generally name Hephaestion only as a good and loyal friend of Alexander's.[51]However, Arrian[52] describes the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with close friends Achilles and Patroclus. It happened right at the beginning of the campaign in Asia when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Arrian discreetly draws no conclusions from this, but, according to Thomas R. Martin, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being homosexuals as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were homosexual or that they had sexual relations. Martin further suggests this concept was theorized by unspecified \"later authors\",[34] who include however such eminent writers as Aeschylus and Plato[53] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion's time. Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn: \"It was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion's first mention in Alexander's career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander's time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\"[54]Hephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time where, according to Thomas R. Martin, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of their time.[34] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, for instance, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. The Greeks used to approach the relationships between men in a very different way from how they will be dealt with today (with exceptions of course). For the Greeks \"homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\". [55] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes) and the other was the beloved (eromenos) despite there being scarcely any direct evidence that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship at all.[56]The former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \"Rumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\"[57] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \"Alexander laid a garland on Achilles' tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus', indicating that he was Alexander's eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\"[58]However, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \"... descendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry.\"[59] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[60] In light of this, it is not surprising that there are many indications that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong. Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue[61] describes an occasion when Hephaestion's conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander's tent all night, and Plutarch[62] describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander's letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion's lips. Diogenes of Sinope, in a letter written to Alexander when he was a grown man, accuses Alexander of being \"... ruled by Hephaestion's thighs.\"[63]No other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander's overwhelming grief at Hephaestion's death. As Andrew Chugg says, \"... it is surely incredible that Alexander's reaction to Hephaestion's death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable.\"[64] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \"... flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions.\"[65]The family of Darius in front of Alexander, by Justus Sustermans and preserved in the Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer. In this picture we can see Hephaestion point out AlexanderSuch an all-encompassing love often leaves little room for other affections. Hephaestion was the best friend of Alexander, his king and his commanding officer, so it is not surprising that we only hear of several other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he was anything but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions who had grown up together, and worked well together for so many years. It is possible that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[66] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[67]It would be wrong to imply that Hephaestion was universally liked or admired however. Outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command he had his enemies. This is clear from Arrian's comment about Alexander's grief: \"All writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\"[68]Yet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[69] mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[70] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.The weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving.In only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander's policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \"For this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows ...\".[71] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander's wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander's own second wife Stateira.[1] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander's own death, eight months after Hephaestion's, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[72]For Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Alexander, says Arrian \"... wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children ...\".[73] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[73]Death and funeral[edit]In spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[74] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice and as soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[75]Piecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion's fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \"This sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\"[76] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.Following Hephaestion's death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[77][78] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion, this was later done.[78]Hephaestion's death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says \"... Alexander's grief was uncontrollable ...\" and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[79] Arrian relates an account that \"... he flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions ...\",[80] another that said \"... he lay stretched upon the corpse all day and the whole night too ...\",[80] and another which told how he had the doctor, Glaucias, executed for his lack of care.[81] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[82] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[83] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles' last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre: \"... he laid the lock of hair in the hands of his beloved companion, and the whole company was moved to tears.\"[84]Another hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit Achilles' killing of \"... twelve high-born youths ...\" beside Patroclus' funeral pyre.[79]Arrian states that all his sources agree that \"... for two whole days after Hephaestion's death Alexander tasted no food and paid no attention in any way to his bodily needs but lay on his bed now crying lamentably, now in the silence of grief.\"[85] Alexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire. Arrian tells us that \"Many of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man ...\"[86] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion's place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \"... wished Hephaestion's name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion's Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion's image continued to be carried before it.\"[87]Alexander sent messengers to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \"... from that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero's rites.\"[88] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion's memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \"To the Hero Hephaestion\".[89][90]Hephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount but we know that in Hephaestion\u2019s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between \u00a350 and \u00a3100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is \u00a325. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion\u2019s funeral would have cost \u00a31,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas.[82] At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[91] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \"... as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation ...\", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[92]The pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[93] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander's own death.[94]One final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[95]Amphipolis Tomb[edit]Based on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325 - 300 BC.[96]Portrayals of Hephaestion in fiction[edit]Cave, A.

In any case, the ancient sources were certain that Alexander was sexually active with women. When Barsine, the daughter of a prominent Persian and a Greek woman, and the widow of Memnon of Rhodes, was captured in 333 and brought to Alexander, he was reportedly so entranced by her beauty \u2014 and her high level knowledge of Greek literature \u2014 that he became her lover. Plutarch asserted that Barsine was the only woman with whom Alexander had sex before his (first) marriage several years later, but other sources report that he had learned about sex from Pancaste, a woman form Thessaly in Greece so beautiful that Apelles the painter became famous for his nude portrait of her. Our sources also recount that Alexander, like the Persian kings he replaces, regularly took his pick of the many concubines kept at the court as temporary sex partners. Most colourfully of all they also report that Alexander spent thirteen days having sex with the female leader of the tribe of women warriors (\u201cAmazons\u201d), who came to him from the Caucasus region, asking that he impregnate her so she could have his child. The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the Iliad never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.) If Alexander and Hephaestion did have a sexual relationship, it would have been transgressive by majority Greek standards...Jump up ^ Diogenes Laertius 5.1.20Jump up ^ Diodorus 17.37.5Jump up ^ Arrian 2.12.31^ Jump up to: a b Curtius 3.12.17Jump up ^ Diodorus 17.114.3Jump up ^ Arrian 7.14.50Jump up ^ Cartledge p19Jump up ^ Arrian 3.26Jump up ^ Arrian 4.8Jump up ^ Arrian 4.5Jump up ^ Curtius 12.16.2Jump up ^ Plutarch 55.1Jump up ^ Hammond 1980, p.16Jump up ^ Hammond 1980, p.250Jump up ^ Cartledge, Paul (2010).

He was \"... by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\"[2] This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nHis military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army.[3] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.\n\nYouth and education\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[4] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201c... one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[5] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[6] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[7] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[8] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be due to the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[9] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.\n\nCareer\n\nSharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander's other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\nThe Battle of Issus by by Albrecht Altdorfer , 1529\n\nHephaestion's career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \"... authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office.\"[10] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion's choice.\n\nAfter the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[11] Hephaestion's task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.\n\nPlutarch, while writing about Alexander's correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[12] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens' inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \"If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\"[12]\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander's governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \"It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus' reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\"[13]\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion's rank. He is called the \"... commander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes).\"[14] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[15][16]\n\nAfter Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\"[17] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[18]\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[19] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais[dubious \u2013 discuss] rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[20]\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"... take over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing.\"[21] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[22]\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[23] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[24] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[25] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \"honorary trierarchs\", indicating his leading position at this time.[26] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion's section marched \"... five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward\".[27] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[28] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[29]\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[30] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[31] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander's de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \"... to command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held.\"[32]\n\nRelationships\n\nLittle is known of Hephaestion's personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[2] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander's becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages. Apart from Diogenes of Sinope's alleged letter quoted below, heavily hinting at Alexander's yielding to Hephaestion's thighs, ancient sources do not generally mention that Hephaestion and Alexander may have been lovers, as some modern scholars have theorized. Overall direct evidence is non-existent and, at least according to Thomas R. Martin, this was a practice which was uncommon by majority Greek standards of their time.[33]\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion enter the tent of the captive royal family of Darius. From a 1696 edition of Curtius.\n\nTheir tutor Aristotle described friendship as \"... one soul abiding in two bodies\".[34] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus,[35] Arrian[36] and Curtius[37] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives mistaking him for Alexander because he was the taller and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed but Alexander reassured her with the words, \"You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\"[37] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said \"... you know that Alexander means more to us than anything.\"[38] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as \"... the friend I valued as my own life.\"[39] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \"Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\"[40]\n\nTheir friendship was also a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; it is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[41] a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[42] and of sheer incompetence.[43] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.\n\nHephaestion played a full part in Alexander's regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes and plans. Curtius[44] states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets. And Plutarch[45] describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented. According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander's first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander's policies as Alexander's choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one. By the time they returned to Persia Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander's second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship well: \"It is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\",[46] and \"At the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\"[47]\n\nAlexander, left, and Hephaestion, right. The Getty Villa Museum.\n\nIt has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers despite the fact that hardly any of Alexander's extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refer to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander's friend,[33][48] consistent with Hephaestion's epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[49] The ancient sources generally name Hephaestion only as a good and loyal friend of Alexander's.[50]\n\nHowever, Arrian[51] describes the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with close friends Achilles and Patroclus. It happened right at the beginning of the campaign in Asia when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Arrian discreetly draws no conclusions from this, but, according to Thomas R. Martin, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being homosexuals as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were homosexual or that they had sexual relations. Martin further suggests this concept was theorized by unspecified \"later authors\",[33] who include however such eminent writers as Aeschylus and Plato[52] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion's time. Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn: \"It was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion's first mention in Alexander's career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander's time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\"[53]\n\nHephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time where, according to Thomas R. Martin, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of their time.[33] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, for instance, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. The Greeks used to approach the relationships between men in a very different way from how they will be dealt with today (with exceptions of course). For the Greeks \"homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\". [54] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes) and the other was the beloved (eromenos) despite there being scarcely any direct evidence that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship at all.[55]\n\nThe former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \"Rumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\"[56] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \"Alexander laid a garland on Achilles' tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus', indicating that he was Alexander's eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\"[57]\n\nHowever, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \"... descendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry.\"[58] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[59] In light of this, it is not surprising that there are many indications that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong. Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue[60] describes an occasion when Hephaestion's conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander's tent all night, and Plutarch[61] describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander's letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion's lips. Diogenes of Sinope, in a letter written to Alexander when he was a grown man, accuses Alexander of being \"... ruled by Hephaestion's thighs.\"[62]\n\nNo other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander's overwhelming grief at Hephaestion's death. As Andrew Chugg says, \"... it is surely incredible that Alexander's reaction to Hephaestion's death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable.\"[63] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \"... flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions.\"[64]\n\nSuch an all-encompassing love often leaves little room for other affections. Hephaestion was the best friend of Alexander, his king and his commanding officer, so it is not surprising that we only hear of several other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he was anything but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions who had grown up together, and worked well together for so many years. It is possible that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[65] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[66]\n\nIt would be wrong to imply that Hephaestion was universally liked or admired however. Outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command he had his enemies. This is clear from Arrian's comment about Alexander's grief: \"All writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\"[67]\n\nYet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[68] mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[69] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving.\n\nIn only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander's policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \"For this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows ...\".[70] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander's wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander's own second wife Stateira.[1] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander's own death, eight months after Hephaestion's, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[71]\n\nFor Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Alexander, says Arrian \"... wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children ...\".[72] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[72]\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nIn spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[73] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice and as soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[74]\n\nPiecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion's fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \"This sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\"[75] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.\n\nFollowing Hephaestion's death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[76][77] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion, this was later done.[77]\n\nHephaestion's death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says \"... Alexander's grief was uncontrollable ...\" and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[78] Arrian relates an account that \"... he flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions ...\",[79] another that said \"... he lay stretched upon the corpse all day and the whole night too ...\",[79] and another which told how he had the doctor, Glaucias, executed for his lack of care.[80] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[81] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[82] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles' last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre: \"... he laid the lock of hair in the hands of his beloved companion, and the whole company was moved to tears.\"[83]\n\nAnother hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit Achilles' killing of \"... twelve high-born youths ...\" beside Patroclus' funeral pyre.[78]\n\nArrian states that all his sources agree that \"... for two whole days after Hephaestion's death Alexander tasted no food and paid no attention in any way to his bodily needs but lay on his bed now crying lamentably, now in the silence of grief.\"[84] Alexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire. Arrian tells us that \"Many of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man ...\"[85] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion's place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \"... wished Hephaestion's name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion's Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion's image continued to be carried before it.\"[86]\n\nAlexander sent messengers to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \"... from that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero's rites.\"[87] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion's memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \"To the Hero Hephaestion\".[88][89]\n\nHephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount but we know that in Hephaestion\u2019s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between \u00a350 and \u00a3100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is \u00a325. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion\u2019s funeral would have cost \u00a31,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas.[81] At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[90] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \"... as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation ...\", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[91]\n\nThe pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[92] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander's own death.[93]\n\nOne final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[94]\n\nAmphipolis Tomb\n\nBased on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325 - 300 BC.[95]\n\nPortrayals of Hephaestion in fiction\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAncient sources\n\nModern sources\n\nFurther reading"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/hephaestion/career", "page_content": "Career\n\nSharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC), and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC), or the invasion of Persia, and nor are the names of Alexander's other close friends and contemporaries, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\nHephaestion's career was never solely a military one. Right from the start, he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC), when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \"... authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office.\" Hephaestion took local advice, and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion's choice.\n\nAfter the siege of Tyre (332 BC), Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland. Hephaestion's task was not an easy one, for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started, and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities, who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza, the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain, and reassembled.\n\nPlutarch, while writing about Alexander's correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business, and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes, and certainly, Athens' inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king, Agis, would seem to support the idea. As Chugg says, \"If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\"\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), and later became Alexander's governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has an interesting suggestion that conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \"It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus' reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\"\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion's rank. He is called the \"... commander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes).\" This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle, and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander, for Arrian tells us he was wounded, and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.\n\nAfter Gaugamela, there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians, and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon, Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\" Alexander had realised that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity, and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army, one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus. The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics, necessary against Scythian nomads, and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns, to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers, to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns, and after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.\n\nIn spring 327 BC, the army headed into India, and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"... take over either by force or agreement all places on their march, and on reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing.\" They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot, and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organise the construction of boats for the crossing.\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces, and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself, without needing instructions.\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC) and then, when the army began its homeward journey, was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes. Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats, which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \"honorary trierarchs\", indicating his leading position at this time. On entering hostile territory, Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion's section marched \"... five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward\". Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea. At the coast, he organised the construction of a fortress, and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala, while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia, he established a city there also. Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey, and when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery. He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander's de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \"... to command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held.\""}, {"url": "https://dictionary.sensagent.com/Hephaestion/en-en/", "page_content": "For other people of the same name, see Hephaestion (disambiguation)\n\nArtistic rendering of Hephaestion based on a bronze portrait head, as of September 2007 housed in The Prado Museum, Madrid.\n\nHephaestion (Ancient Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, alternative spelling: \"Hephaistion\"; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"... by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\"[1] This friendship lasted their whole lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nHis military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry, and was entrusted with many other tasks through Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates, and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire, and made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife, Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. At the time of his own death eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.\n\nYouth and education\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[2] Now a member of court life, it is possible that the two future conquerors would have met around this time.\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201c... one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[3] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[4] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[5] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education, and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius, and Laomedon.[6] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be due to the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[7] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire; second only to the king himself.\n\nCareer\n\nSharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC), and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens.

Right from the start, he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance.

Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \"... to command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held.\"[30]\n\nRelationships\n\nLittle is known of Hephaestion's personal relationships, beyond his extraordinarily close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man, who had many friends, but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[1] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander's becoming king, through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life, and their marriages.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion enter the tent of the captive royal family of Darius. From a 1696 edition of Curtius.\n\nTheir tutor, Aristotle, described such a friendship as \"... one soul abiding in two bodies\".[31] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus,[32] Arrian[33] and Curtius[34] all describe the scene, when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, mistaking him for Alexander, because he was the taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realised her mistake, she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander reassured her with the words, \"You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\"[34] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said \"... you know that Alexander means more to us than anything.\"[35] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as \"... the friend I valued as my own life.\"[36] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \"Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\"[37]\n\nTheir friendship was also a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; it is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation, of treachery,[38] a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[39] and of sheer incompetence.[40] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces, he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty, who understood and sympathised with his aims, and above all, who got the job done.\n\nHephaestion played a full part in Alexander's regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes and plans. Curtius[41] states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets, and Plutarch[42] describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose, and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander had discussed it, and who arranged for the change to be implemented. According to the painting done by Aetion, of Alexander's first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander's policies, as Alexander's choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one. By the time they returned to Persia, Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander's second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship well: \"It is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\",[43] and \"At the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\"[44]\n\nAlexander, left, and Hephaestion, right. The Getty Villa Museum.\n\nIt has been suggested that as well as being close friends, Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers. None of the ancient sources states this in so many words. By the time the extant sources were written\u2014some three hundred years later\u2014homosexual affairs were looked upon with less favour than they had been in ancient Greece\u2014Horace[45] speaks of the Greek vice\u2014and so had already begun the process which has continued intermittently ever since, the \"airbrushing\" of Hephaestion out of history. However, Arrian[46] describes the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with Achilles and Patroclus, who were acknowledged, by Plato and Aeschylus among others, to have been lovers. It happened right at the beginning of the campaign in Asia, when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus, and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Arrian discreetly draws no conclusions from this. However, Robin Lane Fox, writing in 1973, says: \"It was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion's first mention in Alexander's career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander's time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\"[47]\n\nHephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time and place where homosexual affairs were seen as perfectly normal, but the pattern that such affairs followed was not the same in every city-state. Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that their sexual relationship belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes) and the other was the beloved (eromenos).\n\nThe former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction, such as Mary Renault, and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \"Rumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\"[48] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \"Alexander laid a garland on Achilles' tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus', indicating that he was Alexander's eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\"[49]\n\nHowever, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \"... descendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry.\"[50] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[51] In light of this, it is not surprising that there is evidence that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong. Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue[52] describes an occasion when Hephaestion's conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander's tent all night, and Plutarch[53] describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander's letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion's lips. Diogenes of Sinope, in a letter written to Alexander when he was a grown man, accuses Alexander of being \"... ruled by Hephaestion's thighs.\"[54]\n\nNo other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander's overwhelming grief at Hephaestion's death. As Andrew Chugg says, \"... it is surely incredible that Alexander's reaction to Hephaestion's death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable.\"[55] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \"... flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions.\"[56]\n\nSuch an all-encompassing love often leaves little room for other affections. Hephaestion's lover was also his best friend, his king, and his commanding officer, so it is not surprising that we hear of no other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he was anything but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions who had grown up together, and worked well together for so many years. It is possible that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus, and by that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[57] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes, before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion, superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[58]\n\nIt would be wrong to imply that Hephaestion was universally liked or admired. Outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command, he had his enemies. This is clear from Arrian's comment about Alexander's grief: \"All writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\"[59]\n\nHowever, given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court, and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[60] mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary, Eumenes, but because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion, that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[61] mentions that it was about lodgings, and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late-19th-century engraving.\n\nIn only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow-officer, and that was with Craterus. In this instance, it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander's policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \"For this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows ...\".[62] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly, as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene, and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue, that such a thing should have happened, and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander's wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife, Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander's own second wife, Stateira. Up till this time, Hephaestion's name had never been linked with any woman, or indeed any man other than Alexander. Of his short married life, nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander's own death, eight months after Hephaestion's, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[63]\n\nFor Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Alexander, says Arrian \"... wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children ...\".[64] Thus, it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines, and that ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[64]\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nIn spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn, and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[65] Plutarch says that, being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice, and as soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast, consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[66]\n\nPiecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion's fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \"This sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\"[67] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid, and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.\n\nHephaestion's death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says \"... Alexander's grief was uncontrollable ...\" and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities, and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[68] Arrian relates an account that \"... he flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions ...\",[69] another that said \"... he lay stretched upon the corpse all day and the whole night too ...\",[69] and another which told how he had the doctor, Glaucias, executed for his lack of care.[70] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[71] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[72] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles' last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre: \"... he laid the lock of hair in the hands of his beloved companion, and the whole company was moved to tears.\"[73]\n\nAnother hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign which shortly followed these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion, and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander, this might have followed in spirit Achilles' killing of \"... twelve high-born youths ...\" beside Patroclus' funeral pyre.[68]\n\nArrian states that all his sources agree that \"... for two whole days after Hephaestion's death Alexander tasted no food and paid no attention in any way to his bodily needs, but lay on his bed now crying lamentably, now in the silence of grief.\"[74] Alexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire, and Arrian tells us that \"Many of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man ...\"[75] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion's place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \"... wished Hephaestion's name to be preserved always in connexion with it, so Hephaestion's Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion's image continued to be carried before it.\"[76]\n\nAlexander sent messengers to the oracle at Siwa, to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came, saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased, and \"... from that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero's rites.\"[77] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion's memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \"To the Hero Hephaestion\".[78]\n\nHephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount, but we know that in Hephaestion\u2019s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. Today, in western Europe, 2008, that would be between \u00a350 and \u00a3100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is \u00a325. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion\u2019s funeral would have cost \u00a31,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon, with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas.[71] At Babylon, funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics, and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before, both in cost and in numbers taking part.[79] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \"... as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation ...\", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[80]\n\nThe pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape, and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures, and with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches, with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle, and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth, the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[81] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander's own death.[82]\n\nOne final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[83]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAncient Sources\n\nModern Sources\n\nFurther reading\n\nReames, Jeanne.
