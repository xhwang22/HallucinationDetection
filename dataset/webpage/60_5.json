It evolved from a coterie of young New York artists, but quickly took hold throughout the country, and also gained attention in Europe. P&D artworks may be characterized as brash, colorful, largely abstract works; but figuration was not unwelcome, as long as it was likewise bold, flashy, and sensuous, with a high degree of decorativeness. The exaltation of \u201cthe decorative\u201d was one of the principal tenets of the movement. From the outset, P&D could encompass all mediums\u2014painting, sculpture, installation, as well as clothing and other forms of wearable art, and interior decoration. Performance and video were also embraced by P&D\u2014just so long as the subject matter and presentation were unapologetically uninhibited, and aimed toward a radical redefinition of beauty, as in works by Robert Kushner and Tina Girouard.\n\nA touch of hedonism prevails in P&D works, in which decoration is paramount and excess is a virtue. Patterning, layered fabrics, sequins and glitter, and high-key paint tones abound in the work, while furniture, wallpaper and decorative objects are elevated to esthetically lofty positions they never held before. A shower curtain design by pioneering installation artist Judy Pfaff for art dealer Holly Solomon\u2019s bathroom, for instance, or faux wallpaper created by artist Cynthia Carlson, could be wholeheartedly embraced as true works of art according to the P&D canon.\n\nJudy Pfaff, Untitled (shower curtain), 1980-1981, mixed mediums, 80 1/2 x 44 1/2 in. Collection Thomas Solomon and Kimberly Mascola; Photo Courtesy of the artist.\n\nP&D offered an effective counter-measure to the prevailing\u2014and often stifling\u2014dictates of Minimalism, which had ruled the art world with patriarchal authority since the mid-1960s. A serious socio-political agenda further underlies the glitzy surfaces of P&D works\u2014a visual manifesto centered on feminism, and an effort to overturn the traditional male-dominated view of art history as well as Western cultural chauvinism. At its best, P&D represents the first manifestation of cultural globalism. The Minimalist aim toward \u201cpurity\u201d of form and expression were supplanted by P&D\u2019s cross-cultural influences, resulting in \u201cpromiscuous patterns,\u201d a phenomenon eloquently explained by The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles curator Anna Katz in the exhibition and book With Pleasure: Pattern and Decoration in American Art 1972-1985.\n\nThe publication, with contributions by Katz as well as authors and scholars Elissa Auther, Hamza Walker, Alex Kitnik, Kayleigh Perkov, Amy Goldin, and others, is the most comprehensive book on the subject produced to date. Assembled with the help of assistant curator Rebecca Skafsgaard Lowery, the exhibition of approximately one hundred works\u2014one of the largest surveys of P&D ever mounted\u2014debuted at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, on October 27, 2019. Its run, through May 11, was cut short due to museum closings in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The exhibition was scheduled to appear this summer at the Hessel Museum of Art at the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, June 27-December 11, 2020, and has now been rescheduled to open in June, 2021.\n\nIn the book, Katz traces the origins of P&D as a bonafide art movement to a 1975 meeting at the downtown Manhattan home of artist Robert Zakanitch to discuss shared ideas and goals among likeminded artists Joyce Kozloff, Miriam Schapiro, Tony Robbin, and others. There was an aim toward antihierarchical systems in art-making\u2014the dissolution of traditional value systems of high and low art. Some P&D artists explored art\u2019s relationship to math and science. Tony Robbin, one of the most inspiring art history professors I had as a college undergrad, explored the fourth dimension in painting, with mesmerizing compositions of ever-shifting layers of geometric patterns.\n\nTony Robbin, Japanese Footbridge, 1972, Acrylic on canvas, 70 x 144 in.; Photo: Courtesy of the artist.\n\nArchitect and theorist Buckminster Fuller was a major inspiration for some artists associated with the P&D movement. He asserted that the human body was defined not by its materiality, but by the patterning of its materials. In the book, contributor Rebecca Skafsgaard Lowery points out that artists of the period studied DNA, fractals, and other structural patterns that seemed to underlie all of existence once you scratched the surface.\n\nRecently, I spoke on the telephone with Anna Katz about the book and the exhibition. We discussed the theme\u2019s evolution and its personal and public significance for her and for art audiences.\n\nDavid Ebony With this exhibition and book, With Pleasure, you are introducing the Pattern and Decoration (P&D) movement to a whole new generation. Maybe I can start by asking you the basic question\u2014how would you define the P&D movement?\n\nAnna Katz The Pattern and Decoration movement emerged in the early 1970s in New York, Los Angeles, and art centers in between, like Chicago. It was fundamentally a group of artists who embraced in their works of the 1970s and \u201980s, a wide range of patterns and motifs usually associated with decorative art, such as florals, or designs from patchwork quilts. The P&D artists challenged a longstanding hierarchy of high and low that was in place in Western art for centuries, that had placed fine art\u2014painting and sculpture\u2014above decorative or applied arts, ornament and craft.\n\nThis was seen at the time as a challenge not only to the values that had dictated Western art whereby painting and sculpture stood well above fabric design, mosaic, basketry, weaving and ceramics. Generally, it was a challenge to the Minimalist esthetic that ruled the day. The P&D movement countered the modernist dictum that \u201cless is more.\u201d These artists used textiles, feathers, glitter, and wild color combinations and overlapping patterns, with the idea that \u201cmore is more.\u201d\n\nDE How did you get involved with the movement? What was the attraction for you and the impetus for this show?\n\nAK The origin story for me is that before I even worked at L.A. MoCA, I was hired to write about seventy-five wall labels for a permanent collection installation, with works by Franz Kline, Lee Krasner, Liz Larner, and also an artist named Kim MacConnel; and I wondered, who the hell is Kim MacConnel? In my research, I learned that he was central to this movement that somehow entirely escaped me, and seems to have been almost totally neglected by most art historians.\n\nHow did I get through to a PhD without being aware of this movement? It struck me that MacConnel\u2019s work so closely resembled works that so many younger artists today are doing. The motivation for me was to explore the last influence of P&D that had yet to be fully assessed. As a scholar, it is exciting to research material that seems to have been left out at the margins of recent art history, and asking questions about it as if for the first time. And it is a time when those questions seem pressing and urgent.\n\nKim MacConnel, Slide Out, 1980, acrylic on cloth, 100 x 110 in. (254\n\nx 279.4 cm). The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, gift of\n\nPaula and Allan Rudnick.\n\nDE I often think of a younger artist like Jeffrey Gibson and others, who must have been influenced directly or indirectly by the P&D movement.\n\nAK Jeffrey Gibson is a fine example. He is an artist who cites P&D as an influence, as does Sanford Biggers, who has been using historic quilts in his work for some time. The rise in ceramics as a prominent art form can also be linked to P&D. I am a little reluctant to name names, but here in Los Angeles, consider the ethos of someone like Laura Owens, who has invested her painting with a nonhierarchical visual vocabulary; or Rebecca Morris, who works in an abstract tradition that challenges conventions of taste and sensibility. Aside from those examples, even when looking at the work of young artists today, just out of school, I see so much Matisse, and so many allusions to decorative and ornamental painting.\n\nDE It seems trendy again, but P&D went through such a long and rough period of being sidelined or dismissed altogether by the art-world status quo. Could you talk about the taboos against the P&D movement, or resistance to it? And how did it eventually overcome that kind of intense negative perception?\n\nAK P&D enjoyed a moment of enthusiastic critical reception, commercial success, and institutional recognition in the mid- and late 1970s. There were exhibitions throughout the U.S. And in Europe, the movement was very well received at the time. In New York, Holly Solomon was the most successful commercial gallery in actively promoting P&D; and works entered the collections of all the prominent museums here and around the world\u2014MoMA, the Met, the Art Institute of Chicago, L.A. MoCA, and so on. By the early 1980s, it seems that P&D had been eclipsed by Neo-Expressionism.\n\nIronically, P&D and Neo-Expressionism have a lot in common. Both can be seen as Postmodern movements that embrace appropriation, reference and citation, mixing high- and low art, and using unconventional materials. But there was one crucial difference. P&D was entirely sincere in its intentions. It is a celebratory art\u2014it embraces kitsch and craft, and ornamental patterns. Its relationship to its sources, as a form of appropriation art, was never one of detachment. By contrast, detachment, irony, and a kind of pervasive cynicism became hallmarks of Neo-Expressionism, and of 1980s Post-Modernism in general.\n\nPart of the problem was a deep-seated historical bias against the fields of craft and decoration that were often deemed \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d\u2014art and artifacts that were traditionally made by women, and which the P&D artists so admired. Although there were quite a few men among the P&D artists\u2014and not all of the women artists were necessarily feminists by self-identification or by definition\u2014the movement\u2019s radical gesture was basically feminist, and shaped by feminist art-historical methods.\n\nRobert Zakanitch, Angel Feet, 1978, acrylic on canvas, three parts,\n\noverall 94 1/4 \u00d7 172 3/8 in. (239.4 \u00d7 437.83 cm). Whitney Museum\n\nof American Art, New York, gift of an anonymous donor. Digital image\n\n\u00a9 Whitney Museum, NY.\n\nDE Do you think that the renewed interest in P&D today is directly connected to the new women\u2019s movement, or the feminist movement that has reemerged in the past few years?\n\nAK I think that\u2019s plausible. When you have a president who boasts about grabbing women; you then find some aspect of the culture that has to reimagine its relationship to feminism in response. Artists, curators and writers in opposition to these recent developments have been looking back into the playbook to see how it was done in the past. They look for inspiration and examples in the late 1960s and early \u201970s.\n\nOne work in the show, a video by Tina Girouard, titled Maintenance III [1973], is a particularly striking example of a feminist artwork within a timely political context. The performer is the artist herself, but you never really see her face. It\u2019s a tightly cropped image of her you see throughout the approximately 30-minute video in which Girouard \u201cmaintains\u201d a set of floral-patterned chiffon fabrics that she calls \u201cSolomon\u2019s lot,\u201d after the uncle who gave them to her. She is shown sewing them, folding, washing, ringing, and rinsing them. While she\u2019s doing this, she\u2019s listening to Top 40 tunes on the radio\u2014Sly and the Family Stone, Pink Floyd, Wings, etc. The music\u2019s interrupted by an advertiser saying, \u201cCome to the Kitty Cat Club,\u201d or whatever it is, Saturday night on Route 95. And then there\u2019s a news report, and it\u2019s on the Watergate hearings\u2014because it\u2019s 1973.\n\nDE In your essay for the book, discussing the relationship of feminism to the P&D movement, you regard Miriam Schapiro as a principal protagonist. Could you say a few words about her contribution?\n\nAK Miriam Schapiro was a pioneer in P&D, and a mentor to many of the artists involved in the movement. A little older than most of them, she was born in 1923 and had a successful career in the 1950s and \u201960s, exhibiting with Andr\u00e9 Emmerich Gallery in New York, first showing Abstract Expressionist paintings and subsequently, hard-edge Minimalist compositions. She moved to California in the late 1960s, and her feminist consciousness was raised then, when she was about 50 years old. She co-founded, along with Judy Chicago, the feminist art program at Cal Arts [California Institute of Arts], in 1971, which culminated in the Womanhouse installation of 1972.\n\nThat particular work is the starting point for this show. Central to Schapiro\u2019s practice as an artist and her feminist activism is \u201cfemmage,\u201d a portmanteau she coined combining female and collage, as well as joining \u201cfemme\u201d and \u201chomage,\u201d as an homage to women. She was motivated to validate the art of women, the creative, artistic and intellectual achievements of women that are worthy of esthetic merit and consideration. She understood that the nearly total exclusion of women from the history of art did not indicate that women had not been making art, but that their art had not been taken seriously enough by the pervasive male-dominated views of art history. With \u201cfemmage,\u201d she was focused on assemblage-like works and justifying activities that were for centuries traditionally associated with women\u2014from quilt-making to interior decoration and cooking\u2014countering the status quo\u2019s judgement of these endeavors as trivial or merely decorative.\n\nMiriam Schapiro Heartland, 1985 Acrylic, fabric, glitter on canvas 85 in. x 94 in. Purchased with funds provided by the Women for Special Acquisition and the Council of 101 87.01 Photographed at the Orlando Museum of Art\n\nDE In the book, you make a distinction between \u201cdecorative\u201d versus \u201cdomestic\u201d art. Could you elaborate on that idea?\n\nAK In Miriam Schapiro\u2019s case, the locus of the decorative and the thrust of it, has to do with the domestic. In her work, she wanted to underscore the fact that historically women did not have access to art schools or studios like male artists did. Their studios were their homes, the place where they expressed their creativity. For Schapiro, the home was the place and site of the decorative. For other artists in the exhibition, the decorative is not necessarily related to the domestic. The decorative for them would be related to non-Western art\u2014Moroccan tiles, for instance, Oaxacan pottery, or Turkish rugs. These art forms were likewise dismissed, in the Western art canon, as inferior to fine art.\n\nDE You also consider Amy Goldin as a key curator in the movement, in a section in the book called \u201cPromiscuous Patterns.\u201d I love that title, by the way! Goldin was very much interested in Islamic art; and you discuss the importance of The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s galleries for Islamic art opening in 1975.\n\nAK Amy Goldin causally mentions the term \u201cpromiscuous\u201d in an essay titled \u201cPatterns, Grids, and Painting,\u201d published in Artforum in 1975. It\u2019s a foundational text in the P&D movement. I understood her use of the term \u201cpromiscuity\u201d as historically relevant and conceptually generative for artists and their relationships to pattern. Modernism\u2019s problem with pattern was that they are superficial, non-essential, that they were merely applied to a surface. In Modernism\u2019s pursuit of purity, the aim was to strip away anything that was extraneous. Therefore, decoration in general and pattern in particular were the first to go. I was interested in seeing how the P&D artists dealt with the promiscuity of patterns. Pattern is not specific to any medium or material; they could combine patterns of a rug on the floor, in an article of clothing, or in the mosaic dome of an Islamic mosque. It\u2019s this kind of promiscuity, a non-virtuous virtue that appealed to the P&D artists, and interests me. In a way, this impurity or non-specialization harbored a special power that the artists wished to harness.\n\nDE Travel was also important to the artists, in considering works by painters Valerie Jaudon and Joyce Kozloff, for example. First-hand experience with non-Western cultures\u2014Asian, African and Native American culture, for instance\u2014that was crucial to the development of P&D, and its global aspect that seems particularly relevant today.\n\nValerie Jaudon, Mineral Wells, 1980, oil on canvas, 120 \u00d7 108 in.\n\n(304.8 \u00d7 274.32 cm).

Photo by Zak Kelley\n\nAK Traveling abroad has been important for artists for generations, of course. It\u2019s an integral part of the artistic impulse, you could say, and education. It was particularly important for P&D artists, many of whom traveled the world\u2014to favorite places like Spain, Morocco, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, China, Japan, Mexico, and so on. The artists were looking at and looking for different ways of conceiving of the decorative. In many non-Western cultures or artistic traditions, there is no hierarchy of fine art and decorative art. In many cultures there is no distinction between art and craft, or fine art and applied art. This was enormously valuable to P&D artists as they were analyzing, and seeking to rethink the bias against the decorative in which they had been inculcated\u2014in Western European art histories and theories. Again, this movement was motivated in large part by feminism, and sought to undermine or overturn the gender and racial biases that had been used to create the historical categories and value systems of Western art.\n\nDE What were some of the surprises for you in the course of organizing the exhibition? And what do you hope that viewers come away with from the show, and the book?\n\nAK There were two surprises for me in the process of curating With Pleasure. One is that there were no exhibitions of P&D when I started to work on it, but in the three years it took to realize the exhibition, several other P&D shows have emerged. This let me know that other people were seeing what I was seeing with regard to the importance of the P&D movement at this moment, and that I was not an outlier.\n\nThe other surprise for me was to see how easy it is to unlearn your taste. I didn\u2019t embark on this show because P&D reflected or validated my own personal esthetic taste and judgement. I was motivated as a scholar to research the movement, which seemed to be an unfairly neglected area of recent art history. My own taste changed not just from looking at these works but from spending time with the artists. The experience made me think about and analyze my own biases when looking at art, and in that way, forced me to unlearn my taste.\n\nI certainly hope that readers will come away with a different\u2014and better\u2014understanding of this period in American art, and see that there was much more going on than has been previously or consistently presented. I also hope that they rethink their taste in art as much as I did in the process of putting the exhibition together.\n\nAnna Katz is curator at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\n\nDavid Ebony is a contributing editor of Art in America magazine, and the author of numerous artist monographs.

Not only did the duo meet in their early teens as part of an evangelical Christian hip-hop troupe \u2014 hardly a commonplace source of indie talent \u2014 but it seems that with every diminishment of their ranks, the Philadelphians get stronger. Their debut release, The (Im)possibility of Longing, was the product of a five-strong line-up; All Together, their third, is born of only two core members, but is perhaps their finest.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising: the record melds together myriad styles, but ultimately has, like its makers, two central identities, one organic, the other drawing in elements of technology and modernity. Chris Ward\u2019s industrious, unprocessed, and often tempestuous beats form the record\u2019s framework, while extra layers of texture are added by various guest musicians bringing to the fore violins, brass, and guitar, but All Together is still grounded enough in keyboard stabs and hip-hop-style breakdowns to be labelled electronica.\n\nIndeed, Pattern Is Movement\u2019s unlikely foundations (the apparently comfortable union of Dr. Dre and Pentecostalism was a feature of both Ward\u2019s and vocalist Andrew Thiboldeux\u2019s youths) aren\u2019t entirely without trace here. Though their polyrhythmic soundscapes might be a world away from the rap side of the deal, Thiboldeux\u2019s swooning falsetto does often suggests Caribou kingpin Daniel Snaith exorcising his inner choirboy, while there\u2019s also a sense of the genre-bridging akin to that of Why?. But if this suggests a heavy sense of the opaque, it shouldn\u2019t distract from what truly makes All Together an enticing prospect: the melodic richness that it upholds throughout. Though the individual parts of All Together \u2014 the distinctive vocals, repetitive refrains, keyboard bleeps and jabs, laced with luscious strings and all held together by deconstructive beats \u2014 seem primed for a challenging listen, the end result is nothing of the sort.\n\nInstead, Pattern\u2019s music is gleefully fun at times, rivalling Pinback for sheer melodic exuberance even as it threatens wilful obscurity. Opener \u201cBird\u201d switches to-and-fro between droning keyboards and sparkly twinkles, Thiboldeux\u2019s vocals bordering all the while on the operatic, yet the song is contagious in both its energy and prettiness. \u201cRight Away\u201d is similarly double-edged, opening with a sense of brooding thunder that is periodically intercepted by the sunshine of Daniel Hart\u2019s guesting violin and Thiboldeux\u2019s keys, marching all the while to Ward\u2019s head-nodding beat.\n\nIt\u2019s this interplay between the many textures of Pattern\u2019s music that makes All Together so captivating, and the uneducated would surely never guess the shrunken ranks of the band by listening alone. \u201cPeach Trees\u201d links together neat vocal harmonies and tip-toeing keyboard, but it\u2019s the repeated violin excerpt that orchestrates proceedings. Guest musicians again come to the fore on \u201cSound of Your Voice\u201d, where the insistent parping of trumpet induces an atmosphere of panic, before again Thiboldeux\u2019s twinkling keys break the tension. Indeed, the interaction between All Together\u2018s instrumentation gives the impression of a larger outfit of seasoned musicians, all so well acquainted with each others\u2019 strengths and weaknesses as to be entirely comfortable.\n\nThe record is accompanied by a set of photographs (not included with press copies, so no comment on them) each providing inspiration for an individual song. As nice a touch as that is, it could just as easily to tied to some specific environment or animation, such is the sense of life here. Each song is like a microcosmic journey, every one colourful and distinct. There\u2019s the odd reference point here and there on All Together \u2014 there\u2019s shades of Amnesiac-era Radiohead in the avant-pop atmosphere that pervades much of the album, while the more pastoral elements remind of Midlake at times \u2014 but Pattern Is Movement as a whole are utterly unique, something which is most definitely to their credit."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/transportation-infrastructure/", "page_content": "Since the development of the world\u2019s earliest civilizations, people have needed to move themselves and their goods from one place to another. As world populations have grown over time, so has the need for better and more advanced systems of transportation.\n\n\n\nTransportation is the movement of goods and people from one place to another. In ancient times, people crafted simple boats out of logs, walked, rode animals and, later, devised wheeled vehicles to move from place to place. They used existing waterways or simple roads for transportation. Over time, people built more complex means of transportation. They learned how to harness various sources of power, such as wind, steam, and combustion, to move barges, ships, trains, automobiles, and airplanes. These new means of transportation required people to change their environments by building transportation infrastructure. Transportation infrastructure is the underlying system of public works designed to facilitate movement.\n\n\n\nPast peoples, such as the ancient Egyptians, built ports in coastal areas for bringing and receiving goods. They also adapted internal natural waterways using dams or other means, to make them navigable. Ancient people also constructed artificial waterways called canals to move goods from place to place. Canals continued to be an important part of transportation infrastructure in societies around the world, particularly in Europe and China during the Middle Ages. Canal building in the United States reached its peak during the mid-1800s, but in other places, such as the Netherlands, canals are still an important part of the transportation infrastructure .\n\n\n\nOverland travel has also changed over time. Historic civilizations, including the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, and Romans, built roads and highways out of earth and stones to connect cities and rural areas. Roadbuilding in Europe and elsewhere improved during 1600s and 1700s, with increased trade and better vehicles.\n\n\n\nWith the development of the steam locomotive in the early 1800s, people began to build railways to take advantage of train travel, particularly in the United States and Britain. By the mid-1800s, workers had constructed around 11,000 kilometers (7,000 miles) of railroad track in England and Wales. In the United States, by 1900, there were more than 320,000 kilometers (200,000 miles) of track. Also during the mid-1800s, people developed means of building railways underground. The world\u2019s first subway line was opened in London, England, in 1863. Subways are still an important part of transportation infrastructure in many of the world\u2019s largest cities.\n\n\n\nAutomobile ownership became widespread by the mid-1900s, particularly in the United States and Europe, and people with cars soon demanded better roads. These roads would allow them to move away from cities and the need for mass transportation. Communities and governments rebuilt their roads, and major highway systems developed over time. European countries were the first to develop highway systems. In the United States, public demand from the 1930s to the 1950s led to government funding of the massive U.S. interstate roadway system.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://patternismovement.bandcamp.com/album/light-of-the-world-ep", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download\n\nIncludes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.\n\nPurchasable with gift card"}, {"url": "https://patternismovement.bandcamp.com/album/all-together", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download Includes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.

The two met at the ages of 13 and 14 --- as part of a Christian hip hop group. Raised in strict Pentecostal households and schools (see Jesus Camp), both Andrew and Chris found refuge in their shared love for Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic --- and a friendship born out of secular escape turned into a creative collaboration. In high school, hand-me-down church sound equipment and a weekend obsession with making and recording music provided the means for what became Pattern is Movement.\n\n\n\nAll Together continues the mysterious narrative of the band and it exalts their existence as a two-man wall of sound. The pounding energy of their live show --- with Chris and Andrew side-by-side, simultaneously hammering their instruments, sweat flying --- resides in ten exquisitely constructed tracks. In the studio (Scott Solter\u2019s), every idea was given its voice; a range of guest instruments embellished the core magic of Andrew\u2019s vocals and keys and Chris\u2019 drums. All Together embraces the vocabulary of the band\u2019s experienced and obsessive recording language, yet it holds on to that unmistakable dynamism of their live performance.\n\n\n\nFurthering All Together\u2019s lore is its song-by-song relationship to a series of old photographs. Found by Andrew\u2019s brother on the street in Philly, ten tiny early 20th century images formed Pattern is Movement\u2019s own set of Oblique Strategies. Each photo abstractly inspired a song and its final form on the record, with Andrew and Chris even referring to the pictures during tracking. The record\u2019s name also arose from the connotation of this found collection: though essentially disparate, we\u2019re ultimately all together in our experience. Once time passes, all our pictures tell the same story.\n\ncredits\n\nreleased April 1, 2008\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States/Settlement-patterns", "page_content": "Although the land that now constitutes the United States was occupied and much affected by diverse Indian cultures over many millennia, these pre-European settlement patterns have had virtually no impact upon the contemporary nation\u2014except locally, as in parts of New Mexico. A benign habitat permitted a huge contiguous tract of settled land to materialize across nearly all the eastern half of the United States and within substantial patches of the West. The vastness of the land, the scarcity of labour, and the abundance of migratory opportunities in a land replete with raw physical resources contributed to exceptional human mobility and a quick succession of ephemeral forms of land use and settlement. Human endeavours have greatly transformed the landscape, but such efforts have been largely destructive. Most of the pre-European landscape in the United States was so swiftly and radically altered that it is difficult to conjecture intelligently about its earlier appearance.\n\nThe overall impression of the settled portion of the American landscape, rural or urban, is one of disorder and incoherence, even in areas of strict geometric survey. The individual landscape unit is seldom in visual harmony with its neighbour, so that, however sound in design or construction the single structure may be, the general effect is untidy. These attributes have been intensified by the acute individualism of the American, vigorous speculation in land and other commodities, a strongly utilitarian attitude toward the land and the treasures above and below it, and government policy and law. The landscape is also remarkable for its extensive transportation facilities, which have greatly influenced the configuration of the land.\n\nAnother special characteristic of American settlement, one that became obvious only by the mid-20th century, is the convergence of rural and urban modes of life. The farmsteads\u2014and rural folk in general\u2014have become increasingly urbanized, and agricultural operations have become more automated, while the metropolis grows more gelatinous, unfocused, and pseudo-bucolic along its margins.\n\nRural settlement\n\nPatterns of rural settlement indicate much about the history, economy, society, and minds of those who created them as well as about the land itself. The essential design of rural activity in the United States bears a strong family resemblance to that of other neo-European lands, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, or tsarist Siberia\u2014places that have undergone rapid occupation and exploitation by immigrants intent upon short-term development and enrichment. In all such areas, under novel social and political conditions and with a relative abundance of territory and physical resources, ideas and institutions derived from a relatively stable medieval or early modern Europe have undergone major transformation. Further, these are nonpeasant countrysides, alike in having failed to achieve the intimate symbiosis of people and habitat, the humanized rural landscapes characteristic of many relatively dense, stable, earthbound communities in parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.\n\nEarly models of land allocation From the beginning the prevalent official policy of the British (except between 1763 and 1776) and then of the U.S. government was to promote agricultural and other settlement\u2014to push the frontier westward as fast as physical and economic conditions permitted. The British crown\u2019s grants of large, often vaguely specified tracts to individual proprietors or companies enabled the grantees to draw settlers by the sale or lease of land at attractive prices or even by outright gift. Of the numerous attempts at group colonization, the most notable effort was the theocratic and collectivist New England town that flourished, especially in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, during the first century of settlement. The town, the basic unit of government and comparable in area to townships in other states, allotted both rural and village parcels to single families by group decision. Contrary to earlier scholarly belief, in all but a few cases settlement was spatially dispersed in the socially cohesive towns, at least until about 1800. The relatively concentrated latter-day villages persist today as amoeba-like entities straggling along converging roads, neither fully rural nor agglomerated in form. The only latter-day settlement experiment of notable magnitude to achieve enduring success was a series of Mormon settlements in the Great Basin region of Utah and adjacent states, with their tightly concentrated farm villages reminiscent of the New England model. Other efforts have been made along ethnic, religious, or political lines, but success has been at best brief and fragile.\n\nCreating the national domain With the coming of independence and after complex negotiations, the original 13 states surrendered to the new national government nearly all their claims to the unsettled western lands beyond their boundaries. Some tracts, however, were reserved for disposal to particular groups. Thus, the Western Reserve of northeastern Ohio gave preferential treatment to natives of Connecticut, while the military tracts in Ohio and Indiana were used as bonus payments to veterans of the American Revolution. A federally administered national domain was created, to which the great bulk of the territory acquired in 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and later beyond the Mississippi and in 1819 in Florida was consigned. The only major exceptions were the public lands of Texas, which were left within that state\u2019s jurisdiction; such earlier French and Spanish land grants as were confirmed, often after tortuous litigation; and some Indian lands. In sharp contrast to the slipshod methods of colonial land survey and disposal, the federal land managers expeditiously surveyed, numbered, and mapped their territory in advance of settlement, beginning with Ohio in the 1780s, then sold or deeded it to settlers under inviting terms at a number of regional land offices. The design universally followed in the new survey system (except within the French, Spanish, and Indian grants) was a simple, efficient rectangular scheme. Townships were laid out as blocks, each six by six miles in size, oriented with the compass directions. Thirty-six sections, each one square mile, or 640 acres (260 hectares), in size, were designated within each township; and public roads were established along section lines and, where needed, along half-section lines. At irregular intervals, offsets in survey lines and roads were introduced to allow for the Earth\u2019s curvature. Individual property lines were coincident with, or parallel to, survey lines, and this pervasive rectangularity generally carried over into the geometry of fields and fences or into the townsites later superimposed upon the basic rural survey. This all-encompassing checkerboard pattern is best appreciated from an airplane window over Iowa or Kansas. There one sees few streams or other natural features and few diagonal highways or railroads interrupting the overwhelming squareness of the landscape. A systematic rectangular layout, rather less rigorous in form, also appears in much of Texas and in those portions of Maine, western New York and Pennsylvania, and southern Georgia that were settled after the 1780s.\n\nDistribution of rural lands Since its formation, Congress has enacted a series of complex schemes for distribution of the national domain. The most famous of these plans was the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered title to 160 acres to individual settlers, subject only to residence for a certain period of time and to the making of minimal improvements to the land thus acquired. The legal provisions of such acts have varied with time as the nature of farming technology and of the remaining lands have changed, but their general effect has been to perpetuate the Jeffersonian ideal of a republic in which yeoman farmers own and till self-sufficient properties. The program was successful in providing private owners with relatively choice lands, aside from parcels reserved for schools and various township and municipal uses. More than one-third of the national territory, however, is still owned by federal and state governments, with much of this land in forest and wildlife preserves. A large proportion of this land is in the West and is unsuited for intensive agriculture or grazing because of the roughness, dryness, or salinity of the terrain; much of it is leased out for light grazing or for timber cutting.\n\nPatterns of farm life During the classic period of American rural life, around 1900, the typical American lived or worked on a farm or was economically dependent upon farmers. In contrast to rural life in many other parts of the world, the farm family lived on an isolated farmstead some distance from town and often from farm neighbours; its property averaged less than one-quarter square mile. This farmstead varied in form and content with local tradition and economy. In particular, barn types were localized\u2014for example, the tobacco barns of the South, the great dairy barns of Wisconsin, or the general-purpose forebay barns of southeastern Pennsylvania\u2014as were modes of fencing. In general, however, the farmstead contained dwelling, barn, storage and sheds for small livestock and equipment, a small orchard, and a kitchen garden. A woodlot might be found in the least-accessible or least-fertile part of the farm. Successions of such farms were connected with one another and with the towns by means of a dense, usually rectangular lattice of roads, largely unimproved at the time. The hamlets, villages, and smaller cities were arrayed at relatively regular intervals, with size and affluence determined in large part by the presence and quality of rail service or status as the county seat. But, among people who have been historically rural, individualistic, and antiurban in bias, many services normally located in urban places might be found in rustic settings. Thus, much retail business was transacted by means of itinerant peddlers, while small shops for the fabrication, distribution, or repair of various items were often located in isolated farmsteads, as were many post offices. Social activity also tended to be widely dispersed among numerous rural churches, schools, or grange halls; and the climactic event of the year might well be the county fair, political rally, or religious encampment\u2014again on a rural site. Not the least symptomatic sign of the strong tendency toward spatial isolation are the countless family burial plots or community cemeteries so liberally distributed across the countryside."}, {"url": "https://patternismovement.bandcamp.com/album/canonic-scott-solter-plays-pattern-is-movement", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download Includes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.

During this special seminar, the Central Committee hopes that we will gain an accurate understanding of the new stage of development through extensive discussions and exchanges of experience, with a view to fully implementing the new development philosophy, accelerating our efforts to create a new development dynamic, and promoting high-quality development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). Doing so will see us setting the stage for building a modern socialist country in all respects.\n\nI have spoken of the importance of studying and applying the guiding principles of the Fifth Plenary Session both at the Session itself and on many other occasions, such as meetings of the Central Committee Political Bureau and its Standing Committee, the Central Economic Work Conference, and the Central Rural Work Conference. Today, I would like to focus on the following four subjects.\n\nFirst, we need to have an accurate understanding of the new stage of development.\n\nAn accurate understanding of the historical stage that the cause of our Party and people has entered is essential for defining the central task of the current period and setting the guidelines, principles, and policies for our work. This is an important practice our Party has used to move from victory to victory in leading China's revolution, development, and reform.\n\nDuring the new-democratic revolution, our Party came to realize during the course of its arduous explorations that the Chinese revolution would have to pass through the historical stage of New Democracy. Based on this understanding, it set the tasks, strategies, and tactics that enabled it to lead the people to win the Chinese revolution. When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, our Party was keenly aware that a transitional period would be required to move from new democracy to socialism. It accordingly formulated a general guideline for this period, which enabled our country to complete its socialist revolution and move smoothly into the period of socialist development. Following the introduction of the reform and opening up policy in 1978, it reviewed the positive and negative experiences of socialist development around the world, and particularly in China, and reached the major conclusion that China was in the primary stage of socialism and would remain in that stage for a long time to come. Accordingly, it set the basic guideline that ushered in a brand new phase of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the Central Committee has built on the sustained efforts of our predecessors by pursuing coordinated implementation of the Five-sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-pronged Comprehensive Strategy. As a result, we have witnessed historic achievements and developments in the cause of our Party and the country, as socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era.\n\nFrom Jan 18 to 20, 2021, President Xi toured Beijing and Hebei province and presided over a meeting reporting on preparations for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. On the afternoon of Jan 19, he visited Taizicheng Station on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed rail line.

This strategic judgment was made based on the following considerations.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, Marxism blends high ideals with practical tasks, and insists on the unity between historical inevitability and the stage-specific nature of development, in the belief that as human society moves inexorably toward communism, it must complete certain historical stages along the way. While applying the basic tenets of Marxism to the practical problems of China, our Party came to realize that the development of socialism did not only constitute one continuous historical process, but was made up of different stages. Between late 1959 and early 1960, Mao Zedong wrote in his reading notes on the Soviet textbook Political Economy that \"It is possible to divide the period of socialism into two stages: one could be called underdeveloped socialism and one comparatively developed socialism. This latter stage,\" he noted, \"may take even longer than the first.\" In 1987, Deng Xiaoping stated that \"Socialism itself is the first stage of communism, and here in China we are still in the primary stage of socialism\u2014that is, the underdeveloped stage. In everything we do we must proceed from this reality, and all planning must be consistent with it.\" The new development stage we are in today is just one part of the primary stage of socialism, but thanks to many decades of hard work, it is a period that marks a new starting point for us.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, this new stage will see our Party lead the people in completing the historic transformation from standing up and becoming prosperous to growing strong. After its founding in 1921, the CPC united with and led the people through a bitter, 28 year-long struggle to establish the People's Republic of China and make the historic transition from new-democratic revolution to socialist revolution. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, our Party led the people in creatively carrying out a socialist transformation by establishing socialism as China's basic system and promoting socialist economic and cultural progress on a large scale. The Chinese people not only stood up, but stood firmly on their own feet and completed the historic transition from socialist revolution to socialist development. On entering a new historical period, it led the people in launching the great new revolution of reform and opening up, which sparked tremendous enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity among all of our people and opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. As China made large strides in catching up with the times, it took yet another huge leap forward along the course of socialist modernization and embraced the bright prospects of national rejuvenation. Building on the development of the past, we are now writing the new chapter of building China into a modern socialist country in all respects.\n\nIn terms of the present reality, we now possess a solid material foundation for embarking on a new journey toward an even higher goal. Thanks to the tireless efforts made since the PRC's founding, and especially in the past 40-odd years since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy, China reached new levels in economic strength, scientific and technological capability, composite national strength, and living standards by the end of the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020). China is now the world's second largest economy, the largest industrial nation, the largest trader of goods, and the largest holder of foreign exchange reserves. China's GDP has exceeded RMB100 trillion yuan and stands at over $10,000 in per capita terms. Permanent urban residents account for over 60% of the population, and the middle-income group has grown to over 400 million. Particularly noteworthy are our historic achievements of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and eliminating absolute poverty\u2014a problem which has plagued our nation for thousands of years. These are significant milestones in our process of socialist modernization, and lay a solid foundation for marching toward the Second Centenary Goal during the new stage of development.\n\nShortly after the founding of the PRC, our Party put forward the goal of building a modern socialist country. Over the course of 13 five-year plans, we have laid a solid foundation for achieving this goal. The next 30 years make up the development stage in which we will finally complete this great ambition. We have worked out the roadmap and timetable for our development going forward. By 2035, or within three five-year plan periods, we will basically achieve socialist modernization. Then, by the middle of this century, after completing another three five-year plans, China will become a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful.\n\nThe world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. Recently, the world situation could be best described by the word \"chaos,\" and it appears that this trend will continue for quite some time. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the leadership capacities and strengths of the social systems of all countries. The fact that time and momentum are on our side gives us self-assurance, resolve, and confidence.\n\nThat said, we must fully recognize that although China remains in an important period of strategic opportunity for development, and will remain so for some time to come, the opportunities and challenges we face are changing. Though both are unprecedented in their extent, the opportunities generally outweigh the challenges. An ancient Chinese sage once said that we should handle the easy and small things cautiously so as to avoid difficulties and disasters. All of us in the Party must remain modest, prudent, and committed to hard work; we must mobilize all positive factors, unite with all forces that can be united with, and focus on running our own affairs well, as we work unswervingly toward our objectives.\n\nOur task is to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects. Of course, the modernization we are pursuing has distinctive Chinese features and is tailored to the realities of China. At the Fifth Plenary Session, I underscored five characteristics in particular. China's modernization must cover a massive population, lead to common prosperity, deliver both material and cultural-ethical progress, promote harmony between humanity and nature, and proceed along a path of peaceful development. This is the direction modernization in China must follow. It must be embodied in our principles, policies, strategies, measures, and work plans to enable the Party and the Chinese people to work together toward this end.\n\nThe new stage of development is an important part of socialist development in our country. In 1992, Deng Xiaoping stated that \"We have been building socialism for only a few decades and are still in the primary stage. It will take a very long historical period to consolidate and develop the socialist system, and it will require persistent struggle by several generations, a dozen or even several dozens. We can never rest on our oars.\" In my opinion, Deng made this remark from a political point of view. He was pointing out that it would take a fairly long period of hard work to turn China into a modern country based on the weak economic foundation of the time. But he was also stressing that we must persist with China's socialist system from one generation to the next, even after modernization is achieved. We must work continuously to find ways to consolidate and develop socialism, for no solution can last forever once developed. Mao Zedong once said that \"All things have their boundaries. The way things develop is that one stage leads to another, advancing without interruption. But each and every stage has a 'boundary.' To deny the 'boundary' is to deny qualitative changes or partial qualitative changes.\" The primary stage of socialism is not a static, cast-iron, or stagnant period, nor is it a spontaneous and passive stage that can easily and naturally be passed through. Rather, it is a stage of dynamism, action, and promise, one that should always brim with vitality. It develops gradually but ceaselessly, moving from quantitative increases to qualitative leaps. Fully building a modern socialist China and basically realizing socialist modernization are essential for China's development in the primary stage of socialism, and essential for China to advance from the primary stage to a higher stage of socialism.\n\nSecond, we need to fully apply the new development philosophy.\n\nFor our Party, one very important part of leading the people in governing the country is answering the major questions of what kind of development China should pursue and how it should pursue it. On October 29, 2015, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, I stated, \"Principles are precursors to actions. All actions in development are guided by principles of development, and it is these principles that ultimately determine the effectiveness of development and its success or failure. Experience tells us that development is a process of constant change, and that the environments and conditions in which development takes place are both subject to change. Therefore, it is only natural that principles of development should also be subject to change.\"\n\nPresident Xi toured Guizhou province, Feb 3-5, 2021, where he visited with officials and members of the public and conveyed his Spring Festival greetings to all people across the nation.

PHOTO BY XINHUA REPORTER XIE HUANCHI\n\nSince the 18th National Congress in 2012, our Party has, based on the careful assessment of the economic situation, made timely adjustments to our development principles and approach, which have given rise to historic achievements and shifts in the economic development of our country. Here, I would like to mention the most significant of these developments.\n\nFirst, we have committed to a people-centered philosophy of development. In my address to the domestic and foreign press during the debut of the Standing Committee of 18th Central Committee Political Bureau on November 15, 2012, I stressed that \"The people yearn for a better life, our goal is to help them achieve it, and we must unswervingly follow the path of common prosperity.\" At the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee on October 29, 2015, I put forward the vision of people-centered development. At the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee on October 29, 2020, I further underscored the need to strive for substantive progress in promoting common prosperity for all our people.\n\nSecond, we have changed the thinking that the GDP growth rate is the sole barometer of success. At the Central Economic Work Conference on December 15, 2012, I stressed that we cannot blindly pursue rapid growth without regard for objective laws and conditions. At a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee Political Bureau on April 25, 2013, I stressed that local governments should not take national regulatory targets as the baseline for local economic development, nor should they compete with each other to have higher growth rates. I said that we needed to shift the focus to improving the quality and returns of economic growth, to promoting sustained and healthy economic development, and to pursuing genuine rather than inflated GDP growth and achieving high-quality, efficient, and sustainable development.\n\nOn Feb 22, 2021, Party and state leaders including Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, and Han Zheng met with research and operations personnel who took part in the Chang'e 5 lunar exploration mission at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi Jinping and others are pictured here viewing a display showing samples brought back from the moon and explaining the results of the mission. PHOTO BY XINHUA REPORTER LI XUEREN\n\nThird, China's economy entered a period defined by three overlapping phases. At a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee Political Bureau on July 25, 2013, I noted that our economy was now in a slowing growth phase, a painful structural adjustment phase, and a phase of absorbing the adverse effects of previous stimulus policies. I emphasized that, at the same time, the world economy was also in a period of profound adjustment, which made for an extremely complex economic development environment. This required us to gain a proper understanding of the characteristics of the current stage of Chinese economic development and to undertake practical reforms and adjustments.\n\nFourth, China's economic development entered a new normal. I put forward this proposition at the Central Economic Work Conference on December 10, 2013. At the Central Economic Work Conference on December 9 of the following year, I analyzed new development trends in nine respects to explain why economic development had entered a new normal. I emphasized that understanding the new normal, adapting to it, and guiding its development constituted the major theme of China's economic development both at present and in the period ahead.\n\nFifth, we have enabled the market to play the decisive role in resource allocation and given better play to the role of the government. I stated at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in November 2013 that the market is the most efficient means of allocating resources. A general law of market economies is that the market should determine the allocation of resources. I thus highlighted the need to let the market play the decisive role in resource allocation, thereby redefining the role of the market.\n\nSixth, we have committed to the idea that lucid waters and lush mountains are as precious as mountains of silver and gold. I put forward this concept during a speech at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan on September 7, 2013. I emphasized that developing an ecological civilization and building a beautiful China constitute a strategic task, because we need to make sure we leave behind a beautiful homeland with blue skies, green fields, and clean waters for our future generations. I reiterated this point during a talk with the Guizhou delegation at the Second Session of the 12th National People's Congress on March 7, 2014.\n\nSeventh, we have introduced the new development philosophy. I proposed the idea of innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in October 2015. I noted that innovative development was focused on addressing the issue of growth drivers, coordinated development on redressing imbalances, green development on creating harmony between humanity and nature, open development on coordinating internal and external development, and shared development on ensuring social equity and justice. I stated that the introduction of the new development philosophy marked a fundamental change for the entire development context of our country.\n\nEighth, we have initiated supply-side structural reform. At the meeting of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs on November 10, 2015, I said that we should make great efforts to promote supply-side structural reform. I stated at the Central Economic Work Conference on December 18, 2015 that the five priorities in promoting supply-side structural reform were cutting overcapacity, reducing excess inventory, deleveraging, reducing costs, and strengthening areas of weakness. At the Central Economic Work Conference on December 19, 2018, I put forward the policy of consolidating the gains in the five priority tasks, strengthening the dynamism of micro entities, upgrading industrial chains, and ensuring unimpeded flows in the economy. I pointed out that this policy constituted a general requirement for furthering supply-side structural reform and spurring high-quality economic development both at present and in the period ahead.\n\nNinth, we must deal with unbalanced and inadequate development. At the 19th CPC National Congress held in October 2017, I concluded that the principal challenge facing Chinese society had evolved into one between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's growing needs for a better life. I emphasized that this represented a historic shift that affected the whole landscape.\n\nTenth, we must deliver high-quality development. At the same congress, I pointed out that China's economy was transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. We arrived at this conclusion based on the change in the principal challenge facing Chinese society. In this stage, we need to follow the new development philosophy.\n\nEleventh, we must modernize our economic system. As I said in the same speech, this is both an urgent requirement for getting us smoothly through this critical transition and a strategic goal for China's development.\n\nTwelfth, we have moved to create a new development dynamic that focuses on domestic economic flow and features positive interplay between domestic flow and international engagement. I put forward this concept at a meeting of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs on April 10, 2020.\n\nThirteenth, we have adopted a coordinated approach to development and security. I stressed at a group study session of the Central Committee Political Bureau on May 29, 2015 that we must firmly keep in mind the concept of ensuring security in development. On January 18, 2016, I analyzed the risks and challenges in four fields we faced on the path of open development at a seminar for provincial and ministerial level officials. On January 5, 2018, in a speech at a seminar for new members and alternative members of the CPC Central Committee and principal provincial and ministerial level leaders, I listed 16 risks in 8 areas that required our full attention. On January 21, 2019, we held a seminar for provincial and ministerial level officials on remaining mindful of worst-case scenarios and guarding against and defusing major risks. At the opening session of that seminar, I pointed out that we should guard against and defuse major risks in the political, ideological, economic, scientific and technological, and social domains and in China-US trade frictions, in foreign affairs, and within our Party. I also set forward clear requirements for these tasks, and emphasized the need to always maintain a high level of vigilance, remaining alert to \"black swan\" events and \"grey rhino\" risks.\n\nIn reviewing this course of events, I wish to underscore the theories and concepts on economic and social development that we have put forward since our Party's 18th National Congress in 2012. Of these theories and concepts, the new development philosophy is the most important. As a theoretical system, it addresses a series of theoretical and practical issues regarding our development goals, drivers, methods, and approaches, and delineates the major political issues with regard to our political stance, values, and model and path of development. The whole Party must fully and faithfully implement the new development philosophy on all fronts. In doing so, we should focus on the following points.\n\n1. We must understand the fundamental aim of the new development philosophy.\n\nAs an old saying goes, \"As vast as heaven and earth may be, the people must always come first.\" The people represent the deepest foundation and the greatest source of confidence for our Party in governing the country. Working for the wellbeing of the people and the rejuvenation of the nation is the immutable aim of our Party in leading the modernization drive, and the root and essence of the new development philosophy. We will only have the right view of development and modernization if we follow a people-centered approach, insisting that development is for the people, reliant on the people, and that its fruits should be shared by the people. The Soviet Union was the world's first socialist country and once enjoyed spectacular success. Ultimately however, it collapsed, mainly because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union became detached from the people and turned into a group of privileged bureaucrats concerned only with protecting their own interests. Even in a modernized country, if a governing party turns its back on the people, it will imperil the fruits of modernization.\n\nPresident Xi toured Fujian province, March 22-25, 2021. He is seen in this photo inspecting the spring tea crop and learning about the development of the local tea industry at an eco-friendly tea farm in Nanping, afternoon of March 22. PHOTO BY XINHUA REPORTER JU PENG\n\nRealizing common prosperity is more than an economic goal. It is a major political issue that bears on our Party's governance foundation. We cannot allow the gap between the rich and the poor to continue growing\u2014for the poor to keep getting poorer while the rich continue growing richer. We cannot permit the wealth gap to become an unbridgeable gulf. Of course, common prosperity should be realized in a gradual way that gives full consideration to what is necessary and what is possible and adheres to the laws governing social and economic development. At the same time, however, we cannot afford to just sit around and wait. We must be proactive about narrowing the gaps between regions, between urban and rural areas, and between rich and poor people. We should promote all-around social progress and well-rounded personal development, and advocate social fairness and justice, so that our people enjoy the fruits of development in a fairer way. We should see that people have a stronger sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security and make them feel that common prosperity is not an empty slogan but a concrete fact that they can see and feel for themselves.\n\nPresident Xi chats with teachers and students at the Imaging and Intelligence Technology Laboratory at Tsinghua University, April 19, 2021, shortly before the school marked its 110th anniversary. PHOTO BY XINHUA REPORTER HUANG JINGWEN\n\n2. We need to stay problem-oriented.\n\nThe China of today stands at a new historical starting point in development. In light of development requirements in the new stage, we need to stick to a problem-oriented approach so that we can implement the new development philosophy with even greater precision. We need to effectively address the issues relating to unbalanced and insufficient development in order to make our development high-quality. For example, greater self-reliance in science and technology, which is essential for us to sustain and develop ourselves, has been hampered by many bottlenecks. The development gap between urban and rural areas and between regions is still too large, and the question of how exactly we should solve this problem involves extensive research into many new issues. In particular, we need to present clear approaches in response to regional divergence and reorganization, accelerated population migration across regions, and the decreasing willingness among rural residents to settle in cities. There is broad consensus about promoting a green transformation in every aspect of economic and social development. But our energy system is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels such as coal, which puts a great strain on the efforts to realize a green and low-carbon transformation in our production modes and ways of life. The targets of reaching peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 are extremely formidable. Given the backlash against economic globalization and the complex and changeable external environment, we need to strike a good balance between greater self-reliance and openness and cooperation, between participation in the international division of labor and the safeguarding of national security, and between utilized foreign investment and security reviews, so that China can open wider to the outside world while guaranteeing its national security. In short, as we enter a new stage of development, we need to deepen our understanding of the new development philosophy, so that we can take more targeted and more concrete measures that will truly deliver high-quality development.\n\n3. We must be mindful of the difficulties ahead.\n\nGood planning and preparation are the keys to avoiding difficulties and hardships. As the principal contradiction in Chinese society has changed and the global balance of power is steadily shifting, China will have to contend with more internal and external risks in development than before. We must be more aware of potential dangers, keep in mind worst-case scenarios, and be prepared for more complex and graver situations. The Central Committee prioritized issues of security in its Recommendations for Formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035. It emphasized that we should ensure security in all areas and throughout the entire process of China's development. If our underlying security foundations are not solid, the entire edifice of our development will come under threat. We must uphold the unity between political security, the safety of the people, and the interests of the nation, be ready to stand up for ourselves and be adept at doing so, and work to increase our overall strengths, especially the strength of our deterrence.\n\nWe should prevent major fluctuations in the macro economy and avoid large inflows and withdrawals of foreign investment in the capital market. We must ensure the security of food, energy, and major resource supplies, as well as the stability and security of industrial and supply chains. We need to prevent the disorderly expansion and unchecked growth of capital, and ensure environmental and workplace safety. We should guard against the risk of large-scale job losses, strengthen public health security, and effectively prevent and handle public disturbances. In strengthening the systems for safeguarding national security, we should draw on experiences from other countries, work out how to set necessary security barriers and locks at different stages, and identify effective solutions for various national security issues.\n\nThird, we need to accelerate the creation of a new development dynamic.\n\nThe Recommendations for Formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035 defined the creation of a new development dynamic that focuses on domestic flow and features positive interplay between domestic flow and international engagement as a major strategic task that concerned China's overall development interests. This task must be correctly understood and actively promoted according to the overall situation.\n\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a backlash against economic globalization and profound adjustments to the circulation patterns in the international economy. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the trend of deglobalization, and many countries have now become more inward-looking. When the epidemic was prevalent, I visited several provinces around the country to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation on epidemic containment and investigate the problems that had emerged in reopening the economy. During my visit to Zhejiang Province, I found that global industrial and supply chains had been partially disrupted due to the pandemic. This had directly impacted flows in the domestic economy. Many companies were forced to suspend operations because they could not bring in the raw materials and personnel they needed or send their goods overseas. I realized just how much things had changed; the environments and conditions that had facilitated largescale imports and exports were no longer in place. Given these new circumstances, we needed to come up with new thinking to steer development. Accordingly, in April last year I proposed that we create a new development dynamic that focused on domestic flow and featured positive interplay between domestic flow and international engagement. At the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee in October 2020, we made comprehensive arrangements for this task. The establishment of the new development dynamic is a strategic and proactive step for taking the initiative in development, a major historic mission that must be fulfilled in the new development stage, and an important measure for applying the new development philosophy.\n\nAs a socialist country with a large population and a vast market, China is certain to encounter various pressures and stern challenges in the process of modernization, the likes of which no other country will have ever experienced. In 1936, Mao Zedong made a remark that still holds true for us even today. He said, \"No matter how complicated, grave, and harsh the circumstances, what a military leader needs most of all is the ability to function independently in organizing and employing the forces under his command. He may often be forced into a passive position by the enemy, but the important thing is to regain the initiative quickly. Failure to do so spells defeat. The initiative is not something imaginary but is concrete and material.\" If we can, by dint of our own efforts, ensure unimpeded domestic flow to effectively shield ourselves from harm, we will have the vigor and vitality to not only survive but thrive amid volatile international situations, making it impossible for anyone to keep us down or to back us into a corner. We must speed up our efforts to create a new development dynamic, so that no matter the challenges or difficulties we encounter, whether anticipated or not, we will be better able to survive, compete, and maintain sustainable development. This way, we can ensure the course of national rejuvenation is never delayed or interrupted.\n\nIn practice, there are some misunderstandings that we need to guard against. First, some people tend to only speak about the first half, or the domestic flow element as the main factor, of the new development dynamic, and call for China to sharply reverse its opening to the outside world. Second, some others speak only of the latter half, or the positive interplay between domestic flow and international engagement, and still subscribe to the old development dynamic of large-scale imports and exports with two ends of the economic process\u2014markets and resources\u2014being located abroad, despite the changes to the international landscape. Third, acting in one's own way and only focusing on one's own sphere of interest is also a mistake. Some are neglecting the task of building a unified national market and promoting overall domestic flow, preferring instead to focus on their own local or regional market. Fourth, some have equated unimpeded economic flow with smooth logistics and are focused only on this basic level of circulation. Fifth, in resolving technological bottlenecks, some people want to do everything themselves, which result in needless replication, or they carry out extravagant projects that ultimately fail because they don't take account of reality and the industrial base. Sixth, in working to expand domestic demand and boost the domestic market, some people have begun blindly handing out loans for investment and over-stimulating consumption, or even reverting back to energy-intensive, high-emissions projects. Seventh, some are concentrating on demand-side management at the expense of supply-side structural reform, making it impossible to achieve a higher-level, dynamic equilibrium at which supply boosts demand. Eighth, some think that the new development dynamic is a matter for the economic and technology departments and has little to do with themselves. All of these understandings are incomplete or even erroneous; we must guard against them and rectify them should they arise.\n\nThe key to building a new development dynamic is to ensure unimpeded economic flow, just the same as a healthy person needs to keep the blood vessels circulating freely to maintain a good balance of vital energy and blood. Economic activity requires the integration of various production factors at the stages of production, allocation, distribution, and consumption in order to realize a circular flow. Under normal circumstances, smooth economic flow will lead to increased material products, greater social wealth, improved wellbeing among the people, and enhanced national strength, giving rise to an upward spiral of development. When obstructions and breakages emerge, economic flow is disrupted. From a macroeconomic perspective, the economic growth rate drops, unemployment rises, risks build up, and the balance of payments falls into disequilibrium. At the microeconomic level, problems such as overcapacity, declining enterprise returns, and falling personal incomes arise.\n\nIn the present stage of China's development, the most important task in promoting smooth economic flow is maintaining effective and smooth operations on the supply side. If we have a strong capacity to provide effective supply, we can clear obstructions and bottlenecks in economic flow, enabling us to create jobs and provide income, which will further boost our country's capacity to create demand. As such, we must take furthering supply-side structural reform as our main task, and continue to carry out the priority tasks of cutting overcapacity, reducing excess inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs, and strengthening areas of weakness. We need to comprehensively improve and upgrade the industrial structure, enhance our innovation capacity, competitiveness, and overall strength, increase the resilience of the supply system, and ensure inputs produce higher-quality outputs with greater efficiency, so as to achieve a dynamic economic equilibrium at a high level.\n\nI have previously mentioned that the essence of the new development dynamic is realizing a high level of self-reliance. Currently, the environment for our economic development is changing, particularly with respect to our comparative advantages in production factors. Because labor costs are rising and the carrying capacities of our resources and environment have reached a limit, the production function formula of the past is no longer sustainable, and science and technology are becoming more and more important on all fronts. Under such circumstances, it is important to put more emphasis on independent innovation. As a result, the Recommendations for Formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035 put forward two major measures of promoting scientific and technological innovation and removing bottlenecks in industry. We must understand these issues as being vital to the survival and development of our nation. We should comprehensively strengthen planning for scientific and technological innovation to bring together superior resources, and implement the mechanism to competitively award research projects in order to promote strong and steady progress in innovation. We must better align the chains of innovation and industry, and draw up roadmaps, timetables, and systems of responsibility. Where appropriate, relevant departments and local governments should play the leading role in this regard. Where it is appropriate for enterprises to take the lead, governments should give them their full support. Central government enterprises and other state-owned enterprises must have the courage to shoulder the responsibility and take the lead in turning themselves into the source of original technologies and the head of the modern industrial chain.\n\nIn today's world, markets are the scarcest resource. China's market is thus a huge advantage of our country. We must make full use of this factor and continuously consolidate it to make it a strong pillar for creating a new development dynamic. Expanding domestic demand is not a temporary policy to cope with financial risks and external shocks, nor is it about unleashing a deluge of strong stimulus policies or increasing government investment. Rather, it is about establishing an effective system to boost domestic demand based on China's actual economic development, moving to tap the potential of demand, working faster to build a complete demand system, strengthening demand-side management, and expanding consumer spending while also upgrading the level of consumption, so that the development of our vast domestic market becomes a sustainable historical process.\n\nTo create a new development dynamic and pursue high-standard opening up, we require robust domestic flow and stable economic fundamentals. On this basis, we can create a strong gravitational pull for global production factors and resources, a strong ability to hold our own amid intense international competition, and powerful momentum for the allocation of global resources. We should continue to deepen opening up based on the flow of production factors such as goods, services, capital, and personnel, and steadily expand institution-based opening up with regard to rules, regulations, management, and standards. We should see that China's domestic circulation plays a stronger guiding role in dual-flow dynamics and foster new advantages for China's participation in international economic cooperation and competition. We should work to harness international flow as a means for improving the efficiency and level of domestic flow and the quality and allocation of our production factors. Through competition in the international market, we should boost the competitiveness of our export products and services, and promote industrial transformation and upgrading to increase China's influence in global industry chains, supply chains, and innovation chains. Chinese enterprises now have interests that extend to many countries around the world. This requires that we pay more attention to understanding international affairs and carrying out thorough studies on stakeholders, trading partners, and investment destinations, in order to establish a clear picture of potential benefits and risks.\n\nTo sum up, entering a new stage of development, applying a new development philosophy, and building a new development dynamic are determined by the logic of China's economic and social development theory, history, and practices. These three elements are closely interrelated. Our entry into the new development stage clarifies the historic juncture that national development has reached, the new development philosophy makes clear the guiding principles behind our modernization drive, and the new development dynamic elucidates the path that will take us to economic modernization. An understanding of the new development stage will provide us with the practical basis for applying the new development philosophy and creating a new development dynamic. The new development philosophy will provide us with a guide for understanding the new development stage and creating a new development dynamic. Creating a new development dynamic, on the other hand, is a strategic choice regarding our response to the opportunities and challenges in the new development stage and the implementation of the new development philosophy.\n\nFourth, we need to strengthen the Party's overall leadership over China's modernization drive.\n\nThe defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and its most prominent trait is its integration of theoretical and practical innovation and institutional and cultural confidence, all of which imbue socialism with Chinese characteristics with great political, theoretical, institutional, and cultural strengths for promoting development. We should implement the guiding principles of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee in tandem with those of its Fourth Plenary Session to continue modernizing China's system and capacity for governance, and combining the strengths of overall Party leadership and Chinese socialism with those of the new development philosophy in order to realize Party leadership over socialist modernization through better defined functions, more sophisticated systems, and more efficient management.\n\nHow well we implement the guiding principles of the Fifth Plenary Session will have a bearing on the overall development of our Party and country for the next five years, fifteen years, and beyond. The Recommendations for Formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035, which were adopted at the Fifth Plenary Session, are rich in content. They incorporate overarching approaches, principles, and strategies as well as detailed requirements, and include strategic decisions that we have been implementing since the CPC's 18th National Congress as well as new major judgments and strategic moves. It is going to require a considerable effort to master this material. If we don't have a thorough understanding of it, we will overlook the essential points and fail to achieve anything of practical value during implementation. Officials at all levels, particularly those in high-ranking positions, need to go through the Recommendations line by line. After acquiring a general understanding, they should delve into the key points and new ideas, and following our fine tradition of linking theory with practice, apply these to the present reality and the long-term horizon to give full play to their enthusiasm, initiative and creativity.\n\nI have mentioned on many occasions that officials in high-ranking positions should be Marxist statesmen and that officials at every level must be politically discerning. Not long ago, I reiterated this point at a meeting of Party members in leadership positions held by the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau. Economic work is not abstract or isolated, but concrete and connected to the whole. Officials at all levels, particularly high-ranking ones, must act in accordance with the overarching strategy of national rejuvenation and the overall context of once-in-a-century world change, continue to enhance their capacity for political judgment, thinking, and implementation, and bear in mind the fundamental interests of our country. They should consistently strengthen their political ability, strategic foresight, and professional competence with regard to understanding the new development stage, applying the new development philosophy, and creating a new development dynamic. They must willingly shoulder their responsibilities and take effective action to implement the Central Committee's decisions and plans.\n\nTo lead China, a major country in the East with over one billion people, in achieving modernization, our Party must adhere to the principles of seeking truth from facts, pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and promoting coordinated development. We must plan in a more farsighted, comprehensive, and strategic fashion so that advances are made on all fronts and a balance is ensured between the quality, structure, scale, speed, performance, and security of development. In building a modern socialist country in all respects, we will leave no region or ethnic group behind; at the same time, due to significant regional disparities and the unbalanced nature of development, it is not possible to synchronize the modernization processes of all regions, and we should encourage and support regions with the right conditions to take the lead in modernization so as to pave the way for others.\n\nWith the Chinese New Year just around the corner, local Party and government officials should go the extra mile in epidemic prevention and control and in ensuring ample supplies, people's basic needs, and security and stability. We should take timely, specific, and practical measures to defuse risks in order to ensure a peaceful and joyous social atmosphere. We must firmly persist with routine epidemic control, thoroughly implement all prevention and control measures, and act swiftly to effectively deal with any sporadic cases. We should conduct a full investigation of social problems, strengthen analysis and assessment to attain a proper understanding of all potential risks, and take action to guard against and defuse these risks. We need to ensure energy and material supplies and transportation safety during the Spring Festival. We should enhance the crime prevention and control systems and crack down on illegal and criminal activities that affect the lives and property of our people to ensure social stability. We must act as soon as possible to resolve problems that could lead to public disturbances such as overdue payments for construction projects and wage arrears owed to rural migrant workers.\n\nComrades, I often recall a remark that Deng Xiaoping made in 1992. He said, \"If we can make China a moderately developed country within a hundred years from the founding of the People's Republic, that will be an extraordinary achievement. The period from now to the middle of the next century will be crucial. We must immerse ourselves in hard work: we have difficult tasks to accomplish and bear a heavy responsibility.\" Now that heavy responsibility has fallen to us, and we must shoulder it with courage and determination. We must unite our people and lead them in working hard in a down-to-earth way to make achievements that are worthy of the Party, the people, and history.\n\nThis was a speech made by General Secretary Xi Jinping at a seminar for provincial and ministerial level officials on studying and implementing the guiding principles of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, January 11, 2021.\n\n(Originally appeared in Qiushi Journal, Chinese edition, No 9, 2021)"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethnic-conflict", "page_content": "The terms ethnic and ethnicity have their roots in the Greek word ethnos, which describes a community of common descent. In ethnic conflict research, the terms ethnic group, communal group, ethnic community, people, and minority are mostly used interchangeably. Two elements provide the basis to identify ethnic groups: first, the accentuation of cultural traits and, second, the sense that those traits distinguish the group from the members of the society who do not share the differentiating characteristics. Anthony D. Smith, a scholar of ethnicity and nationalism studies, identified ethnic criteria that provide the origins of communal identity. Those include shared historical experiences and memories, myths of common descent, a common culture and ethnicity, and a link with a historic territory or a homeland, which the group may or may not currently inhabit. Elements of common culture include language, religion, laws, customs, institutions, dress, music, crafts, architecture, and even food. Ethnic communities show signs of solidarity and self-awareness, which are often expressed by the name the group gives itself.\n\nEthnic identity is formed by both tangible and intangible characteristics. Tangible characteristics, such as shared culture or common visible physical traits, are important because they contribute to the group\u2019s feeling of identity, solidarity, and uniqueness. As a result, the group considers perceived and real threats to its tangible characteristics as risks to its identity. If the group takes steps to confront the threats, its ethnicity becomes politicized, and the group becomes a political actor by virtue of its shared identity. On the other side, ethnicity is just as much based on intangible factors\u2014namely, on what people believe, or are made to believe, to create a sense of solidarity among members of a particular ethnic group and to exclude those who are not members.\n\nTheories of ethnic identity\n\nAlthough communal identity provides the foundation for the definition of ethnic groups, disagreement exists over how ethnic identity forms and how it changes over time. A first school of thought, known as the primordialist approach, explains ethnicity as a fixed characteristic of individuals and communities. According to primordialists, ethnicity is embedded in inherited biological attributes, a long history of practicing cultural differences, or both. Ethnic identity is seen as unique in intensity and durability and as an existential factor defining individual self-identification and communal distinctiveness. Mobilization of ethnic identity and ethnic nationalism is a powerful tool to engage the group in a political struggle. Ethnic divisions and ethnic conflict are considered inherent to multiethnic societies and a common phenomenon.\n\nThe primordialist focus on fixed identities, however, fails to recognize variations in ethnic group formation, ranging from relatively short-term associations to long-standing, strong, and cohesive groups with biological and historical roots. To account for these differences, a second approach, referred to as instrumentalist, was developed, which understands ethnicity as a device used by individuals and groups to unify, organize, and mobilize populations to achieve larger goals. Those goals are mostly of a political nature and include, among others, demands for self-governance, autonomy, access to resources and power, respect for the group\u2019s identity and culture, and minority rights. Instrumentalists hold that ethnicity has very little or no independent ranking outside the political process and is in its character comparable to other political affiliations such as ideological beliefs or party membership. According to instrumentalists, ethnicity is a result of personal choice and mostly independent from the situational context or the presence of cultural and biological traits. Ethnic conflict arises if ethnic groups compete for the same goal\u2014notably power, access to resources, or territory. The interests of a society\u2019s elite class play an important role in mobilizing ethnic groups to engage in ethnic conflicts. Ethnic conflict is thus similar to other political interest conflicts.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nInstrumentalism is criticized by those who argue that ethnicity, in contrast to political affiliations, cannot be willfully decided on by individuals and is instead rooted in and regulated by the society as a whole. Advocates of another school of thought, known as social constructivism, focus on the social nature of ethnic identity. In their view, ethnicity is neither fixed nor entirely open. Ethnic identity is created by social interactions between individuals and groups and remains therefore beyond a person\u2019s choice, but it is subject to change if the social conditions change. Individuals and groups cannot avoid the fact that ethnic differences exist, but they determine for themselves what to make of those differences. Ethnic conflict depends thus to a great extent on the opportunities provided for the group to reach their goals. Violent conflict is caused mainly by social and political systems that lead to inequality and grievances and do not offer options for the peaceful expression of differences. Changes in social interactions, such as increased tensions or violent conflict, influence the socially constructed nature of ethnicity. Social constructivists explain the tremendous atrocities committed during ethnic conflicts\u2014such as genocide, mass rape, and ethnic cleansing\u2014by the fact that, by virtue of ethnicity, ultimately everyone becomes involved in the struggle, regardless of their intent.\n\nA fourth view, that of psychocultural interpretations, ascribes to ethnicity deep cultural and psychological roots, which make ethnic identity extremely persistent. The scholar Marc Howard Ross, drawing on psychocultural interpretation theory, defines ethnic identity as originating in \u201cshared, deeply rooted worldviews\u201d that shape group members\u2019 relationships with others, their actions, and their motives. Ethnic identity cannot be changed, only made more tolerant and open-minded. Ethnic conflict engages central elements of each group\u2019s identity and invokes fears and suspicion about real and potential opponents. Ethnic conflict is thus not simply a political event but a drama that challenges the very existence of the group by contesting its identity. This explains why ethnic conflicts are very difficult to resolve.\n\nIn reality, some ethnic groups have identities with deep historical roots whereas others do not, and some groups have static identities whereas others have dynamic identities. The concrete expression of ethnicity and its propensity to lead to violence and warfare depend on the context. Ethnic identities are adaptable to and activated by unexpected threats and new opportunities. Ethnicity cannot be politicized unless an underlying core of memories, experience, or meaning moves people to collective action. In light of this, Milton J. Esman, in his book Ethnic Politics (1994), noted that ethnic identity usually \u201ccan be located on a spectrum between primordial historical continuities and (instrumental) opportunistic adaptations.\u201d\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the salience and intensity of ethnic identities. Indisputably, the strongest factor is war and violence. First, the history of common efforts, stories of sacrifices for a common goal, and memories of human suffering create strong connections among the members of affected ethnic groups. Similarly, if a group experiences economic, political, and cultural discrimination, group cohesion tends to increase. Second, a group\u2019s ethnic identity is stronger if mass literacy is achieved. Literacy allows elements of identity to be stored in writing, which means that historical and cultural narratives can reach a mass audience and stay the same over time. Even if an ethnic identity lies dormant for some time, it can be revived. Finally, the identities of nonimmigrant groups tend to be more pronounced than the identities of immigrant ethnic groups. While immigrants often assimilate, nonimmigrant minorities generally adhere to their traditions, especially if they are easily distinguished from the rest of the society by tangible traits such as physical markers."}, {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2021.770513/full", "page_content": "*, Maria K.

Based on the review of the status quo in cross-cultural measurement development and our years of experience in conducting this research among a co-cultural group, this paper describes a Model for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement (MC3M) for intercultural and/or cross-cultural communication research. As an exemplar, we report on a program of research applying the model to develop a culturally derived measurement of social norms and the factors impacting the norm-behavior relationship for members of a unique population group (i.e., ethnically Tibetan pastoralists in Western China). The results provide preliminary evidence for the construct validity and reliability of the culturally derived measurements. The implications, benefits, and shortcomings of the MC3M model are discussed. Recommendations for advancing both conceptual and measurement refinement in intercultural and cross-cultural communication research are provided.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCulture and Social Norms: Development and Application of a Model for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement (MC3M)\n\nSocial norms research has rapidly garnered popularity in the past several decades in multiple disciplines, such as communication, social psychology, public health, and economics (Chung and Rimal, 2016). Given the power of normative influence on perceptions and actions consistently shown in the body of literature (Borsari and Carey, 2003; Rhodes et al., 2020), social norm theories, rooted in the U.S.-based research, are being applied in numerous cross-cultural contexts (Mackie et al., 2015). Yet, problems persist with inconsistencies in the conceptual and operational definitions of norms (Shulman et al., 2017), and findings of prior studies may be culturally bound (Chung and Rimal, 2016).\n\nTo help fill this gap and advance scholarship on social norms and other culturally contextualized communication measurements, we combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to develop culturally derived measures of social norms in a unique population.1 Specifically, we describe research that examines the nature of interpersonal communication as a basis for shaping social norms and normative perceptions (Lapinski et al., 2021), using this information to derive a series of measures rooted in the cultural context. Data obtained from a multi-year project, including field visits, in-depth interviews, and household surveys about grassland conservation behaviors with ethnically Tibetan pastoralists on the Tibetan Plateau in Western China, are presented as the basis for conceptualization, scale development, and initial evidence for the validity of measures of social norms and related constructs from theories on the communication of social norms (Rimal and Real, 2005; Lapinski et al., 2018). This population is the focus of our work because of their critical role in ecosystem conservation issues in Asia and as a marginalized cultural group (Bessho, 2015; Bum, 2016). As the basis for this research, we offer a model derived from existing research and practice for the development or adaptation of constructs and measures for intercultural or cross-cultural communication research. The value of this paper is the presentation of a model for developing measures of social norms (and related scales in communication studies) accounting for cultural dynamics. This process is useful beyond the particular population studied here, as the detailed steps described in the model shed light on future research on similar issues (e.g., conservation and health) among marginalized groups or populations with unique historical and/or cultural backgrounds (e.g., indigenous people and ethnic minorities).\n\nConceptualizing and Measuring Social Norms in Cultural Context\n\nGenerally, social norms are \u201crules and standards that are understood by members of a group, and that guide or constrain social behavior without the force of law\u201d (Cialdini and Trost, 1998, p. 152) shared through interpersonal and mediated communication (Kincaid, 2004). Social norms can influence health, environmental, and philanthropic attitudes and behaviors and can be influenced through communication campaigns (Shulman et al., 2017). International attention has focused on the use of social norm campaigns as key to social change on various issues (e.g., child marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting, food waste, vaccination) because these efforts involve changing beliefs and actions of an entire community or cultural group rather than those of individuals (UNICEF, 2010).\n\nDespite the growing popularity of social norms research, critical issues remain in literature, including vague conceptualizations of what constitutes a social norm and conflated definitions and inadequacies in the measures of different types of norms (Shulman et al., 2017). These problems \u201cimpair our ability to understand what norms are, how they work, how they should be measured, and boundary conditions that dictate where norms should and should not be applied\u201d (Shulman et al., 2017, p.1209). Meanwhile, the increasing trend of social norms research conducted as comparative studies or in countries other than the U.S. and Europe in recent years (e.g., Geber et al., 2019; Stamkou et al., 2019) has created a demand for new methods conceptualizing and measuring social norms and related constructs.\n\nIndeed, what we know about norms may be impacted by the so-called WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) phenomenon documented in psychological research (Henrich et al., 2010). Shulman et al.\u2019s (2017) examination of 832 empirical studies in English language journals found that most studies of social norms (82.4%) were conducted in the U.S. and Western Europe; similar findings exist in global development where few international studies address measurement development or fundamental conceptualization of norms (Mackie et al., 2015).\n\nConstructing valid and reliable measures of key study concepts is regarded as one of the most critical steps in empirical research. No matter how well-designed a study is, poor measurement of study constructs can yield errors in interpreting the results. When studies are designed to compare two cultures or to study communication patterns and processes in a unique population or co-cultural group within a larger group, the measurement challenges are compounded (Croucher and Kelly, 2019, 2020). Differences in the conceptualization of core study ideas, languages, values, and other factors lead to substantial challenges when researchers try to maximize conceptual and measurement equivalence, reliability, and construct validity of measurement for samples from co-cultural groups within national boundaries or across national boundaries (Herdman et al., 1997; Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998; Davidov et al., 2018).\n\nBecause of the culturally bound nature of social norms, it is crucial for researchers to establish and clearly describe conceptualizations and measurements of norms embedded in the appropriate cultural and social context. By culturally bound, in this case, we mean that although social norms, as unwritten codes of conduct, appear to exist in all human cultures, their form and function vary by group, complicating measurement. A lack of culturally valid measurement may hinder progress in theory building, especially in identifying boundary conditions for theories.\n\nStudies of social norms and cultural dynamics have focused on nation/country (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1999) or race/ethnicity (e.g., LaBrie et al., 2012) as a delimiting concept. We recognize the benefits and limitations of using country or nation as the sole proxy or operationalization of culture, despite the prevalence of this practice in cross-cultural research (c.f., Schaffer and Riordan, 2003).\n\nUsing country, race, or ethnicity to identify cultural groups is convenient, clear, and tidy; most people can self-identify these characteristics when asked with valid indicators in the measures. Yet, country and culture are incongruent under most conditions. Generally, multiple co-cultural groups exist under the same overarching national identity (Orbe, 1997). As such, culture may function at the level of a nation-state, a co-cultural group within a nation-state, or any collective of people who share deep or surface-level cultural elements (termed a unique population). For the current study, we draw from the intercultural communication literature and use the term \u201cculture\u201d to include communities of people with uniquely shared communication characteristics, perceptions, values, beliefs, and practices. Shared practices, ethnicity, and language serve as indicators for the cultural group, which is the focus of the present study; ethnically Tibetan pastoralists. This group shares the following characteristics: they are historically nomadic and engage in animal husbandry, and they have Tibetan ethnicity with the Kham Tibetan dialect as their primary language.\n\nBecause, fundamentally, culture influences how people view the world, identifying within-culture conceptualizations of key study constructs should be the first step in empirical inquiry. As unwritten implicit rules, social norms are formed, shaped, and reinforced through observation and interpersonal and mediated communication among a collective. Normative perceptions may be formed about both the prevalence of behavior (i.e., commonly called descriptive norms; what is done by most members of a group) and what most people think to be appropriate or inappropriate behaviors (i.e., injunctive norms; what is socially approved or disapproved; Cialdini et al., 1990). Hence, it is critical to acknowledge the socially and culturally shared nature of social norms, as people relate to in-group members within a specific culture. That is, social norms, by their nature, emanate from collectives within a system. As such, it is necessary to identify the influential people and in-groups who are most connected to particular decisions or behaviors in order to contextualize norms.\n\nSome research demonstrates the culturally bound nature of conceptualizations of social norms and their communication (e.g., Jensen and Bute, 2010; Lapinski et al., 2015). Using in-depth interviews and observation, the literature indicates that key conceptualizations developed in one cultural context (like injunctive norms with social prescriptions for appropriate behavior) may not exist in the same form when examined through a different cultural lens (Jensen and Bute, 2010). Likewise, the nature of interpersonal and mediated communication about what is approved behavior is constrained by the nature of the social system (Elwood et al., 2000; Lapinski et al., 2015) and connected to cultural predispositions (Lapinski et al., 2019).\n\nDeveloping culturally derived social norms measures is also critical to enhance both the internal and external validity of the existing corpus of research to account for culturally-based concepts and processes (Mollen et al., 2010). Surprisingly little is written about how to develop reliable and valid culturally derived measures of communication concepts like social norms; instead, one must go to the literature in cross-cultural and organizational psychology to find scholarship addressing some of these issues (c.f., Schaffer and Riordan, 2003). In public health, there is a robust literature on the cross-cultural adaptation of scales; yet, Epstein et al. (2015) reviewed 31 studies making recommendations for cross-cultural adaptation (CCA) and concluded there was no consensus on best practices for adapting measures across cultural contexts.\n\nIn sum, identifying and refining the culturally derived conceptualization of social norms is the first step in developing methods for measuring these constructs. Measurement development is critical for expanding social norms research to account for cultural similarities and differences in order to enhance both internal and external validity in the corpus of research to account for culturally-based concepts and processes (Mollen et al., 2010; Lapinski et al., 2019).\n\nStudies of Social Norms in Cultural Context: Absolutism, Universalism, and Relativism\n\nVarious approaches to studying cultural dynamics in social normative influence are evidenced in the literature (c.f., Fischer et al., 2009; Lee and Green, 1991; Park and Levine, 1999). Many of these studies have involved comparative research designs in which data from a U.S. sample are compared to a sample(s) of people from another nation (Shulman et al., 2017). The predominant theories that address social norms, such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975), the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991), focus theory of normative conduct (Cialdini et al., 1990), social norms approach (SNA; Berkowitz, 2004), and theory of normative social behavior (TNSB; Rimal and Real, 2005), have been developed and tested primarily in the U.S. with measures of the core theoretical concepts constructed in English. Studies using these theories sometimes provide evidence for measurement reliability and validity of the study measures using data from samples, often of college undergraduates, in various regions of the U.S. (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1999; Jang, 2012).\n\nIt is when these theories and measures are applied in new cultural contexts that challenges may arise. That is, by moving existing normative concepts and measures into new cultural contexts, studies may fail to account for the dynamics of normative influence unique to the new context. A framework in cross-cultural psychology that can be applied to communication research describes three orientations to the cross-cultural adaptation of theories and measures, including absolutism, universalism, and relativism (Herdman et al., 1997; Berry et al., 2002). Based on this framework, there are roughly three approaches to studying social norms in cultural context: 1) adoption of the conceptualization and measures from existing theories and using them with no modification in a new cultural context (absolutism); 2) using conceptualization and measures developed in one cultural context (often in the language of the researcher) and translating the measures into the primary language of the study participants or making other adjustments for cultural context (universalism), and 3) developing the study concepts and measures based on data (or dialogue) from within the cultural context in the language of participants for each cultural group included in the study (relativism). In each of these cases, the nuances of the study procedures and the reporting of the processes are different for each study. For example, studies may or may not report on: the development of conceptual definitions, translation and back translation of items, evidence for scale reliability or validity, or measurement invariance. In the following, we review and summarize examples of these orientations from across disciplines2 and then propose a series of recommended practices derived from the existing literature, for culturally derived measurement of communication constructs.\n\nAbsolutism\n\nAbsolutism orientation assumes a minimal impact of \u201cculture\u201d on the constructs being studied (i.e., they are culture-free) because of the species-wide similarities among all human beings. As a result, standard instruments measuring the focal constructs are considered appropriate to be used in different cultures. This practice may result in a construct conceptualized and operationalized in one culture that is \u201cimposed\u201d directly onto another culture (Berry et al., 2002). It involves adopting the conceptual definitions, study materials, and measures directly from prior research without substantial modifications3. It may include using measures from prior research in a particular country without any translation procedures or evidence for measurement construct validity or equivalence (e.g., Th\u00f8gersen and \u00d6lander, 2006; Abikoye and Olley, 2012; Nguyen and Neighbors, 2013; Savani et al., 2015).\n\nFor example, Bobek et al. (2007) conducted an experimental study with participants recruited from Australia, Singapore, and the U.S. to examine the effects of social norms on tax compliance using Cialdini and Trost\u2019s (1998) taxonomy of social norms. Factor analysis and scale reliability analysis were performed to establish evidence for the scales\u2019 validity and reliability before proceeding to test hypotheses. However, across the three national samples, the constructs and measures were assumed to be equivalent, and a translation process was not described.4 Likewise, using measures from the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991), Wan et al. (2018) examined the moderating effect of subjective norms on the behavioral intention of using urban green spaces among Hong Kong residents. The convergent and discriminant validity and reliability of the measures were assessed before testing the structural model. But, no survey translation information was described, although most people in Hong Kong speak Cantonese as their primary language, and only 4.3% of the population use English regularly (GovHK, 2020).\n\nUniversalism\n\nThe universalism orientation acknowledges that culture substantially impacts how constructs are expressed and defined across cultures. Though this approach still assumes species-wide similarities (i.e., universal patterns), it accepts the idea that measurement needs to be adapted cross-culturally, given that the context-free constructs and measurements are difficult or impossible to obtain. In this approach, conceptual definitions and measures are developed in one cultural context, typically in English. Then the study materials and measures are translated into the country\u2019s language in which the research is conducted. Evidence for back-translation, construct validity, and measurement equivalence may or may not be described. There are a few social norms studies that account for cultural dynamics using this method (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1999; Park and Levine, 1999; Boer and Westhoff, 2006; Fornara et al., 2011; Jang et al., 2013; Stamkou et al., 2019; Walter et al., 2019).\n\nFor example, Stamkou et al. (2019) examined the moderating effect of cultural collectivism and tightness on responses to norm violators in 19 countries. The conceptual definition of the key study constructs and the measures, including social norms, norm violations, individualism-collectivism, and tightness-looseness, were adapted from existing literature developed in the U.S and translated into each country\u2019s official language following the procedures outlined by Brislin (1986); validity and reliability evidence was provided. Likewise, Jain et al. (2018) investigated the effect of descriptive and injunctive norms on condom use among young men in Ethiopia using norms measures from the TNSB (Rimal and Real, 2005) translated into Amharic, Afan Oromo, and Tigrigna. Adaptations were made in the norm measures to account for cultural context, but measurement validity and reliability evidence was not presented. Limaye et al. (2012) reported similar process in Malawi; acceptable reliability of the scales was presented, but measurement validity evidence was not included.\n\nRelativism\n\nThe last orientation, relativism, assumes that because of the substantial role of culture in people\u2019s cognitive thinking patterns and behaviors, it is impossible to use standard measurements across cultures; hence, local instruments developed within a specific culture should be adopted (Herdman et al., 1997; Berry et al., 2002). In this approach, the conceptual definitions and measures are developed within the focal cultural group, often through collaborative processes and formative data collection. The language in which they are developed may be that of the focal country or region. Measurement construct validity and equivalence evidence may or may not be described (e.g., Babalola, 2007; Rimal et al., 2015; Yilma et al., 2020). For example, Rimal et al. (2019) developed a personal narrative-based intervention, including social norms messages targeting adolescent students in Serbia, to improve their driving behaviors using conceptual definitions and measurement based on theory and cultural context. Formative data (i.e., one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and reaction interviews) was conducted first to develop the intervention and the measures of core concepts, including descriptive and injunctive norms. Results showed acceptable reliability of the normative scales, but measurement validity evidence was not included.\n\nIn sum, the literature on social norms and cultural dynamics indicates a range of approaches to developing concepts and measurements in cultural context for both single and multi-culture studies.\n\nModel for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement (MC3M)\n\nBased on the research on culturally derived measurement (Hui and Triandis, 1985; Pedhazur and Schmelkin, 2013; Schaffer and Riordan, 2003; Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998), research on measurement model validation and equivalence (Bollen, 2005), and our team\u2019s international and cross-cultural research, we present a Model for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement (MC3M) containing a series steps for the development of quantitative measures in communication science taking a relativistic approach (Figure 1) and use a variant of this model in the current research. Although we focus here specifically on social norms, we believe this model may benefit other communication research. In the following sections, we describe a series of studies to illustrate the process of applying the model to develop culturally derived social norm measures.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFIGURE 1. Proposed model for communication measurement development in cultural context: model for culturally contextualized communication measurement (MC3M).\n\nThe program of research that we report here was conducted on the Tibetan Platea in the Tsangsum Yungyul (Tibetan) or Sanjiangyuan (Mandarin) area of China, located in southern Qinghai Province. This region is home to about 960,000 inhabitants, 90% of whom are ethnically Tibetan, and nearly 70% are pastoralists, sometimes nomadic, herding mainly yaks and sheep (see Appendix A). Geographically, the territory is vast, with human settlements dispersed, making data collection in the region challenging. The terrain includes glaciers and high-altitude grasslands, which input to three of Asia\u2019s major rivers, the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong providing freshwater to nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s population. The population of this region is generally Tibetan Buddhist. Their position as a unique or co-cultural group within China makes Tibetan pastoralists an important group to study social influence processes. They play a key role in the future of this ecologically sensitive region, but studies conducted in this area are rare (Shen and Tan, 2012).\n\nStep 1: Identification of Key Constructs\n\nDiscussions with cultural informants, review of the scientific and gray literature about the study region, field visits, and collaborative discussions with project partners were the first stage of this project; Step 1 in the MC3M. The cross-cultural (U.S. multi-ethnic, Han, Tibetan team), cross-disciplinary (anthropology, communication, sustainability, conservation biology, economics) team shared an interest in interpersonal communication about social norms and their effects on conservation behavior and the role of financial incentives in promoting conservation behavior among ethnically Tibetan pastoralists.\n\nThe exploratory work conducted in Step 1 revealed results in many key activities and insights, two of which we highlight here. First, discussion with collaborators coupled with our searches of the scientific literature revealed little social science data on the population of interest. This is critical because it drove our approach to the methods we used throughout the remainder of the project. Second, the focal constructs, behaviors, core theory, and research questions/predictions were developed collaboratively based on this process. Animal husbandry behaviors and their impact on the grassland and water ecology were identified as both salient for the study population and conservation practice. Specifically, herding types of animals with less relative ecological impact, reducing herd size to have less impact on grassland quality, and modifying grazing patterns to protect sensitive areas were the behaviors examined; organized patrolling to reduce poaching of wild animals was also examined but is reported elsewhere.\n\nStep 2: In-Depth Interviews\n\nAs the next step in developing measures of the normative dimensions and providing construct validity evidence in this cultural context, in-depth interviews were conducted (Step 2 in the MC3M). The purpose of the interviews was to determine whether or not and how normative information was communicated to members of our study population and the character of that information in order to identify conceptualizations of social norms. In addition, we sought to understand the conditions under which normative information was available, the people from whom normative information emanates, and expected outcomes for the focal behaviors. Eighty in-depth interviews were conducted with members of our study population; detailed results are reported in companion papers (Lapinski et al., 2018; Lapinski et al., 2021). Interview data were analyzed via quantitative content analysis, thematic analysis, and network analysis.\n\nThe interviews provided the basis for understanding indigenous conceptualizations of injunctive and descriptive norms, outcome expectancies associated with the behaviors, important referent groups for information about our study topics. In brief, the findings from the interviews uncovered normative influence as one basis for social power (Kelman, 1961) among members of the study community (Lapinski et al., 2018) and three essential themes for conceptualizing social norms (Lapinski et al., 2021): 1) a shared understanding of what the participants believe is typical in the community, particularly local herding groups or villages (descriptive norms); 2) what participants believe is approved and disapproved or expected in the community (injunctive norms), and the anticipated reactions of others to compliance or noncompliance with expectations; and 3) important referent groups for decisions about herding (normative referents). Key referents were identified as dependent on the nature of information (general information, advice-seeking, or problem-focused), including herding group members, other villagers, family, and people in positions of power (e.g., veterinarians, government officials, village leaders).\n\nStep 3: Refining Conceptualizations\n\nBased on the findings from the interviews, revised conceptual definitions (Step 3 in the MC3M) and quantitative items were developed (Step 4, described in the method) to investigate further the influences of social norms on behaviors guided by several existing theories of social norms (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975; Cialdini et al., 1990; Rimal and Real, 2005) and our prior research (Lapinski et al., 2018). Based on the interview data, the conceptualizations of both normative constructs (i.e., perceived descriptive norms and perceived injunctive norms, provided earlier in this paper) have been modified slightly to be culturally appropriate. Consistent with prior research, perceived descriptive norms are conceptualized as pastoralists\u2019 perceptions of the prevalence of referent others\u2019 (herding group and village group member) behavior. Perceived injunctive norms are conceptualized as perceptions of the referent others\u2019 opinions and expectations about behaviors. A common element in conceptualizations of social norms\u2013that social sanctions exist for noncompliance with the norm\u2013was not included in the definition because it was not evidenced in our data. The key referent groups for this behavior are the herding group (if the pastoralist belongs to one) or others from the same village (if the pastoralist does not herd with a herding group). Families have been incorporated into the herding group conceptualization, given the clear overlap revealed from the interview data between these two groups.\n\nOutcome expectations, as well as group identification and group orientation, were considered as key constructs in the study because prior research has shown they enhance the influence of social norms and appear to be critical in studies of cultural dynamics (Cruz et al., 2000; Lapinski et al., 2007) and conceptualizations were shaped based on the results of the in-depth interviews. Outcome expectation is conceptualized as beliefs of the potential losses or benefits related to the behavior and includes monetary and non-monetary outcomes. The types of outcomes identified in the interviews included changes to the grassland, changes to economic well-being, and changes to identity as a Tibetan (Lapinski et al., 2021). Group identity refers to feelings of affinity with one\u2019s social group and the desire to be connected to that group (Rimal and Real, 2005). Group orientation refers to one\u2019s connection to the collective (i.e., the extent to which one\u2019s social groups are central to the decision-making process). Giving priority to group goals over personal goals may function to enhance the influence of social norms on behaviors since group-oriented individuals are guided by group goals and norms in order to maintain harmony within groups (Lapinski et al., 2007). Finally, we conceptualized behavioral intention as a person\u2019s readiness to perform a behavior (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and a possible outcome of normative influence.\n\nThese conceptualizations form the basis for the development of items designed to measure each of the constructs. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with our study population in order to complete Steps 4\u20137 in the MC3M: The hypothesis is proposed:\n\nH: The measures of perceived descriptive norms (PDN), perceived injunctive norms (PIN), outcome expectations (OE), group identity (GID), group orientation (GO), and behavioral intentions (BI) will yield valid and reliable unidimensional scales.\n\nMethods\n\nSampling and Participants\n\nParticipants were recruited from one city and three counties in the study region via network sampling by project partners (see Appendix A). Yushu Prefecture is an area of 267,000 square kilometers, with a total population of 283,100 people (95.3 percent Tibetan). As of 2015, Yushu Prefecture has one city and five counties; our sample included: Yushu City, Zaduo County, Nangqian County, and Chengduo County. Because of the behaviors examined in this study, three filter questions were asked at the beginning of the survey to ensure that the participant 1) was a pastoralist, 2) with at least 10 yaks in their herd, and 3) was the primary decision-maker in the household (i.e., the head of the household). Only people who answered affirmatively to these questions were included in the sample. During data cleaning, one participant was removed from the data analysis because his household had fewer than 10 yaks.\n\nIn total, 360 Tibetan pastoralists (85% male) in 10 townships participated in the surveys5, with an average age of 45.85 (SD = 12.29), ranging from 18 to 80. The average size of the household was 6.52 (SD = 2.57), with an average number of 2.36 (SD = 1.48) school-aged children and 2.31 (SD = 1.48) family members who helped with herding. Regarding the level of education, on average, participants had 1.3 years (SD = 2.36) of schooling (including public schools and monastery schools), ranging from 0 (illiterate; 68.1%) to 15 years. Nearly all (98.3%) reported owning only yaks; less than 1% had both yaks and sheep (three misssing responses). The average herd size of yaks was 40.87 (SD = 28.27), ranging from 0 to 200. Approximately 20% of the participants (n = 71) belonged to herding groups, and 9 (12.7%) of them reported themselves as the leader of the herding group.\n\nSurvey Instrument Development\n\nStep 4: Initial Item Development and Cognitive Interviews\n\nThe survey items were developed by the project team based on the results of the in-depth interviews (Lapinski et al., 2018, 2021) and prior research on social norms-related variables (Step 4 in the MC3M). The scale items were developed via the procedures suggested by Hunter and Gerbing (1982). Items were developed for each distinct dimension by examining the conceptual definitions of the constructs and by deriving content from the interviews. Multiple items were created for each construct in order to allow for subsequent statistical tests of construct validity (Hunter and Gerbing, 1982). The item construction process resulted in a large pool of items reviewed for face validity by the researchers. To enhance conceptual equivalence (Herdman et al., 1997), each question was discussed by study team members and revised based on the discussion. Items that matched the conceptual definition of the construct were retained. The measures were developed in English and Tibetan simultaneously, captured in English, and then translated into Tibetan with flexibility for local variations in the dialect. The instrument was then back-translated to English to check for accuracy in interpretation and to avoid cultural biases. Then, the study team members discussed the final version of questionnaire questions one by one (see Appendix B for the detailed procedures of translation and back-translation).\n\nTwo groups of cognitive interviews (four participants per group) were conducted with local community members to pilot the survey instrument before the data collection. This qualitative approach, conducted prior to the quantitative data collection, helped researchers examine how the respondents process and interpret questions and identify the factors influencing their answers (Cabral and Savageau, 2013). Due to the benefit of improving item interpretation and strengthening scale quality shown in numerous studies (e.g., Collins, 2003; Ryan et al., 2012), the cognitive interview has been recommended as a standard step in survey development, refinement, and adaptation.\n\nDuring the cognitive interviews, participants were asked to evaluate the survey questions with the goal of increasing the clarity, meaningfulness, and cultural appropriateness of the questions. Modifications were made to question wording and question order, and some questions were eliminated. Although we developed the scales to use verbally administered Likert-type response scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), based on the suggestions from local collaborators and cognitive interview participants, we adopted the strategy of using fingers (digits; commonly used among people in the sample in everyday life) as a response scale when asking about Likert-type questions (e.g., thumb = strongly agree; the little finger = strongly disagree), to help participant better understand the options. A \u201cNot Sure\u201d option was added based on the suggestions from the local collaborator and the feedback generated from the cognitive interviews.\n\nProcedures\n\nSurveys were conducted by four ethnically-Tibetan enumerators who were native speakers of the Kham Tibetan dialect and also fluent in Mandarin Chinese. Enumerators received training on survey skills, survey instruments, and the protection of human subjects by the study team (Step 5 in the MC3M). The enumerators verbally administered all questions using the digit response scale described above and recorded the responses in booklets due to the low level of literacy among our potential participants6 based on the exciting literature (e.g., John, 2000; Bangsbo, 2008), the fieldwork of our community collaborators in our study area over the years, and data from our previous interviews. To minimize unintended enumerator effects on the survey data, enumerators were trained not to provide any explanations to the survey questions other than clarification or to provide verbal or nonverbal reactions toward participants\u2019 answers. Statistical analysis was conducted to ensure that no significant differences existed in study variables for different enumerators.\n\nUpon approaching a potential participant, each enumerator first introduced him/herself and the purpose of the survey briefly. If the individual agreed to answer the initial eligibility questions, the enumerator would record the sex of the respondent through observation first and then ask the three filter questions mentioned above (i.e., a pastoralist with at least 10 yaks who is the head of their household). Once the participant was determined as eligible for the survey, the enumerator proceeded with the informed consent process, adapted to be culturally appropriate while retaining the key elements of consent. Participants were also provided with opportunities to ask questions before deciding to participate or not. If they agreed to participate, the enumerator would proceed to the main survey questions. First, each participant was asked if he/she belonged to a herding group. Based on the participant\u2019s answer to this question, he/she was directed to the subsequent questions associated with a specific referent group (people in my herding group vs people in my village), measuring their perceived descriptive norms, perceived injunctive norms, group orientation, group identity, perceived outcome expectation, behavioral intentions of reducing their herd size and demographics. Based on local norms, participants did not receive incentives for participation.\n\nSurveys were conducted in semi-private settings in Kham Tibetan dialect and lasted approximately 30 min each. Participants\u2019 responses to each question were recorded on the survey paper in Mandarin Chinese by the surveyors and manually entered into the computer later by two research assistants who were fluent in both Chinese and English. Each research assistant first entered all the survey data independently, and then their data entry files were carefully compared to identify any inconsistencies caused by human error during the data entry process. Following several days of data collection, data were reviewed, and procedures were discussed to determine whether modifications were necessary; all study procedures were retained. One researcher who was tri-lingual (Kham Tibetan, Mandarin, and English) was responsible for quality control of the procedures and data. All procedures were approved by a university institutional review board.\n\nMeasurement\n\nLikert-type scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) were adopted, with an additional option \u201cNot Sure\u201d added; response scales were administered using the enumerators\u2019 fingers as a guide. All survey items (see Appendix D), including factor loadings, are presented in Table 1. Items either focused on herding group members or village group members as the referent, the 5 years prior to the survey as the time period, and herd size reduction as the behavior. Because of the nature of the study procedures, which were conducted in the field in naturalistic conditions, without incentives, every effort was made to streamline the questionnaire content and number of items per dimension in order to avoid attrition. For all scales, items retained following confirmatory factor analysis were summed such that higher scores indicated greater levels of the variable.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTABLE 1. The Measurement Model of the Six Constructs.\n\nEstablishment of Measurement Model\n\nBased on Hunter and Gerbing (1982), the development and evaluation of a measurement model via factor analysis procedures included three steps: 1) construction of the model, 2) estimation of the observed correlations among the variables/items in the model, and 3) comparison of the observed correlations among variables with the correlations predicted by the model. The measurement model was specified first based on a theory of the relationships among the items. Thus, it was appropriate to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) procedures to estimate the parameters of the models and provide construct validity evidence. These procedures are included in Step 6 of the MC3M in Figure 1; all scale items are presented in Table 1, with items removed following measurement analysis designated.\n\nScales and Items\n\nPerceived descriptive norms (PDN). Participants\u2019 perceived prevalence of others\u2019 behavior of reducing the herd size among their referent group (herding group or people in the same village) was assessed with four items. One item directly asking about how many yaks they think the most households in their herding group/village own was dropped as it failed the internal consistency test with a low factor loading.\n\nPerceived injunctive norms (PIN). Participants\u2019 perceptions of the referent others\u2019 opinions and anticipations of them reducing the size of their herds were assessed with four items initially. Two items, including a reverse-coded item, were eliminated due to low factor loadings.\n\nGroup identity (GID). Participants\u2019 perceived attitudinal similarity and closeness with their referent group (their herding group or people in the same village) was assessed with four items derived from Rimal and Real (2005). One item measuring participants\u2019 perceived closeness to their herding group/village was dropped as it failed the internal consistency test with a low factor loading.\n\nOutcome expectations (OE). Expectations about behavioral outcomes were measured by four items, including a reverse-coded item measuring the perceived benefits associated with herd reduction behavior. The results indicated small correlations among all the items (see Table 1). Hence, it was deemed inappropriate to compose the variable by summing the items. This variable was removed from the rest of the analysis assessing the validity and reliability of the scales.\n\nGroup orientation (GO). The extent to which one is oriented toward group goals as opposed to individual goals was measured by a four-item scale derived from Triandis\u2019 (1995) individualism-collectivism (INDCOL) scale and prior research (Lapinski et al., 2007), which has been modified for this study based on the in-depth interviews.\n\nBehavioral intention (BI). Participants\u2019 intent to engage in the study behavior of reducing the number of yaks in their herds was measured with three items initially, including a reverse-coded item measuring the intention to increase the number of yaks in their herds. One item was eliminated due to its low factor loading.\n\nDemographics. Participants\u2019 demographic information was collected at the end of the survey, including biological sex (observed and recorded by the enumerator), age, number of people in their households, number of children, level of education, and residence location (county and township).\n\nResults\n\nMissing Data and \u201cNot-Sure\u201d Responses\n\nMissing data and responses of \u201cnot sure\u201d (NS) were scrutinized for patterns (Rubin, 1976) because the population under study is rarely surveyed, and the scales are newly developed (see detailed results in Appendix C). The findings show that NS answers are more prevalent among village groups than herding groups, accounting for 93.62% of the total NS answers, suggesting the influential power of one\u2019s herding group as the source of clearer normative information. For measurement validation in the subsequent analyses, both the missing and the NS data were eliminated, and the pairwise deletion was employed to retain sufficient statistical power.\n\nConstruct Validity Assessment\n\nCFA was conducted using the lessR package developed by Gerbing (2021) within R programming environment to provide evidence that the observed scale items measured the same theoretical constructs. Both internal consistency and parallelism (Hunter and Gerbing, 1982) were tested to evaluate the unidimensionality of the measurement model. The a priori specified criteria for item retention for tests of internal consistency include both the pattern and magnitude of the errors between predicted and obtained correlations between items (e < 0.20) and examination of the size of the factor loadings. Once items were eliminated from a factor, factors were reanalyzed to test the unidimensionality of the new factor. Behavioral intentions with three items7 was not included in this test.\n\nIn testing the internal consistency among items designed to measure PDN, item #4 was dropped as it failed the internal consistency test with a low factor loading and large error for predicted and obtained inter-item correlations (e > 0.20). Since there were only three items left after the elimination, this factor was not tested again for internal consistency. When testing items measuring PIN, items #3 (reverse-coded) and #4 were eliminated due to the low factor loadings and large errors yielded. Two items were retained. Likewise, when testing items measuring group identity, item #4 was eliminated due to the low factor loading and large error. As such, no further internal consistency test was conducted. For the items measuring OE, the results showed insufficient factor loadings of all items developed in this scale with large errors. Hence, we deemed it was inappropriate to compose the variable by summing up the items and removed this variable from the rest of the analysis.\n\nFor the items measuring GO, the test of internal consistency via CFA indicated a plausible four-item solution for the scale; all items were retained. All errors for predicted and obtained inter-item correlations were small (e < 0.20, goodness of fit RMSE = 0.06).\n\nTests of parallelism were next conducted to estimate how items measuring the same factor are distinct from other factors. Instead of assessing macro-level correlations between scales, tests of parallelism are conducted at the level of individual items with a low tolerance for errors (i.e., the discrepancy between the predicted correlations and the observed correlations). Results from the parallelism test showed that the four-factor model solution was acceptable: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.94, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.91, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.07, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.06, \u03c72(67) = 228.01, p < 0.00, all errors were below the a priori specified value of 0.20. The factor loading for each scale item was reported in Table 1, in which the five-factor solution was clearly demonstrated.\n\nDiscriminant Validity of the Constructs\n\nAfter establishing the measurement model, the relationships among the four constructs were examined to assess the discriminant validity, which refers to measurement items within different constructs that should be unrelated (Hunter and Gerbing, 1982). See Table 2 for the correlations among the variables in both herding and village groups. The mean and standard deviation for each variable were also reported in the table.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTABLE 2. Zero-Order Correlations, Means, and Standard Deviations of Measured Variables for Both Herding Group and Village Group Participants.\n\nTo assess discriminant validity, average variance extracted (AVE) was analyzed, which measures the amount of variance captured by a construct in relation to the amount of variance due to measurement error (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The formula for calculating AVE is as below:\n\nAVE = \u2211 [ \u03bb i 2 ] \u2211 [ \u03bb i 2 ] + \u2211 [ V a r ( \u03b5 i ) ]\n\nwhere \u03bb i is the factor loading of each measurement item on its corresponding construct, and \u03b5 i is the error measurement. A widely used criterion to assess discriminant validity is Fornell-Larcker criterion (Fornell and Larcker, 1981), which suggested that based on the corrected correlations from the CFA model, the square root of a construct\u2019s AVE should be larger than the coefficient of correlations between the specific construct and other constructs in the model\u2013that is to say, a latent construct should explain better the variance of its own indicator rather than the variance of other latent constructs. Therefore, the square root of each construct\u2019s AVE should have a greater value than the correlations with other latent constructs. If that is the case, discriminant validity is established on the construct level. In Table 2, evidence is provided for the construct validity of the scales.\n\nMeasurement Invariance Tests\n\nSince the survey questions pertained to different referent groups (herding group vs people in the same village), multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was conducted using Mplus following procedures recommended by Byrne (2013). These tests provide evidence that the observed scale indicators/items under study measured the same theoretical constructs (latent variables or factors) across the two groups of the sample. Without established measurement invariance, comparative analyses do not produce meaningful results, and results of differences between groups cannot be unambiguously interpreted (Milfont and Fischer, 2015).\n\nFirstly, a baseline model (Model 1) was established from each group without constraints imposed across the groups for configural invariance (i.e., pattern invariance test). Next, Model 2 examining metric invariance was tested by constraining the factor loadings to be equal across the two groups (i.e., weak measurement invariance test). Model 3 tested scalar invariance by constraining both the factor loadings and indicator/item intercepts equal across the two groups (i.e., strong measurement invariance test; Byrne, 2013). Results showed no significant changes in Chi-squares across the three models, indicating a satisfactory measurement equivalence across the two groups. This enabled us to compare mean scores for the underlying factors across groups in the later analysis. The results were reported in Table 3.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nTABLE 3. Fit Indices for Measurement Invariance Tests between the Herding Group Members vs Village Group Members.\n\nReliability Assessment\n\nFollowing the establishment of scale dimensionality, parallelism, and invariance, reliability was assessed via calculation of Cronbach\u2019s alpha for each scale using SPSS v.25, with both the split data file based on the referent group (i.e., herding group vs village group) and the combined dataset. Hunter and Gerbing (1982) suggested that when establishing new measures, validity and reliability should be treated separately. Hence, it was necessary to establish the dimensionality of the scales before examining scale reliability.\n\nIn addition to Cronbach\u2019s alpha, composite reliability (sometimes called construct reliability) was assessed as an indicator of internal consistency in scale items (Netemeyer et al., 2003). By measuring the total amount of true score variance relative to the total scale score variance (Brunner and S\u00dc\u03b2, 2005), it serves as an indicator of the shared variance among the observed variables used as an indicator of a latent construct (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Thresholds for composite reliability are up for debate, but as a general guideline (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Netemeyer et al., 2003), composite reliability of the constructs should be higher than 0.7; The formula (Netemeyer et al., 2003) is:\n\n( \u2211 i = 1 p \u03bb i ) 2 ( \u2211 i = 1 p \u03bb i ) 2 + \u2211 i p V ( \u03b4 )\n\nwhere: \u03bb i = completely standardized loading for the ith indicator, V(\u03b4 i ) = variance of the error term for the ith indicator, and p = number of indicators.\n\nResults (see Table 1) showed that coefficient alphas ranged from 0.60 to 0.93. Considering the uniqueness of the target culture group in this study and the fact that this was the very first study ever in which the measures were developed, the relatively lower-alpha scores for group orientation (\u03b1 = 0.68) and behavioral intentions (\u03b1 = 0.60) suggest that future use of these scales should correct estimates for unreliability due to error of measurement. The composite reliability estimates ranged from 0.77 to 0.91, providing additional evidence for scale reliability.\n\nGround Truthing Results\n\nStep 7 in the MC3M is \u201cground truthing\u201d of process, method, and findings throughout the entire course of the research with stakeholders, including cultural insiders. In the current study, this was accomplished in several key ways. First, by conducting cognitive interviewing and ongoing data and procedural quality checks during the course of the study, we accounted for perceptions of cultural insiders. Second, we regularly presented our procedures and progress to our community collaborators and enumerators to gain their input; changes to procedures were made when possible without compromising study rigor or validity. Third, the findings of the study were presented to people working in this region and on these topics prior to publication to discuss the findings and learn about their understanding of the study findings relative to their experience. Fourth, our project partners who work in this region and one of whom is a member of the population from which we sampled, were included in all publications and reviewed the content for consistency with their experience and understanding of the cultural context.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNoting the critical role of reliable and valid culturally derived measures for social norms constructs and the lack of models for developing measures in cultural context, the present study was designed to propose and apply a model to guide intercultural and cross-cultural communication researchers developing quantitative measures of study constructs. Specifically, this study contributed to the existing corpus of communication literature by offering the Model for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement (MC3M) to describe the process of developing measures for communication research involving unique populations. This model, derived from prior research in disciplines outside of communication and applied over several years in a program of research among ethnically Tibetan pastoralists, provides a clear path forward for researchers conducting studies of communication processes across or within cultures among marginalized or co-cultural groups. In addition to proposing and applying the MC3M, the results of this study provide preliminary evidence for measurement validity and reliability of measures of key social norms constructs. We first discuss the measurement development and findings using the MC3M process and then describe the utility and limitations of the MC3M.\n\nSocial Norms Measures\n\nThe development of the culturally contextualized measures of social norms constructs began with significant informal and formal information gathering processes and data collection. Existing social norms theories and measures (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1990; Lapinski and Rimal, 2005) and the culturally-contextualized conceptual definitions served as the basis for new item development and testing using a cross-sectional survey. The content evaluation was conducted by discussions among the multi-lingual, multi-cultural team members, translation and back-translation, and through cognitive interviews among participants from the study population. As a result, we modified questions, revised the response scale, and decided to use finger-counting as a way to describe the response scale to respondents. Continuous process and data quality monitoring during data collection contributed to the development of the measures.\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provided initial evidence for the construct validity of the culturally derived social norm measures. Tests of internal consistency and parallelism indicated that the data were consistent with unidimensional factors measuring the two types of norms: descriptive norms and injunctive norms, as well as group identity, group orientation, and behavioral intentions. Notably, several items were removed from the scales for each of these constructs due to insufficient factor loadings suggesting the need for continued scrutiny of these items in future research. The items designed to measure outcome expectations failed to meet a priori standards, and as such, these items were removed from the final measurement analysis. Outcome expectations play a key role in enhancing the effects of social norms (Chung and Rimal, 2016), and future research should consider improved measures of this construct appropriate to cultural context. The failure of these items is difficult to explain. The content of the items was derived from in-depth interviews, and the adoption of procedures described by Ajzen et al. (1995) for belief elicitation was included; the item administration followed the same procedures as other scales. Nonetheless, it is clear that the items appear to be measuring unique concepts and do not form a unidimensional scale.\n\nMost of the scales exhibited reliability coefficients within generally accepted ranges. However, the scale measuring behavioral intentions is relatively low. Perhaps this is due to the small number of items measuring this dimension since alpha is a function of the number of items on a scale. Because of the study procedures and the need to keep the questionnaire to a reasonable length to recruit and retain study participants without incentives, minimal items per dimension were administered. The behavioral intention scale could benefit from additional item refinement in future research studying behaviors in a cultural context. As an important limitation: although we focused a great deal on identifying, conceptualizing, and understanding the behaviors under study in the in-depth interviews (Lapinski et al., 2021), we did not focus our efforts on understanding our study community\u2019s thinking about the concept of \u201cintent.\u201d This is something any legal scholar will remind us is complicated and perhaps culturally bound.\n\nBecause of the novelty of the study issue and information from our collaborators that most of our participants would not have the experience participating in research studies, a significant amount of time was spent reviewing and refining the item response scales. Ultimately, we decided to use digit counting and verbal descriptions of the responses. A \u201cnot sure\u201d category was included in the scales, based on the cognitive interviewing process, and many participants used this option. The fact that many used this response option reinforces the importance of including it, but also makes the analysis and treatment of \u201cnot sure\u201d responses complicated. It stands as a key limitation to our measures and will be explored carefully in future research. Reviewing the measurement literature for advice on how to handle these data, there was surprisingly little guidance. This represents an opening for future research on measurement and the development of response scales to be used when verbal administration of items is necessary, and populations may have little experience participating in research. This finding also highlights the utility of using cognitive interviewing to refine response scales and items.\n\nSubstantively, the \u201cnot sure\u201d responses show that participants who were asked about village group members as the referent were more uncertain about what is considered normative behavior compared to those belonging to a herding group. These findings were consistent with the existing social norms and communication theories (e.g., Kincaid, 2004; Lapinski and Rimal, 2005; Mackie et al., 2015) on the critical role of physically or psychologically proximal groups in shaping, communicating, and maintaining normative information of certain behaviors.\n\nModel for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement (MC3M)\n\nThe process described for developing, evaluating, and validating the culturally derived social norm measures presented in this study has valuable empirical and theoretical implications for researchers who intend to conduct studies of co-cultural groups or unique populations. The model delineating the specific steps in developing culturally derived communication measures, starting from identifying and refining culturally derived conceptualizations, is a major contribution of this paper. Although we focus specifically on social norms research among the Tibetan population, we believe this model may have relevance for other communication research issues targeting other populations.\n\nThe MC3M has a number of key benefits and limitations. First, it provides a roadmap to researchers who wish to combine qualitative and quantitative methods to study communication processes in cultural contexts by specifying a set of best practices for developing measures. It is particularly applicable for populations or issues with little existing communication research, such as what we describe here. Second, it is based on existing research and practice and meant to function as a nascent and evolvable model as research on measurement development in cultural context progresses in the field of communication. There are certain additions and changes that could be incorporated into this model, and it is the hope of the researchers that it will have heuristic value, evolving as new knowledge is generated. Third, it is directly designed to be applied to intercultural, cross-cultural, and global communication research, filling a gap in the literature that has been dominated by other disciplines.\n\nThe model is not without limitations. Most importantly, we recognize that implementing the entire model requires significant time, resources, and relationships in a community. Further, the measures developed using the model cannot be simply taken and used in other cultural contexts but can serve as a basis for adaptation in intercultural communication research among similar populations and for similar issues. The relativism approach taken in the MC3M represents a departure from some of the existing cross-cultural/intercultural research, in which absolutism or universalism approaches are commonly adopted, and measures are used in communities without adaptation. With this said, we acknowledge that absolutism or universalism may still be appropriate in certain study contexts, such as when the research constructs are likely to be less sensitive to the influence of cultural or social factors.\n\nNonetheless, it is crucial to recognize the substantial role of culture in people\u2019s communication, cognitions, and behaviors (Herdman et al., 1997; Berry et al., 2002). As such, we encourage researchers to develop quantitative measures derived within a specific cultural context following rigorous procedures. Measurement development and validation are critical for expanding social norms and other communication research accounting for cultural similarities and differences. Doing so can enhance both internal and external validity in the corpus of research to account for culturally-based concepts and processes (Mollen et al., 2010; Croucher et al., 2019).\n\nThe continued increasing global interactions highlight the need for cross-cultural researchers to be particularly careful and attentive to the issues of adapting existing constructs, theories, and measures developed in one culture for use in other cultures, and such issues are applicable to a variety of research disciplines. Acknowledging that nuances of the research process are different for each study, we hope that the proposed Model for Culturally Contextualized Communication Measurement, as well as the case we have described in this study, could serve to stimulate advancement in both conceptual and measurement refinement in intercultural and cross-cultural communication research.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Michigan State University.

The authors do not have financial conflicts of interest.\n\n2As a caveat, only studies published in English language journals are reviewed here. Further, we only use the information available about these studies in the published version of the paper which may be incomplete.\n\n3Minor adaptions of the scales may be involved to fit with the specific study scenarios or focal behaviors.\n\n4Although English is the dominant language in Australia and the U.S., Singapore\u2019s national languages are English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil (Department of Statistics Singapore, 2019).\n\n5The geographical distance between villages is very far with some hundreds of kilometers apart and the primary transportation relies on rough mountain roads, so obtaining the sample was challenging. The participants were recruited primarily through community events and snowball sampling strategies.\n\n6We were conducting research in a politically sensitive area in China (c.f., Huang, 2013) and participants were likely to be unfamiliar with surveys. As such, we used verbally administered surveys.\n\n7Based on the suggestions from our experienced local collaborators and cultural insiders, we had to keep the survey short by limiting the number of items for each scale as much as possible, due to the reasons that 1) our survey was verbally administered, which took a much longer time to complete compared to a written/online survey, and 2) our study group had never participated in any studies or completed any surveys. Items developed in each scale with closely shared meaning may confuse them when answering the questions.\n\nReferences\n\nAbikoye, G. E., and Olley, B. O. (2012).

This approach encompasses ideas and observations from an array of disciplines, notably history, sociology, demography, developmental psychology, biology, and economics. In particular, it directs attention to the powerful connection between individual lives and the historical and socioeconomic context in which these lives unfold. As a concept, a life course is defined as \"a sequence of socially defined events and roles that the individual enacts over time\" (Giele and Elder 1998, p. 22). These events and roles do not necessarily proceed in a given sequence, but rather constitute the sum total of the person's actual experience. Thus the concept of life course implies age-differentiated social phenomena distinct from uniform life-cycle stages and the life span. Life span refers to duration of life and characteristics that are closely related to age but that vary little across time and place.\n\nIn contrast, the life course perspective elaborates the importance of time, context, process, and meaning on human development and family life (Bengtson and Allen 1993). The family is perceived as a micro social group within a macro social context\u2014a \"collection of individuals with shared history who interact within ever-changing social contexts across ever increasing time and space\" (Bengston and Allen 1993, p. 470). Aging and developmental change, therefore, are continuous processes that are experienced throughout life. As such, the life course reflects the intersection of social and historical factors with personal biography and development within which the study of family life and social change can ensue (Elder 1985; Hareven 1996).\n\nHistorical Development\n\nMany researchers identify the life course perspective as a \"new\" paradigm in the behavioral sciences because it was not formally advanced until the 1990s. During this decade, rapid social change and population aging drew attention to historical influences and to the complexity of processes underlying family change and continuity. Advances in statistical techniques also prompted the continued growth of life course studies, including the creation of new methodologies to analyze longitudinal data.\n\nEarly applications of life course theorizing can be traced to the beginning decades of the twentieth century (Bengston and Allen 1993). Until the mid-1960s, however, no distinct field of life course studies, with a focus on the variability of age patterns, developmental effects, and the implications of historical change, gained prominence. At this time, researchers from diverse social science disciplines (e.g., Clausen 1991; Riley 1987; Hagestad and Neugarten 1985) examined various aspects of these themes, including the joint significance of age, period, and cohort in explaining the relationship between individual and social change. \"Social timetables\" and their variability were also used to study development, aging, and cohorts. For example, Bernice Neugarten pioneered a research program that considered individual deviations from widely shared age-expectations about the timing of major transitional events (for example, when to marry or to have children). Research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s continued to incorporate these themes, as well as to focus attention on historical changes in life patterns, the consequences of life course experiences (such as the Great Depression) on subjective well-being, the interlocking transitions of family members, and integrating kin and age distinctions, among others (Burton and Bengtson 1985; Clausen 1991; Elder 1974; Rossi and Rossi 1990). By the end of the twentieth century, the life course approach was commonly considered an \"emerging paradigm\" (Rodgers and White 1993) with both a distinctive theory and methods. Glen Elder, in particular, began to advance core principles of life course theory, which he describes as defining \"a common field of inquiry by providing a framework that guides research on matters of problem identification and conceptual development\" (1998, p. 4). This perspective has also been (and continues to be) synthesized with other theories or fields of study, such as family development (e.g., Bengston and Allen), human development (e.g., Elder), status attainment (e.g., Featherman; Blau; and Duncan), family history (e.g., Hareven), life span (e.g., Baltes), stress theory (e.g., Pearlin and Skaff), demography (e.g., Uhlenberg), gerontology (e.g., Neugarten), and Bronfenbrenner's ecological perspective (Moen et al. 1995).\n\nKey Principles and Concepts\n\nSeveral fundamental principles characterize the life course approach. They include: (1) socio-historical and geographical location; (2) timing of lives; (3) heterogeneity or variability; (4) \"linked lives\" and social ties to others; (5) human agency and personal control; and (6) how the past shapes the future. Each of these tenets will be described and key concepts will be highlighted. This will be followed by an overview of selected examples of empirical applications from an international and cross-cultural perspective.\n\nSociohistorical and geographical location. An individual's own developmental path is embedded in and transformed by conditions and events occurring during the historical period and geographical location in which the person lives. For example, geopolitical events (e.g., war), economic cycles (e.g., recessions), and social and cultural ideologies (e.g., patriarchy) can shape people's perceptions and choices and alter the course of human development. Thus, behavior and decisions do not occur in a vacuum, because people and families interact within sociohistorical time. Indeed, an understanding of the location of various cohorts in their respective historical contexts aids scholars and policy makers to identity circumstances that have differentially affected people's respective life histories.\n\nTiming of lives. Three types of time are central to a life course perspective: individual time, generational time, and historical time (Price, McKenry, and Murphy 2000). Individual or ontogenetic time refers to chronological age. It is assumed that periods of life, such as childhood, adolescence, and old age, influence positions, roles, and rights in society, and that these may be based on culturally shared age definitions (Hagestad and Neugarten 1985). Generational time refers to the age groups or cohorts in which people are grouped, based upon their age. People born between 1946 and 1964, for example, are often referred to as the baby boom generation. Finally, historical time refers to societal or large-scale changes or events and how these affect individuals and families, such as political and economic changes, war and technological innovations (e.g., information access through the Internet).\n\nFurthermore, Elder (1985) observes that time can also be envisioned as a sequence of transitions that are enacted over time. A transition is a discrete life change or event within a trajectory (e.g., from a single to married state), whereas a trajectory is a sequence of linked states within a conceptually defined range of behavior or experience (e.g., education and occupational career). Transitions are often accompanied by socially shared ceremonies and rituals, such as a graduation or wedding ceremony, whereas a trajectory is a long-term pathway, with age-graded patterns of development in major social institutions such as education or family. In this way, the life course perspective emphasizes the ways in which transitions, pathways, and trajectories are socially organized. Moreover, transitions typically result in a change in status, social identity, and role involvement. Trajectories, however, are long-term patterns of stability and change and can include multiple transitions.\n\nProgress along trajectories is age-graded such that some transitions can be viewed as more age appropriate while others violate normative social timetables by occurring too early or too late (Hagestad and Neugarten 1985). An off-age transition might be leaving home at a very young age (e.g., age fifteen) or becoming a teenage parent. There is also the possibility of transition reversals or countertransitions. An example of a transition reversal is when a young adult returns after leaving home, while countertransitions can be produced by the life changes of other roles and statuses (e.g., parenthood creates grandparenthood). The timing of transitions also can decrease the chance of success in a particular trajectory, such as the likelihood of completing school.\n\nHeterogeneity or variability. Heterogeneity or diversity in structures or processes is another life course principle. One must consider not only modal or average developmental and transitional trends, but also variability. Matilda Riley's (1987) research supported a model of age stratification\u2014the different experiences of different cohorts\u2014and so helped to overcome the fallacy of cohort centrism, the notion that cohorts share perspectives simply because they share a common age group. Indeed, generations or cohorts are not homogeneous collections of people. Rather, they differ in terms of influential dimensions such as gender, social class, family structure, ethnicity, and religion. Moreover, the ability to adapt to life course change can vary with the resources or supports inherent in these elements in the form of economic or cultural capital (e.g., wealth, education) or social capital (e.g., family social support). For example, Barbara A. Mitchell's (2000) research demonstrates that young adults with weak family ties may not have the option to return home during difficult economic times. Finally, there is also the recognition of increasing diversity associated with aging. The longer one lives, the greater the exposure to factors that affect the aging process.\n\nLinked lives and social ties. A fourth tenet emphasizes that lives are interdependent and reciprocally connected on several levels. Societal and individual experiences are linked thorough the family and its network of shared relationships (Elder 1998). As a result, macro-level events, such as war, could affect individual behaviors (e.g., enrolling in military service), and this can significantly affect other familial relationships. Stressful events, such as the death of a family member, can also affect family relationships because these occurrences can trigger patterns of stress and vulnerability or, conversely, promote adaptive behaviors and family resilience. Moreover, personality attributes of individual family members can also affect family coping styles, functioning, and well-being.\n\nIn addition, family members can also synchronize or coordinate their lives with regard to life planning and matters related to the timing of life events. This can sometimes generate tensions and conflicts, particularly when individual goals differ from the needs of the family as a collective unit. Tamara Hareven (1996), for example, notes that historically, the timing of adult children's individual transitions (e.g., when to marry) could generate problems if it interfered with the demands and needs of aging parents.\n\nHuman agency and personal control. According to the life course perspective, individuals are active agents who not only mediate the effect of social structure but also make decisions and set goals that shape social structure. Individuals are assumed to have the capacity to engage in planful competence, which refers to the thoughtful, proactive, and self-controlled processes that underlie one's choices about institutional involvements and social relationships (Clausen 1991). However, it should be recognized that the ability to make specific choices depends on opportunities and constraints. Parallel to this idea is the concept of control cycles whereby families and individuals modify their expectations and behavior in response to changes in either needs or resources. Elder (1974) found that families in the Great Depression regained a measure of control over their economic hardship through expenditure reductions and multiple family earners. In this way, families and individuals can construct, negotiate, and traverse life course events and experiences.\n\nHow the past shapes the future. Finally, another hallmark of this perspective is that early life course decisions, opportunities, and conditions affect later outcomes. The past, therefore, has the potential to shape the present and the future, which can be envisioned as a ripple or domino effect. This can occur at various levels: the cohort/generational level and the individual/familial level. For example, one generation can transmit to the next the reverberations of the historical circumstances that shaped its life history (living through the feminist movement, for example). The timing and conditions under which earlier life events and behaviors occur (e.g., dropping out of school, witnessing domestic abuse) can also set up a chain reaction of experiences for individuals and their families (e.g., reproduction of poverty, a cycle of family violence). The past, therefore, can significantly affect later life outcomes such as socioeconomic status, mental health, physical functioning, and marital patterns. This long-term view, with its recognition of cumulative advantage or disadvantage, is particularly valuable for understanding social inequality in later life and for creating effective social policy and programs (O'Rand 1996).\n\nSelected Research Applications\n\nThe life course perspective has been applied to several areas of family inquiry in North America (particularly in the United States), as well as inter-nationally. Although space limitations do not permit full coverage of this vast body of work, several studies are highlighted to illustrate recent applications of the approach. In the United States, researchers have adopted this framework to investigate: men's housework (Coltrane and Ishii-Kuntz 1992); the timing of marriage and military service (Call and Teachman 1996); work history and timing of marriage (Pittman and Blanchard 1996); families, delinquency and crime (Sampson and Laub 1993) as well as many other substantive areas (Price et al. 2000).\n\nIn Canada, researchers have used a life course approach to study the transition to grandmotherhood (Gee 1991) and youth transitions into adulthood, especially leaving and returning to home (e.g., Mitchell 2000). It should also be noted that this perspective is becoming popular in studies of ethnic diversity, social inequality, and aging families (Stoller and Gibson 2000) and that numerous cross-national comparisons of life patterns have been conducted (e.g., between Germany and the United States\u2014Giele and Elder 1998, p. 246).\n\nFurthermore, the life course approach is being used more and more in countries such as Japan (Fuse 1996) and other East Asian countries, as well as Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, and India. Applications of the life course perspective are illustrated in research on generational relations and family support in Thailand and Sri Lanka (Hareven 1996), caregiver's marital histories in Britain (Lewis 1998), the German Life History Study (Br\u00fcchner and Mayer 1998; Elder and Giele 1998, p. 52), young adults from the Netherlands (Liefbroer and De Jong 1995), changing patterns of age, work, and retirement in Europe (Guillemard 1997), and patterns of household formation and inheritance in preindustrial northern Europe and in northern India (Gupta 1995).\n\nFinally, a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodologies have been used in life course analyses. Common quantitative methodologies include: longitudinal designs, cohort and cross-sectional comparisons, and life event history analysis; whereas descriptive and qualitative approaches entail archival research, biographical approaches such as life history reviews and in-depth interviews, personal narratives, and life stories. This methodological pluralism is consistent with the multidisciplinary nature of the life course perspective and the recognition of the necessity to bridge macro and micro levels of theory and analysis (Giele and Elder 1998).\n\nIn summary, the flourishing area of life course theorizing and research offers unique opportunities to interconnect historical and cultural location and changes in societal institutions with the experiences of individuals and families. The challenge will be to refine and test a dynamic, emergent conceptual model that extends across multiple disciplines and multiple levels of analysis. Future advances will enable researchers to extend the frontiers of knowledge pertaining to continuity and discontinuity in family life amidst ever-changing social, economic and global environments.\n\nSee also:Adulthood; Family Roles; Family Theory; Rites of Passage; Time Use; Transition to Parenthood\n\nBibliography\n\nbengtson, v. l., and allen, k. r.

Communication: mean to share with or to make common, as in giving to another a part or share of your\n\nthoughts, hopes, and knowledge. Source \u4ea4\u9645\u9080\u8bf7\n\nThe source is the person with an idea he or she desires to communicate.\n\n13.Encoding \u7f16\u7801 Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), humans are not able to share thoughts directly. Your\n\ncommunication is in the form of a symbol representing the idea you desire to communicate. Encoding is the\n\nprocess of putting an idea into a symbol. Message \u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f The term message identifies the encoded thought. Encoding is the process, the verb; the\n\nmessage is the resulting object. Channel \u4ea4\u9645\u6e20\u9053 The term channel is used technically to refer to the means by which the encoded message\n\nis transmitted. The channel or medium, then, may be print, electronic, or the light and sound waves of the\n\nface-to-face communication. Noise \u5e72\u6270 The term noise technically refers to anything that distorts the message the source encodes. Receiver \u4ea4\u9645\u63a5\u53d7 The receiver is the person who attends to the message. Decoding \u89e3\u7801 Decoding is the opposite process of encoding and just as much an active process. The\n\nreceiver is actively involved in the communication process by assigning meaning to the symbols received. Receiver response \u63a5\u53d7\u53cd\u5e94 The receiver is the person who attends to the message. Receiver response\n\nrefers to anything the receiver does after having attended to and decoded the message. Feedback \u53cd\u9988 Feedback refers to that portion of the receiver response of which the source has knowledge\n\nand to which the source attends and assigns meaning. Context \u573a\u666f The final component of communication is context.

How is the Chinese writing style different the American writing style?\n\nThe Chinese employ a circular approach in writing. In this kind of indirect writing, the development of the\n\nparagraph may be said to be \u2018turning and turning in a widening gyre\u2019. The circles or gyres turn around the subject\n\nand show it from a variety of tangential views, but the subject is never looked at directly. A paragraph is set off by\n\nan indentation of its first sentences or by some other conventional devise, such as extra space between\n\nparagraphs.\n\nIn contrast, the Americans are direct and linear in writing. An English expository paragraph usually begins with a\n\ntopic statement, and then, by a series of subdivisions of that topic statement, each supported by example and\n\nillustrations, proceeds, to develop that central idea and relate that idea to all other ideas in the whole essay, and\n\nto employ that idea in proper relationship with the other ideas, to prove something, or perhaps to argue\n\nsomething.

However, they do believe that there is a\n\nsupreme and wonderful truth that words cannot teach, and ritual cannot attain.\n\nBuddhists are not favorably disposed to the notion of free enterprise and the pursuit of material well-being. Seen\n\nfrom a western worldview, having no desires adversely affects motives for personal enrichment and growth\n\ngenerally. Thus, little support is accorded to free enterprise.\n\nChristianity recognizes the importance of work and free ownership of property. Protestant, in particular, sees the\n\nsalvation of the individual through hard work and piety.

L. Mencken and Carl Jung \u2014 may or may not be fair to diplomats, but are surely correct in reminding us that more is involved in what one communicates than what one literally says; more is involved in what one means than the standard, conventional meaning of the words one uses. The words \u2018yes,\u2019 \u2018perhaps,\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 each has a perfectly identifiable meaning, known by every speaker of English (including not very competent ones). However, as those lines illustrate, it is possible for different speakers in different circumstances to mean different things using those words. How is this possible? What\u2019s the relationship among the meaning of words, what speakers mean when uttering those words, the particular circumstances of their utterance, their intentions, their actions, and what they manage to communicate? These are some of the questions that pragmatics tries to answer; the sort of questions that, roughly speaking, serve to characterize the field of pragmatics.\n\nPragmatics deals with utterances, by which we will mean specific events, the intentional acts of speakers at times and places, typically involving language. Logic and semantics traditionally deal with properties of types of expressions, and not with properties that differ from token to token, or use to use, or, as we shall say, from utterance to utterance, and vary with the particular properties that differentiate them. Pragmatics is sometimes characterized as dealing with the effects of context. This is equivalent to saying it deals with utterances, if one collectively refers to all the facts that can vary from utterance to utterance as \u2018context.\u2019 One must be careful, however, for the term is often used with more limited meanings.\n\nDifferent theorists have focused on different properties of utterances. To discuss them it will be helpful to make a distinction between \u2018near-side pragmatics\u2019 and \u2018far-side pragmatics.\u2019 The picture is this. The utterances philosophers usually take as paradigmatic are assertive uses of declarative sentences, where the speaker says something. Near-side pragmatics is concerned with the nature of certain facts that are relevant to determining what is said. Far-side pragmatics is focused on what happens beyond saying: what speech acts are performed in or by saying what is said, or what implicatures (see below for an explanation of these terms) are generated by saying what is said.\n\nNear-side pragmatics includes, but is not limited to resolution of ambiguity and vagueness, the reference of proper names, indexicals and demonstratives, and anaphors, and at least some issues involving presupposition. In all of these cases facts about the utterance, beyond the expressions used and their meanings, are needed.\n\nWe can divide these facts into several categories. For indexicals such as \u2018I,\u2019 \u2018now,\u2019 and \u2018here,\u2019 basic facts about the utterance are required: the agent, and when and where it occurred. For other indexicals and demonstratives, speaker intentions are also relevant. While it seems the referent of \u2018you\u2019 must be a person addressed by the speaker, which of several possible addressees is referred to seems up to the speaker\u2019s intentions. Within syntactic and semantic constraints, anaphoric relations seem largely a matter of speaker\u2019s intent. Speaker\u2019s intentions and the way the speaker is connected to the wider world by causal/historical \u2018chains of reference\u2019 are relevant to the reference of proper names.\n\nFar-side pragmatics deals with what we do with language, beyond what we (literally) say. This is the conception according to which Voltaire\u2019s remarks belong to pragmatics. It\u2019s up to semantics to tell us what someone literally says when they use expressions of a given type; it\u2019s up to pragmatics to explain the information one conveys, and the actions one performs, in or by saying something.\n\nPragmatics is usually thought to involve a different sort of reasoning than semantics. Semantics consists of conventional rules of meaning for expressions and their modes of combination. Locke supposed that communication was basically a matter of a speaker encoding thoughts into words and the listener decoding words back into thoughts. The same basic picture is found fairly explicitly in Saussure and other influential theorists. This picture seems to fit reasonably well with the picture that emerged from the logicians and philosophers of language in the tradition of logical analysis, of language as a system of phonological, syntactic and semantic rules, of which competent speakers and interpreters have implicit mastery. Paradigmatically, the sincere speaker plans to produce an utterance with the truth-conditions of a belief she wishes to express; she chooses her words so that her utterance has those truth-conditions; the credulous interpreter needs to perceive the utterance, and recognize which phones, morphemes, words and phrases are involved, and then using knowledge of the meanings, deduce the truth-conditions of the utterance and of the belief it expresses.\n\nIn contrast, pragmatics involves perception augmented by some species of \u2018ampliative\u2019 inference \u2014 induction, inference to the best explanation, Bayesian reasoning, or perhaps some special application of general principles special to communication, as conceived by Grice (see below) \u2014 but in any case a sort of reasoning that goes beyond the application of rules, and makes inferences beyond what is established by the basic facts about what expressions are used and their meanings.\n\nThe facts with which pragmatics deals are of various sorts, including:\n\nFacts about the objective facts of the utterance, including: who the speaker is, when the utterance occurred, and where;\n\nFacts about the speaker\u2019s intentions. On the near side, what language the speaker intends to be using, what meaning she intends to be using, whom she intends to refer to with various shared names, whether a pronoun is used demonstratively or anaphorically, and the like. On the far side, what she intends to achieve by saying what she does.\n\nFacts about beliefs of the speaker and those to whom she speaks, and the conversation they are engaged in; what beliefs do they share; what is the focus of the conversation, what are they talking about, etc.\n\nFacts about relevant social institutions, such as promising, marriage ceremonies, courtroom procedures, and the like, which affect what a person accomplishes in or by saying what she does.\n\nWe will divide our discussion, somewhat arbitrarily, into the \u2018Classic Pragmatics\u2019 and \u2018Contemporary pragmatics.\u2019 The Classic Period, by our reckoning, stretches from the mid-sixties until the mid-eighties.\n\nOur initial focus will be on the traditions in pragmatics inaugurated by the J. L. Austin and H. P. Grice. Both of these philosophers were interested in the area of pragmatics we call \u2018beyond saying.\u2019 In the classic period, these phenomena were studied on the premise \u2014 a premise increasingly undermined by developments in pragmatics itself \u2014 that a fairly clear distinction could be made between what is said, the output of the realm of semantics, and what is conveyed or accomplished in particular linguistic and social context in or by saying something, the realm of pragmatics. What is said is sort of a boundary; semantics is on the near side, and those parts of pragmatics that were the focus of the classic period are on the far side.\n\nThe British philosopher John Langshaw Austin (b. 1911\u2013d. 1960) was intrigued by the way that we can use words to do different things. Whether one asserts or merely suggests, promises or merely indicates an intention, persuades or merely argues, depends not only on the literal meaning of one\u2019s words, but what one intends to do with them, and the institutional and social setting in which the linguistic activity occurs. One thing a speaker might intend to do, and be taken to do, in saying \u201cI\u2019ll be there to pick you up at six,\u201d is to promise to pick her listener up at that time. The ability to promise and to intend to promise arguably depends on the existence of a social practice or set of conventions about what a promise is and what constitutes promising. Austin especially emphasized the importance of social facts and conventions in doing things with words, in particular with respect to the class of speech acts known as illocutionary acts.\n\nAustin began by distinguishing between what he called \u2018constatives\u2019 and \u2018performatives.\u2019 A constative is simply saying something true or false. A performative is doing something by speaking; paradigmatically, one can get married by saying \u201cI do\u201d (Austin 1961). Constatives are true or false, depending on their correspondence (or not) with the facts; performatives are actions and, as such, are not true or false, but \u2018felicitous\u2019 or \u2018infelicitous,\u2019 depending on whether or not they successfully perform the action in question. In particular, performative utterances to be felicitous (i) must invoke an existing convention and (i) the convention must be invoked in the right circumstances.\n\nA clear delimitation between performatives and constatives proved to be difficult to establish, however. There are explicit performatives; a verb used in a certain way makes explicit the action being performed: \u201cI bet that there is a dangerous animal there,\u201d \u201cI guarantee that there is a dangerous animal there,\u201d \u201cI warn you that there is a dangerous animal there.\u201d But the same action could be performed implicitly: \u201cThere is a dangerous animal there,\u201d where both issues of (in)felicities and issues of truth/falsity are simultaneously present. Instead of pursuing the distinction between performatives and constatives, Austin (1962a) proposed a new three-fold distinction.\n\nAccording to this trichotomy, a speech act is, first of all, a locutionary act, that is, an act of saying something. Saying something can also be viewed from three different perspectives: (i) as a phonetic act: uttering certain noises; (ii) as a phatic act: uttering words \u201cbelonging to and as belonging to, a certain vocabulary, conforming to and as conforming to a certain grammar\u201d; and (iii) as a rhetic act: uttering words \u201cwith a certain more-or-less definite sense and reference\u201d (Austin 1962a, 95). Now, to perform a locutionary act is also in general to perform an illocutionary act; in performing a locutionary act, we perform an act with a certain force: ordering, warning, assuring, promising, expressing an intention, and so on. And by doing that, we will normally produce \u201ccertain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts or actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons\u201d (ibidem, 101) that Austin calls perlocutionary. At the point of his untimely death, Austin\u2019s work on speech act theory was far from complete. His main work, How to do things with words was published posthumously, based on lecture notes of Austin and his students.\n\nAustin\u2019s student, John R. Searle (1969) developed speech act theory as a theory of the constitutive rules for performing illocutionary acts, i.e., the rules that tell what performing (successfully) an illocutionary act (with certain illocutionary force and certain propositional content) consists in. The rules are classified as (i) propositional content rules, which put conditions on the propositional content of some illocutionary acts; (ii) preparatory rules, which tell what the speaker will imply in the performance of the illocutionary acts; (iii) sincerity rules, that tell what psychological state the speaker expresses to be in; and (iv) essential rules, which tell us what the action consists in essentially.\n\nLet\u2019s return to our case of promising. According to Searle\u2019s analysis, for an utterance by S to H to count as a promise must meet the following conditions:\n\nThe propositional content represents some future action A by S;\n\nH prefers S\u2019s doing A to her not doing it, and S believes that to be so; and it is not obvious both to S and H that S will do A in the normal course of events;\n\nS intends to do A; and\n\nPromising counts as the undertaking of an obligation of S to do A.\n\nIf someone, then, wants to make a (felicitous) promise she must meet these conventional conditions. The study of these conventional conditions for illocutionary acts, together with the study of their correct taxonomy constitutes the core of speech act theory.\n\nBased on their essential conditions, and attending to the minimal purpose or intention of the speaker in performing an illocutionary act, Searle (1975a) proposes a taxonomy of illocutionary acts into five mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive classes:\n\nRepresentative or assertive. The speaker becomes committed to the truth of the propositional content; for example, asserting: \u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d\n\nDirective. The speaker tries to get the hearer to act in such a way as to fulfill what is represented by the propositional content; for example, commanding: \u201cClose the door!\u201d\n\nCommissive. The speaker becomes committed to act in the way represented by the propositional content; for example, promising: \u201cI\u2019ll finish the paper by tomorrow.\u201d\n\nExpressive. The speaker simply expresses the sincerity condition of the illocutionary act: \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s raining!\u201d\n\nDeclarative. The speaker performs an action just representing herself as performing that action: \u201cI name this ship the Queen Elizabeth.\u201d\n\nSpeech act theory, then, adopts a social or institutional view of linguistic meaning. This is sometimes opposed to the intentionalist view favored by Grice (1957) and Strawson (1964), but there need be no inconsistency. (For an interesting discussion on the relationship between intentionalist and social, institutional and intersubjective views on meaning and communication by Searle, Bennett, Habermas and Appel, see part I of Lepore & Van Gulick 1991.)\n\nHerbert Paul Grice (b. 1913\u2013d. 1988) emphasized the distinction Voltaire makes, in our opening quotation, between what words mean, what the speaker literally says when using them, and what the speaker means or intends to communicate by using those words, which often goes considerably beyond what is said. I ask you to lunch and you reply, \u201cI have a one o\u2019clock class I\u2019m not prepared for.\u201d You have conveyed to me that you will not be coming to lunch, although you haven\u2019t literally said so. You intend for me to figure out that by indicating a reason for not coming to lunch (the need to prepare your class) you intend to convey that you are not coming to lunch for that reason. The study of such conversational implicatures is the core of Grice\u2019s influential theory.\n\nGrice\u2019s so-called theory of conversation starts with a sharp distinction between what someone says and what someone \u2018implicates\u2019 by uttering a sentence. What someone says is determined by the conventional meaning of the sentence uttered and contextual processes of disambiguation and reference fixing; what she implicates is associated with the existence of some rational principles and maxims governing conversation (setting aside \u2018conventional implicatures\u2019 which we discuss below). What is said has been widely identified with the literal content of the utterance; what is implicated, the implicature, with the non-literal, what it is (intentionally) communicated, but not said, by the speaker. Consider his initial example:\n\nA and B are talking about a mutual friend, C, who is now working in a bank. A asks B how C is getting on in his job, and B replies: Oh quite well, I think; he likes his colleagues, and he hasn\u2019t been to prison yet. (Grice 1967a/1989, 24.)\n\nWhat did B say by uttering \u201che hasn\u2019t been to prison yet\u201d? Roughly, all he literally said of C was that he hasn\u2019t been to prison up to the time of utterance. This is what the conventional sentence meaning plus contextual processes of disambiguation, precisification of vague expressions and reference fixing provide.\n\nBut, normally, B would have implicated more than this: that C is the sort of person likely to yield to the temptation provided by his occupation. According to Grice, the \u2018calculation\u2019 of conversational implicatures is grounded on common knowledge of what the speaker has said (or better, the fact that she has said it), the linguistic and extra linguistic context of the utterance, general background information, and the consideration of what Grice dubs the \u2018Cooperative Principle (CP)\u2019:\n\nMake your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged. (Grice 1967a/1989, 26.)\n\nThe maxims\n\nAccording to Grice, the CP is implemented, in the plans of speakers and understanding of hearers, by following \u2018maxims:\u2019\n\nQuantity Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange). Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.\n\nQuality (Supermaxim): Try to make your contribution one that is true. (Submaxims): Do not say what you believe to be false. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\n\nRelation Be relevant.\n\nManner (Supermaxim): Be perspicuous. (Submaxims): Avoid obscurity of expression. Avoid ambiguity. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). Be orderly. Frame whatever you say in the form most suitable for any reply that would be regarded as appropriate; or, facilitate in your form of expression the appropriate reply (added by Grice 1981/1989, 273).\n\n\n\nGrice sees the principles governing conversation as derived from general principles governing human rational cooperative action. There has been much discussion about the CP and the maxims. Are all of them necessary? Do we need more? Are they normative or descriptive? What\u2019s their exact role in the theory of implicatures: Are they principles that speakers and hearers are assumed to observe in rational communication, or simply the theorist\u2019s tools for rational reconstruction? Does the CP require from speaker and hearer further cooperation towards a common goal beyond that of understanding and being understood? What is clear is that Grice attributes to these principles an essential role for the definition and the interpretation of conversational implicatures.\n\nImplicatures\n\nThe paradigmatic kind of reasoning on the part of the hearer for the determination of implicatures, according to Grice, follows this pattern:\n\nHe has said that p; there is no reason to suppose that he is not observing the maxims, or at least the CP; he could not be doing this unless he thought that q; he knows (and knows that I know that he knows) that I can see that the supposition that he thinks that q is required; he has done nothing to stop me thinking that q; he intends me to think, or is at least willing to allow me to think, that q; and so he has implicated that q. (Grice 1967a/1989, 31.)\n\nApplied to the earlier example, about the banker, A would reason in the following way:\n\nB has said that C has not been to prison yet (p); he is apparently flouting the maxim of relation (\u201cBe relevant.\u201d), but I have no reason to suppose that he is opting out CP; his violation of the maxim would only be apparent if he is thinking that C is potentially dishonest (q); B knows (and knows that I know that he knows) that I can figure out he is thinking that q; \u2026; so he has implicated that q.\n\nConversational implicatures have the following characteristics:\n\nThey are cancelable: \u2026 a putative conversational implicature that p is explicitly cancelable if, to the form of words the utterance of which putatively implicates that p, it is admissible to add but not p, or I do not mean to imply that p, and it is contextually cancelable if one can find situations in which the utterance of the form of words would simply not carry the implicature. (Grice 1967b/1989, 44.) They are non-detachable: \u2026 it will not be possible to find another way of saying the same thing, which simply lacks the implicature in question, except where some special feature of the substituted version is itself relevant to the determination of an implicature (in virtue of one of the maxims of Manner). (Grice 1967a, 1989, 39.) They are calculable: The presence of a conversational implicature must be capable of being worked out; for even if it can in fact be intuitively grasped, unless the intuition is replaceable by an argument, the implicature (if present at all) will not count as a conversational implicature. (Grice 1967a/1989, 31.)\n\nGrice considers this last property to be crucial for distinguishing between conversational and conventional implicatures. Conventional implicatures are generated by the meaning of certain particles like \u2018but\u2019 or \u2018therefore.\u2019 Consider the difference between (1) and (2):\n\nHe is an Englishman, therefore he is brave. He is an Englishman, and he is brave.\n\nAccording to Grice, a speaker has said the same with (1) as with (2). The difference is that with (1) she implicates (3).\n\n3. His being brave follows from his being English.\n\nThis is a conventional implicature. It is the conventional meaning of \u2018therefore,\u2019 and not maxims of cooperation, that carry us beyond what is said.\n\nGrice\u2019s concept of conventional implicatures (which has antecedents in Frege; see Bach 1999b) is the most controversial part of his theory of conversation for many followers, for several reasons. According to some, its application to particular examples runs against common intuitions. By using the word \u2018therefore\u2019 is the speaker not saying that there is some causal connection between being brave and being English? Isn\u2019t she saying and not merely implying that one\u2019s being brave follows from one\u2019s being English? Moreover, the category of conventional implicatures blurs the distinction between what is said, usually conceived as determined by the semantic conventions of language, and what is implicated, usually thought of as a matter of the speaker\u2019s intentions in saying what she does. Conventional sentence meaning contributes crucially to what is said, which is considered essentially different from implicatures; but now we have the result that some elements of conventional meaning do not contribute to what is said but to implicatures (albeit conventional). Finally, it places the study of the conventional meaning of some expressions within the realm of pragmatics (study of implicatures), rather than semantics, usually conceived as the home of conventional meaning.\n\nAmong conversational implicatures, Grice distinguished between \u2018particularized\u2019 and \u2018generalized.\u2019 The former are the implicatures that are generated by saying something in virtue of some particular features of the context, \u201ccases in which there is no room for the idea that an implicature of this sort is normally carried by saying that p.\u201d (Grice 1967a/1989, 37) The above example of conversational implicature is, then, a case of particularized conversational implicature. A generalized conversational implicature (henceforth GCI) occurs where \u201cthe use of a certain forms of words in an utterance would normally (in the absence of special circumstances) carry such-and-such an implicature or type of implicature.\u201d (Ibid.). Grice\u2019s first example is a sentence of the form \u201cX is meeting a woman this evening.\u201d Anyone who utters this sentence, in absence of special circumstances, would be taken to implicate that the woman in question was someone other than X\u2019s \u201cwife, mother, sister, or perhaps even close platonic friend\u201d (Ibid.) Being an implicature, it could be cancelled, either implicitly, in appropriate circumstances, or explicitly, adding some clause that implies its denial.\n\nParticularized conversational implicatures have a wide range of applications that Grice himself illustrates: the informative use of tautologies, irony, metaphor, hyperbole, meiosis and, in principle, any kind of non-literal use that relies in special circumstances of the utterance can be explained in terms of them. But GCIs apply to philosophically more important issues, in particular, to what, according to the introduction to \u201cLogic and Conversation\u201d, was Grice\u2019s most important motivation: the issue of the difference of meaning between logical constants of formal languages and their counterparts in natural languages, or the alleged meanings of verbs like \u2018to look like,\u2019 \u2018to believe\u2019 or \u2018to know.\u2019 GCIs are also at the heart of Grice\u2019s Modified Occam\u2019s Razor (\u201cSenses are not to be multiplied beyond necessity,\u201d Grice 1967b/1989, 47), which has served as a criterion for distinguishing semantic issues from pragmatic uses and for preferring, in general, an explanation in terms of implicatures rather than a semantic one that postulates ambiguity.\n\nGrice is probably best known in the philosophy of language for his theory of implicatures. It is surely his most influential body of work for those parts of linguistics, psychology, cognitive science and computer science that share philosophy\u2019s interest in language. His theory of meaning, however, is indispensable for understanding his overall philosophical vision and his \u2018big picture\u2019 of language and communication. We will not explain this project, which consists in part of ultimately reducing all semantic notions to psychological ones. But we will say a bit about its central concept of \u2018M-intentions,\u2019 in order to develop an important aspect of his pragmatic theory, the concept of a communicative intention.\n\nCommunicative intentions\n\nGrice conceived that semantic notions like word and sentence meaning were ultimately based on speaker\u2019s meaning, and this on speaker\u2019s intention, what he called M-intentions. What he conceived as a study of the ontology of semantic notions has been received, however, as a characterization of communicative intentions, the mental causes of communicative acts, and those that the hearer has to understand for the communicative act to be successful.\n\nSo conceived, communicative intentions have these characteristic properties:\n\nThey are always oriented towards some other agent \u2014 the addressee.\n\nThey are overt, that is, they are intended to be recognized by the addressee.\n\nTheir satisfaction consists precisely in being recognized by the addressee.\n\nThese properties are already pointed out in the first version of Grice\u2019s M-intentions:\n\n\u201cA meant something by x\u201d is (roughly) equivalent to \u201cA intended the utterance of x to produce some effect in an audience by means of the recognition of this intention.\u201d (Grice 1957/1989, 220.)\n\nGrice later reformulated this definition, giving rise to a hot debate about the precise characterization of communicative intentions, mainly about two points:\n\nCommunicative intentions are intentions to produce some response on the part of the addressee, but what kind of response, exactly, should this be? Suppose I tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d This act may have many results: perhaps you will hear the words, understand their meaning, come to believe that it is raining, search for your umbrella, fail to find it and grow angry, and finally become so angry you chew the rug. I may have planned all of this, but more typically I will have had in mind that you be prepared for the weather. But my communicative intention seems to be directed at a crucial subgoal. If I get you to believe it is raining, your own rationality will take over and you will get prepared. What I seem to aim at is changing your beliefs. It was this sort of response that Grice took to be typical in his early work on meaning. But it is really more in line with the spirit of his proposal that the crucial subgoal be to get the audience to believe that the speaker believes that it is raining. That\u2019s really the change that language can bring about; having gotten the audience that far, the speaker needs to hope that the audience trusts her weather-knowledge, will take the steps to themselves believing in rain, and then prepare adequately for the weather. But even this rather modest subgoal may be too much to require for the success of the communicative action qua communicative action. Suppose I say that it is raining, and you hear me and understand the meaning of my words. But you don\u2019t think I am being sincere; you don\u2019t believe that I believe what I said. But still, I have said it. My overall plan to help insure that you don\u2019t get wet and catch cold may fail, but I do seem to have succeeded in saying what I set out to say. It seems that the only new mental state needed is the audience\u2019s recognition of the speaker\u2019s communicative intention; his understanding of the speaker\u2019s utterance. This is what has been called \u2018illocutionary uptake\u2019: In the case of illocutionary acts we succeed in doing what we are trying to do by getting our audience to recognize what we are trying to do. But the \u2018effect\u2019 on the hearer is not a belief or a response, it consists simply in the hearer understanding the utterance of the speaker. (Searle 1969, 47.) So the most common answer has been to follow Searle on this point and exclude perlocutionary results, beyond uptake of this sort, from the content of communicative intentions. Communicative intentions must be wholly overt: The understanding of the force of an utterance in all cases involves recognizing what may be called broadly an audience-directed intention and recognizing it as wholly overt, as intended to be recognized. (Strawson 1964, 459.) The exact formulation of this requirement has been a subject of intense debate, some arguing for a reflexive (self-referential) definition, others for a potentially infinite but practically finite number of clauses in the definition, with conceptual, logical or psychological arguments. What seems to be a matter of consensus is that every covert or even neutral (with respect to its intended recognition by the addressee) aspect of the speaker\u2019s intention must be left out of the definition of communicative intentions. A short but comprehensive way of concluding would be to say that the fulfillment of communicative intentions consists precisely in being recognized by the addressee. (For this debate, see Searle 1969; Schiffer 1972; Harman 1974; Blackburn 1984; Sperber and Wilson 1986; Recanati 1986; Bach 1987 and Neale 1992.)\n\nAfter the founding work made in parallel by Austin-Searle, on the one side, and by Grice, on the other, Kent Bach and Robert Harnish (Linguistic Communication and Speech Acts (1979)) made an important attempt to integrate the founders\u2019 insights in a unified theory.\n\nOn the whole, if choosing the appropriate label for their theory between either \u2018neo-Gricean\u2019 or \u2018neo-Austinian/Searlean,\u2019 the first seem the most appropriate: their theory might be taken to lean toward the Gricean conception of inferential understanding of the speaker\u2019s communicative intentions rather than to the Austin-Searle view of speech acts as performed according to some conventional or \u2018constitutive\u2019 rules. To obtain a unified theory they developed their own conceptual framework, based on the ideas of Grice, Austin and Searle but including many important innovations of their own. Here it is a brief description of some of them:\n\nLocutionary acts\n\nLike Austin, but unlike Searle, Bach and Harnish argue for the concept of locutionary acts: acts of using sentences with \u201ca more or less definite \u2018sense\u2019 and a more or less definite \u2018reference,\u2019\u201d in Austin\u2019s words. They are more explicit than Austin, and argue that determining what someone has (locutionarily) said by uttering a sentence amounts to determining\n\nthe operative meaning of the sentence uttered the referents for the referring expressions the properties and relations being ascribed the times specified\n\nWith this information the hearer identifies what a speaker has said, at the locutionary level. From a contemporary perspective, the most remarkable point here is, in our opinion, that they see the determination of the locutionary act by the hearer, not as a matter of merely decoding the conventional meaning of the sentence uttered, but as a matter of inference that has to be based on linguistic meaning plus contextual information concerning the speaker\u2019s intentions. Grice did not claim that what a speaker said was determinable without consideration of the speaker\u2019s intentions; quite the contrary. But he was not particularly explicit about the way it was done, and the received view, anyway, has been that inference was exclusive to the \u2018calculation\u2019 of implicatures.\n\nThe distinction between locutionary and illocutionary acts of saying also offers Bach and Harnish a useful conceptual tool for treating potentially problematic cases of discordance between utterance content and speaker\u2019s intentions, such as slips of the tongue, false referential beliefs, and irony.\n\nTo go from the locutionary to the illocutionary content, if there is any, the hearer has to infer the communicative intention of the speaker, and to do that, the hearer needs more information. Among other things, the hearer will have to make use of the Communicative Presumption (CP) that they state as follows:\n\nThe mutual belief in the linguistic community C L to the effect that whenever a member S says something in L to another member H, he is doing so with some recognizable illocutionary intent. (Bach and Harnish 1979, 61.)\n\nThe taxonomy of illocutionary acts\n\nBach and Harnish accept most of Searle\u2019s (1975a) critiques of Austin\u2019s taxonomy as well as his criteria for grouping illocutionary acts in terms of basic illocutionary intentions and expression of mental attitudes; but they make some amendments. To begin with, they discard Searle\u2019s class of declarative illocutionary acts (basically covering Austin\u2019s explicit performatives), because they take them to be basically assertives or constatives (see Searle 1989, Bach and Harnish 1992 for a further discussion of this issue). Then, the communicative illocutionary acts are (Bach and Harnish 1979, ch. 3):\n\nconstatives, that express a speaker\u2019s belief and her desire that the hearer forms a similar one.\n\ndirectives, that express some attitude about a possible future action by the hearer and the intention that her utterance be taken as reason for the hearer\u2019s action.\n\ncommissives, that express the speaker\u2019s intention to do something and the belief that her utterance obliges her to do it.\n\nacknowledgments, that express feelings toward the hearer (or the intention that the utterance will meet some social expectations regarding the expression of feelings).\n\nBach and Harnish make a distinction between communicative illocutionary acts, the category to which these four types belong, and the category of conventional illocutionary acts, which they take to be fundamentally different. Communicative acts are acts performed with certain communicative intentions whose recognition by the hearer is necessary for the acts to be successful. In conventional acts, on the other hand, no communicative intention need be involved. Success is a matter of convention, not intention. Conventional acts determine and produce facts of institutional nature, if performed according to conventions that do not require any communicative intention on the part of the speaker and, a fortiori, neither its recognition on the part of any hearer. Among conventional acts, Bach and Harnish (1979, ch. 6) distinguish between two classes:\n\neffectives, that when produced by the appropriate person in appropriate circumstances produce a change, a new fact in an institutional context; an example might the President of the United States statement that he vetoes a piece of legislation.\n\nverdictives, do not produce facts, but determine facts, natural or institutional, with an official, binding effect in the institutional context; an example is a jury\u2019s verdict of guilt; it does not create the fact of guilt, but settles the issue of guilt in a binding way.\n\nThe SAS\n\nThe Speech Act Schema (SAS) gives the form of the required reasoning by the hearer to fully understand the speaker\u2019s utterance: from the meaning of the sentence used all the way to the perlocutionary act performed. This requires, besides linguistic information, a system of communicative and conversational presumptions, together with contextual mutual beliefs.\n\nBach and Harnish think that inference is involved, from the beginning, in the determination of the locutionary act. The next step is to infer the literal illocutionary intentions and from here, in the simplest case, go for the (intended) perlocutionary ones, if any. Roughly, an illocutionary act is literal when its propositional content coincides with the content of the locutionary act, and the force of the former is within the constraints imposed by the latter.\n\nBut it may happen that the literal illocutionary act cannot be taken as a reasonable thing to have been done by the speaker in some specific circumstances (say, the literal claim is false and obviously so), and the hearer has to search for another non-literal act. Someone speaks non-literally when she does not mean what she says but something else instead.\n\nIt can also be the case that the speaker is doing more than merely performing a literal act. She means what she says but she means more. The hearer will have to infer the indirect act being performed. It must be noticed that indirect acts can also be based on non-literal acts. Then the SAS extends to account for the intentional perlocutionary effects of the speech act.\n\nBach and Harnish\u2019s SAS offers a detailed study of the structure of utterance interpretation as an inferential process. Taken as an attempt of unification of the two main roots of pragmatics, it can be considered as the closing of the \u2018Classic Pragmatics\u2019 period and the transition from \u2018philosophical\u2019 pragmatics to linguistic and psychological pragmatics. They can be still located within far-side pragmatics but their clear idea of the role of pragmatic \u2018intrusion\u2019 in the determination of what is said is announcing the arrival of near-side pragmatics.\n\nIn logic and in many of the investigations of logical empiricists in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, artificial languages were the focus of attention. First the predicate calculus, and then various extensions of it incorporating modal and temporal operators seemed the appropriate linguistic vehicles for clear-thinking philosophers. Issues about the use of natural languages were often thought to be beyond the scope of the proof-theoretic and model-theoretic tools developed by logicians. As Stalnaker put it in 1970,\n\nThe problems of pragmatics have been treated informally by philosophers in the ordinary language tradition, and by some linguists, but logicians and philosophers of a formalistic frame of mind have generally ignored pragmatic problems \u2026 . (Stalnaker 1970/1999, 31.)\n\n(For an important exception, see Reichenbach\u2019s Elements of Symbolic Logic (1947).)\n\nThe idea that techniques of formal semantics should be adapted to natural languages was forcefully defended by Donald Davidson, on general philosophical principles, and Richard Montague, who applied the techniques of possible worlds semantics to fragments of English in a body of work that was influential in both philosophy and linguistics.\n\nThese attempts make clear that, on the near side of what is said, semantics and pragmatics are quite enmeshed. The interpretation of indexicals and demonstratives seems squarely in the realm of pragmatics, since it is particular facts about particular utterances, such as the speaker, time, and location, that determine the interpretation of \u2018I,\u2019 \u2018you,\u2019 \u2018now\u2019 and the like. But the relevance of these varying factors is determined by a non-varying rule of meaning, as Bar-Hillel (1954) had already observed.\n\nIn his essay \u201cPragmatics\u201d (1968), Richard Montague generalized the concept of a possible world to deal with a number of phenomena, including indexicals. An index combines a possible world with other factors relevant to the truth value of a sentence. To study tensed sentences, for example, one incorporates times into indices. A sentence like \u201cElwood went to the store,\u201d is true in a world, at a time. A sentence like \u201cI went to the store,\u201d would be true in a world, at a time, for a speaker: roughly, if the speaker went to the store prior to the time in the world.\n\nIf we ignore time, we can think of the meaning of \u201cI am sitting\u201d as a function from pairs of speakers and worlds to truth-values. Suppose Moe is sitting in the actual world w and standing in alternative world w\u2032, while Curley is standing in w and sitting in w\u2032. \u201cI am sitting\u201d is true at <Moe, w> and <Curley, w\u2032>.\n\nA somewhat different approach to indexicality, implemented in different ways by David Kaplan and Robert Stalnaker, has been much more influential, however. Here is how Stalnaker put the key idea:\n\nThe scheme I am proposing looks roughly like this: The syntactical and semantical rules for a language determine an interpreted sentence or clause: this, together with some features of the context of use of the sentence or clause determines a proposition; this in turn, together with a possible world, determines a truth-value. An interpreted sentence, then, corresponds to a function from contexts into propositions, and a proposition is a function from possible worlds into truth-values. (Stalnaker 1970/1999, 36.)\n\nBoth of these philosophers develop a \u2018two-tiered\u2019 approach to the content of utterances of sentences containing indexicals. \u201cI am sitting\u201d expresses the proposition that Moe is sitting in a context with Moe as speaker, a different proposition, that Curley is sitting, in a context with Curley as speaker. Thus we have two functions involved. The character (Kaplan) or propositional concept (Stalnaker) is a function from contexts to propositions. And, at least within possible worlds semantics, propositions are conceived as functions from worlds to truth-values.\n\nThis \u2018two-tiered\u2019 approach brings out what Moe\u2019s utterance of \u201cI am sitting,\u201d has and doesn\u2019t have in common with Curley\u2019s utterance of \u201cYou are sitting,\u201d directed at Moe. They both have the same truth-value, of course, but more importantly they express the same proposition, in spite of having different meanings (characters, propositional concepts).\n\nThere are, however, important differences in the way Kaplan and Stalnaker implement this idea, which reflect the very different ways in which they think about context.\n\nThe most influential treatment of indexicals and demonstratives has probably been David Kaplan\u2019s monograph Demonstratives (1989), versions of which were circulated in the seventies. Kaplan\u2019s basic concepts are context, character, and content. Character is what is provided by sentences with indexicals, like \u201cI am sitting,\u201d or \u201cYou are sitting,\u201d a function from contextual features to contents.\n\nFor Kaplan, a context is a quadruple of an agent, location, time and world; intuitively, these are the speaker of an utterance, the time and location of the utterance, and the possible world in which it occurs; the beliefs of the speaker as to who she is, where she is, and when it is, and what the real world is like are irrelevant to determining content, although not of course to explaining why the speaker says what she does. (The possible world is the contextual feature Kaplan uses to deal with \u201cactually\u201d). A proper context is one in which the agent is at the location at the time in the world, which is of course the characteristic relation among the speaker, time, location and world of an utterance.\n\nKaplan did not officially take his theory to be a theory of utterances. He thought of his account, or at least of the formal theory he supplies, as a theory of occurrences, or sentences-in-context, which are abstract objects consisting of pairs of contexts and expression types. Utterances, Kaplan argues, are an unsuitable subject matter for logical investigation. Utterances take time, for one thing, so it would not be possible to insist that all of the premises of an argument share the same context, but this stipulation is needed for logic. For another, since any utterance of \u201cI am not speaking\u201d would be false, we might have to conclude that \u201cI am speaking\u201d is a logical truth, an unwelcome result.\n\nKaplan does not call what he is doing \u201cpragmatics\u201d but the semantics of indexicals and demonstratives.\n\nKaplan\u2019s theory was part of a movement in the philosophy of language that developed the sixties and seventies, which we will call \u2018referentialism.\u2019 For our purposes, the salient aspects of referentialism are (i) in some forms, heavy reliance was made of the concept of \u2018what is said,\u2019 \u2014 often equated with \u2018the proposition expressed\u2019 \u2014 by a particular utterance of a suitably declarative sentence; (ii) referentialists argued persuasively that \u2018what is said\u2019 or \u2018the proposition expressed\u2019 depends on reference of names, indexicals and demonstratives, rather than any descriptive \u2018backing\u2019 or identifying conditions speakers or hearers might associate with them. More controversially, Donnellan (1966) argued that in the case of \u2018referential\u2019 uses of definite descriptions, the reference of the description, rather than the descriptive condition, is a constituent of the proposition expressed.\n\nThe question naturally raises, then, how does the referentialist conception of what is said fit with Grice\u2019s theory of conversation, which, as we have seen, pertains to the reasons the speaker has for saying what she does.\n\nIt can be argued that Kaplan\u2019s concept of content fits in with Grice\u2019s theory of conversation. For the purposes of formal semantics and logic, the context (in Kaplan\u2019s sense) can be taken as given. Kaplan treats both the sentence and the context as abstract objects, and all of the rules of interpretation are suitably deductive. Pragmatics begins when we apply Kaplan\u2019s theory to utterances. Semantics and near-side pragmatics resolve reference, and so what proposition is expressed, that is, what is said, by an utterance involving the use of a sentence in a context. Then Grice\u2019s theory of conversation, and the Austin-Searle theory of speech acts, takes over to tell us what else the speaker has implicated by saying what she did, and what else she has accomplished in or by saying what she did.\n\nThis picture is not without problems, however. Referentialism seems to bring in its wake various version of Frege\u2019s problem of identity, and these are relevant to pragmatics.\n\nConsider the statements \u201cHesperus is visible in the eastern sky\u201d and \u201cPhosphorus is visible in the eastern sky.\u201d On referentialist principles, the two statements express the same proposition, the one that is true in all worlds in which Venus (the planet that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 are two names for) is visible in the eastern sky. But they seem to convey different information. And, most dramatically, \u201cHesperus is Hesperus\u201d seems trivial, while \u201cHesperus is Phosphorus\u201d or \u201cPhosphorus is Venus\u201d seem to convey valuable information. And yet, on referentialist principles, all three identity statements express the same proposition.\n\nParadigmatically, according to Grice\u2019s theory, the input to the hearer\u2019s reasoning about implicatures is what is said. Referentialism would seem to imply that different ways of saying the same thing should be conversationally equivalent. But this does not seem correct. If Elwood says, \u201cI can\u2019t reach the salt,\u201d this has the implicature that he would appreciate someone passing it to him. But what if he says, \u201cElwood can\u2019t reach the salt\u201d? The implicatures are not so clear. Elwood seems to have flouted the maxim of quantity, in both its submaxims, giving us information we don\u2019t need (the name of the person who can\u2019t reach the salt), and denying us information we do need, namely that the speaker is the person whose relation to the saltshaker is at issue. Grice\u2019s maxims of manner allow the theory of conversation to deal with information that depends on how something is said, rather than only what is said; it seems these maxims may have to be exploited beyond what Grice envisaged to explain how co-referential names and indexicals can give rise to non-equivalent implicatures, if we adopt the referentialist account of what is said.\n\nIn his seminal article \u201cPragmatics\u201d (1970) Stalnaker proposed a conception of semantics and pragmatics that would allow the tools and traditions of formal semantics to be extended to pragmatics. The pragmatic phenomena he mainly had in mind are what we are calling \u201cnear-side pragmatics,\u201d involving the way in which, in the setting of natural language, contextual factors interact with conventional meaning to determine what is said, or the proposition expressed. Stalnaker uses his pragmatic theory to deal with issues that might be thought to require a semantic explanation, such as the informativeness of identity statements (\u201cHesperus is Phosphorus\u201d) and the import of negative existentials (\u201cHomer did not exist\u201d); in doing so he saw himself as continuing in a Gricean tradition:\n\n\u2026 I think the general Gricean strategy of trying to reduce the burden on semantics by explaining as much of the phenomena as possible in terms of truisms about conversation as a rational activity remains as fruitful and promising as it was when he first proposed it. (Stalnaker 1999, 113.)\n\nFormal semantics, as Stalnaker sees it, can be conceived as the study of propositions within a possible worlds framework. Artificial languages are designed to fit the meanings they are to express, so the connection between language and proposition should not be a tricky issue. But with natural languages,\n\nit is a semantical problem to specify the rules for matching up sentences of a natural language with the propositions that they express. In most cases\u2026the rules will not match sentences directly with propositions, but will match sentences with propositions relative to features of the context in which the sentence is used. These contextual features are a part of the subject matter of pragmatics\u2026 (Stalnaker 1970/1999, 34.)\n\nPresupposition, Common Ground and Context\n\nLike Kaplan, Stalnaker has a two-tiered picture: sentence meanings provide a function from contexts to propositions; propositions themselves are functions from worlds to truth-values. Stalnaker, however, has a quite different picture of context, which he bases on the concept of presupposition. Intuitions about what is said are accompanied by intuitions about what is not said, but merely presupposed. If Elwood says,\n\nThe Queen of England has several palaces\n\nhe does not say that there is a Queen of England, but he presupposes that there is. And consider\n\nPeter knows the sea is salty It was James Madison that led America to defeat in the war of 1812 Bush regrets invading Iraq Trump resumed cheating on his wife\n\nIn saying (2), Elwood would not say, but merely presuppose, that the sea is salty. In saying (3) he would presuppose, but not say, that someone led America to defeat in the War of 1812. In saying (4) Elwood would presuppose that Bush invaded Iraq, and in (5) he would presuppose that Trump had cheated on his wife, and then stopped doing so for a period of time (possibly rather short).\n\nPresupposition has been treated as a semantic phenomenon and as a pragmatic phenomenon. Arguably, each of (1)-(5) and its corresponding negation would have the same presupposition. This has led to the semantic conception of presupposition as a non-trivial entailment that is shared by a statement and its negation. Semantical approaches to presupposition encounter some tricky problems, the most important of which is \u201cthe projection problem.\u201d If presupposition is semantic, then it seems the presuppositions of complex sentences should be a function of the presuppositions of the simple sentences that make them up, but it is at least not obvious that this is so. Consider, for example,\n\nThe king has a son The king\u2019s son is bald If the king has a son, the king\u2019s son is bald\n\n(6) presupposes that there is a king, (7) that there is a king and that the king has a son. (8) contains both (6) and (7). It seems to inherit the presupposition of (6) but not of (7); that is, (8) presupposes that there is a king, but not that he has a son. A correct theory of just how presuppositions are inherited from simple to complex sentences would solve the projection problem, and doing so seems to be required for a semantic account of presupposition. A number of interesting theories have been put forward; it is not our purpose to claim that they are or are not successful. (See Karttunen 1973, 1974; Karttunen and Peters 1979; Gazdar 1979; Soames 1989; Burton-Roberts 1989a-b, 1999; Heim 1992; Horn 19995; Asher and Lascarides 1998; Carston 1998, 1999a; Kamp 2001; Beaver 2002; Schlenker 2010.)\n\nStalnaker recognizes semantic presupposition in the case of simple sentences (1)-(5). And he thinks that semantic presuppositions are also pragmatically presupposed; that is, if P is a semantic presupposition of what the speaker says, then the speaker will in fact take P for granted and take her audience to do so too; she will treat P as part of the common ground:\n\nThere is no conflict between the semantic and pragmatic concepts of presupposition; they are explications of related but different ideas. In general, any semantic presupposition of a proposition expressed in a given context will be a pragmatic presupposition of the people in the context, but the converse clearly does not hold. To presuppose a proposition in the pragmatic sense is to take its truth for granted, and to assume that others involved in the context do the same\u2026 The set of all the presuppositions made by a person in a given context determines a class of possible worlds, the ones consistent with all the presuppositions. This class sets the boundaries of the linguistic situation. (Stalnaker 1970/1999, 38.)\n\nStalnaker emphasizes that when we make assertions (the paradigmatic use of language, conceived as a tool for exchanging information), there is a natural division into what the speaker presupposes and what the speaker says. If Elwood says, \u201cThe Queen of England has charming grandchildren,\u201d he presupposes that there is a unique queen of England, and says that her grandchildren are charming. In the ordinary case, the presupposition would be shared by the conversational participants, but not everyone would already know, or believe, what Elwood says about her. The presuppositions that are shared are the common ground, which is an important part of the context of an utterance. Elwood\u2019s assertion is an attempt to add to the common ground that additional content that the queen\u2019s grandchildren are charming. Of course, someone may deny that this is so, in which case it wouldn\u2019t become part of the common ground. Nevertheless, we can conceptualize the meaning of a sentence, or a central part of the meaning of a sentence, in terms of the change a use of it attempts to make to the common ground.\n\nPropositional Concepts\n\nUnlike Kaplan, Stalnaker has a homogeneous theory of contexts and contents. Both context and content can be conceived of as propositions, or equivalently as sets of worlds. A context is a set of worlds, that capture the common ground in a conversation, the presuppositions that all of the participants share. The point of an assertion is to change the common ground. An utterance token is associated with a propositional concept, which characterizes the context-change potential of an assertion.\n\nA propositional concept is a function from possible worlds into propositions, or, equivalently, a function from an ordered pair of possible worlds into a truth-value. (Stalnaker 1978/199, 81.)\n\nThe truth-value of a statement like \u201cThat man is sitting\u201d will depend on two issues: (i) who is being referred to as \u2018that man\u2019; (ii) who is sitting. The propositional concept corresponding to this statement will yield the truth for any pair of worlds w, w\u2032 such that there is an x that is referred to as \u2018that man\u2019 in w, and x is sitting in w\u2032.\n\nSuppose, for example, we are talking about Albert. The common ground will include such things as that \u2018Albert\u2019 names a certain person that attended Stanford last year, that this person was from Bonn, and that he intended to return and teach in Germany. The common ground leaves open whether he is, as we speak, in Germany or not. I say, \u201cAlbert isn\u2019t in Germany, but in Switzerland, this month.\u201d If no one objects, the common ground will change; the worlds in which Albert is anywhere but in Switzerland will be eliminated. The propositional concept of an utterance can be seen as the effect it will have on the various contexts in which it might occur. Which worlds my assertion adds or deletes from the common ground will depend on who we are talking about (the reference of \u2018Albert\u2019) and which month it is when I speak, for example. The proposition expressed by a statement, what is asserted, will be a proposition that captures the change proposed for the context in which it occurs.\n\nSuppose now that you and I are talking, and not far in the distance are Elwood and Ambrose. Elwood is clearly standing; it\u2019s not so clear whether Ambrose is standing or sitting. I point to Ambrose and say, \u201cthat man is sitting.\u201d Given that I am pointing to Ambrose, my statement will be true only if he is sitting, and so perhaps you change your beliefs accordingly; what was not part of the common ground, that Ambrose was sitting, now becomes part of the common ground.\n\nAnother possibility is that you think you see Ambrose at least as clearly than I do, and it is not at all clear that I am right. So you reject my proposal to modify the common ground, and say, \u201cAmbrose may not be sitting.\u201d\n\nBut there is a third possibility, too. Suppose you took me as pointing to Elwood. But if I am pointing to Elwood, I am saying something patently false, for it is clear that he is standing. To make sense of my remark, the simplest thing to do is change your view of whom I am pointing at: Ambrose rather than Elwood. Now the change is not in who you think is sitting or not, but whom you think I am pointing to. Given the propositional concept of the utterance \u201cthat man is sitting\u201d, it works, in the paradigmatic case, to convey information about who is sitting, and it also has the capacity, in a different situation, to convey information about to whom I am pointing.\n\nThe concept of a propositional concept allows Stalnaker to accommodate the facts that, as we saw above, seemed to pose a problem for referentialists.\n\nMost current pragmatic theorists are neo-Griceans in that they adopt at least some version of his main three contributions:\n\na fundamental distinction of what a speaker says and what she implicates; a set of rules or principles, derived from general principles of rationality, cooperation and/or cognition, that guide, constrain or govern human linguistic communication (there are differences among neo-Griceans on the exact nature of these principles and of pragmatic reasoning generally, as we shall see); and a notion of communicative intention (called M(eaning)-intention by Grice) whose fulfillment consists in being recognized by the addressee.\n\nGiven these similarities, there are many differences. One important dimension involves disciplines and methodology. Following Carston (2005) there are at least three different general tendencies: those who see pragmatics, much in Grice\u2019s vein, as a philosophical project; those who concentrate on its interaction with grammar; and those who see it as an empirical psychological theory of utterance interpretation.\n\nA second dimension has to do with the relative importance given to two models of communication. One is the coding-decoding model of Locke and Saussure, as developed in the twentieth century logic and philosophy in compositional theories of meaning and truth. The other model, which we owe mostly to Grice, also has Lockean roots, in that communication of belief from speaker to hearer lies at its center. But the mechanism of discovery is not decoding according to conventional rules, but intention-recognition and discovery based on ampliative inference. The two models are not inconsistent, and all theorists accept elements of each. The issue is their relative centrality and importance in the phenomenon of human communication with language.\n\nAccording to the coding model, communication consists in a sender and a receiver sharing a common code or language and a channel, so that the former encodes the message and sends it for the latter to decode it. Communication is, following this picture, quite an easy matter. It just amounts to knowledge of language and a safe channel \u2014 i.e., without too much \u2018noise.\u2019 If sender and receiver share the knowledge of the code and the message makes its way through the channel the success of communication is guaranteed.\n\nOne of Grice\u2019s major contributions to the theory of communication was provision of an alternative to the Locke-Saussure model of communication as a coding and decoding of thoughts. One can think of the alternative either as a supplement or a replacement for the coding model.\n\nIntentions and their recognition are at the heart of Grice\u2019s alternative. Even if the interpreter\u2019s reasoning is guided by the conversational principle or maxims, as Grice suggested, intention-recognition is not basically a matter of following conventional rules, but ampliative reasoning about what is going on in other minds.\n\nBut how do the two models fit together? Is language mainly and centrally a matter of deduction, of coding and decoding according to the conventions of meaning, with a little intention-recognition around the near and far edges to take care of ambiguity and implicature? Or is communication mainly a matter of acting in ways that get one\u2019s intentions recognized, with the conventions of language being just a helpful resource for accomplishing this?\n\nIn the classical period, near-side pragmatics tended to be ignored, and the Gricean model applied only to issues beyond saying; all of this is consistent with the first picture. Many neo-Griceans still adopt much of the first picture, and see the core of language as an autonomous realm studied by semantics, in which the meanings of parts compositionally determine the meanings of wholes, the fundamental concept of meaning being the truth-conditions of sentences. Grice\u2019s work is often used to bolster this picture; Gricean considerations serve as a sort of shock-absorber, where apparent data that are difficult to handle on the autonomous-semantics picture are treated as merely apparent, resulting from mistaking implicatures for \u2018semantic content.\u2019 Recanati calls such theorists \u2018minimalists;\u2019 (see 3.4 below) while no one denies that contextual facts and pragmatic reasoning are needed at the near side of what is said, according to these theorists, there is minimal intrusion of such considerations on autonomous semantics.\n\nAccording to relevance theory this is a mistake. Sperber and Wilson (1986) see things the second way. Following Grice\u2019s model, understanding what someone means by an utterance is a matter of inferring the speaker\u2019s communicative intention: the hearer uses all kinds of information available to get at what the speaker intended to convey. The semantic information obtained by decoding the sentence uttered is but one example of such information. But much more information has to be used to infer what the speaker meant \u2014 that includes both what she said and what she implicated \u2014 by her utterance. So central is intention-recognition to understanding language that the code model, with autonomous semantics at its core, should largely be abandoned in favor of the inferential model. One kind of pragmatic reasoning pervades language use, near-side and far-side, and the areas in which the code model is applicable are basically marginal.\n\nThe need for supplementary information is too pervasive and too important to be a matter of something specifically linguistic, as might be suggested by Grice\u2019s conversational principle and maxims. Sperber and Wilson see the fundamental mechanism of such inferences as going well beyond language, and beyond humans. In terms of Carston\u2019s distinctions, relevance theory departs from Grice\u2019s philosophical project, and aims at an empirical psychological theory of human cognition and communication. They see the phenomenon they call \u2018relevance\u2019 as a psychological phenomenon basic to the lives not only of humans but of all animals with a cognitive repertoire sophisticated enough to have choices about which environmental cues to attend to. Evolution shapes the phenomenon of relevance; an animal\u2019s attention is drawn to environmental cues that provide the most crucial information. Sounds of an approaching cat grabs a bird\u2019s attention away from a worm; parents are alert to the sounds of their baby\u2019s crying. The phenomenon is extended through learning; the squeal of brakes grabs a driver\u2019s attention away from a pretty sunset. And the cues can be conventional; the dinner bell grabs the attention of the hungry child. The phenomenon of relevance in language is another manifestation of this very general phenomenon. \u2018Relevance\u2019 in relevance theory, then, should not be taken to be just our ordinary conception of relevance; nor should it be equated with the \u2018relevance\u2019 of Grice\u2019s maxim, although it is connected to that and intended to provide a deepened understanding of what underlies the maxim.\n\nRelevance theory emphasizes that the rules of language leave all sorts of issues open. Some words have too many meanings: ambiguity. Others have too little meaning: \u2018he,\u2019 or \u2018that.\u2019 Decoding alone won\u2019t determine which meaning the speaker is using, or which object she intends to refer to with a pronoun. So even before we get to what is said, communication involves intentions on the part of the speaker that go beyond what she \u201ccodes-up\u201d into language, and inferences on the part of the hearer that go beyond decoding. And of course when we consider what is conveyed beyond saying, the coding model is even less adequate. In all of these ways in which knowledge of convention falls short, relevance fills the gap.\n\nA second difference rooted in the psychological conception of pragmatics is reliance on the representational theory of mind. The tenets of relevance theory are couched in talk of processing representations, rather than, and sometimes in addition to, the ordinary terminology of philosophical psychology.\n\nThus, instead of Grice\u2019s cooperative principle and conversational maxims, relevance theory postulates principles of relevance, which stem from the applicability of the general phenomenon of relevance to linguistic situations in the context of a representational theory of mind. There are two fundamental principles.\n\nPragmatic relevance is a property of utterances as a particular case of inputs to cognitive processes:\n\nAn input is relevant to an individual when it connects with available contextual assumptions to yield POSITIVE COGNITIVE EFFECTS: for example, true contextual implications, or warranted strengthenings or revisions of existing assumptions. (Sperber & Wilson 2005, 7)\n\nThe relevance of an input for an individual is a matter of degree. In general, the greater those positive cognitive effects with the smaller mental effort to get them, the greater the relevance of the input for the individual. Sperber and Wilson conjecture that the cognitive architecture of human beings tends to the maximization of relevance. This is what their first principle of relevance states:\n\nFirst (cognitive) principle of relevance: Human cognition is geared towards the maximization of relevance (that is, to the achievement of as many contextual (cognitive) effects as possible for as little processing effort as possible).\n\nThis is the general cognitive principle that serves as background for communication in general and linguistic communication in particular. Applied to linguistic communication, this involves the following: For a communicative act to be successful, the speaker needs the addressee\u2019s attention; since everyone is geared towards the maximization of relevance, the speaker should try to make her utterance relevant enough to be worth the addressee\u2019s attention. This leads us to the\n\nSecond (communicative) principle of relevance: Every act of ostensive communication (e.g. an utterance) communicates a presumption of its own optimal relevance.\n\nBy \u2018ostensive\u2019 relevance theorists make reference to the \u2018overt\u2019 or \u2018public\u2019 nature of the speaker\u2019s communicative intentions in acts of communication. Communication will be successful (i.e., understanding will occur) when the addressee recognizes those intentions. This process is mostly inferential and it has costs. So, the addressee would not start the inferential process without a presumption that it will report her some benefits, that is, without a presumption that the input is not only relevant, but as relevant as it can, ceteris paribus. Then, when someone utters something with a communicative purpose, she does it, according to relevance theory, with the presumption of optimal relevance, which states that\n\nThe utterance is relevant enough to be worth processing. It is the most relevant one compatible with the communicator\u2019s abilities and preferences.\n\nAlthough the principles of relevance account for near-side and far-side inferences, relevance theory acknowledges a fundamental distinction. On the near side, ambiguities, references, and issues of vagueness will be resolved so as to make the \u2018explicature\u2019 \u2014 the relevance theoretic replacement for \u2018what is said,\u2019 or \u2018the proposition expressed\u2019 \u2014 maximally relevant. A somewhat more complex sort of reasoning then derives implicatures. But these processes are not sequential. The \u2018choice\u2019 of explicature will be affected by the need to come to an understanding of everything that is communicated, explicature and implicature, as maximally relevant.\n\nThe addressee\u2019s understanding process starts then when she perceives an ostensive stimulus and stops when her expectations of relevance are satisfied, that is, when she has the most relevant hypothesis (the one with the most positive cognitive effects at the least processing costs) about the speaker\u2019s communicative intention. After decoding the sentence uttered and getting at the proposition expressed, the hearer will built a \u2018context\u2019 of \u2018implicated premises\u2019 or assumptions for getting the cognitive positive effects that make the utterance relevant. Remember that those effects can be the reinforcement or revision of those assumptions but also conclusions obtained deducing then from the proposition expressed plus the context of premises. This context building will also be highly constrained by relevance, looking for as many positive effects as possible with the fewer inferential steps as possible. In addition, the hearer has to look for the contents or assumptions the speaker ostensively intends her to consider.\n\nConsider the following exchange between A and B:\n\nHave you seen The Da Vinci Code? I don\u2019t like action movies.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that in B\u2019s response has the following implicatures, as implicated premise and conclusion, respectively:\n\nPremise: That The Da Vinci Code is an action movie.\n\nConclusion: That B has not seen it and, maybe, does not intend to see it.\n\nA retrieves the premise that together with the content of B\u2019s response allows her to deduce a conclusion that is reasonable to think B intends her to make, given that it seems the most relevant (the one with more cognitive positive effects \u2014 as implicatures in this case \u2014 with low processing costs).\n\nThis is how relevance theory re-interprets the Gricean notion of particularized conversational implicatures: they are treated as implicated premises and conclusions, communicated beyond what the speaker says. On the other hand, relevance theorists abandon the category of generalized conversational implicatures. The phenomena Grice took to be as generalized conversational implicatures belong on the near side according to relevance theorists. They are not part of what is implicated by the speaker in making her utterance, but part of the explicature.\n\nAccording to this view, pragmatics in general and the principle of relevance in particular have a lot to say about what happens on the near side of the explicature. It is probably fair to say that relevance theorists are mainly responsible for contemporary pragmatics focusing not only on what is conveyed beyond saying but also on saying itself, and for the fact that, as we shall see below, contemporary philosophical pragmatic theory tends to focus on the extent to which pragmatics \u2018intrudes\u2019 upon the traditional turf of semantics.\n\nTogether with Horn\u2019s (1984, 1989, 2004), Levinson\u2019s work (2000) is a good representative of grammar-oriented pragmatics. Levinson is only marginally a neo-Gricean. He is not committed to Grice\u2019s fundamental two-fold division between what is said, on the one hand, and implicatures, on the other \u2014 he proposes a third level of default or preferred interpretation. He does not provide a theory of utterance comprehension based primarily on recognition of communicative intentions, for default interpretations are not concerned with that. However, he does assume conversational principles and maxims, formulating a series of heuristics, inspired by Grice\u2019s maxims, for a theory of Generalized Conversational Implicatures (GCIs) that, as important as they were in Grice\u2019s program, have been neglected by many post-Gricean authors. Levinson\u2019s GCI theory is not a philosophical theory of human communication, nor a psychological theory of utterance understanding, but a partial theory of utterance-type meaning with its focus on linguistics. As he puts it:\n\nIn the composite theory of meaning, the theory of GCIs plays just a small role in a general theory of communication\u2026 It is just to linguistic theory that GCIs have an unparalleled import. (Levinson 2000, pp. 21\u201322.)\n\nThe two-layered view of utterance content consisting, according to Levinson, of a level of encoded meaning (sentence-meaning) and a level of inferential meaning (speaker\u2019s or utterance-(token)-meaning), must be supplemented by a third intermediate layer of utterance-type-meaning which is not based \u201con direct computations on speaker-intentions but rather on general expectations about how language is normally used\u201d (p. 22).\n\nThese expectations are formulated by Levinson as a series of heuristics, that have a clear connection with Grice\u2019s maxims of quantity and manner:\n\nFirst (Q) Heuristic: What isn\u2019t said, isn\u2019t (i.e., what you do not say is not the case)\n\nThis is related to Grice\u2019s first maxim of quantity (\u201cMake your contribution as informative as required\u201d) and is held responsible for the inference of so-called scalar implicatures, among others. So from an utterance of \u201cSome students came to the party\u201d it is inferable by default that not all the students came. It is not part of the meaning of \u2018some,\u2019 yet, in general \u2014 by default from the utterance-type \u2014 it is what one would infer in absence of evidence to the contrary. In this case, the heuristic has to be restricted to a set of alternates in a \u2018scale,\u2019 so that the use of one implicates the non-applicability of the other.\n\nSecond (I) Heuristic: What is expressed simply is stereotypically exemplified\n\nThis is related to Grice\u2019s second maxim of quantity (\u201cDo not make your contribution more informative than necessary\u201d), and is taken to be involved in cases of interpretation of conditionals as bi-conditionals, the enrichment of conjunctions with the expression of temporal and causal relations among the conjuncts, \u2018bridging\u2019 inferences, collective reading of plural noun phrases, and so on.\n\nThird (M) Heuristic: What is said in an abnormal way, isn\u2019t normal (i.e., marked message indicates marked situation)\n\nThis heuristic is related to Grice\u2019s maxim of manner and, specially, to the first submaxim (\u201cAvoid obscurity of expression\u201d) and the fourth (\u201cAvoid prolixity\u201d). If according to the second heuristic an unmarked utterance gives rise to a stereotypical interpretation, now we have that this interpretation is overruled if a marked utterance is produced. One of the clearest examples is double negation versus simple positive assertion. Compare \u201cIt\u2019s possible the plane will be late\u201d with \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that the plane will be late.\u201d\n\nWhen conflict among these three heuristics arise, Levinson argues that these are resolved in the following way: Q defeats M, and M defeats I.\n\nContemporary philosophical approaches to pragmatics are often classified by their view of the two models discussed in Section 3.1. \u2018Literalists\u2019 think that semantics is basically autonomous, with little \u2018pragmatic intrusion\u2019; \u2018contextualists\u2019 adopt the basic outlines of the Relevance Theory view of the importance of pragmatics at every level, while perhaps demurring on many of the details and the psychological orientation.\n\nTake, for example, an utterance of \u201cIt is raining\u201d by John now on the CSLI patio in a telephone conversation with Kepa, who is in Donostia. John is talking about the weather in Stanford. Arguably, what John says is that it is raining in Stanford. This is what he intends for Kepa to understand, and it is the content of the belief, formed by looking at the weather around him, that motivates his utterance. Stanford, then, seems to be a constituent, part of the subject matter, of John\u2019s remark. But how did it get there? It seems that it is a matter of pragmatics; it is a fact about John\u2019s intentions that makes his remark to be about Stanford, and that suffices. This is an example of what Perry (1986) calls an \u2018unarticulated constituent,\u2019 and an instance of a more general phenomenon we will call \u2018unarticulated content.\u2019\n\nThe same basic choice, about what to do with apparently unarticulated content that seems to be part of what is said, presents itself in connection with a number of other phenomena: \u2018enriched\u2019 uses of logical operators and numerals (\u201cMary got married and [then] had [exactly] three children\u201d), quantifier domain restriction (\u201cNobody [in the class] was paying attention\u201d), comparative adjectives (\u201cJohn is short [for a football player]\u201d), and a long list of phenomena reconsidered now as possibly being part of what is said, the explicature or the content of the utterance, rather than part of what is implicated.\n\nMost contemporary theorists would acknowledge that in such cases one might describe \u2018what is said\u2019 in terms of the unarticulated content: John said that it was raining at Stanford; the speaker said that Mary got married and then had children, and so forth. And there is general agreement that intuitions about \u2018what is said\u2019 cannot by themselves carry much theoretical weight, and there is considerable disagreement about theoretical interpretation of unarticulated content.\n\nLiteralists argue that the important divide, traditionally marked by \u2018what is said,\u2019 should be maintained, although marked by new terminology. Cappelen and Lepore\u2019s (2005) term is \u2018semantic content.\u2019 On the near side of semantic content will be only the factors acknowledged by Grice: conventional meaning of words and modes of composition; resolution of ambiguity (including, perhaps, issues of standards of precision and vagueness), and resolution of reference of indexicals, demonstratives and names. On the far side are Gricean implicatures.\n\nAmong literalists, we may distinguish between minimalists and \u2018hidden indexical\u2019 theorists. Literalists, do not accept any pragmatically determined element in utterance content that is not triggered by grammar, i.e., by a particular context-sensitive element in the sentence used. Minimalists try to keep context-sensitive expressions to a minimum and hidden-indexicalists pose a context-sensitive expression whenever is needed. The latter admit the \u2018unarticulated\u2019 content into the proposition literally expressed by the utterance, but hold that it is not \u2018really\u2019 unarticulated, since below the surface grammar, at some deeper level, say logical form, the sentence provide an indexical to be resolved pragmatically (Stanley 2000; Stanley and Szabo 2000).\n\nCappelen and Lepore are both literalists and minimalists. They use the term \u2018semantic content\u2019 for propositions determined solely by conventions of meaning, precisification, disambiguation and reference fixing. They allow that semantic content, so conceived, is often not what ordinary speakers would identify as \u2018what is said\u2019; but they take what is said to be a pragmatic concept, and so do not see this as an objection to their scheme. The semantic content of John\u2019s utterance above, for example, is something like the proposition \u201cRain is occurring,\u201d a relatively trivial proposition, that will be true if it is raining anywhere on earth (or perhaps, anywhere in the universe). (See Cappelen and Lepore (2007) and Perry (2007).) The triviality of John\u2019s remark, literally interpreted, sets Kepa on the search of some relevant proposition he may have meant to convey, and this proposition, that it is raining in Palo Alto, is what satisfies our intuitive concept of \u2018what is said.\u2019 But that shows only that \u2018what is said\u2019 is basically a pragmatic concept, that shouldn\u2019t be used to delineate true semantic content. We need to change the sign from \u2018what is said\u2019 to \u2018semantic content,\u2019 rather than move the boundary to fit the sign. On the near side of semantic content we find only conventional meaning, disambiguation, and resolution of reference and vagueness. On the far side we find implicatures, that contribute not only what is suggested, conveyed, and the like, but even what is said, as ordinarily conceived.\n\nThose over on the Contextualist side, in contrast, see the level corresponding to Grice\u2019s \u2018what is said\u2019 as determined not only by semantics, disambiguation and reference-fixing, but also by a number of other pragmatic processes that \u2018intrude\u2019 on the near side and enrich semantic content. Contextualists include relevance theorists and such philosophers as Recanati (2004), Travis (1997), Korta and Perry (2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011, 2013) and Neale (2004). Contemporary contextualists do not insist on the term \u2018what is said,\u2019 but provide other criteria for the boundary between the proposition more or less directly expressed and implicatures. Recanati argues that this level \u2014 which he sometimes calls \u2018what is said max \u2019 in contrast of the \u2018what is said min \u2019 of minimalists \u2014 should consist of a proposition that is consciously available to the speaker and the proposition he intends to express, and that any planned implications should also be consciously accessible. Cappelen and Lepore\u2019s proposition would not usually pass this test. In our example, John would not be consciously aware of having expressed a proposition that would be true if it was raining on Venus, nor would he at any remotely conscious level have planned for Kepa to reason from the triviality and irrelevance of the proposition that rain occurs to the one he meant to convey, that it rains at Stanford.\n\nIn Korta and Perry\u2019s \u2018Critical Pragmatics\u2019 (2008, 2011, 2013), the concept of \u2018what is said\u2019 is replaced with two concepts. The \u2018reflexive\u2019 or \u2018utterance-bound content\u2019 and the \u2018referential\u2019 or \u2018locutionary content\u2019 of an utterance. The \u2018utterance-bound content\u2019 is its truth-conditions, as determined by the conventional meanings of the words used and modes of composition, and thus corresponds to the \u2018semantically determined content.\u2019 This content will not be the proposition expressed, but rather a set of conditions on the utterance and the proposition it expresses, with quantification over all relevant factors not determined by meaning \u2014 including factors that resolve ambiguity and reference. At this level, then, Critical Pragmatics is radically minimal. For example, an utterance u of \u201cElwood touched that woman\u201d will be true (roughly) if and only if there is an x and y such that the speaker of u refers to x with \u2018Elwood,\u2019 refers to y with \u2018that woman,\u2019 and uses \u2018touches\u2019 with for some action A permitted by the conventions of English, and at some time prior to the time of u, x A\u2019ed y. The condition on the utterance given to the right of the \u2018if and only if\u2019 comprise the reflexive content of the utterance. On the other hand, the referential content of u will be the proposition that, say, Elwood put his hands on Eloise, if the actual facts about u provide Elwood, Eloise as the referents and putting one\u2019s hands on as the relevant sense of \u2018touches.\u2019 Critical Pragmatics emphasizes the speaker\u2019s plan, a hierarchy of intentions, as the main source of the facts that supplement conventional meaning to get us from reflexive to incremental meaning.\n\nThe second concept employed to do the traditional work of \u2018what is said\u2019 is \u2018locutionary content.\u2019 The intended locutionary content is basically the referential content the speaker intends to express, given her conception of the context \u2014 that is, roughly, the speaker, time, place and whom and what she points at. The locutionary content is fixed by the actual contextual facts, so a speaker\u2019s intended locutionary content may not be the locutionary content of the utterance she produces.\n\nAn intermediate position \u2014 called \u2018syncretic\u2019 by Recanati (2004) \u2014 has been subtly defended by Kent Bach (1994, 1999a, 2001). Bach is on the literalist, minimalist side of the spectrum with respect to semantic content (for which he continues to use the term \u2018what is said.\u2019) But he agrees with contextualists that unarticulated contents are not implicatures, and are not triggered by the meaning of the sentence uttered. He introduces an intermediate category between what is said, in his minimalist sense, and implicatures, which he calls \u2018implicitures\u2019 \u2014with \u2018ci\u2019 pronounced as in \u2018implicit\u2019 \u2014 to include these elements.\n\nRecently, the philosopher Michael Devitt (2013) raised an interesting issue about an alleged methodological flaw of many, if not most, approaches to pragmatics. The flaw consists in conflating the metaphysics of meaning \u2014 the study of what constitutes the meaning of an utterance \u2014 and the epistemology of meaning \u2014 the study of how the hearer interprets the meaning of an utterance. In his words:\n\nConsider the \u2018meaning-properties\u2019 of an utterance in as broad a sense as you like, cover all its \u2018semantic\u2019 and \u2018pragmatic\u2019 properties, in whatever preferred sense. So the properties we are concerned with include conventional properties, \u2018what is said\u2019, \u2018what is implicated\u2019, and so on. [footnote omitted] Now, what constitutes one of those properties is one thing, how the hearer discovers the property, another. The property is constituted by what the speaker does, by the conventions she participates in, the objects she has in mind, or messages she intentionally conveys. [footnote omitted] That is where we look for the \u2018metaphysics of meaning\u2019. And what needs emphasizing is that none of these meaning-properties is constituted in any way at all by what the hearer does in trying to interpret what is said or meant (Devitt, 2013: 288).\n\nDevitt attributes the confusion between the metaphysics and the epistemology of meaning to most contextualist proposals (or what he calls linguistic pragmatism), such as Bezuidenhout (2002), Capone (2012), Carston (2004), Crimmins and Perry (1989), Elugardo and Stainton (2004), Green (1989), Korta and Perry (2008), Levinson (2000), Parikh (2010), Recanati (2004), Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), Saul (2002), Stanley and Szabo (2000) and Taylor (2001). The exceptions, on the other hand, would be Bach (1999a, 2005), Neale (2004, 2016) and Fodor and Lepore (2004) (for a recent discussion, see the exchange between Korta and Perry (2019a, 2019b) and Devitt (2019) in the Journal of Pragmatics.)\n\nRelevance theory, for example, certainly takes pragmatics to be the study of the comprehension processes of the utterance on the part of the hearer (Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), Carston (2002), Wilson and Sperber (2012)). And, as Devitt claims, the study of those processes should not be confounded with the study of what constitutes the pragmatic properties of an utterance. In this case, however, the relevance-theoretic hearer-oriented perspective seems a matter of deliberate choice rather than a confusion.\n\nFollowing Neale (forthcoming), besides the distinction between the metaphysics and the epistemology of meaning, we should also consider formatics: the study of how the speaker forms the plan that eventually causes the production of her utterance. It is reasonable to be clear about these three approaches, because though different, they are closely interconnected. The speaker\u2019s beliefs about the hearer\u2019s capability of understanding in the circumstances of the utterance may affect, and typically do affect, her formation of communicative intentions, which, in turn, constrain what she says and implicates. Some approaches combine the three perspectives, and being explicit about their difference may be often welcome.\n\nContemporary pragmatics is a large, active, interdisciplinary field. The work we have considered here merges into important work in logic, computer science and other areas we have not been able to discuss. Philosophers, the founders of the discipline, continue to play an important role in this field. Philosophically oriented pragmatists (to give an old term a new meaning) usually consider pragmatic issues with an eye towards large issues in the philosophy of language and beyond. But in the course of this, they provide detailed analyses and consider a wide variety of cases that continue to provide ideas and inspiration for pragmatists from other disciplines. There is formal and computational pragmatics; theoretical and applied; clinical, experimental pragmatics and even neuropragmatics; there is also intercultural. Interlinguistic and intersociocultural pragmatics; historical pragmatics and history of pragmatics. And this list, as the whole entry, is not exhaustive.\n\nMany of the definitions reproduced below contrast pragmatics with semantics.\n\nMorris 1938. Semantics deals with the relation of signs to (\u2026) objects which they may or do denote. Pragmatics concerns the relation of signs to their interpreters.\n\nBy \u2018pragmatics\u2019 is designated the science of the relation of signs to their interpreters. (\u2026) Since most, if not all, signs have as their interpreters living organisms, it is a sufficiently accurate characterization of pragmatics to say that it deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, that is, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena which occur in the functioning of signs.\n\nCarnap 1942. If in an investigation explicit reference is made to the speaker, or, to put it in more general terms, to the user of a language, then we assign it to the field of pragmatics. (\u2026) If we abstract from the user of the language and analyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the field of semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata also and analyze only the relations between expressions, we are in (logical) syntax.\n\nBar-Hillel 1954. I believe, therefore, that the investigation of indexical languages and the erection of indexical language-systems are urgent tasks for contemporary logicians. May I add, for the sake of classificatory clarity, that the former task belongs to descriptive pragmatics and the latter to pure pragmatics (in one of the many senses of the expression)?\n\nStalnaker 1970. Syntax studies sentences, semantics studies propositions. Pragmatics is the study of linguistic acts and the contexts in which they are performed. There are two major types of problems to be solved within pragmatics: first, to define interesting types of speech acts and speech products; second, to characterize the features of the speech context which help determine which proposition is expressed by a given sentence. \u2026 It is a semantic problem to specify the rules for matching up sentences of a natural language with the propositions that they express. In most cases, however, the rules will not match sentences directly with propositions, but will match sentences with propositions relative to features of the context in which the sentence is used. Those contextual features are part of the subject matter of pragmatics.\n\nKatz 1977. [I] draw the theoretical line between semantic interpretation and pragmatic interpretation by taking the semantic component to properly represent only those aspects of the meaning of the sentence that an ideal speaker-hearer of the language would know in an anonymous letter situation,(\u2026) [where there is] no clue whatever about the motive, circumstances of transmission, or any other factor relevant to understanding the sentence on the basis of its context of utterance.\n\nGazdar 1979. PRAGMATICS = MEANING \u2014 TRUTH CONDITIONS. What we need in addition is some function that tells us about the meaning of utterances. (\u2026) The domain of this pragmatic function is the set of utterances, which are pairs of sentences and contexts, so that for each utterance, our function will return as a value a new context: the context as changed by the sentence uttered. (\u2026) And we can treat the meaning of the utterance as the difference between the original context and the context arrived at by utterance of the sentence. [This applies to only] a restricted subset of pragmatic aspects of meaning.\n\nKempson 1988. Semantics provides a complete account of sentence meaning for the language, [by] recursively specifying the truth conditions of the sentence of the language. \u2026 Pragmatics provides an account of how sentences are used in utterances to convey information in context.\n\nKaplan 1989. The fact that a word or phrase has a certain meaning clearly belongs to semantics. On the other hand, a claim about the basis for ascribing a certain meaning to a word or phrase does not belong to semantics\u2026 Perhaps, because it relates to how the language is used, it should be categorized as part of (\u2026) pragmatics (\u2026), or perhaps, because it is a fact about semantics, as part of (\u2026) Metasemantics.\n\nDavis 1991. Pragmatics will have as its domain speakers\u2019 communicative intentions, the uses of language that require such intentions, and the strategies that hearers employ to determine what these intentions and acts are, so that they can understand what the speaker intends to communicate.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Philosophy (Fotion 1995). Pragmatics is the study of language which focuses attention on the users and the context of language use rather than on reference, truth, or grammar.\n\nThe Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (Lycan 1995). Pragmatics studies the use of language in context, and the context-dependence of various aspects of linguistic interpretation. (\u2026) [Its branches include the theory of how] one and the same sentence can express different meanings or propositions from context to context, owing to ambiguity or indexicality or both, (\u2026) speech act theory, and the theory of conversational implicature.\n\nThe Blackwell Companion to Philosophy (Davies 1995). The distinction between semantics and pragmatics is, roughly, the distinction between the significance conventionally or literally attached to words, and thence to whole sentences, and the further significance that can be worked out, by more general principles, using contextual information.\n\nCarston 1999. The decoding process is performed by an autonomous linguistic system, the parser or language perception module. Having identified a particular acoustic stimulus as linguistic, the system executes a series of deterministic grammatical computations or mappings, resulting in an output representation, which is the semantic representation, or logical form, of the sentence or phrase employed in the utterance. (\u2026) The second type of cognitive process, the pragmatic inferential process (constrained and guided by the communicative principle of relevance) integrates the linguistic contribution with other readily accessible information in order to reach a confirmed interpretive hypothesis concerning the speaker\u2019s informative intention.\n\nBach 2004. Semantic information is information encoded in what is uttered \u2014 these are stable linguistic features of the sentence \u2014 together with any extralinguistic information that provides (semantic) values to context-sensitive expressions in what is uttered. Pragmatic information is (extralinguistic) information that arises from an actual act of utterance, and is relevant to the hearer\u2019s determination of what the speaker is communicating. Whereas semantic information is encoded in what is uttered, pragmatic information is generated by, or at least made relevant by, the act of uttering it.\n\nAmbiguity\n\nIn general, an expression is ambiguous if it has more than one meaning. When a word (e.g., \u2018bank\u2019) has multiple meanings, we have lexical ambiguity. A sentence can be ambiguous even if none of its words is ambiguous. Sometimes the ambiguity is considered syntactic because the alternative meanings correspond to alternative syntactic configurations (e.g., \u2018Mary saw John with a telescope\u2019). If there is only one syntactic configuration, the ambiguity is structural (e.g., \u2018Every man admires a woman\u2019). It is not always clear what kind ambiguity is at stake, or even if there is any ambiguity at all (Grice\u2019s theory of implicatures and his Ockham\u2019s modified razor had a great impact on this issue). In any case, ambiguity \u2014 the existence of several meanings for an expression \u2014 should be distinguished from nambiguity (the existence of many different bearers of a proper name), from vagueness (meanings with unclear boundaries of application), and underdetermination (failure to fully specify a meaning). It is usually assumed that resolving ambiguity is a pragmatic process, involving determining which meaning the speaker intends to be exploiting, although ambiguity itself is a semantic condition.\n\nAttitude report\n\n\u2018Propositional attitude\u2019 is Bertrand Russell\u2019s term for designating mental states with propositional content, conceived as relations between an agent and a proposition. Propositional attitude verbs include \u2018believes,\u2019 \u2018wants,\u2019 \u2018desires,\u2019 \u2018intends\u2019 or \u2018knows\u2019 and many others \u2014 basically, the core of our vocabulary for describing minds and language.\n\nSentences like \u2018Kepler thought that the Earth was spherical\u2019 embed other sentences \u2014 \u2018the earth was spherical\u2019 \u2014 in oblique (or opaque or intensional (with an \u2018s\u2019)) contexts. Oblique contexts are not truth-functional. Substituting other true sentences for \u2018the earth was spherical\u2019 will not necessarily preserve truth. Moreover, even substituting co-designative terms for \u2018the earth\u2019 may not preserve truth. Kepler did not, one supposes, think that Frege\u2019s favorite planet was spherical (assuming the earth was Frege\u2019s favorite planet).\n\nAccording to Frege, in such contexts the usual sense of the sentence, the \u2018Gedanke\u2019 or proposition expressed, becomes the reference. Since Frege\u2019s \u201c\u00dcber Sinn und Bedeutung\u201d (1892) and Russell\u2019s \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905) the study of reports of these attitudes has been one of the central topics of the philosophy of language, semantics and pragmatics.\n\nCharacter/Content\n\nSince Kaplan\u2019s work on indexicals and demonstratives, (Kaplan 1989) it is commonplace to distinguish between the character of an expression and the content of an utterance of an expression. For example, the character of the word \u2018I\u2019 in English doesn\u2019t change from context to context, although the content does. Knowing the character of a sentence like \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 doesn\u2019t imply knowing the content of a particular utterance of that sentence; for the latter, you need to know the \u2018semantic\u2019 context of the utterance. Character is a property of linguistic expressions (types); content is a property of utterances \u2014sentences-in-context; tokenings of them.\n\nContext\n\n\u2018Con"}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/speech-acts/", "page_content": "First published Tue Jul 3, 2007; substantive revision Thu Sep 24, 2020\n\nWe are attuned in everyday conversation not primarily to the sentences we utter to one another, but to the speech acts that those utterances are used to perform: requests, warnings, invitations, promises, apologies, predictions, and the like. Such acts are staples of communicative life, but only became a topic of sustained investigation, at least in the English-speaking world, in the middle of the twentieth century. [ 1 ] Since that time \u201cspeech act theory\u201d has become influential not only within philosophy, but also in linguistics, psychology, legal theory, artificial intelligence, literary theory, and feminist thought among other scholarly disciplines. [ 2 ] Recognition of the significance of speech acts has illuminated the ability of language to do other things than describe reality. In the process the boundaries among the philosophy of language, the philosophy of action, aesthetics, the philosophy of mind, political philosophy, and ethics have become less sharp. In addition, an appreciation of speech acts has helped lay bare a normative structure implicit in linguistic practice, including even that part of this practice concerned with describing reality. Much recent research aims at an accurate characterization of this normative structure underlying linguistic practice.\n\nBertrand Russell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions was a paradigm for many philosophers in the twentieth century. One reason for this is that it suggested a way to respond to longstanding philosophical problems by showing them to be specious. Russell argued that such sentences as \u2018The present King of Singapore is bald,\u2019 and, \u2018The round square is impossible,\u2019 possess superficial grammatical forms that are misleading as to their underlying logical structure. In so doing he showed how such sentences can be meaningful without this fact obliging us to posit current Singaporean monarchs or round squares. Many philosophers in what came to be known as the Ordinary Language movement were inspired by this achievement to argue that classic philosophical problems (e.g., of free will, the relation of mind to body, truth, the nature of knowledge, and of right and wrong) likewise rested on a misunderstanding of the language in which these problem are couched. In How to Do Things with Words, J.L. Austin for instance writes,\n\n\u2026in recent years, many things which would once have been accepted without question as \u2018statements\u2019 by both philosophers and grammarians have been scrutinized with new care\u2026 It has come to be commonly held that many utterances which look like statements are either not intended at all, or only intended in part, to record or impart straightforward information about the facts\u2026Along these lines it has by now been shown piecemeal, or at least made to look likely, that many traditional philosophical perplexities have arisen through a mistake-the mistake of taking as straightforward statements of fact utterances which are either (in interesting non-grammatical ways) nonsensical or else intended as something quite different. Whatever we may think of any particular one of these views and suggestions\u2026it cannot be doubted that they are producing a revolution in philosophy. (Austin 1962, pp. 1\u20132)\n\nThe Ordinary Language movement, with its broad claim that the meaning of an expression should be equated with its use, and its desire to transcend traditional philosophical perplexities, did not achieve the revolution of which Austin speaks. Nonetheless one of its enduring legacies is the notion of a speech act.\n\nOne way of appreciating the distinctive features of speech acts is in contrast with other well-established phenomena within the philosophy of language and linguistics. Accordingly in this entry we will consider the relations among speech acts and: semantic content, grammatical mood, speaker-meaning, logically perfect languages, perlocutions, performatives, presuppositions, and implicature. This will enable us to situate speech acts within their ecological niche.\n\nWhereas an act of speech is any act of uttering[3] meaningful words, \u2018speech act\u2019 is a term of art. As a first approximation, speech acts are those acts that can (though need not) be performed by saying that one is doing so. On this conception, resigning, promising, asserting and asking are all speech acts, while convincing, insulting and growing six inches are not. One can, for instance, resign by saying, \u201cI resign\u2026\u201d, although one can also resign from a position without describing oneself as doing so. However, this conception is too inclusive, since it also counts whispering as a speech act even though one can whisper a string of nonsense words without meaning anything. Instead a more accurate characterization of speech acts builds on Grice\u2019s notion of speaker meaning. This notion is discussed further in Section 5 below, but for now it is enough to note that in looking at my watch, I might be trying to tell the time; or I might be trying to indicate to you that it\u2019s time for us to leave. The latter (but not the former) is a case of speaker meaning.\n\nAccordingly, a speech act is a type of act that can be performed by speaker meaning that one is doing so. This conception still counts resigning, promising, asserting and asking as speech acts, while ruling out convincing, insulting and whispering. This definition leaves open the possibility of speech acts being performed wordlessly, as well as speech acts being performed without saying that you are doing so. Our characterization of speech acts captures this fact in emphasizing speaker meaning rather than the uttering of any words.\n\nSpeech acts are thus also to be distinguished from performatives. \u2018Performative\u2019 is another technical term, and as used here it refers in the first instance to a kind of sentence. A performative sentence is in the first person, present tense, indicative mood, active voice, that describes its speaker as performing a speech act. \u2018I assert that George is the culprit,\u2019 is a performative sentence by this test. As we have seen, one can perform a speech act without uttering a performative. Further, since it is merely a type of sentence, one can utter a performative without performing a speech act. For instance, while talking in my sleep I might say, \u201cI hereby promise to climb the Eiffel Tower,\u201d without thereby making any promise. We may also define a performative utterance as an utterance of a performative sentence that is also a speech act.[4]\n\nMore nomenclature: \u2018Speech act\u2019 and \u2018illocution\u2019 will here be used synonymously. The latter term is due to Austin, who used \u2018illocutionary force\u2019 to refer to a dimension of communicative acts. (It is nowadays common also to use \u2018illocute\u2019 as a verb meaning \u2018to perform a speech act.\u2019) Austin\u2019s reason for using \u2018force\u2019 begins with the observation that, construed as a bit of observable behavior, the communicative significance of an act may be underdetermined by what has been said or observably done. I bow deeply before you. So far you may not know whether I am paying obeisance, responding to indigestion, or looking for a wayward contact lens. So too, an utterance of a meaningful sentence (which Austin calls a locutionary act) such as \u2018You\u2019ll be more punctual in the future,\u2019 may leave you wondering whether I am making a prediction or issuing a command or even a threat. The colloquial question, \u201cWhat is the force of those words?\u201d is often used to elicit an answer. In asking such a question we acknowledge a grasp of those words\u2019 meaning but seek to know how that meaning is to be taken\u2013as a threat, as a prediction, or as a command.\n\nOr so it seems. In an early challenge to Austin, Cohen (1964) argues that the notion of illocutionary force is otiose provided we already have in place the notion of a sentence\u2019s meaning (Austin\u2019s locutionary meaning). Cohen contends that for a performative sentence such as \u2018I promise to read that novel,\u2019 its meaning already guarantees that it is a promise. On the other hand, for a sentence that is not a performative, such as \u2018I will read that novel,\u2019 if it is understood as being used to make a promise, the promise is still implicit in the sentence\u2019s meaning. In either case, Cohen concludes, meaning already guarantees force and so we do not require an extra-semantic notion to do so.\n\nCohen\u2019s reasoning assumes that any utterance of \u2018I promise to read that novel\u2019 is a promise. But as we have seen with the case of the somniloquist, neither a sentence, nor even the utterance of a sentence, is sufficient on its own for the performance of a speech act, be it a promise or some other. In a similar spirit to that of Cohen, Searle (1968, p. 407) observes that a serious and literal utterance of \u2018I promise to read that novel,\u2019 made under what he terms \u201cconditions of successful utterance\u201d, also counts as a promise. Searle concludes from this that some locutionary acts are also illocutionary acts, and infers from this in turn that for some sentences, their locutionary meaning determines their illocutionary force. This last inference is, however, a non sequitur. As we have seen, the aforementioned sentence\u2019s meaning does not determine the illocutionary force with which it is uttered. Rather, when that sentence is uttered in such a way as to constitute a promise, what determines that force is the meaning of the sentence together with such factors as the speaker\u2019s being serious and other contextual conditions being met.\n\nWe may thus agree with Searle that some locutionary acts are also illocutionary acts, without losing sight of our earlier observation that locutionary meaning underdetermines illocutionary force. This fact about underdetermination is implied by Davidson\u2019s Thesis of the Autonomy of Linguistic Meaning, according to which once a bit of language has acquired a conventional meaning, it can be used for any of a variety of extra-linguistic purposes (Davidson, 1979). Green 1997 argues for a qualification of Davidson\u2019s Autonomy Thesis to recognize sentences having the feature that if they are used in a speech act all, then there is at least one other illocutionary force that their utterance must have. Even in light of this qualified version of the Autonomy Thesis, the most that can be said of, \u2018I promise to climb the Eiffel Tower,\u2019 is that it is designed to be used to make promises, just as common nouns are designed to be used to refer to things and predicates are designed to characterize things referred to. Below (Section 6.3) we shall consider the view that force is a component of meaning, albeit not of a sentence\u2019s meaning.[5]\n\nLet us return, then, to an elucidation of our distinction between what a speaker says and the force of her utterance. A grammatical sentence composed of meaningful words is commonly thought to express a \u201ccontent,\u201d which is determined by what that sentence literally means together with features of the context of utterance. Suppose I say to someone in a crowded subway, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d I am most likely trying to convey the message that he should move. However, what I literally say is only that the addressee in question is standing on my foot. This is the content of my utterance. Many if not most utterances of grammatical sentences composed of meaningful words express more than those sentences\u2019 contents. Pragmaticians, however, commonly distinguish content from other aspects of meaning conveyed by an utterance. On this way of thinking, two intertranslatable sentences of different languages will express the same content, and certain transformations of a sentence within a language are commonly thought to express the same content. Thus, \u2018Mary saw John,\u2019 and \u2018John was seen by Mary,\u2019 will express the same content even if a speaker\u2019s use of one rather than another of these will carry a distinctive suggestion. For indicative sentences, such contents are typically called Propositions. (In what follows I will capitalize this term to signify that it is in part technical.) Propositions, then, are the contents of indicative sentences, are what such sentences express, and, further, are often thought to be the primary bearers of truth value.\n\nIllocutionary force and semantic content are often taken to be distinct from one another, not just in the way that your left and right hand are distinct, but rather by virtue of falling into different categories. Stenius 1967 elucidates this distinction, noting that in chemical parlance a radical is a group of atoms normally incapable of independent existence, whereas a functional group is the grouping of those atoms in a compound that is responsible for certain of that compound\u2019s properties. Analogously, a Proposition is itself communicatively inert. For instance, merely expressing the Proposition that it is snowing is not to make a move in a \u201clanguage game\u201d. Rather, such a move is only made by putting forth a Proposition with an illocutionary force such as assertion, conjecture, command, etc. The chemical analogy gains further support from the fact that just as a chemist might isolate radicals held in common among various compounds, the student of language may isolate a common element held among \u2018Is the door shut?\u2019, \u2018Shut the door!\u2019, and \u2018The door is shut\u2019. This common element is the Proposition that the door is shut, queried in the first sentence, commanded to be made true in the second, and asserted in the third. According to the chemical analogy, then:\n\nIllocutionary force : Propositional content :: functional group : radical\n\nIn light of this analogy we may see, following Stenius, that just as the grouping of a set of atoms is not itself another atom or set of atoms, so too the forwarding of a Proposition with a particular illocutionary force is not itself a further component of Propositional content.\n\nEncouraged by the chemical analogy, a central tenet in the study of speech acts is that content may remain fixed while force varies. The force of an utterance also underdetermines its content: Just from the fact that a speaker has made a promise, we cannot deduce what she has promised to do. For these reasons, students of speech acts contend that a given communicative act may be analyzed into two components: force and content. While semantics studies the contents of communicative acts, pragmatics studies their force.\n\nThe force/content distinction also finds parallels in our understanding of mentality. Speech acts are not only moves in a \u201clanguage game.\u201d They also often purport to express of states of mind with analogous structural properties. An assertion that it is snowing purports to express the speaker\u2019s belief that it is snowing. A promise to read Middlemarch purports to express the speaker\u2019s intention to read Middlemarch. We find evidence for these relationships in the fact that it is in some sense absurd to say, \u2018It\u2019s snowing, but I don\u2019t believe that it is,\u2019 and \u2018I promise to read Middlemarch, but I have no intention of doing so.\u2019[6] Further, just as we may distinguish between an asserting and what is asserted (the so-called \u201cing/ed ambiguity\u201d for verbs such as \u2018assert\u2019), and a promising from what is promised, we may also distinguish between a state of believing and what is believed, and a state or act of intending and what is intended. Searle 1983 delineates structural analogies between speech acts and the mental states they express. Pendlebury 1986 succinctly explains the merits of this approach.\n\nIn spite of these structural analogies, we may still wonder why an elucidation of the notion of force is important for a theory of communication. That A is an important component of communication, and that A underdetermines B, do not justify the conclusion that B is an important component of communication. Content also underdetermines the decibel level at which we speak but this fact does not justify adding decibel level to our repertoire of core concepts for pragmatics or the philosophy of language. Why should force be thought any more worthy of admission to this set of core concepts than decibel level? One reason for an asymmetry in our treatment of force and decibel level is that the former, but not the latter, seems to be a component of speaker meaning: Force is a feature not of what is said but of how what is said is meant; decibel level, by contrast, is a feature at most of the way in which something is said. This point is developed in Section 5 below.\n\nWe have spoken thus far as if the contents of speech acts must be Propositions, and indeed Searle routinely analyzes speech acts as having the form F(p) (e.g., 1975, p. 344), where \u2018F\u2019 is the force component and \u2018p\u2019 the Propositional content component. However, in the last two decades linguistic semantics has developed formal representations of contents for the two other major grammatical moods besides the indicative, namely the interrogative and the imperative. On the strength of the analyses of Hamblin (1958), Bell (1975), Pendlebury (1986) and others, one strategy for the semantics of interrogatives is to construe them as expressing sets of propositions rather than a single proposition, where each element of the putative set is a complete answer to the question at issue. Thus the content expressed by \u2018How many doors are shut?\u2019 will be {<No doors are shut>, <One door is shut>, \u2026} where the ellipsis will be filled by as many other Propositions as it is reasonable to interpret the questioner as asking after. Call such a set an Interrogative. A complete answer to an Interrogative is an element of the set by which it is defined; a partial answer is a subset of that set containing two or more members, as would naturally be expressed by the sentence \u2018Between two and four doors are shut.\u2019 On the present conceptualization, just as we may distinguish between expressing and asserting a Propositional content, we may also distinguish between expressing an Interrogative and asking a question. One merely expresses an Interrogative in such an utterance as, \u2018John wonders how many doors are shut.\u2019 In fact, a single utterance may express two Interrogatives while asking neither, as in \u2018How many doors are shut will depend on how many customers are trying on clothes.\u2019 Asking a question is no less substantial a conversational move than is making an assertion.\n\nSimilarly, work by Hamblin (1987), Belnap (1990), Portner (2004) and others suggests semantic analyses for sentences in the imperative mood: on one approach an imperative expresses a property, and when one speaker issues an imperative that her addressee accepts, that property is added to her \u201cto do list\u201d, itself a parameter of what we will later describe as conversational score (Section 7).\n\nIn light of the above liberalization of the notion of sentential content to accommodate the contents of non-indicative sentences, we may rephrase Stenius\u2019s chemical analogy as follows:\n\nIllocutionary force : sentential content :: functional group : radical\n\nwith the understanding that different types of sentential content will correspond to the different grammatical moods. This refined analogy would in turn require there to be different types of radical.[7]\n\nIn some cases we can make something the case by saying that it is. Alas, I cannot lose ten pounds by saying that I am doing so, nor can I persuade you of a claim by saying that I am doing so. On the other hand I can promise to meet you tomorrow by uttering the words, \u201cI promise to meet you tomorrow,\u201d and if I have the authority to do so, I can even appoint you to an office by saying, \u201cI hereby appoint you.\u201d (I can also appoint you without making the force of my act explicit: I might just say, \u201cYou are now Treasurer of the Corporation.\u201d) Only an appropriate authority, speaking at the appropriate time and place, can: christen a ship, pronounce a couple married, appoint someone to an administrative post, declare the proceedings open, or rescind an offer. Austin, in How To Do Things With Words, details the conditions that must be met for a given speech act to be performed felicitously.\n\nFailures of felicity fall into two classes: misfires and abuses. The former are cases in which the putative speech act fails to be performed at all. If I utter, before the QEII, \u201cI declare this ship the Noam Chomsky,\u201d I have not succeeded in naming anything because I lack the authority to do so. My act thus misfires in that I\u2019ve performed an act of speech but no speech act. Other attempts at speech acts might misfire because their addressee fails to respond with an appropriate uptake: I cannot bet you $100 on who will win the election unless you accept that bet. If you do not accept that bet, then I have tried to bet but have not succeeded in betting. As we will see in Section 9, a systematic unwillingness on the part of a speaker\u2019s interlocutors to respond with the requisite uptake may compromise that speaker\u2019s freedom of speech.\n\nSome speech acts can be performed\u2013that is, not misfire\u2014while still being less than felicitous. I promise to meet you for lunch tomorrow, but haven\u2019t the least intention of making good. Here I have promised all right, but the act is not felicitous because it is not sincere. My act is, more precisely, an abuse because although it is a speech act, it fails to live up to a standard appropriate for speech acts of its kind. Sincerity is a paradigm condition for the felicity of speech acts. Austin foresaw a program of research in which thousands of types of speech act would be studied in detail, with felicity conditions elucidated for each.[8]\n\nAs observed by Sbis\u00e0 2007, not only can I perform a speech act by speaker meaning that I am doing so, I can also subsequently rescind that act. I cannot, it would seem, change the past, and so nothing I can do on Wednesday can change the fact that I made a promise or assertion on Monday. However, on Wednesday I may be able to retract a claim I made on Monday. I can\u2019t take back a punch or a burp; the most I can do is apologize for one of these infractions, and perhaps make amends. By contrast, not only can I apologize or make amends for a claim I now regret; I can also withdraw it. Likewise, you may allow me on Wednesday to retract the promise I made to you on Monday. In both these cases of assertion and promise, I am now no longer beholden to the commitments that the speech acts engender in spite of the fact that the past is fixed. Just as one can, under appropriate conditions, perform a speech act by speaker meaning that one is doing so, so too one can, under the right conditions, retract that very speech act.\n\nAustin famously denied that performatives are statements (1962, p. 6). This may be taken either as the denial that performative sentences, even those in the indicative grammatical mood, have truth value; or instead as the denial that utterances of performative sentences, even when such sentences have truth value, are assertions. One can consistently hold that an indicative sentence has truth value, and even that it may be uttered in such a way as to say something true, while denying that its utterance is an assertion. (Testing a microphone in a windowless room, I utter, \u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d and it happens to be raining outside. Here I have said something true but have made no assertion.)\n\nLemmon 1962 argues that performative utterances are true on the ground that they are instances of a wider class of sentences whose utterance guarantees their truth. If sound, this argument would show that performatives have truth value, but not that they are assertions. It also leaves unanswered the question why some verb phrases such as \u2018I promise\u2019 may be used performatively while others cannot be so used. Sinnott-Armstrong 1994 also argues that performatives can have truth value without addressing the question whether they are also used to make assertions. Reimer 1995 argues that while performatives have truth values, they are not also assertions. Adopting a similar strategy, Jary 2007 aims to explain how utterances of such sentences as \u201cI order you to clean the kitchen,\u201d can succeed in being orders. In so doing he draws on Green\u2019s 2007 analysis of showing to argue that such utterances show (rather than merely describe) the force of the speaker\u2019s utterance. Because \u2018show\u2019 is factive, if such an utterance shows its force, then it must have that force.\n\nMost challenges to Austin, however, construe performatives as assertions and attempt to explain their properties in that light. Ginet 1979 argues that performative verbs (\u2018promise,\u2019 \u2018appoint\u2019, etc.) name the kinds of acts that one can perform by asserting that one is doing so, and elaborates on why this is so. In this way he offers an account of how performatives work that depends on the assumption that performative utterances are assertions. Starting from that same assumption, Bach 1975 contends that \u2018I order you to clean the kitchen\u2019 is an assertion, and proceeds to explain on this basis how the speaker is indirectly also issuing an order. This explanation depends on the speaker\u2019s being able to count on the addressee\u2019s ability to discern the speaker\u2019s communicative intention. In later work, such as Bach and Harnish 1978, and 1992, this view is refined with a notion of standardization, so that a sufficiently common practice of issuing assertions with performative effect enables speakers and hearers to bypass complex inferential reasoning and jump by default to a conclusion about the illocution being performed. Reimer 1995 challenges Bach and Harnish on the ground that hearers do not seem to impute assertoric force to the indicative sentences speakers utter with performative effect; her criticism would evidently carry over to Ginet\u2019s proposal. Instead Reimer contends that performative utterances rest on systems of what she terms illocutionary conventions to achieve their performative effects.\n\nSearle 1969, p. 62\u20134, had argued that a performative formula such as \u201cI promise to\u2026\u201d is an \u201cillocutionary force indicator\u201d in the sense that it is a device whose role is to make explicit the force of the speaker\u2019s utterance. Making something explicit, however, would seem to involve characterizing an independent event or state of affairs, and as a result Searle\u2019s account presupposes that speakers can imbue their utterances with the force of demotions and excommunications; yet this is what was to be explained. Realizing this, Searle and Vanderveken (1985) characterize performatives as speech acts having the force of declarations. Uncontroversial examples of this speech act are declaring war or adjourning a meeting. Searle 1989 then acknowledges that this account pushes us back to the question how certain expressions come to have the power to make declarations. In that same work he offers an answer that depends on the view that in uttering a sentence with a performative prefix, a speaker manifests an intention to perform an act of a certain kind: in uttering the words, \u2018I order you to close the door\u2019, I manifest an intention to order you to close the door, etc. Searle also takes it that manifesting an intention to perform a speech act is sufficient for the performance of that act. On this basis, Searle goes on to attempt to derive the assertoric nature of performatives, holding that when uttered in such a way as to say something true, they are also assertions.\n\nAustin distinguishes illocutionary acts into five categories: verdictives (in which a speaker gives a verdict, e.g. acquitting and diagnosing), exercitives (in which speakers exercise powers, rights or influence, e.g. excommunicating and resigning), commissives (in which speakers commit themselves to causes or courses of action, e.g. promising and betting), behabitives (concerning attitudes and social behavior, e.g. apologizing and toasting), and expositives (in which speakers clarify how their utterances fit into lines of reasoning, e.g., postulating and defining).\n\nSearle (1975) criticizes Austin\u2019s taxonomy on two central grounds. First, Austin\u2019s methodology is unduly lexicographic, assuming that we can learn about the range and limits of illocutionary acts by studying illocutionary verbs in English or other natural languages. However, Searle observes, nothing rules out the possibility of there being illocutionary acts that are not named by a verb either in a particular language such as Swahili or Bengali, or indeed in any language at all; similarly, two non-synonymous illocutionary verbs may yet name one and the same illocutionary act.\n\nSecond, Searle argues that the principles of distinction among Austin\u2019s categories are unclear. For instance, behavitives seem to be a heterogeneous group with little unifying principle. Similarly, \u2018describe\u2019 appears both as a verdictive and as an expositive whereas one would expect taxonomic categories to be mutually exclusive. More generally, Austin\u2019s brief account of each category gives no direction as to why this way of delineating them does so along their most fundamental features. Searle offers a new categorization of speech acts based on relatively clear principles of distinction. To appreciate this it will help to explain some of the basic concepts he uses for this purpose.\n\nConsider an example derived from Anscombe (1963): a woman sends her husband to the grocery store with a list of things to procure; unbeknownst to him he is also being trailed by a detective concerned to make a list of what the man buys. By the time the husband and detective are in the checkout line, their two lists contain exactly the same items. The contents of the two lists differ, however, along another dimension. For the contents of the husband\u2019s list guide what he puts in his shopping cart. Insofar, his list exhibits world-to-word direction of fit: It is, so to speak, the job of the items in his cart to conform to what is on his list. By contrast, it is the job of the detective\u2019s list to conform with the world, in particular to what is in the husband\u2019s cart. As such, the detective\u2019s list has word-to-world direction of fit: The onus is on those words to conform to how things are. Speech acts such as assertions and predictions have word-to-world direction of fit, while speech acts such as commands have world-to-word direction of fit.\n\nNot all speech acts appear to have direction of fit. I can thank you by saying \u201cThank you,\u201d and it is widely agreed that thanking is a speech act. However, thanking seems to have neither of the directions of fit we have discussed thus far. Similarly, asking who is at the door is a speech act, but it does not seem to have either of the directions of fit we have thus far mentioned. Some would respond by construing questions as a form of imperative (e.g., \u201cTell me who is at the door!\u201d), and then ascribing the direction of fit characteristic of imperatives to questions. This leaves untouched, however, banal cases such as thanking or even, \u201cHooray for Arsenal!\u201d Some authors, such as Searle and Vanderveken 1985, describe such cases as having \u201cnull\u201d direction of fit. That characterization is evidently distinct from saying such speech acts have no direction of fit at all.[9]\n\nDirection of fit is also not so fine-grained as to enable us to distinguish speech acts meriting different treatment. Consider asserting that the center of the Milky Way is inhabited by a black hole, as opposed to conjecturing that the center of the Milky Way is so inhabited. These two acts are subject to different norms: The former purports to be a manifestation of knowledge, while the latter does not. This is suggested by the fact that it is appropriate to reply to the assertion with, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d (Williamson 1996), while that is not an appropriate response to the conjecture (Green 2017). Nevertheless, both the assertion and conjecture have word-to-world direction of fit. Might there be other notions enabling us to mark differences between speech acts with the same direction of fit?\n\nOne suggestion might come from the related notion of conditions of satisfaction. This notion generalizes that of truth. As we saw in 2.3, it is internal to the activity of assertion that it aims to capture how things are. When an assertion does so, not only is it true, it has hit its target; the aim of the assertion has been met. A similar point may be made of imperatives: it is internal to the activity of issuing an imperative that the world is enjoined to conform to it. The imperative is satisfied just in case it is fulfilled. Assertions and imperatives both have conditions of satisfaction\u2014truth in the first place, and conformity in the second. In addition, it might be held that questions have answerhood as their conditions of satisfaction: A question hits its target just in case it finds an answer, often in a speech act, such as an assertion, that answers the question posed. Like the notion of direction of fit, however, the notion of conditions of satisfaction is too coarse-grained to enable us to make some valuable distinctions among speech acts. Just to use our earlier case again: an assertion and a conjecture that P have identical conditions of satisfaction, namely that P be the case. May we discern features distinguishing these two speech acts, in a way enabling us to make finer-grained distinctions among other speech acts as well? I shall return to this question in Sections 6\u20137.\n\nIn an attempt to systematize and deepen Austin\u2019s approach, Searle and Vanderveken 1985 distinguish between those illocutionary forces employed by speakers within a given linguistic community, and the set of all possible illocutionary forces. While a certain linguistic community may make no use of forces such as conjecturing or appointing, these two are among the set of all possible forces. (These authors appear to assume that while the set of possible forces may be infinite, it has a definite cardinality.) Searle and Vanderveken go on to define illocutionary force in terms of seven features, namely:\n\nIllocutionary point: This is the characteristic aim of each type of speech act. For instance, the characteristic aim of an assertion is to describe how things are, and perhaps also to bring about belief in an addressee; the characteristic aim of a promise is to commit oneself to a future course of action. Degree of strength of the illocutionary point: Two illocutions can have the same point but differ along the dimension of strength. For instance, requesting and insisting that the addressee do something both have the point of attempting to get the addressee to do that thing; however, the latter is stronger than the former. Mode of achievement: This is the special way, if any, in which the illocutionary point of a speech act must be achieved. Testifying and asserting both have the point of describing how things are; however, the former also involves invoking one\u2019s authority as a witness while the latter does not. To testify is to assert in one\u2019s capacity as a witness. Commanding and requesting both aim to get the addressee to do something; yet only someone issuing a command does so in her capacity as a person in a position of authority. Content conditions: Some illocutions can only be achieved with an appropriate propositional content. For instance, I can only promise what is in the future and under my control; or, at least, I cannot promise to do anything that it is obvious to myself and my promissee that I cannot do. So too, I can only apologize for what is in some sense under my control and already the case. (In light of our discussion above of semantics for non-indicative contents, this condition could be recast in terms of imperatival, interrogative, and propositional content conditions.) Preparatory conditions: These are all other conditions that must be met for the speech act not to misfire. Such conditions often concern the social status of interlocutors. For instance, a person cannot bequeath an object unless she already owns it or has power of attorney; a person cannot marry a couple unless she is legally invested with the authority to do so. Sincerity conditions: Many speech acts involve the expression of a psychological state. Assertion expresses belief; apology expresses regret, a promise expresses an intention, and so on. A speech act is sincere only if the speaker is in the psychological state that her speech act expresses. Degree of strength of the sincerity conditions: Two speech acts might be the same along other dimensions, but express psychological states that differ from one another in the dimension of strength. Requesting and imploring both express desires, and are identical along the other six dimensions above; however, the latter expresses a stronger desire than the former.\n\nSearle and Vanderveken (1985) suggest, in light of these seven characteristics, that each illocutionary force may be defined as a septuple of values, each of which is a \u201csetting\u201d of a value within one of the seven characteristics. It follows, according to this suggestion, that two illocutionary forces F 1 and F 2 are identical just in case they correspond to the same septuple.\n\nI cannot slow the expansion of the universe or convince you of the truth of a claim by saying that I am doing so. However, these two cases differ in that the latter, but not the former, is a characteristic aim of a speech act. One characteristic aim of assertion is the production of belief in an addressee, whereas there is no speech act one of whose characteristic aims is the slowing of the universe\u2019s expansion. A type of speech act can have a characteristic aim without each speech act of that type being issued with that aim: Speakers sometimes make assertions without aiming to produce belief in anyone, even themselves. Instead, the view that a speech act-type has a characteristic aim is akin to the view that a biological trait has a function. The characteristic role of wings is to aid in flight even though some flightless creatures are winged.\n\nAustin called these characteristic aims of speech acts perlocutions (1962, p. 101). I can both urge and persuade you to shut the door, yet the former is an illocution while the latter is a perlocution. How can we tell the difference? We can do so by noting that under the right conditions, one can urge just by saying and speaker meaning, \u201cI hereby urge you to shut the door,\u201d while there are no circumstances in which I can persuade you just by saying, \u201cI hereby persuade you to shut the door.\u201d A characteristic aim of urging is, nevertheless, the production of a resolution to act (1962, p. 107). Cohen (1973) develops the idea of perlocutions as characteristic aims of speech acts.\n\nPerlocutions are characteristic aims of one or more illocution, but are not themselves illocutions. Nevertheless, one speech act can be performed by means of the performance of another. For instance, my remark that you are standing on my foot is normally taken as, in addition, a demand that you move; my question whether you can pass the salt is normally taken as a request that you do so. These are examples of so-called indirect speech acts (Searle 1979). Phrases that are commonly used in service of indirect speech acts are, \u2018Would you mind terribly if I\u2026,\u2019 \u2018Might I suggest\u2026,\u2019 and \u2018It seems to me that\u2026\u2019, or simply \u2018please\u2019, as in \u2018Can you pass the salt, please?\u2019 Observe that this last sentence, with its appended tag-question, cannot be interpreted as a request for information (about the addressee\u2019s salt-passing abilities), but can only be understood as a request. Asher and Lascarides (2001) provide a formal model of indirect speech acts on which some are conventionalized while others require Gricean reasoning for their interpretation.\n\nWhile indirect communication is ubiquitous, indirect speech acts are less common than might first appear. In asking whether you intend to quit smoking, I might be taken as well to be suggesting that you quit. However, while the embattled smoker might jump to this interpretation, we do well to consider what evidence would mandate it. After all, while I probably would not have asked whether you intended to quit smoking unless I hoped you would quit, I can evince such a hope without performing the speech act of suggesting. Evincing a psychological state, even if done intentionally, arguably does not constitute a speech act. Instead, intentionally evincing a psychological state may be understood as simply expressing that state (See Green 2020, ch. 2).\n\nWhether, in addition to a given speech act, I am also performing an indirect speech act would seem to depend on my intentions. My question whether you can pass the salt is also a request that you do so only if I intend to be so understood. What is more, this intention must be feasibly discernible on the part of one\u2019s audience. Even if, in remarking on the fine weather, I intend as well to request that you pass the salt, I will not have issued a request unless I have made that intention manifest in some way.\n\nHow might I do this? One way is by making an inference to the best explanation. Perhaps the best explanation of my asking whether you can pass the salt is that I mean to be requesting that you do so, and perhaps the best explanation of my remarking that you are standing on my foot, particularly if I use a stentorian tone of voice, is that I mean to be demanding that you desist. By contrast, it is doubtful that the best explanation of my asking whether you intend to quit smoking is that I intend to suggest that you do so. Another explanation at least as plausible is my hope, or expression of hope, that you do so. Bertolet 1994 develops a more skeptical position than that suggested here, arguing that any alleged case of an indirect speech act can be construed just as an indication, by means of contextual clues, of the speaker\u2019s intentional state\u2014hope, desire, etc., as the case may be. Postulation of a further speech act beyond what has been (relatively) explicitly performed is, he contends, explanatorily unmotivated. McGowan et al. (2009) reply by offering three conditions they take to be sufficient for a case of what they term linguistic communication. They would also argue that in, for instance, the smoking case, the speaker meets those three conditions, and thus counts as suggesting that the addressee quit smoking. Bertolet (2017) replies that these three conditions are not sufficient for an instance of speaker meaning, and given that (as we have seen) speaker meaning is a necessary condition for (non-conventional) speech acts, concludes that McGowan et al. have not established that the cases that concern them are indirect speech acts.\n\nThese considerations suggest that indirect speech acts, if they do occur at all, can be explained within the framework of conversational implicature\u2013that process by which we mean more (and on some occasions less) than we say, but in a way not due exclusively to the conventional meanings of our words. Conversational implicature, too, depends both upon communicative intentions and the availability of inference to the best explanation (Grice, 1989). In fact, Searle\u2019s 1979 influential account of indirect speech acts is couched in terms of conversational implicature (although he does not use this phrase). The study of speech acts is in this respect intertwined with the study of conversations; we return to this theme in Section 6.[10]\n\nNot only does content underdetermine force; content together with grammatical mood does so as well. \u2018You\u2019ll be more punctual in the future\u2019 is in the indicative grammatical mood, but as we have seen, that fact does not determine its force. The same may be said of other grammatical moods. Although I overhear you utter the words, \u2018shut the door\u2019, I cannot infer yet that you are issuing a command. Perhaps instead you are simply describing your own intention, in the course of saying, \u201cI intend to shut the door.\u201d If so, you\u2019ve used the imperative mood without issuing a command. So too with the interrogative mood: I overhear your words, \u2018who is on the phone.\u2019 Thus far I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve asked a question, since you may have so spoken in the course of stating, \u201cJohn wonders who is on the phone.\u201d Might either or both of initial capitalization or final punctuation settle the issue? Apparently not: What puzzles Meredith is the following question: Who is on the phone?\n\nMood together with content underdetermine force. On the other hand it is a plausible hypothesis that grammatical mood is one of the devices we use (together with contextual clues, intonation, and the like) to indicate the force with which we are expressing a content. Understood in this weak way, it is unexceptionable to construe the interrogative mood as used for asking questions, the imperatival mood as used for issuing commands, and so on. So understood, we might go on to ask how speakers indicate the force of their speech acts given that grammatical mood and content cannot be relied on alone to do so.\n\nOne well known answer we may term force conventionalism. According to a strong version of this view, for every speech act that is performed, there is some convention that will have been invoked in order to make that speech act occur. This convention transcends those imbuing words with their literal meaning. Thus, force conventionalism implies that in order for use of \u2018I promise to meet you tomorrow at noon,\u2019 to constitute a promise, not only must the words used possess their standard conventional meanings, there must also exist a convention to the effect that the use, under the right conditions, of some such words as these constitutes a promise. Austin seems to have held this view. For instance in his characterization of \u201cfelicity conditions\u201d for speech acts, Austin holds that for each speech act\n\nThere must exist an accepted conventional procedure having a certain conventional effect, that procedure to include the uttering of certain words by certain persons in certain circumstances\u2026 (1962, p. 14).\n\nAustin\u2019s student Searle follows him in this, writing\n\n\u2026utterance acts stand to propositional and illocutionary acts in the way in which, e.g., making an X on a ballot paper stands to voting. (1969, p. 24)\n\nSearle goes on to clarify this commitment in averring,\n\n\u2026the semantic structure of a language may be regarded as a conventional realization of a series of sets of underlying constitutive rules, and \u2026speech acts are acts characteristically performed by uttering sentences in accordance with these sets of constitutive rules. (1969, p. 37)\n\nSearle espouses a weaker form of force conventionalism than does Austin in leaving open the possibility that some speech acts can be performed without constitutive rules; Searle considers the case of a dog requesting to be let outside (1969, p. 39). Nevertheless Searle does contend that speech acts are characteristically performed by invoking constitutive rules.\n\nMillikan (1998) espouses a parsimonious conception of conventions that she terms \u2018natural conventions,\u2019 and on the assumption that natural conventions are a type of convention, one would expect this strategy to make it easier to defend the view that speech acts are inherently conventional. For Millikan, a natural convention is constituted by patterns that are reproduced by virtue of the weight of precedent.[11] A pattern is reproduced just in case it has a form that derives from a previous entity having, in certain respects, the same form, and in such a way that had the previous form been different in those respects, the current form would be different in those respects as well (1998, p. 163). Photocopying is one form of reproduction meeting these criteria; the retinotopic mapping from patterns of stimulation on the retina to patterns of stimulation in the visual cortex is evidently another. Millikan would not treat retinotopic mapping as a type of convention, however, since it would not seem to be perpetuated by virtue of the weight of precedent. The point is difficult to discern, however, since in her discussion of the matter Millikan discusses the conditions under which a pattern is taken to be conventional, rather than for it to be conventional, writing\n\nTo be thought of as conventional, a reproduced pattern must be perceived as proliferated due, in important part, to weight of precedent, not to its intrinsically superior capacity to produce a desired result, or due, say, to ignorance of alternatives (ibid, p. 166).\n\nMillikan thus seems to characterize what it is for a pattern to have weight of precedent in terms of that pattern\u2019s being perceived to have such weight. This notion is not itself elucidated, and as a result the notion of weight of precedent is left obscure in her account. Nonetheless, she tells us that just as the conventions of chess dictate that when one\u2019s king is in check, one does what one can to get him out of check; so too the conventions of language dictate that when A tells B that p, B responds by believing that p. Millikan describes the hearer\u2019s response as a hidden, inner act that is not under B\u2019s voluntary control. Millikan also describes this response as being learned in the way that we learn what she calls \u201cnatural sign patterns,\u201d such as our learning that the sound of crashing waves is an indication of a nearby coastline.\n\nOn Millikan\u2019s view, then, A\u2019s assertion of p being followed by B\u2019s belief that p is a process that is not intrinsically superior to others that might have been followed. This may be doubted, however. What, after, all would be viable alternative responses? Disbelieving p? Remaining neutral on the question of p? Scratching one\u2019s left earlobe? Any of these responses would tend to undermine the use of language as a means for transmission of information. What is more, if belief formation is not under the voluntary control of addressees, it is obscure how this aspect of communication could be conventional, any more than the pattern of stimulation of our visual cortex is conventional when that pattern results from an isomorphic pattern on the retina.\n\nForce-conventionalism as espoused by Austin and later Searle has been challenged by Strawson, who writes,\n\nI do not want to deny that there may be conventional postures or procedures for entreating: one can, for example, kneel down, raise one\u2019s arms, and say, \u201cI entreat you.\u201d But I do want to deny that an act of entreaty can be performed only as conforming to such conventions\u2026.[T]o suppose that there is always and necessarily a convention conformed to would be like supposing that there could be no love affairs which did not proceed on lines laid down in the Roman de la Rose or that every dispute between men must follow the pattern specified in Touchstone\u2019s speech about the countercheck quarrelsome and the lie direct. (1964, p. 444)\n\nStrawson contends that rather than appealing to a series of extra-semantic conventions to account for the possibility of speech acts, we explain that possibility in terms of our ability to discern one another\u2019s communicative intentions. What makes an utterance of a sentence in the indicative mood a prediction rather than a command, for instance, is that it manifests an intention to be so taken; likewise for promises rather than predictions. This position is compatible with holding that in special cases linguistic communities have instituted conventions for particular speech acts such as appointing and excommunicating. So too, as Skinner (1970) observes, understanding the utterances of an historical figure crucially depends on sensitivity to conventions of the society in which they are made.\n\nIntending to make an assertion, promise, or request, however, is not enough to perform one of these acts. Those intentions must be efficacious. The same point applies to cases of trying to perform a speech act, even when what one is trying to do is clear to others. This fact emerges from reflecting on an oft-quoted passage from Searle:\n\nHuman communication has some extraordinary properties, not shared by most other kinds of human behavior. One of the most extraordinary is this: If I am trying to tell someone something, then (assuming certain conditions are satisfied) as soon as he recognizes that I am trying to tell him something and exactly what it is I am trying to tell him, I have succeeded in telling it to him. (1969, p. 47.)\n\nAs Green 2013 observes, the point may be doubted. Suppose I am trying to work up the courage to ask Sidney\u2019s hand in marriage. Sidney recognizes this fact on the basis of background knowledge, my visible embarrassment, and my fumbling in my pocket for an engagement ring. Here we cannot infer that I have succeeded in asking Sidney anything. Nothing short of coming out and saying it will do. Similarly, it might be common knowledge that my moribund uncle is trying, as he breathes his last, to bequeath me his fortune; still, I won\u2019t inherit a penny if he expires before saying what he was trying to.[12] Closer to Searle\u2019s example, even if you were to find, on the basis of fMRI analysis of my neural activity, that I was trying to tell you that it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow, I still have not asserted anything about tomorrow\u2019s weather. (If I were completely paralyzed as a result of Locked-In Syndrome, then making such a neural effort might be the most I can hope to do; in that case, your fMRI information might be enough to justify you in taking me to have performed a speech act.)\n\nThe gist of these examples is not the requirement that words be uttered in every speech act\u2014we have already observed that speech acts can be performed silently. Rather, their gist is that speech acts involve intentional undertaking of a publicly accessible commitment; further, that commitment is not undertaken simply by virtue of my intending to undertake it, even when it is common knowledge that this is what I am trying to do. Can we, however, give a more illuminating characterization of the relevant intentions than merely saying that, for instance, to assert P one must intentionally put forth P as an assertion? Strawson (1964) proposes that we can do so with aid of the notion of speaker meaning\u2014to which we now turn.\n\nAs we have seen, that A is an important component of communication, and that A underdetermines B, do not justify the conclusion that B is an important component of communication. One reason for an asymmetry in our treatment of force and decibel level is that the former, but not the latter, seems crucial to how I mean what I say. I intend to speak at a certain volume, and sometimes succeed, but in most cases it is no part of how I mean what I say that I happen to be speaking at that volume. On the other hand, the force of my utterance is an aspect of what I mean. It is not, as we have seen, any aspect of what I say\u2014that notion being closely associated with content. However, whether I mean what I say as an assertion, a conjecture, a promise or something else will be crucial to how I mean what I do.\n\nIn his influential 1957 article, Grice distinguished between two uses of \u2018mean\u2019. One use is exemplified by remarks such as \u2018Those clouds mean rain,\u2019 and \u2018Those spots mean measles.\u2019 The notion of meaning in play in such cases Grice dubs \u2018natural meaning\u2019. Grice suggests that we may distinguish this use of \u2018mean\u2019 from another use of the word more relevant to communication, exemplified in such utterances as\n\nIn saying \u201cYou make a better door than a window\u201d, George meant that you should move,\n\nand\n\nIn gesticulating that way, Salvatore means that there\u2019s quicksand over there,\n\nGrice used the term \u2018non-natural meaning\u2019 for this use of \u2018mean\u2019, and in more recent literature this jargon has been replaced with the term \u2018speaker meaning\u2019.[13] After distinguishing between natural and (what we shall hereafter call) speaker meaning, Grice attempts to characterize the latter. It is not enough that I do something that influences the beliefs of an observer: In putting on a coat I might lead an observer to conclude that I am going for a walk. Yet in such a case it is not plausible that I mean that I am going for a walk in the sense germane to speaker meaning. Might performing an action with an intention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs be sufficient for speaker meaning? No: I might secretly leave Smith\u2019s handkerchief at the crime scene to make the police think that Smith is the culprit. However, whether or not I am successful in getting the authorities to think that Smith is the culprit, in this case it is not plausible that I mean that Smith is the culprit.\n\nWhat is missing in the handkerchief example is the element of overtness. This suggests another criterion: Performing an action with the, or an, intention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs, while intending that this very intention be recognized. Grice contends that even here we do not have enough for speaker meaning. Herod presents Salome with St. John\u2019s severed head on a charger, intending that she discern that St. John is dead and intending that this very intention of his be recognized. Grice observes that in so doing Herod is not telling Salome anything, but is instead deliberately and openly letting her know something. Grice concludes that Herod\u2019s action is not a case of speaker meaning either. The problem is not that Herod is not using words; we have already considered communicators who mean things wordlessly. The problem seems to be that to infer what Herod intends her to, Salome does not have to take his word for anything. She can see the severed head for herself if she can bring herself to look. By contrast, in its central uses, telling requires a speaker to intend to convey information (or alleged information) in a way that relies crucially upon taking her at her word. Grice appears to assume that at least for the case in which what is meant is a proposition (rather than a question or an imperative), speaker meaning requires a telling in this central sense. What is more, this last example is a case of performing an action with an intention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs, even while intending that this very intention be recognized; yet it is not a case of telling. Grice infers that it is not a case of speaker meaning either.\n\nGrice holds that for speaker meaning to occur, not only must one (a) intend to produce an effect on an audience, and (b) intend that this very intention be recognized by that audience, but also (c) intend this effect on the audience to be produced at least in part by their recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention. The intention to produce a belief or other attitude by means (at least in part) of recognition of this very intention, has come to be called a reflexive communicative intention.\n\nIt may be doubted that speaker meaning requires reflexive communicative intentions. After all, a mathematics teacher who proves a theorem T for her class likely wants her pupils to believe T on the strength of her proof rather than their recognition of her intention that they come to believe T. (Vlach 1981) It may even be doubted that speaker meaning requires intentions to produce cognitive effects on addressees at all: Davis (1992) provides a range of cases such as speaking to pre-linguistic infants, uncooperative photocopy machines, and photos of deceased loved ones.[14],[15] Instead of intentions to produce psychological effects in an addressee, some authors have advocated a construal of speaker meaning as overtly manifesting an aspect of one\u2019s commitments or state of mind (Green 2019). Compare my going to the closet to take out my overcoat (not a case of speaker meaning), with the following case: After heatedly arguing about the weather, I march to the closet while beadily meeting your stare, then storm out the front door while ostentatiously donning the coat. Here it is more plausible that I mean that it is raining outside, and the reason seems to be that I am making some attitude of mine overt: I am not only showing it, I am making clear my intention to do just that.\n\nHow does this detour through speaker meaning help to elucidate the notion of force? One way of asserting that P, it seems, is overtly to manifest my commitment to P, and indeed commitment of a particular kind: commitment to defend P in response to challenges of the form, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I must also overtly manifest my liability to be either right or wrong on the issue of P depending on whether P is the case. By contrast, I conjecture P by overtly manifesting my commitment to P in this same \u201cliability to error\u201d way, but I am not committed to responding to challenges demanding full justification. I must, however, give some reason for believing P; this much cannot, however, be said of a guess.\n\nWe perform a speech act, then, when we overtly commit ourselves in a certain way to a content\u2014where that way is an aspect of how we speaker-mean that content. One way to do that is to invoke a convention for undertaking commitment; another way is overtly to manifest one\u2019s intention to be so committed. We may elucidate the relevant forms of commitment by spelling out the norms underlying them. We have already adumbrated such an approach in our discussion of the differences among asserting and conjecturing. Developing that discussion a bit further, compare\n\nasserting\n\nconjecturing\n\nguessing\n\nAll three of these acts have word-to-world direction of fit, and all three have conditions of satisfaction mandating that they are satisfied just in case the world is as their content says it is. Further, one who asserts, conjectures, or guesses that P is right or wrong on the issue of P depending on whether P is in fact so. However, as we move down the list we find a decreasing order of stringency in commitment. One who asserts P lays herself open to the challenge, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d, and she is obliged to retract P if she is unable to respond to that challenge adequately. By contrast, this challenge is inappropriate for either a conjecture or a guess. On the other hand, we may justifiably demand of the conjecturer that she give some reason for her conjecture; yet not even this much may be said of one who makes a guess. (The \u201ceducated guess\u201d is intermediate between these two cases.)\n\nThis illocutionary dimension of speaker meaning characterizes not what is meant, but rather how it is meant. Just as we may consider your remark, directed toward me, \u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d and my remark, \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d as having said the same thing but in different ways; so too we may consider my assertion of P, followed by a retraction and then followed by a conjecture of P, as two consecutive cases in which I speaker-mean that P but do so in different ways. This idea will be developed further in Section 8 under the rubric of \u201cmode\u201d of illocutionary commitment.[16]\n\nSpeaker meaning, then, encompasses not just content but also force, and we may elucidate this in light of the normative structure characteristic of each speech act: When you overtly display a commitment characteristic of that speech act, you have performed that speech act. Is this a necessary condition as well? That depends on whether I can perform a speech act without intending to do so\u2014a topic for Section 9 below. For now, however, compare the view at which we have arrived with Searle\u2019s view that one performs a speech act when others become aware of one\u2019s intention to perform that act. What is missing from Searle\u2019s characterization is the notion of overtness: The agent in question must not only make her intention to undertake a certain commitment manifest; she must also intend that that very intention be manifest. There is more to overtness than wearing one\u2019s heart (or mind) on one\u2019s sleeve.\n\nIn elucidating this normative dimension of force, we have sought to characterize speech acts in terms of their conversational roles. That is not to say that speech acts can only be performed in the setting of a conversation: I can approach you, point out that your vehicle is blocking mine, and storm off. Here I have made an assertion but have not engaged in a conversation. Perhaps I can ask myself a question in the privacy of my study and leave it at that\u2013not continuing into a conversation with myself. However, a speech act\u2019s \u201cecological niche\u201d may nevertheless be the conversation. In that spirit, while we may be able to remove a speech act type from its environment and scrutinize it in isolated captivity, doing so may blind us to some of its distinctive features.\n\nThis ecological analogy sheds light on a dispute over the question whether speech acts can profitably be studied in isolation from the conversations in which they occur. An empiricist framework, exemplified in John Stuart Mill\u2019s A System of Logic, suggests attempting to discern the meaning of a word, for instance a proper name, in isolation. By contrast, Gottlob Frege (1884) enjoins us to understand a word\u2019s meaning in terms of the contribution it makes to an entire sentence. Such a method is indispensable for a proper treatment of such expressions as quantifiers, and represents a major advance over empiricist approaches. Yet students of speech acts have espoused going even further, insisting that the unit of significance is not the proposition but the speech act. Vanderveken writes,\n\nIllocutionary acts are important for the purpose of philosophical semantics because they are the primary units of meaning in the use and comprehension of natural language. (Vanderveken, 1990, p. 1.)\n\nWhy not go even further, since speech acts characteristically occur in conversations? Is the unit of significance really the debate, the colloquy, the interrogation?\n\nStudents of conversation analysis have contended precisely this, remarking that many speech acts fall naturally into pairs.[17] For instance, questions pair naturally with assertions when the latter purport to be answers to those questions. Likewise, offers pair naturally with acceptances or rejections, and it is easy to multiply examples. Searle, who favors studying speech acts in isolation, has replied to these considerations (Searle 1992). There he issues a challenge to students of conversation to provide an account of conversations parallel to that of speech acts, arguing as well that the prospects for such an account are dim. One of his reasons is that unlike speech acts conversations do not as such have a point or purpose. Green 1999 rejoins that many conversations may indeed be construed in teleological terms. For instance, many conversations may be construed as aimed at answering a question, even when that question concerns something as banal as the afternoon\u2019s weather or the location of the nearest subway station. Asher and Lascardes (2003) develop a systematic treatment of speech acts in their conversational setting that also responds to Searle\u2019s challenge. Additionally, Roberts (2004, 2012) develops a model of conversational kinematics according to which conversations are invariably aimed at answering what she terms a question under discussion (QUD). This view is best appreciated within the framework of the \u201cscorekeeping model\u201d of conversation, to which we now turn.\n\nMuch literature concerned with speech acts is curiously disconnected from research in the semantics of natural language emphasizing pragmatic factors. For instance, Stalnaker (1972, 1973, 1974), Lewis (1979, 1980), Thomason (1990) and others have developed models of the kinematics of conversations aimed at understanding the role of quantification, presupposition (both semantic and pragmatic), anaphora, deixis, and vagueness in discourse. Such models typically construe conversations as involving an ever-developing set of Propositions that can be presupposed by interlocutors. This set of Propositions is the conversational common ground, defined as that set of Propositions that all interlocutors take to be true, while also taking it that all other interlocutors take them to be true. If a Proposition p is in a conversation\u2019s common ground, then a speaker may felicitously presuppose p\u2019s truth. Suppose then that the Proposition that Singapore has a unique King is in a conversation\u2019s common ground at given point; then a speaker may felicitously utter a sentence such as \u2018The present King of Singapore is wise,\u2019 or \u2018Singapore\u2019s king is sleeping\u2019. Other parameters characterizing a conversation at a given point include the domain of discourse, a set of salient perceptible objects, standards of precision, time, world or situation, speaker, and addressee. The set of all values for these items at a given conversational moment is often referred to as \u201cconversational score\u201d.\n\n\u201cScorekeeping\u201d approaches to language use typically construe a contribution to a conversation as a Proposition: If that \u201cassertion\u201d is accepted, then the score is updated by having the Proposition entered into common ground. In this spirit, MacFarlane (2011) considers an account of the speech act of assertion in terms an utterance\u2019s capacity to update conversational score. Such an approach will, however, face a difficulty in explaining how two speech acts with the same content, such as an assertion that the Milky Way contains a black hole, and a conjecture that it does, will make different conversational contributions. An enrichment of the scorekeeping model would include sensitivity to differences such as these.\n\nAnother development in the scorekeeping model refines the teleological picture adumbrated above to incorporate Questions, construed (along the lines of Section 2.1) as sets of Propositions. When an interlocutor proffers an assertion that is not met with objections by others in the conversation, the Propositional content of that illocution will enter into common ground. When an interlocutor poses a question that is accepted by others, we may represent the change as an addition to Common Ground of the set of propositions that is the Interrogative content of that illocution. The presence of that Interrogative obliges interlocutors to work to rule all but one Proposition that is a complete answer to the Interrogative. Because Interrogatives stand in inferential relations to one another (Q1 entails Q2 just in case any answer to Q1 is an answer to Q2), one strategy for answering a question is to divide it into tractable questions that it entails: \u2018How many covered bridges are there in Japan?\u2019 can be answered by answering that question for each of that country\u2019s 47 prefectures. Roberts (2004, 2012) develops the Question Under Discussion model of conversational dynamics according to which common ground contains a partially ordered set of Interrogatives in addition to a set of Propositions. This teleological approach to conversation bids fair to enrich our understanding of the relations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics such as presupposition and implicature.[18]\n\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift (1879) constitutes history\u2019s first thoroughgoing attempt to formulate a rigorous formal system in which to carry out deductive reasoning. However, Frege did not see his Begriffsschrift as merely a tool for assessing the validity of arguments. Rather, he appears to have seen it as an organon for the acquisition of knowledge from unquestionable first principles; in addition he wanted to use it in order to help make clear the epistemic foundations on which our knowledge rests. To this end his formal system contains not only symbols indicating the content of propositions (including logical constants), but also symbols indicating the force with which they are put forth. In particular, Frege insists that when using his formal system to acquire new knowledge from propositions already known, we use an assertion sign to indicate our acknowledgment of the truth of the proposition used as axioms or inferred therefrom. Frege thus employs what would now be called a force indicator: an expression whose use indicates the force with which an associated proposition is being put forth (Green 2002).\n\nReichenbach expands upon Frege\u2019s idea in his 1947. In addition to using an assertion sign, Reichenbach also uses indicators of interrogative and imperatival force. Hare similarly introduces force indicators to lay bare the way in which ethical and cognate utterances are made (Hare 1970). Davidson (1979), however, challenges the value of this entire enterprise of introducing force-indicating devices into languages, formal or otherwise. Davidson\u2019s reason is that since natural language already contains many devices for indicating the force of one\u2019s speech act, the only interest a force indicator could have would be if it could guarantee the force of one\u2019s speech act. But nothing could do this: Any device purporting to be, say, an infallible indicator of assertoric force is liable to being used by a joker or actor to heighten the realism of their performance. Referring to the putative force-indicating device as a \u2018strengthened mood,\u2019 he writes,\n\nIt is apparent that merely speaking the sentence in the strengthened mood cannot be counted on to result in an assertion: every joker, storyteller, and actor will immediately take advantage of the strengthened mood to simulate assertion. There is no point, then, in the strengthened mood; the available indicative does as well as language can do in the service of assertion (Davidson 1979, p. 311).\n\nHare 1989 replies that there could be a society with a convention that utterance of a certain expression constituted performance of a certain illocutionary act, even those utterances that occur on stage or as used by jokers or storytellers. Green 1997 questions the relevance of this observation to asserting, which as we have seen, which as we have seen, seem to require intentions for their performance. Just as no convention could make it the case that I believe that P, so too no convention could make it the case that I intend to put forth a certain sentence as an assertion.\n\nOn the other hand, Green 1997 and Green 2000 also observe that even if there can be no force indicator in the sense Davidson criticizes, nothing prevents natural language from containing devices that indicate force conditional upon one\u2019s performing a speech act: such a force indicator would not show whether one is performing a speech act, but, given that one is doing so, it would show which speech act one is performing. For instance, parenthetical expressions such as, \u2018as is the case\u2019 can occur in the antecedent of conditionals, as in: \u2018If, as is the case, the globe is warming, then Antarctica will melt.\u2019 Use of the parenthetical cannot guarantee that the sentence or any part of it is being asserted, but if the entire sentence is being asserted, then, Green claims, use of the parenthetical guarantees that the speaker is also committed to the content of the antecedent. If this claim is correct, natural language already contains force indicators in this qualified sense. Whether it is worth introducing such force indicators into a logical notation remains an open question.\n\nSubsequent to Austin\u2019s introduction of the notion of a performative, it has also been suggested that what we might call performative sentential frames behave like force indicators: \u2018I claim that it is sunny,\u2019 seems to be a prolix way of saying that it is sunny, where the \u2018I claim\u2019 seems only to indicate how what follows is to be taken. On the approach of Urmson (1952), for instance, such a sentence should be understood on the model of \u2018It is sunny, I claim.\u2019 Support for such an analysis may be found in the fact that a potential reply to that utterance is \u2018No it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s pouring outside!\u2019, while \u2018No you don\u2019t\u2019 is not. Again, if the speaker does not believe it is sunny outside, she cannot dodge, she cannot dodge the accusation of lying by remarking that what she had asserted was that she claimed that it is sunny, and not anything about the weather.\n\nNonetheless, drawing on Cohen 1964, Lycan 2018 objects to the view that such performative frames make no contribution to sentence or utterance meaning. If Marissa felicitously utters, \u2018I claim that it is sunny,\u2019 while Abdul felicitously utters, \u2018I conjecture that it is sunny,\u2019 the view implies that their utterances mean the same. The two speakers have clearly said different things, however. On the other hand, if we hold that the performative frame does contribute to the content of what Marissa and Abdul said, then, Lycan points out, it will be difficult to explain how their utterances commit either of them to any position about the weather. It evidently won\u2019t do to posit inference rules such as \u2018I state that p,\u2018 ergo, \u2018p\u2019. We will consider a solution to what Lycan terms \u201cCohen\u2019s Problem\u201d after developing a notion of illocutionary inference in the next section.\n\nStudents of speech acts contend, as we have seen, that the unit of communicative significance is the Illocution rather than the Proposition. This attitude prompts the question whether logic itself might be enriched by incorporating inferential relations among speech acts rather than just inferential relations among Propositions. Just as two event-types E1 and E2 (such as running quickly and running) could be logically related to one another in that it is not possible for one to occur without the other; so too speech act types S 1 and S 2 could be inferentially related to one another if it is not possible to perform one without performing the other. A warning that the bull is about to charge is also an assertion that the bull is about to charge but the converse is not true. This is in spite of the fact that these two speech acts have the same propositional content: That the bull is about to charge. If, therefore, warning implies asserting but not vice versa, then that inferential relation is not to be caught within the net of inferential relations among propositions.\n\nIn their Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (1985), Searle and Vanderveken attempt a general treatment of logical relations among speech acts. They describe their central question in terms of commitment:\n\nA theory of illocutionary logic of the sort we are describing is essentially a theory of illocutionary commitment as determined by illocutionary force. The single most important question it must answer is this: Given that a speaker in a certain context of utterance performs a successful illocutionary act of a certain form, what other illocutions does the performance of that act commit him to? (1985, p. 6)\n\nTo explicate their notion of illocutionary commitment, these authors invoke their definition of illocutionary force in terms of the seven values mentioned in Section 2.3 above. On the basis of this definition, they define two notions pertinent to entailment relations among speech acts, namely strong illocutionary commitment and weak illocutionary commitment. According to the former definition, an illocutionary act S 1 commits a speaker to another illocutionary act S 2 iff it is not possible to perform S 1 without performing S 2 . Whether that relation holds between a pair of illocutionary acts depends on the particular septuples with which they are identified. Thus suppose that S 1 is identical with <IP 1 , Str 1 , Mode 1 , Cont 1 , Prep 1 , Sinc 1 , Stresinc 1 > (corresponding to illocutionary point, strength, mode of achievement, propositional content, preparatory condition, sincerity condition, and strength of sincerity condition, respectively); and suppose that S 2 is identical with <IP 1 , Str 2 , Mode 1 , Cont 1 , Prep 1 , Sinc 1 , Stresinc 1 >. Suppose further that Str 1 and Str 2 differ only in that 1 is stronger than 2. Then it will not be possible to perform S 1 without performing S 2 ; whence the former strongly illocutionarily implies the latter. (This definition of strong illocutionary commitment generalizes in a straightforward way to the case in which a set of speech acts S 1 , \u2026, S n \u22121 implies a speech act S n .)\n\nSearle and Vanderveken also define a notion of weak illocutionary commitment such that S 1 weakly illocutionarily implies S 2 iff every performance of S 1 commits an agent to meeting the conditions laid down in the septuple identical to S 2 (1985, p. 24). Searle and Vanderveken infer that this implies that if P logically entails Q, and an agent asserts P, then she is committed to believing that Q. These authors stress, however, that this does not mean that the agent who asserts P is committed to cultivating the belief Q when P implies Q. In lieu of that explication, however, it is unclear just what notion of commitment is at issue. It is unclear, for instance, what it could mean to be committed to believing Q (rather than just being committed to Q) if this is not to be explicated as being committed to cultivating the belief that Q.\n\nOther approaches attempt to circumvent such problems by reductively defining the notion of commitment in terms of obligations to action and liability to error and/or vindication. Performance of a speech act or set of speech acts can commit an agent to a distinct content, and do so relative to some force. If P and Q jointly imply R, then my asserting both P and Q commits me to R. That is not to say that I have also asserted R: if assertion were closed under deductive consequence I would assert infinitely many things just by virtue of asserting one. By contrast, if I conjecture P and Q, then I am once again committed to R but not in the way that I would have been had I asserted P and Q. For instance, in the assertion case, once my further commitment to R is made clear, it is within the rights of my addressee to ask how I know that R holds; this would not have been an acceptable reply to my merely conjecturing P and Q. Developing this theme, let S be an arbitrary speaker, <\u0394 l A l , \u2026, \u0394 n A n , \u0394B> a sequence of force/content pairs; then:\n\n<\u0394 l A l , \u2026, \u0394 n A n , \u0394B> is illocutionarily valid iff if speaker S is committed to each A i under mode \u0394 i , then S is committed to B under mode \u0394.[19]\n\nBecause it concerns what force/content pairs commit an agent to what others, illocutionary validity is an essentially deontic notion: It will be cashed out in terms either of obligation to use a content in a certain way conversationally, or liability to error or vindication depending upon how the world is.\n\nOur discussion of the possibility of an illocutionary logic answers one question posed at the end of Section 6.3, namely whether it is possible to perform a speech act without intending to do so. This seems likely given Searle and Vanderveken\u2019s definition of strong illocutionary commitment: We need only imagine an agent performing some large number of speech acts, S 1 , \u2026, S n \u22121 , which, unbeknownst to her, jointly guarantee that she fulfills the seven conditions defining another speech act S n . Even in such a case she performs S n only by virtue of intentionally performing some other set of speech acts S 1 , \u2026, S n \u22121 ; it is difficult to see how one can perform S n while having no intention of performing a speech act at all.\n\nWe are also in a position to make headway on Cohen\u2019s Problem as formulated by Lycan. As argued in Green 2000, in an assertion of \u2018I (hereby) assert that p\u2019, a speaker commits herself to p even though her words do not logically entail that Proposition; nor do they presuppose, or either conversationally or conventionally imply it. They do, however, illocutionarily entail it: anyone committed to \u2018I assert that p\u2019 assertorically is thereby committed to p assertorically. By contrast, one committed to \u2018I assert that p\u2019 as a supposition for the sake of argument is not thereby committed to p. Accordingly, such a phrase as \u2018I assert that\u2019 is semantically opaque (making a non-trivial contribution to the truth conditions of the sentences in which it occurs) but pragmatically transparent in the sense that a speaker who undertakes assertoric commitment to a sentence in which it has widest scope is also assertorically committed to its complement. Analogous remarks apply to \u2018I conjecture that\u2019 and the like.\n\nIn a paradigmatic illocutionary event, a speaker has a choice of which if any speech act to perform and her addressee will do her charitable best to discern that speaker\u2019s intentions and, where necessary, which conventions she may be invoking. Pratt (1986) observes that this paradigm is not true to the facts of many areas of communicative life, writing\n\nAn account of linguistic interaction based on the idea of exchange glosses over the very basic facts that, to put it crudely, some people get to do more talking than others, some are supposed to do more listening, and not everybody\u2019s words are worth the same. (1986, p. 68)\n\nAlthough Pratt intends this remark as a critique of speech act theory, it also suggests a way in which this theory might shed light on subtle forms of oppression. We saw in Section 2.2 that a putative bet can misfire if it is not accepted. In such a case the speaker attempts to bet but fails in that effort due to a lack of audience uptake. So too, a person may not be in the correct social position to, say, excommunicate or appoint, and her attempts to perform such illocutions will misfire. More momentously, a pattern of abuses of speech act institutions might deprive a person of an ability to perform speech acts: the inveterate promise-breaker will, in time, lead others in his community to be unwilling to accept any promises he tries to make. He can perform countless locutionary acts but will be unable to perform the illocutionary act of promising, at least in this community.\n\nA pattern of culpable behavior could make a speaker unable to perform one speech act type. Could a pattern of culpable behavior\u2013intentional or inadvertent\u2014on the part of others in a speaker\u2019s community achieve the same effect? This could happen if enough such speakers decide never to accept one person\u2019s bets, warnings, or promises. Beyond such hypothetical cases, it has been argued that patterns of social inequality can prevent members of certain groups from performing the speech acts they would choose to. Building on and refining McKinnon\u2019s (1993) claim that pornography silences women, Langton (1993), and Hornsby and Langton (1998) argue that the industry and consumption of pornography deprive women of the ability to perform the speech act of refusing sexual advances. Refusing is a speech act, but if large enough numbers of men deny uptake (with such thoughts as, \u201cBy \u2018no\u2019 she really means \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d etc.) then, these authors argue, women\u2019s attempts to refuse sexual advances will be characteristically inert with respect to the speech act of refusal. Women will still be able to attempt to refuse sexual advances, and can still try to prevent them by physical means, but a crucial illocutionary form of protection will be closed to them. So too, apartheid, Jim Crow, and even patterns of discrimination of which the perpetrators are not consciously aware, can deprive racial, religious, and ethnic minority groups of the ability to perform speech-act types requiring uptake. These phenomena are generally referred to as illocutionary silencing.\n\nBird (2002) denies that the speech act of refusal requires uptake. Such an illocution is, he contends, like inviting and surrendering, which can occur whether or not their intended audiences grasp or accept the proffered illocutions. Similarly denying that the \u201csilencing\u201d argument should be cast in terms of speech acts, Maitra 2009 argues that the institution of pornography prevents speaker-meant instances of refusal from being understood. One can speaker-mean that she refuses, for instance, but patterns of cognitive and affective response will systematically prevent that refusal from being grasped. Broadening the scope of investigations of the interaction of injustice and illocutionary phenomena, McGowan 2009 argues that some speech acts can not only cause but also constitute instances of oppression. Anderson, Haslanger and Langton (2012) provide overviews of research on racial, gender and related forms of oppression as they relate to speech acts.\n\nAlthough not inherently culpable, the practice of dogwhistling has also recently gained the interest of theorists of speech acts. As suggested by the metaphor, an agent dogwhistles just in case one or more dimensions of a speech act she performs is readily intelligible only to a proper subset of her addressees. Saul 2018 notes that in contemporary American politics, stating one\u2019s opposition to the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott seems to be a way of signaling one\u2019s anti-abortion sympathies. For those not in the know, however, a speaker\u2019s opposition to the Dred Scott appears to be an uncontroversial act of rejecting racism. The phenomenon of dogwhistling provides an apparent challenge to conceptions of speaker meaning in terms of overtness, since the dogwhistler would seem to speaker mean a content that is cryptic to all but her insider audience: is her utterance both overt and covert? Instead of adopting such a view, one who construes speech acts in terms of overtness could refine the notion of manifestness occuring in her account. What is manifest to one addressee may not be manifest to another, and a speaker may exploit this fact.

The vastness of the land, the scarcity of labour, and the abundance of migratory opportunities in a land replete with raw physical resources contributed to exceptional human mobility and a quick succession of ephemeral forms of land use and settlement. Human endeavours have greatly transformed the landscape, but such efforts have been largely destructive. Most of the pre-European landscape in the United States was so swiftly and radically altered that it is difficult to conjecture intelligently about its earlier appearance.\n\nThe overall impression of the settled portion of the American landscape, rural or urban, is one of disorder and incoherence, even in areas of strict geometric survey. The individual landscape unit is seldom in visual harmony with its neighbour, so that, however sound in design or construction the single structure may be, the general effect is untidy. These attributes have been intensified by the acute individualism of the American, vigorous speculation in land and other commodities, a strongly utilitarian attitude toward the land and the treasures above and below it, and government policy and law. The landscape is also remarkable for its extensive transportation facilities, which have greatly influenced the configuration of the land.\n\nAnother special characteristic of American settlement, one that became obvious only by the mid-20th century, is the convergence of rural and urban modes of life. The farmsteads\u2014and rural folk in general\u2014have become increasingly urbanized, and agricultural operations have become more automated, while the metropolis grows more gelatinous, unfocused, and pseudo-bucolic along its margins.\n\nRural settlement\n\nPatterns of rural settlement indicate much about the history, economy, society, and minds of those who created them as well as about the land itself. The essential design of rural activity in the United States bears a strong family resemblance to that of other neo-European lands, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, or tsarist Siberia\u2014places that have undergone rapid occupation and exploitation by immigrants intent upon short-term development and enrichment. In all such areas, under novel social and political conditions and with a relative abundance of territory and physical resources, ideas and institutions derived from a relatively stable medieval or early modern Europe have undergone major transformation. Further, these are nonpeasant countrysides, alike in having failed to achieve the intimate symbiosis of people and habitat, the humanized rural landscapes characteristic of many relatively dense, stable, earthbound communities in parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.\n\nEarly models of land allocation From the beginning the prevalent official policy of the British (except between 1763 and 1776) and then of the U.S. government was to promote agricultural and other settlement\u2014to push the frontier westward as fast as physical and economic conditions permitted. The British crown\u2019s grants of large, often vaguely specified tracts to individual proprietors or companies enabled the grantees to draw settlers by the sale or lease of land at attractive prices or even by outright gift. Of the numerous attempts at group colonization, the most notable effort was the theocratic and collectivist New England town that flourished, especially in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, during the first century of settlement. The town, the basic unit of government and comparable in area to townships in other states, allotted both rural and village parcels to single families by group decision. Contrary to earlier scholarly belief, in all but a few cases settlement was spatially dispersed in the socially cohesive towns, at least until about 1800. The relatively concentrated latter-day villages persist today as amoeba-like entities straggling along converging roads, neither fully rural nor agglomerated in form. The only latter-day settlement experiment of notable magnitude to achieve enduring success was a series of Mormon settlements in the Great Basin region of Utah and adjacent states, with their tightly concentrated farm villages reminiscent of the New England model. Other efforts have been made along ethnic, religious, or political lines, but success has been at best brief and fragile.\n\nCreating the national domain With the coming of independence and after complex negotiations, the original 13 states surrendered to the new national government nearly all their claims to the unsettled western lands beyond their boundaries. Some tracts, however, were reserved for disposal to particular groups. Thus, the Western Reserve of northeastern Ohio gave preferential treatment to natives of Connecticut, while the military tracts in Ohio and Indiana were used as bonus payments to veterans of the American Revolution. A federally administered national domain was created, to which the great bulk of the territory acquired in 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and later beyond the Mississippi and in 1819 in Florida was consigned. The only major exceptions were the public lands of Texas, which were left within that state\u2019s jurisdiction; such earlier French and Spanish land grants as were confirmed, often after tortuous litigation; and some Indian lands. In sharp contrast to the slipshod methods of colonial land survey and disposal, the federal land managers expeditiously surveyed, numbered, and mapped their territory in advance of settlement, beginning with Ohio in the 1780s, then sold or deeded it to settlers under inviting terms at a number of regional land offices. The design universally followed in the new survey system (except within the French, Spanish, and Indian grants) was a simple, efficient rectangular scheme. Townships were laid out as blocks, each six by six miles in size, oriented with the compass directions. Thirty-six sections, each one square mile, or 640 acres (260 hectares), in size, were designated within each township; and public roads were established along section lines and, where needed, along half-section lines. At irregular intervals, offsets in survey lines and roads were introduced to allow for the Earth\u2019s curvature. Individual property lines were coincident with, or parallel to, survey lines, and this pervasive rectangularity generally carried over into the geometry of fields and fences or into the townsites later superimposed upon the basic rural survey. This all-encompassing checkerboard pattern is best appreciated from an airplane window over Iowa or Kansas. There one sees few streams or other natural features and few diagonal highways or railroads interrupting the overwhelming squareness of the landscape. A systematic rectangular layout, rather less rigorous in form, also appears in much of Texas and in those portions of Maine, western New York and Pennsylvania, and southern Georgia that were settled after the 1780s.\n\nDistribution of rural lands Since its formation, Congress has enacted a series of complex schemes for distribution of the national domain. The most famous of these plans was the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered title to 160 acres to individual settlers, subject only to residence for a certain period of time and to the making of minimal improvements to the land thus acquired. The legal provisions of such acts have varied with time as the nature of farming technology and of the remaining lands have changed, but their general effect has been to perpetuate the Jeffersonian ideal of a republic in which yeoman farmers own and till self-sufficient properties. The program was successful in providing private owners with relatively choice lands, aside from parcels reserved for schools and various township and municipal uses. More than one-third of the national territory, however, is still owned by federal and state governments, with much of this land in forest and wildlife preserves. A large proportion of this land is in the West and is unsuited for intensive agriculture or grazing because of the roughness, dryness, or salinity of the terrain; much of it is leased out for light grazing or for timber cutting.\n\nPatterns of farm life During the classic period of American rural life, around 1900, the typical American lived or worked on a farm or was economically dependent upon farmers. In contrast to rural life in many other parts of the world, the farm family lived on an isolated farmstead some distance from town and often from farm neighbours; its property averaged less than one-quarter square mile. This farmstead varied in form and content with local tradition and economy. In particular, barn types were localized\u2014for example, the tobacco barns of the South, the great dairy barns of Wisconsin, or the general-purpose forebay barns of southeastern Pennsylvania\u2014as were modes of fencing. In general, however, the farmstead contained dwelling, barn, storage and sheds for small livestock and equipment, a small orchard, and a kitchen garden. A woodlot might be found in the least-accessible or least-fertile part of the farm. Successions of such farms were connected with one another and with the towns by means of a dense, usually rectangular lattice of roads, largely unimproved at the time. The hamlets, villages, and smaller cities were arrayed at relatively regular intervals, with size and affluence determined in large part by the presence and quality of rail service or status as the county seat. But, among people who have been historically rural, individualistic, and antiurban in bias, many services normally located in urban places might be found in rustic settings. Thus, much retail business was transacted by means of itinerant peddlers, while small shops for the fabrication, distribution, or repair of various items were often located in isolated farmsteads, as were many post offices. Social activity also tended to be widely dispersed among numerous rural churches, schools, or grange halls; and the climactic event of the year might well be the county fair, political rally, or religious encampment\u2014again on a rural site. Not the least symptomatic sign of the strong tendency toward spatial isolation are the countless family burial plots or community cemeteries so liberally distributed across the countryside."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/rite-of-passage/Life-cycle-ceremonies", "page_content": "Life-cycle ceremonies Life-cycle ceremonies are found in all societies, although their relative importance varies. The ritual counterparts of the biological crises of the life cycle include numerous kinds of rites celebrating childbirth, ranging from \u201cbaby showers\u201d and rites of pregnancy to rites observed at the actual time of childbirth and, as exemplified by the Christian sacrament of baptism and the fading rite of churching of women, to a ceremony of thanksgiving for mothers soon after childbirth. These rites involve the parents as well as the child and in some societies include the couvade, which in its so-called classic form centres ritual attention at childbirth upon the father rather than the mother. At this time the father follows elaborate rules of ritual procedure that may include taking to bed, simulating labour pains, and symbolically enacting the successful birth of a child. In all societies some ritual observances surround childbirth, marriage, and death, though the degree of elaboration of the rites varies greatly even among societies of comparable levels of cultural development. Rites at coming-of-age are the most variable in time in the life span and may be present or absent. In some societies such rites are observed for only one sex, are elaborate for one sex and simple for the other, or are not observed for either sex. Characteristically, rites at coming-of-age are not generally observed in modern industrial and postindustrial societies. For example, the Jewish bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah and Protestant confirmation are, in their current forms, more or less vestiges of formerly important religious rites. Similarly, in East Asia, performances of rites at coming-of-age have waned in recent times. The elaborate rites observed a century ago in Japan, for example, when young men and young women reached social maturity are only rarely observed today and are virtually unknown to the general population. Death is given social attention in all societies, and the observances are generally religious in intent and import. In societies that fear dead bodies, the deceased may be abandoned, but they are nevertheless the focus of ritual attention. Most commonly, rites at death are elaborate, and they include clearly all of the stages of separation, transition, and reincorporation first noted by van Gennep.\n\nCeremonies of social transformation Ceremonies of social transformation include all the life-cycle ceremonies, since these involve social transitions for the subjects of the ritual and also for other persons. A man or woman who dies, for example, assumes a new social role as a spirit that may be socially important to the living, the bereaved spouse becomes a widow or widower, and the children have an unnamed but changed status as lacking one parent. A vast number of rites of social transformation, such as rites of initiation into common-interest societies, have no direct or primary connection with biological changes, however. These are abundant in the United States and in Europe, usually as secular ceremonies. In lineage-based or tribal societies, rites of this kind mark induction into age-graded societies, principally limited to males, and a variety of common-interest societies such as warrior societies, curing societies (special groups whose purpose is to cure illnesses), and graded men\u2019s societies that are hierarchically ranked in prestige. Whether hereditary or achieved by appointment or election, assumption of important office in various kinds of societies is often observed by elaborate ritual. Any other events involving changes in social status tend to become the subjects of institutionalized ritual, which is then a prerequisite for the new status. Common examples are initiation ceremonies of college fraternities, sororities, and honorary societies; adult fraternal societies; and social groups of other kinds centred on common interests. Other social changes of importance that apply to a substantial number of people but do not involve initiation into organized social groups are also given ritual attention. Common among these are graduation exercises, festivities marking retirement from work, and various kinds of award ceremonies.\n\nCeremonies of religious transformation Religious transformation ceremonies signal changes in religious status, which may be matters of the greatest importance to the people. Making sacrifices and offerings are rituals that may be required in the normal course of life; further, these acts may be regarded as conferring a new religious status or state of grace. Sacrifices are a frequent feature of rites of passage, and important ceremonies like the coronations and funerals of rulers have sometimes required the sacrifice of many human beings. Among the laity, entry into a religious society or the assumption of any other new religious role is customarily an event celebrated by such rites as those of baptism and confirmation. Among professional religious personnel, the achievement of any distinct status of specialization is ordinarily observed by rites corresponding to the Christian rites of ordination\u2014the rites through which religious functionaries become entitled to exercise their respective functions. As with other rites of passage, these rites may be simple or complex, and their degree of complexity may generally be easily seen as reflecting the religious and social importance of the newly acquired status. A single element of an elaborate rite in one society, such as circumcision or the dressing of the hair in a distinctive way, may in another society be the central or sole event of rites of either social or religious transformation. These ceremonies may, accordingly, be called rites of circumcision or be identified by the name of the style of hairdress.\n\nOther ceremonies The term rites of passage is applied occasionally to institutionalized rites for curing serious illness and rarely to cyclic ceremonies like harvest festivals. No new social or religious status is ordinarily gained by recovery from illness or participation in harvest rites, however, and these ceremonies have probably been included among the rites of passage because of similarities in their ritual procedures. In some societies recovery from a very critical illness is regarded as a divine sign that the erstwhile invalid should assume the role of a religious specialist, but rites of ordination are quite separate. Some elements of ceremonies pertaining to changes in the seasons may be seen as incorporating acts of separation and incorporation, symbolically saying goodbye to the old season and welcoming the new, but these are not customarily called rites of passage. Divorce, although clearly denoting a change in social status, has rarely been regarded as a rite of passage. Festive observances at this time are perhaps common in some societies, but they are often informal practices of the individual or simple acts of local custom, such as discarding wedding rings, that are not institutionalized in the entire society. The absence of divorce from the conventional roster of rites of passage illustrates an outstanding characteristic of this class of rites: all celebrate events that are either socially approved or, like death and illness, unavoidable. Rites of passage that signal the assumption of social statuses disapproved by society are both out of keeping with the prevailing interpretation of the rites as being socially supportive and would broaden them to cover such events as trials by jury and commitment to prison for serious crimes.\n\nSymbolic aspects of ceremonies Whatever their subclassification, elaborate rites of passage are commonly rich in symbolism that prominently includes representations of the states of separation and transition and, especially, insignia of the new status. Most common among these markers of new status are alterations and embellishments of visible or invisible parts of the body, distinctive garments and bodily decorations, and insignias corresponding to symbols of office. All parts of the body that may be altered or embellished without ordinarily causing serious disability have served as the symbols of social statuses and have been elements of rites of passage. Outstanding among these insignias are special styles of hairdress, clothing, and ornaments; the filing, staining, and removal of teeth; the wearing of ornaments in pierced ears, noses, or lips; tattoos or their counterpart of scarification, which produces designs in relief; and circumcision or other genital operations (see religious dress). Several motifs or themes of symbolism commonly recur among societies widely separated from each other geographically and culturally. One such theme symbolizes death and rebirth into the new status. Initiates may be ceremonially \u201ckilled\u201d in a simulated sacrifice and then made symbolically to act like infants who, during the rites, are made to mature into their new statuses. Another common form of symbolism makes use of doors or other portals that signify entry into the new social domain. Ordeals are a rather common feature of coming-of-age ceremonies for both males and females, and they are also used in rites of initiation into men\u2019s societies of various kinds. Success in passing the ordeals is customary and signifies mastery of the roles that are to be assumed. A universal feature of rites of passage is the proscription of certain kinds of ordinary behaviour. Sexual continence is a common rule, as is the prohibition of ordinary work such as farming, hunting, and fishing. Many rites prohibit certain behaviour or prescribe the reverse of ordinary behaviour. Among Native Americans of the western United States, for example, a taboo against scratching the body with the fingers was common during ritual periods. In other societies, ritual behaviour required that the subjects of ritual sit in a remarkable fashion, wear articles of clothing inside out or backward, or wear the clothing of the opposite sex. These acts all may be seen as dramatizations, by contrast, of the events that they celebrate, thereby making them memorable. The early work of the British anthropologists Victor Turner and Mary Douglas paid particular attention to ritual symbols. Turner investigated the use of symbols in rites of passage and other rituals. According to him, the symbols developed and employed within social systems represent oppositions, tensions, and cleavages that rites were designed to resolve. Douglas highlighted the ways in which the human body serves as a \u201cnatural symbol\u201d of pollution and purity during rites of passage and other rituals within social systems based on taboo. Through altering or embellishing the body during the course of a rite, the body becomes \u201cinscribed\u201d with meaning through which a society communicates whether an individual or group is considered polluted or pure."}]}
