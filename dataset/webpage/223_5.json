Led by Joe Gordon, Charlie Keller, and Joe DiMaggio, they easily won the American League pennant that season, winning 103 games and outpacing the second-place Boston Red Sox by nine games.\n\nThe Cardinals had not had nearly as easy a time in winning the National League flag. As late as August 5 they trailed the Brooklyn Dodgers by 10 games. It wasn\u2019t until they swept a two-game series against the Dodgers on September 11 and 12 that they moved into a tie for the league lead. The following day, after dropping the first game of a doubleheader against the Phillies, St. Louis began a six-game win streak that gave them the lead for good. They finished with 106 wins, two games ahead of the Dodgers, to win their sixth National League pennant.\n\nThough the Cardinals started National League MVP Mort Cooper in Game 1, they committed four errors and lost the opener, 7-4. From that point forward, however, the World Series belonged to the Cardinals.\n\nAfter winning Game 2 at Sportsman\u2019s Park, 4-3, the Cardinals went to Yankee Stadium and picked up 2-0 and 9-6 wins. As a result, Game 5 presented the opportunity to conclude the series and hoist the championship.\n\nThe Cardinals started 24-year-old right-hander Johnny Beazley, who had gone 21-6 with a 2.13 ERA during the regular season. Beazley had been the winning pitcher in Game 2, scattering 10 Yankees hits and allowing three runs in a complete-game effort.\n\nTo oppose Beazley, the Cardinals sent 37-year-old Red Ruffing to the mound. A 19-season major-league veteran, Ruffing was a six-time all-star who had received American League MVP votes in four of the previous five seasons. He went 14-7 with a 3.21 ERA in the regular season and was the winning pitcher in Game 1 of the World Series, allowing four runs over 8 2/3 innings.\n\nRuffing opened Game 5 with a scoreless first inning before Phil Rizzuto gave him a one-run lead with a solo home run to lead off the bottom of the inning. Ruffing held that lead until the top of the fourth, when Enos Slaughter hit a solo home run to right field.\n\nThe Yankees regained the lead in the bottom of the fourth when Red Rolfe laid down a bunt single and advanced to second on a throwing error by Beazley. After Rolfe advanced to third on a fly ball, DiMaggio drove him home with a single to left.\n\nNew York threatened again in the fifth as Ruffing singled and the Cardinals committed two more errors. With the bases loaded, DiMaggio grounded out to Kurowski at third base to end the inning.\n\nThe Cardinals carried that momentum into their next at-bat, as Terry Moore and Slaughter opened the inning with singles. With runners on first and third, Walker Cooper hit a sacrifice fly to right field that tied the game once more.\n\nNeither side threatened again until the top of the ninth, when Walker Cooper hit a leadoff single up the middle. After Johnny Hopp laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance Walker Cooper to second, Ruffing faced off with Kurowski, who had struck out three times against Rudding in Game 1 and was 0-for-3 with three fly balls heading into the ninth inning of Game 5.\n\nAs a 7-year-old in Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski had climbed a fence and fallen, landing in broken glass. When the injury turned into osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone, doctors removed four inches of his ulna, one of two bones in the forearm.\n\nOn this occasion, however, neither Kurowski\u2019s misshapen right arm nor Rudding\u2019s previous success against him made any difference. His fly ball sailed over the left-field wall to give the Cardinals a 4-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth.\n\nThe Yankees made things tense in the final frame when Joe Gordon led off with a single and Bill Dickey reached on the Cardinals\u2019 fourth error of the game. However, Walker Cooper picked Gordon off second base and Beazley got pinch-hitter Jerry Priddy to pop up for the second out. The Yankees called upon George Selkirk to bat in place of Rudding, but Selkirk grounded out to second baseman Jimmy Brown to end the game and the series.\n\nFor the fourth time in franchise history, the Cardinals were world champions. Bookmakers and scalpers who expected the powerhouse Yankees to win the series reportedly lost up to $100,000.[1] It was the first World Series the Yankees had lost in seven trips since 1926, when Rogers Hornsby\u2019s Cardinals won the first championship in franchise history.\n\n\u201cBaseball\u2019s domination by the New York Yankees folded up and passed out of existence before 69,052 spectators here this afternoon as the St. Louis National League Cardinals, fighting uphill in the vast Yankee Stadium, became the new world champions of the green diamond,\u201d wrote St. Louis Globe-Democrat sports editor Martin J. Haley.[2]\n\n\u201cAny time you can beat a ball club like the Yanks \u2026 well, I just feel wonderful,\u201d Cardinals manager Billy Southworth said. \u201cIf I felt any better I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d[3]\n\nFor bringing the championship back home to St. Louis, each player received a $6,192.50 share of the World Series purse.[4] For many of the Cardinals, that doubled their salary for the season.\n\n\u201cGosh, I can buy that farm now,\u201d pitcher Howie Krist said. \u201cIt\u2019s 150 acres and it\u2019s a good producing piece of land. Money may shrink, but 150 acres will be 150 acres five years from now, just as it is today.\u201d[5]\n\nKurowski, who was down to his last bat after breaking all of his others during the season, kept it nearby throughout the postgame celebration, showing it to teammates, visitors, and anyone who showed interest.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother Ray was listening on the radio,\u201d Kurowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine down in Parris Island, South Carolina. I got a letter from him this afternoon congratulating me on getting into the World Series, but telling me I made him look silly by fanning my first three times at bat. I got even with him today.\u201d[6]\n\nAfter the 1942 season, Kurowski made five consecutive all-star appearances. In 1945, he hit .323 with 21 homers and 102 RBIs and placed fifth in the National League MVP voting. In 1947, he again finished in the top 10 in the MVP vote after batting .310 with a career-high 27 homers and 104 RBIs. Shortly thereafter, arm injuries ended his career and he went on to become a minor-league coach and manager for 18 seasons.\n\nAfter his breakout 1942 season, Beazley\u2019s career was interrupted by World War II. Before the World Series, he had announced his intention to return home to Nashville, Tennessee, and enlist in the Marine Corps. After he beat the Yankees in Game 5, the Marines recruiting office sent him a telegram: \u201cIf you can toss hand grenades like you pitch for them Cards, hurry up.\u201d[7]\n\nAfter three years of military service, Beazley finally returned in 1946 and went 7-5 with a 4.46 ERA. Ahead of the 1947 season, the Cardinals sold him to the Boston Braves, where he won just two games the remainder of his career.\n\nBeazley\u2019s counterpart in Game 5, Ruffing, missed the next two seasons due to military service, returning in 1945 at age 40. He pitched three more seasons in the majors, making his final appearance with the White Sox in 1947.\n\nThe 1942 championship marked the beginning of a five-year stretch in which the Cardinals made four World Series appearances and won three. In 1943, the Yankees returned the favor, beating St. Louis in a five-game World Series, but the Cardinals bounced back and won the 1944 title over the cross-town Browns. In 1946, the Cardinals won the World Series again, this time defeating the Red Sox in seven games."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/home_run.php?p=kurowwh01", "page_content": "Whitey Kurowski played his first Major League Baseball game on September 23, 1941, with the St. Louis Cardinals.

George (Whitey) Kurowski's two-run home run off Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of Game 5 propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in 1926.\n\nThat Kurowski was even in a major league uniform defied the odds.

The win was the fourth in a row for the Cardinals over the Yankees in the best-of-seven World Series.\n\nKurowski\u2019s home run rates with those by players such as Ken Boyer (1964), Tim McCarver (1964), Willie McGee (1982), Tom Lawless (1987), Albert Pujols (2011) and David Freese (2011) as being among the most prominent and most important in Cardinals World Series lore.\n\nBeating the odds\n\nGeorge \u201cWhitey\u201d Kurowski, a Reading, Pa., native, debuted with the Cardinals on Sept. 23, 1941 _ six days after another Polish-American from Pennsylvania, Stan Musial, played his first game for St. Louis.\n\n\u201cKurowski\u2019s right arm, which flaps in the breeze like a seal\u2019s flipper, is the result of a bone operation, in which a large piece was removed from the forearm,\u201d wrote Tom Meany, a New York-based syndicated columnist. \u201cAs a kid, he fell off a fence and landed on some broken glass. Osteomyelitis was the result and osteomyelitis is no fun for an 8-year-old who can\u2019t even pronounce it.\u201d\n\nDetermined to earn a spot with the 1942 Cardinals, Kurowski was at spring training when he learned his father had died of a heart attack. Kurowski also had lost a brother who died in a coal mining accident.\n\nJimmy Brown opened the 1942 season as the Cardinals\u2019 starting third baseman, with Kurowski in reserve. In late May, manager Billy Southworth shifted Brown to second base, replacing Frank \u201cCreepy\u201d Crespi, and made Kurowski the starter at third.\n\nKurowski, 24, batted .254 with nine home runs and 42 RBI in 115 games for the 1942 National League champions.\n\nDecision time\n\nIn Game 1 of the 1942 World Series, Kurowski struck out three times against Yankees starter and future Hall of Famer Red Ruffing.\n\nKurowski produced a hit in each of the next three games, all Cardinals victories.\n\nNeeding one more win to clinch the championship, the Cardinals started rookie Johnny Beazley, winner of Game 2, against Ruffing in Game 5. Ruffing, 37, had seven World Series wins in his career.\n\nIn the ninth, with the score tied at 2-2, Walker Cooper led off for the Cardinals with a single to center. Johnny Hopp\u2019s sacrifice bunt moved Cooper to second.\n\nKurowski batted next. With first base open, Ruffing looked to the dugout to see whether Yankees manager Joe McCarthy wanted him to give an intentional walk to Kurowski. On deck was the eighth-place batter, Marty Marion, who had no home runs during the regular season. After Marion came the pitcher, Beazley.\n\nMcCarthy ordered Ruffing to pitch to Kurowski.\n\nDramatic ninth\n\nKurowski connected on a high, inside pitch and drove the ball through a fog toward the left-field corner. \u201cNot one-tenth of the spectators saw the ball,\u201d wrote Tom Meany.\n\nThe ball _ fair by about five feet _ cleared the fence for a two-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 4-2 lead.\n\nCooper and Kurowski \u201creceived a few pats on the back when they arrived at the bench,\u201d the St. Louis Star-Times reported. \u201cThe Cards were not going to celebrate before the final verdict had been sealed.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees threatened in their half of the ninth. Joe Gordon led off with a single. Bill Dickey rolled a grounder to second, but Jimmy Brown booted the ball for an error.\n\nWith runners on first and second, no outs, Jerry Priddy bluffed a bunt. The Cardinals\u2019 catcher, Walker Cooper, fired the ball _ \u201ca lightning peg,\u201d The Sporting News called it _ to Marion, who was covering second. Gordon, caught off guard, was tagged out.\n\nThe pickoff took the steam out of the Yankees\u2019 comeback hopes. Priddy popped out (Brown made a sprawling catch on the play) and George Selkirk, batting for Ruffing, grounded out, ending the game and clinching the championship for the Cardinals. Boxscore\n\nTeam player\n\nIn the victorious clubhouse, Cardinals players \u201chugged and pounded Kurowski on the back and then hoisted him on their shoulders,\u201d the Associated Press reported. Teammates tore pieces off the back of Kurowski\u2019s uniform pants and kept the shreds as souvenirs.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother, Ray, was listening to the radio,\u201d Kurowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine down in Parris Island, S.C. I got a letter from him congratulating me on getting into the World Series, but telling me I made him look silly by fanning my first three times at-bat. I got even with him today.\u201d\n\nEach member of the Cardinals earned a World Series championship share of $6,192.50.\n\nUpon arriving in St. Louis by train from New York, the Cardinals were greeted by a crowd so thick on the station platform \u201cit was hard to see who was coming out of the train,\u201d the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nSoon after, 13 of the Cardinals, including Kurowski, went to the Red Cross headquarters in St. Louis and donated blood for use in treating U.S. military members.\n\nWrote the Star-Times, \u201cThe team spirit that carried the Cardinals to the top of the heap can be best illustrated by Kurowski, the blonde-haired Polish boy from the hills of Pennsylvania who sidesteps all personal glory _ even after that epic smash.\u201d\n\nPreviously: From Les Bell to David Freese: Cards 3rd base champs\n\nPreviously: Tom Lawless and his role in Cards World Series lore"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/whitey-kurowski/", "page_content": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 \u2013 December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1941\u201349).
