{"John Russell volunteered to go out and bring in a wounded man who was lying close to the enemy's position.": [{"url": "https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/voices-of-the-first-world-war-wounded", "page_content": "And for French private Leopold Carles, the danger became too great when he tried to help a wounded comrade in 1918.\n\nWe had to run away from the position where we were. Personally I was carrying one of my comrades who had been wounded and there then we were caught between two fires, and that is tragic, you as a human being, you can\u2019t realise what your instinct is, what your personal action is of that moment. The only action you could take is to be safe. Jump from one point to the other, to a shell hole if you can. But when you got, as I had on that particular day, one of my comrades who had been hit, badly hit by a shell splinter, I was carrying him and what was tragic is when I had to give him up. There was no question out of it, we were going to be both killed or one of us had to try and make it for his skin.\n\nBritish gunner H Doggett managed to find the compassion to help his enemy following an attack on Poelcappelle in October 1917.\n\nNow there was one boy, German, there he had got half his hip blown away. And in some yard by Kitchener\u2019s Wood there was a light railway. When the lad got there I tied him on to a little truck and put a label on him asking the next person to see to him, just to push him on down to the line. I don\u2019t know whether it is good to say it or not, but I think it was the only kind act I did out there, to be quite honest.\n\nBut a member of Tom Adlam\u2019s platoon had no such empathy during a British attack on the Schwaben Redoubt in September 1916.\n\nWhen we were going along the trenches the men sort of lose all controls. One of the nicest fellows I had in my platoon, we saw\u2026 there was a German soldier just at the dugout. He\u2019d been wounded. He was in a bad way. He was just moaning, \u2018Mercy kamarad, mercy kamarad.\u2019 And this fellow in front of me said, \u2018Mercy? You b\u2026 German,\u2019 he said, \u2018take that!\u2019 And he pointed, I thought, point blank at him. He was just in front of me. But he jerked his \u2026 and he missed him. And I gave him a shove from behind and I said, \u2018Go on, he won\u2019t do any harm. Let\u2019s go and get a good one.\u2019 But it was so funny, the fellow said afterwards, \u2018Sir, glad I missed him, Sir.\u2019 It was just in the heat of the moment, you see.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in helping wounded men was moving them to safety from where they had fallen on the battlefield. As German medical officer Stephen Westmann found, this could be an extremely risky process.\n\nWe had met the experience of the British, that whenever they had wounded men in their forward lines they went along with a Red Cross flag and nobody fired at them. The German guns were silent until the Red Cross flag had disappeared. We did the same and the British didn\u2019t fire too, artillery fire ceased completely and infantry fire stopped. Now we got the idea to do the same trick with the French. We formed a kind of convoy, in front of it a man with a Red Cross flag, in the middle another man with a Red Cross flag and in the rear another man with a Red Cross flag. Unfortunately the result was exactly the contrary. The French artillery opened up \u2013 it was intense fire \u2013 and several of the stretcher bearers were wounded and killed and so we had to give up this attempt and to bring the men down at night.\n\nEvery battalion had its own stretcher-bearers, who carried wounded men to the medical officer. Basil Farrer described his role as a stretcher bearer in the Ypres area in 1915.\n\nWe\u2019d be in the front line in our \u2013 the company stretcher-bearers would generally share a dugout to themselves, there, with our stretchers \u2013 and we\u2019d be available on call. For, if there was a casualty, the word was passed down the line, \u2018Stretcher-bearer! Stretcher-bearer!\u2019 And then, of course, we\u2019d go along with our stretcher, attend to the man, see if he was wounded. Every soldier had a \u2013 in the pocket in his tunic inside \u2013 a dressing. Well, we\u2019d get that out and there\u2019s a little phial of iodine \u2013 if the wound wasn\u2019t too serious, we\u2019d get that out and put the iodine on and just wrap it up and then put him on the stretcher and take him down to the regimental aid post where he\u2019d be dealt with by the MO attached to the battalion. Every infantry battalion had an RAMC medical officer attached.\n\nBut this system soon broke down during the chaos of large battles. Australian stretcher-bearer Frank Kennedy described how the confusion of the Gallipoli landings in April 1915 meant that it was impossible to follow normal procedures.\n\nWhen we disembarked from our boats on the beach the conditions were indescribable. Wounded, dead, dying, rifles left all over the place, packs that the chaps had chucked off as they advanced in the first assault, no dressing station had been arranged. And the first thing, the first order I was given was to try and get the bodies carried under cover. We did our best, we went up, but the carrying of the stretchers down those slopes was the most difficult thing that any stretcher bearer could do. To try and ease the pain of the chap on the stretcher, stepping down, perhaps stumbling over some bushes, but we carried on right on until the evening, getting as many as we could down there.\n\nRegimental medical officers were only equipped to administer basic treatment. Maberly Esler outlined what little he was able to do at his regimental aid post as MO of the 9th Border Regiment in 1915.\n\nThe only thing you had at your disposal was to cover the wound, to keep it from getting infected, and stopping haemorrhage if by compression on the main vessel \u2013 if they were haemorrhaging and bleeding to death \u2013 or putting a tourniquet round the leg or arm. If it was shot off and bleeding profusely, you had to stop the whole thing by putting a tourniquet on. But you couldn\u2019t keep a tourniquet on longer than an hour without them losing the leg altogether, stopping the blood supply. So it was very necessary to get the field ambulance so they could ligature the vessels, and the quicker that was done, the better. It was very necessary in a case like that to get them shot off to the ambulance as soon as possible, in five or ten minutes.\n\nIf necessary, a casualty would be moved from the regimental aid post to an Advanced Dressing Station. After Victor Fagence of the Royal West Surrey Regiment was hit by machine-gun bullets in late July 1917, he found a lack of organisation at the station he went to.\n\nWell, there was the dressing station there. There was the officer, the medical officer, who was also a surgeon. Most of them were surgeons. And he had one or two orderlies. And quite a lot of wounded. There were a lot of walking wounded and a number of stretcher cases. But the peculiar fact that struck me was that we all had to line up as we arrived, queue up as we arrived. And each man was being attended to in his order of arrival in the queue, without any regard to how badly or lightly he was wounded.\n\nIf a wounded man needed further treatment he would usually then be taken by ambulance to a Casualty Clearing Station. Alice Remington worked as an ambulance driver with the Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment in France. She later recalled the challenges of her role.\n\nIt was the driving up and if you had a lot of wounded people, you know. Groans of people in pain are very distressing. And, you know, there\u2019s not much you can do except get them there without making their wounds even worse. Because if you drove fast, besides giving pain \u2013 which they might have stuck \u2013 you had to be so careful, if there were any fractures, that the fractures didn\u2019t jab into anyone. Particularly if it was a chest wound. You couldn\u2019t have any ribs or anything puncturing lungs.\n\nTravelling behind the lines in an ambulance did not mean a wounded man was out of danger. British officer James Naylor was sent back for treatment when he was wounded during an attack in June 1918.\n\nI walked back to some cross roads where we knew the odd ambulance used to come to collect walking wounded. I got into this ambulance and we drove off and we hadn\u2019t gone very, very far before a shell burst quite close to it and turned the whole thing over. None of us was hurt more than we originally had been hurt or wounded. We all got up, I remember, and we couldn\u2019t right the thing because we weren\u2019t sort of fit enough and we went on walking."}, {"url": "https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/merseysides-war-heroes-who-were-22122581", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet our MyWirral newsletter, for the best news, pictures, opinions and video from across the peninsula\n\nToday we remember all the men and women who have given their lives for their country.\n\nIn honour of our heroes, we have looked at the people who were born, lived or had links in and around Merseyside and were awarded the prestigious Victoria Cross.\n\nThe Victoria Cross was instituted by Royal Warrant on 29 January 1856 for award to both officers and non-commissioned ranks of the Royal Navy and the Army who, in the presence of the enemy \"shall have performed some signal act of valour\".\n\nREAD MORE:List of Remembrance Sunday services taking place across Merseyside\n\nIt remains Britain's premier award for gallantry in the face of the enemy and is worn before all other orders, decorations and medals.\n\nWebsite Find My Past has given the ECHO access to the in-depth details of Merseyside's heroes and their stories of incredible acts of bravery in the field of battle.\n\nSign up for the MyWirral newsletter The MyWirral newsletter will bring you news from across the borough in a way you\u2019ve never had before.

During recent operations Capt. Ackroyd displayed the greatest gallantry and devotion to duty. Utterly regardless of danger, he worked continuously for many hours up and down and in front of the line tending the wounded and saving the lives of officers and men.\n\n\"In so doing he had to move across the open under heavy machine-gun, rifle and shell fire. He carried a wounded officer to a place of safety under very heavy fire.\n\n\"On another occasion he went some way in front of our advanced line and brought in a wounded man under continuous sniping and machine-gun fire.\n\n\"His heroism was the means of saving many lives, and provided a magnificent example of courage, cheerfulness, and determination to the fighting men in whose midst he was carrying out his splendid work. This gallant officer has since been killed in action.\"\n\nErnest Wright Alexander - born in Liverpool 1870, Royal Field Artillery - died on August 25, 1934 in Kingsbridge, Devon\n\n\"For conspicuous bravery and great ability at Elouges on 24th August, 1914, when the flank guard was attacked by a German corps, in handling his battery against overwhelming odds with such conspicuous success that all his guns were saved, notwithstanding that they had to be withdrawn by hand by himself and three other men.\n\n\"This enabled the retirement of the 5th Division to be carried out without serious loss. Subsequently Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander (then Major) rescued a wounded man under a heavy fire, with the greatest gallantry and devotion to duty.\"\n\nStanley Henry Parry Boughey - born in Toxteth in 1896, Royal Scots Fusiliers - died on December 4, 1917 in El Burf, Palestine\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when in command of his battalion. Lieut-Colonel Bushell personally led C Company of his battalion, who were co-operating with an Allied regiment in a counter-attack, in face of very heavy machine-gun fire.\n\n\"In the course of this attack he was severely wounded in the head, but continued to carry on, walking about in front of both English and Allied troops, encouraging and reorganising them.\n\n\"He refused even to have his wound attended to until he had placed the whole line in a sound position, and formed a defensive flank to meet a turning movement by the enemy.\n\n\"He then went to Brigade Headquarters and reported the situation, had his wound dressed, and returned to the firing line, which had come back a short distance.

Next day he took one stretcher-bearer to the advanced trenches, and under heavy shell fire carried an urgent case for 500 yards into safety, being wounded in the side by a shell splinter during the journey.\n\n\n\n\"The same night he took up a party of twenty volunteers, rescued three wounded men from a shell hole twenty-five yards from the enemy\u2019s trench, buried the bodies of two officers, and collected many identity discs, although fired on by bombs and machine guns.\n\n\"Altogether he saved the lives of some twenty badly wounded men, beside the ordinary cases which passed through his hands. His courage and self-sacrifice were beyond praise. \"\n\nNoel's second Victoria Cross.\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when in action ( Wieltje, Flanders ).Though severely wounded early in the action whilst carrying a wounded soldier to the Dressing Station, Captain Chavasse refused to leave his post, and for two days not only continued to perform his duties, but in addition went out repeatedly under heavy fire to search for and attend to the wounded who were lying out.\n\n\"During these searches, although practically without food during this period, worn with fatigue and faint with his wound, he assisted to carry in a number of badly wounded men, over heavy and difficult ground.\n\n\"By his extraordinary energy and inspiring example, he was instrumental in rescuing many wounded who would have otherwise undoubtedly succumbed under the bad weather conditions. This devoted and gallant officer subsequently died of his wounds.\"\n\nWilliam La Touch Congreve - born in Neston 1891, Prince Consort\u2019s Own Rifle Brigade - died July 20, 1916\n\n\u201cFor most conspicuous bravery during a period of fourteen days preceding his death in action. This officer constantly performed acts of gallantry and showed the greatest devotion to duty, and by his personal example inspired all those around him with confidence at critical periods of the operations.\n\n\"During preliminary preparations for the attack he carried out personal reconnaissances of the enemy lines, taking out parties of officers and non-commissioned officers for over 1,000 yards in front of our line, in order to acquaint them with the ground. All these preparations were made under fire.\n\n\"Later, by night, Major Congreve conducted a battalion to its position of employment, afterwards returning to it to ascertain the situation after assault.\n\n\"He established himself in an exposed forward position from where he successfully observed the enemy, and gave orders necessary to drive them from their position.\n\n\"Two days later, when Brigade Headquarters was heavily shelled and many casualties resulted, he went out and assisted the medical officer to remove the wounded to places of safety, although he was himself suffering severely from gas and other shell effects.\n\n\"He again on a subsequent occasion showed supreme courage in tending wounded under heavy shell fire.\n\n\"He finally returned to the front line to ascertain the situation after an unsuccessful attack, and whilst in the act of writing his report, was shot and killed instantly.\"\n\nEdgar Christopher Cookson - born in Tranmere 1883, HMS Comet - died on September 28, 1915 in Mesopotamia\n\n\"On the 28th September, 1915, the river gunboat \"Comet\" had been ordered with other gunboats to examine and, if possible, destroy an obstruction placed across the river by the Turks.\n\n\"When the gunboats were approaching the obstruction a very heavy rifle and machine gun fire was opened on them from both banks.\n\n\"An attempt to sink the centre dhow of the obstruction by gunfire having failed, Lieutenant-Commander Cookson ordered the \"Comet\" to be placed alongside, and himself jumped on to the dhow with an axe and tried to cut the wire hawsers connecting it with the two other craft forming the obstruction. He was immediately shot in several places and died within a very few minutes.\"\n\nGabriel George Coury - born 1896 in Liverpool, Prince of Wales\u2019 Volunteers South Lancashire Regiment - died in 1956\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery. During an advance he was in command of two platoons ordered to dig a communication trench from the firing line to the position won.\n\n\"By his fine example and utter contempt of danger he kept up the spirits of his men and completed his task under intense fire.\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\"Later, after his battalion had suffered severe casualties and the Commanding Officer had been wounded, he went out in front of the advanced position in broad daylight and in full view of the enemy found his Commanding Officer, and brought him back to the new advanced trench over ground swept by machine-gun fire.\n\n\"He not only carried out his original tasks and saved his Commanding Officer, but also assisted in rallying the attacking troops when they were shaken and in leading them forward.\"\n\nJohn Thomas Davies - born in Birkenhead, Prince of Wales\u2019 Volunteers South Lancashire Regiment - died on October 28, 1955\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On 24 March 1918 near Eppeville, France, when his company was ordered to withdraw, Corporal Davies knew that the only line of withdrawal lay through a deep stream lined with a belt of barbed wire and that it was imperative to hold up the enemy as long as possible.\n\n\"He mounted the parapet in full view of the enemy in order to get a more effective field of fire and kept his Lewis gun in action to the last, causing many enemy casualties and enabling part of his company to get across the river, which they would otherwise have been unable to do.\"\n\nArthur Walter Evans - born 1891 in Seaforth, Lincolnshire Regiment - died on November 1, 1936\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery and initiative when with a daylight patrol sent out to reconnoitre and to gain touch with a neighbouring division.\n\n\"When [the patrol was] on the west bank of [the] river an enemy machine-gun post was sighted on the east bank. The river being too deep to force, Sergt Evans volunteered to swim across, and having done so, crept up alone in rear of the machine-gun post.\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\"He shot the sentry and also a second enemy who ran out; he then turned back and caused four to surrender.\n\n\"A crossing over the river was subsequently found, the officer and one man of his patrol joined him, and reconnaissance was continued along the river bank.\n\n\"After proceeding some distance, machine-gun and rifle fire was opened on the patrol, and the officer was wounded. In spite of the fact that no cover was available, Sergt Evans succeeded in covering the withdrawal of the wounded officer under most dangerous and difficult conditions and under heavy fire.\n\n\"The success of the patrol, which cleared up a machine-gun post on the flank of the attacking troops of a neighbouring division and obtained an identification, was greatly due the very gallant conduct of Sergt Evans.\"\n\nCyril Edward Gourley - born in 1893, Wavertree, Royal Field Artillery - died on January 31, 1982\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery when in command of a section of howitzers.\n\n\"Though the enemy advanced in force getting within 400 yards in front, between 300 and 400 yards on one flank and with snipers in the rear, Sergeant Gourley managed to keep one gun in action practically throughout the day.\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\"Though frequently driven off always returned, carrying ammunition, laying and firing the gun himself, taking first one and then another of the detachment to assist him.\n\n\"When the enemy advanced he pulled his gun out of the pit, and engaged a machine gun at 500 yards, knocking it out with a direct hit.\n\n\"All day he held the enemy in check, firing with open sights at enemy parties in full view at 300 to 800 yards, and thereby saved his guns, which were withdrawn at nightfall.\"\n\nDavid Jones - born in Liverpool, 1891, King\u2019s Liverpool Regiment - died in action at Bancourt, Somme, France on October 7, 1916\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery, devotion to duty and ability displayed in the handling of his platoon.\n\n\"The platoon to which he belonged was ordered to a forward position and during the advance came under heavy machine gun fire, the officer being killed and the platoon suffering heavy losses.\n\n\"Serjt David Jones led-forward the remainder, occupied the position and held it for two days and two nights without food or water, until relieved.\n\n\"On the second day he drove back three counter-attacks, inflicting heavy losses. His coolness was most praiseworthy. It was due entirely to his resource and example that his men retained confidence and held their post.\"\n\nThomas Alfred (Todger) Jones - born 1880 in Runcorn, Cheshire Regiment - died on January 30, 1956\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On 25 September 1916 during the Battle of Morval Private Jones was with his company covering the advance in front of a village, when he noticed an enemy sniper 200 yards (200 m) away.\n\n\"He went out and, although one bullet went through his helmet and another through his coat, he returned the sniper's fire and killed him.\n\n\"He then saw two more Germans firing on him although they were displaying a white flag.

He beat off Cavalry charges, by the enemy, causing them many casualties.\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\"One enemy charge left 15 casualties within 20 yards of his trench. One man who had managed to reach the trench was bayonetted by Major Lafone. All of his men became casualties except three.\n\n\"The trench was so full of wounded that it became difficult to move about and use weapons.\n\n\"Major Lafone ordered those who could walk to move to a trench, slightly to the rear. They continued to maintain a heroic resistance.\n\n\"When eventually they became surrounded, he stepped into the open and continued to fight until he was mortally wounded, finally he collapsed. His courage and cheerfulness set a splendid example to the men which enabled them to hold the position as ordered.\"\n\nFrank Lester - born 1896 in Huyton, Lancashire Fusiliers - died on October 12, 1918 at Neuvilly, France\n\n\"For most conspicuous gallantry and self-sacrifice during the clearing of the village of Neuvilly, near Le Cateau, on 12th October 1918.\n\n\"With a party of seven men under an officer, Lester was the first to enter a house by the back door, shooting two Germans as they attempted to escape by the front door.\n\n\"A minute later a fall of masonry blocked the door by which the party had entered.

During an attack, which was held up by machine gun fire which caused many casualties, Sgt Molyneux instantly organised a bombing party to clear the trench in front of a house.\n\n\"Many enemy were killed and a machine gun captured. Having cleared this obstacle, he immediately jumped out of the trench and called for someone to follow him, and rushed for the house.\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\"By the time the men arrived he was in the thick of a hand-to-hand fight, this only lasted a short time and the enemy surrendered, and in addition to the dead and wounded between twenty and thirty prisoners were taken.\n\n\"Apart from the personal bravery of this Non-Commissioned officer, his initiative and dash prevented a slight check from becoming a serious block in the advance, and undoubtedly prevented many casualties.\"\n\nThomas Mottershead - born 1892 in Widnes, No 20 Squadron - killed on January 12, 1917 in Belgium\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery, endurance and skill, when attacked at an altitude of 9000 feet (2 800 metres) the petrol tank was pierced and the machine set on fire.\n\n(Image: Find My Past)\n\n\"Enveloped in flames, which his Observer, Lieutenant Gower was unable to subdue, this very gallant soldier succeeded in bringing his aeroplane back to our lines, and though he made a successful landing, the machine collapsed on touching the ground, pinning him beneath wreckage from which he was subsequently rescued.\n\n\n\n\"Though suffering extreme torture from burns, Sergeant Mottershead showed the most conspicuous presence of mind in the careful selection of a landing place, and his wonderful endurance and fortitude undoubtedly saved the life of his Observer.

Likewise, men in other states sought to join the Union army both before and after the proclamation.\n\nAfter the war, some of those early, quick volunteers also battled to be named the first volunteer for the Union. Months, years, and decades after the war, numerous claims and accolades for who had been the first volunteer began emerging across the North.\n\nIn the absence of standard volunteering procedures, uniform record-keeping methods, and official recognizing systems, individuals staked their own claims and groups gave accolades however they saw fit. As a result, today there are multiple historical displays, monuments, markers, and records that identify different veterans as the first volunteer with several from New York being among those named.\n\nPost-Proclamation\n\nOne of the earliest occasions for recognizing the first volunteer occurred not long after the war ended. In 1867, the Mabon G.A.R. (Grand Army of the Republic) Post in Sanborn, New York, presented a medal to William Wirt Bush of Lockport.\n\nBefore Lincoln was elected, Bush was a vocal supporter of Republican principles and intended to be first to enlist in the event of war. In the first issue of Union and Confederate Annals (1884), Bush recounted that after Fort Sumter fell on April 14, 1861, and news spread that Lincoln would call for troops the next day, he devised a plan to be the first volunteer.\n\nBush prepared his own enlistment papers and created a sign that said \u201cVolunteers Wanted\u201d and then waited with a friend, the telegraph operator, for the expected news on April 15th. At noon (Lockport time) the President\u2019s proclamation started coming over the wire. Bush hurried to his nearby place of business, signed his enlistment paper, posted his sign, and commenced recruiting volunteers. It\u2019s on that basis that was recognized as the first volunteer with a medal (currently is in the Niagara County Historical Society collection). However, Bush was not the only man in New York to quickly respond the day of Lincoln\u2019s proclamation and receive recognition as the first volunteer.\n\nWhen news of Lincoln\u2019s proclamation reached Batavia, Genesee County, NY, on April 15th, Charles F. Rand promptly volunteered. A historical marker outside the Holland Land Company Museum in Batavia states that Congress recognized Rand as the first volunteer. Indeed, records of the 57th Congress show that Rand was recognized as \u201cthe first man from his county to answer the call for volunteers\u201d but the report added that \u201cit is claimed that he was the first man to enlist in the United States.\u201d\n\nNeither the Congressional record nor the historical marker provide the time when Rand volunteered on April 15, but material at the Holland Land Office Museum indicates that it occurred sometime in the morning. If Rand volunteered in the morning, then that means he preceded Bush. However, a claim was also made in Minnesota for someone who volunteered that same morning.\n\nA historical marker stands in a patch of grass on the south side of Main Street in Anoka, Minnesota,. It states that Aaron Greenwald was the first man to volunteer for the Union when he did so \u201cshortly after 10 am on April 15, 1861.\u201d\n\nOn the opposite side of the same street is a display, constructed in 2013, which provides more details. However, traveling southeast a little over 20 miles from Anoka to the capital city of St. Paul one sees a statue atop a granite shaft near the Cathedral of St. Paul which recognizes Josias R. King as the first volunteer.\n\nThat statue, erected in 1903, was sculpted in the likeness of Josias King under protest from other veterans who argued the matter in local newspaper articles starting in 1885, in which several other Minnesota men were named as the first volunteer. Eventually, King and his supporters prevailed. At the unveiling it was said that King was the first to volunteer \u2013 on the evening of April 15th. Aaron Greenwald did not survive the war to stake his own claim (he died at Gettysburg) and there is an absence of records showing exactly when Greenwald and King volunteered. Nonetheless, those dueling first-volunteer monuments in Minnesota remain, with some contending that whoever was first to volunteer in Minnesota was de facto the first volunteer for the Union.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s governor was the first governor to offer troops to Lincoln, and so the reasoning goes, that means the first volunteer from Minnesota was the first for the Union. Minnesota\u2019s Governor Ramsey happened to be in Washington D.C. when Fort Sumter came under attack and on April 14 he gave a written offer of Minnesota volunteers to the Secretary of War who passed it along to the President the same day.\n\nWhile some think that bolsters a Minnesotan\u2019s first-volunteer claim and narrows the focus to only Minnesota veterans, it actually broadens the field of possible claims to include other states and opens the competition to more veterans. Here\u2019s why: Minnesota\u2019s governor offered troops on April 14 prior to Lincoln\u2019s call for volunteers on April 15 so, therefore, anyone from any state who volunteered before the President\u2019s proclamation should also be in the running for recognition as the first volunteer, and some are.\n\nBefore the Proclamation\n\nWhen William DeHart of Logansport, Indiana, heard about Rand\u2019s recognition as the first volunteer, he touted his own claim. DeHart volunteered after Fort Sumter was attacked, but before Lincoln called for volunteers. When news of his challenge to Rand\u2019s first-volunteer claim reached Batavia, an article in The Daily News argued that Rand\u2019s \u201claurels are in danger.\u201d However, DeHart was not the only veteran who volunteered before the proclamation and challenged Rand\u2019s recognition.\n\nJohn Kinnear was the first to respond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after a notice was posted in January of 1861, recruiting volunteers. After hearing of Rand\u2019s recognition as first volunteer, The Cambridge Tribune claimed that Kinnear preceded Rand and was, thus, the first volunteer. However, there was someone else from Massachusetts who volunteered a month earlier.\n\nOn December 18, 1860, Edward Winslow Hincks (also Hinks), wrote a letter from Boston to then-Major Robert Anderson at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, volunteering to aid in its defense in the event of an attack. Hincks\u2019 letter and Anderson\u2019s response are reproduced in The History of Essex County Massachusetts (1888). It is also recorded in Massachusetts in the Rebellion (1866) that a few months after the Civil War, Anderson was at an assembly in Boston and announced that Hincks was the first volunteer.\n\nThere was a man from New York who volunteered even earlier. In War Anecdotes and Incidents of Army Life (Lawson, 1888), it is recorded that Terrence J. Kennedy of Auburn, New York, \u201cclaims to have been the first volunteer for the Union Army\u201d because he \u201cso early as November, 1860 \u2026 urged the immediate enlistment of men\u201d and shortly thereafter began recruiting and drilling volunteers.\n\nIf there is a man who volunteered earlier than Kennedy, then I am not aware of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t. In that tumultuous time in America\u2019s history, men all across the North took the initiative and signed makeshift rolls.\n\nConclusion\n\nNew York veterans feature prominently as early volunteers for the Union and two veterans from New York have a strong position for first-volunteer status \u2013 if it\u2019s a question of who might have been first before the proclamation (Terrence Kennedy) or post-proclamation (Charles F. Rand).\n\nEven if records were found that include the exact time of day when each soldier volunteered however, it would still be challenging to determine with certainty who preceded whom \u2013 time zones wouldn\u2019t be standardized until nearly twenty years after the war.\n\nThe statues, monuments, and displays that recognize different veterans as the first volunteer are not proof of who actually was first, but are records of the many who received accolades as the first volunteer for the Union.\n\nBehind every historical marker or exhibit are stories and exclusive claims, such as who was first to volunteer, should come under more scrutiny, especially in the absence of official records and the presence of competing recognition.\n\nPhotos, from above: Josias R.

How do you read?\u201d And he answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\u201d And He said to him, \u201cYou have answered right; do this, and you will live.\u201d But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, \u201cAnd who is my neighbor?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, \u2018Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.\u2019 Which of these three, do you think, proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\u201d He said, \u201cThe one who showed mercy on him.\u201d And Jesus said to him, \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d\n\nLuke 10: 25-37 (1st Gospel)\n\nMany of us are familiar with the story of the Good Samaritan. A lawyer challenges Jesus with a question: what does he need to do to inherit eternal life? Jesus responds with a question, asking the man what is his understanding of what he needs to do. The man knows the two great commandments, to love God and to love our neighbor. Jesus compliments the man, he\u2019s well on his way to inheriting eternal life. The man, however, asks Jesus; \u201cWho is my neighbor?\u201d (Luke 10:29) Then Jesus tells the story of the Good Samaritan.\n\nA man was beat up and left at the side of the road to die. A priest and a Levite passed him by and didn\u2019t stop. A Samaritan stops by and helps the man, pouring oil and wine on his wounds. He then puts the wounded man on his donkey and takes him to an inn and takes care of him. The next day, the Good Samaritan needs to continue on his journey so he gives the innkeeper money in order to continue caring for the wounded man.\n\nThe most apparent lesson of this parable is that our neighbor is everyone, even our enemies, because the man who had been beaten and robbed was Jewish. The priest and Levite were leaders in his temple and should have been the first to run to his aid. It was the Samaritan, a sworn enemy of the Jews, who stopped to render help to this man.\n\nThere is other symbolism in this parable. The oil and wine used to heal the wounds of the man who had been robbed represent Holy Unction and Holy Communion, the two sacraments in our Church that we use for healing. The inn represents the Church. This is where we are to go when we are hurt and wounded by the world. The innkeeper is the priest, the one who was administering the inn. And the two denarii represent our stewardship. It is stewardship offered to the church that allows the church to care for those who are spiritually wounded.\n\nThe Good Samaritan might actually be called \u201cthe good steward,\u201d because he embodied the three branches of stewardship\u2014he offered his time, his talent, and his treasure to see that a wounded man could be healed. He offered his time, by spending a day and a night with a wounded man. He offered his talent because he had some knowledge of binding up wounds. And he offered his treasure. When he couldn\u2019t give of his time, when the time had come where he needed to leave the inn, he still provided the means for the man to be healed, by offering two denarii to the innkeeper.\n\nThere is still more that we can take away from this chapter. We don\u2019t usually consider this story from the perspective of the man who had been beaten and robbed. Yet, when we consider which person in the story we most relate to, for many of us it is that man on the side of the road. We feel beaten down by the world, wounded in our souls, anxious and uncertain, and overall uncomfortable. Hopefully, we don\u2019t feel like this every day. However, all of us feel like this on some days. We sit at the roadside, hoping for some help. The \u201cpriest\u201d and \u201cLevite\u201d come along and our hopes increase\u2014these are \u201cour people\u201d we think. And then we are crushed when they pass us by. Along comes the \u201cSamaritan,\u201d our \u201cenemy\u201d\u2014maybe it\u2019s the person who has wronged us, or the unpopular/uncool person, or the person whose beliefs are a little different than ours. We now have some mixed feelings. We need help. But from this person?!\n\nThink about how that man on the side of the road felt when the Samaritan helped him. Was his pride wounded because people passed him by and he was now being treated by his enemy? Was he angry and resentful, still hating the man who was helping him? Was his heart melting, his hate giving way to love and appreciation? When it was all over and he was healed, did he look at Samaritans differently? Did he encourage his family and friends to look at them differently? The Bible story does not answer these questions for us. These questions, however, come up in our own stories.\n\nWhen we need help, are we too proud to ask for help? And when help comes from a traditionally unwanted source, do we accept it, or refuse it? Are our hearts changed towards those who are helpful, even if before we didn\u2019t like them? Part of what wounds are souls are not only the times we get kicked to the curb, but the other things that happen\u2014how we deal with \u201cour people\u201d when they ignore us, how we deal other our \u201cenemies\u201d when they actually help us.\n\nThere are also people who refuse to accept help. They are independent, or self-reliant, or too proud to accept help when it is offered. Some may not even see that they need help or that others are capable and willing to help. Imagine the wounded man, bloody and seriously ill, telling the Samaritan, \u201cno thanks, I don\u2019t want your help.\u201d Yet, there are probably people who would do that. They will still see the Samaritan either as their enemy, or they will stubbornly insist on doing it by themselves.\n\nThere is one other category that needs to be mentioned, those who will not accept the help of God. There are those who may see God as the enemy. They won\u2019t reach out to God or to the Church because they have been wounded by spiritual disappointment. This Gospel passage not only has a message to help our wounded neighbors. It also has a message to those wounded\u2014to accept help from God and even from our enemies.\n\nWe all get turns as the priest and Levite, too. We all know people who need help, \u201cour own people\u201d, our family, and our friends. How often do we pass people by, even the people we like?\n\nIf we are really to love our neighbor as ourselves, we have to see everyone as our neighbor. The definition of neighbor is \u201cthe one who lives next to us.\u201d When we are at home, the neighbor is the person in the house or the apartment next door. However, at all times, our neighbor is whoever is in closest proximity to us. It may be the person who lives next door when we are at home. It is the person at the desk next to us at work, the person in the car next to us on the road, the person next to us in the pew at church. Our neighbor at any given moment might be our best friend or our biggest enemy. Our neighbor may be the person who needs help, or the person from whom we need help.\n\nThe healing of soul and body is aided in large part by how we relate to each other as neighbors. When we are wounded, we are aided in being able to call on others for help and trusting they will come to our aid and help us. And when we are wounded, we must put away stubborn pride and accept the needed healing, even if it isn\u2019t convenient or being offered by a friend. When we come upon someone who is wounded, we become an aid in their process of healing by being a good neighbor, or steward, to them. This might involve our time, our talent, or even our treasure, just as it did for the Good Samaritan. However, what it requires first are eyes to are able to see those who are in need, and a heart that pushes us to run toward them, whomever they may be.\n\nThe Physician and Help of the suffering, the Redeemer and Savior of the sick, Master and Lord of all, grant healing to Your ailing servants; have compassion and mercy, on those, who have grievously sinned, and deliver them, O Christ, from their iniquities, that they may glorify Your Divine power.

Kroah, Jr., who served two tours in Vietnam, one as a Special Forces officer. He was talking about Airman 1st Class William H. Pitsenbarger, an Air Force pararescue and medical specialist from Piqua, Ohio, who had voluntarily left the relative safety of a helicopter to descend into a brutal jungle battle to treat and evacuate wounded soldiers in 1966. Pitsenbarger was credited with saving nine lives, after several times refusing to be evacuated himself, during a fight in which 106 of the 134 troopers were killed or badly wounded. Soon after the battle, his Air Force commanders nominated him for the Medal of Honor, but he did not receive it. An Army general recommended that the award be downgraded to the Air Force Cross, apparently because at the time there was not enough documentation of Pitsenbarger\u2019s heroic actions.\n\nPitsenbarger, on April 11, 1966, at his own request, descended 100 feet on a winch line from a Kaman HH-43 Huskie helicopter into a dense jungle valley and alighted in the middle of an encircled company of U.S. Army soldiers. The besieged troops were members of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division and were under attack by VC about 35 miles east of Saigon. Regarding Pitsenbarger\u2019s actions, Daniel Kirby of Louisville, Ky., who had been a Company C rifleman, commented: \u2018I was stunned that somebody was coming down to put themselves in that situation. It\u2019s hard to believe that someone would voluntarily come into that battle and stay with it. He had to be the bravest person I\u2019ve ever known.\u2019\n\nAfter landing, Pitsenbarger gave first aid to the wounded, decided which men needed to be evacuated first and strapped them into a wire basket called a Stokes litter. He helped get nine GIs lifted out of the battle and flown to a nearby field hospital. He refused evacuation himself several times in order to try to save more wounded men. Then his helicopter was hit by enemy fire and nearly disabled. Before leaving the area, his pilot, Harold D. Salem of Mesa, Ariz., signaled for Pitsenbarger to ride the litter up to safety. Again, he refused and waved the chopper off.\n\nKroah, of Houston, said he remembered Pitsenbarger being lowered through the trees at a time when\u2019small-arms fire would be so intense that it was deafening, and all a person could do was get as close to the ground as possible and pray.\u2019 Before long Kroah had been wounded five times and was flat on the ground. \u2018On three different occasions I glimpsed movement, and it was Pits dragging somebody behind a tree trunk or a fallen tree, trying to give them first aid,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018It just seemed like he was everywhere. Everybody else was ducking, and he was crouched and crawling and dragging people by the collar and pack straps out of danger\u2026.I\u2019m not certain of the number of dead and wounded exactly, but I\u2019m certain that the death count would have been much higher had it not been for the heroic efforts of Airman Pitsenbarger.\u2019 Kroah added that the battle was so fierce that his own Army medic was frozen with fear and unable to move and that one of his fire-team leaders, a combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War, curled into a fetal position and wept.\n\n\u2018For Airman Pitsenbarger to expose himself on three separate occasions to this enemy fire was certainly above and beyond the call of duty of any man,\u2019 said Kroah. \u2018It took tremendous courage to expose himself to the possibility of almost certain death in order to save the life of someone he didn\u2019t even know\u2026.He had a total disregard for his own safety and tremendous courage.\u2019\n\nFor the next couple of hours Pitsenbarger crawled through the thick jungle looking for wounded soldiers. He would drag them to the middle of the company\u2019s small perimeter, putting them behind trees and logs for shelter. At one point, said Charles Epperson, of Paris, Mo., Pitsenbarger saw two wounded soldiers outside the perimeter. \u2018He said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to go get those people,\u2019 and I said, \u2018No way. I\u2019m staying behind my tree.\u2019 It was just unbelievable fire coming at us from all sides. But he took off to get those guys, and I could see him trying to get both of them and having a hard time, so I ran out there and helped him drag them inside our lines. He was an inspiration to me,\u2019 said Epperson.\n\nFred Navarro, who was seriously wounded, said Pitsenbarger saved his life by covering him with the bodies of two dead GIs, shielding him from more bullets. \u2018We were getting pounded so bad that I could only lie on the ground for cover. Pitsenbarger continued cutting pant legs, shirts, pulling off boots and generally taking care of the wounded. At the same time, he amazingly proceeded to return enemy fire whenever he could,\u2019 said Navarro, of San Antonio, Texas.\n\nF. David Peters, of Alliance, Ohio, had been in Vietnam only two weeks at the time of the incident. He recalled that he was terrified when he was told to help Pitsenbarger during the firefight. \u2018I don\u2019t remember how many wounded were taken out when we started taking small-arms fire,\u2019 said Peters. \u2018I remember him saying something to the [helicopter] pilot like, get out of here, I\u2019ll get the next one out. His personal choice to\u2026get on the ground to help the wounded is undoubtedly one of the bravest things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019 said Peters.\n\nJohnny W. Libs, a seasoned jungle fighter who was leading Company C that day, said he\u2019d never seen a soldier who deserved the Medal of Honor more than Pitsenbarger. He recalled telling one of his machine-gunners, Phillip J. Hall, of Palmyra, Wis., that Pitsenbarger was out of his mind to leave his chopper for \u2018this inferno on the ground. We knew we were in the fight of our lives and my knees were shaking, and I just couldn\u2019t understand why anybody would put himself in this grave danger if he didn\u2019t have to.\u2019 Libs, of Evansville, Ind., also said that Pitsenbarger seemed to have no regard for his own safety. \u2018We talk about him with reverence. I [had] never met him, but he\u2019s just about the bravest man I have ever known. We were brave, too. We did our job. That\u2019s what we were there for. He didn\u2019t have to be there. He could have gotten out of there. There\u2019s no doubt he saved lives that day.\u2019\n\nHall said that Pitsenbarger\u2019s descent into the firefight \u2018was the most unselfish and courageous act I ever witnessed. I think of him often now,\u2019 he added. \u2018That thing never leaves my mind totally. He did actually give up his life for guys on the ground that he didn\u2019t even know. And he didn\u2019t have to be there. I know he made the conscious decision to stay there.\u2019Salem said that Pitsenbarger had volunteered to go to the ground because the soldiers were having trouble putting a wounded man into the wire basket to be lifted out. The helicopter pilot recalled telling Pitsenbarger that he could leave the chopper only if he agreed that, when given a signal, he would return to the aircraft. \u2018As we were [getting in position], I said, \u2018Pits, it\u2019s hotter than hell down there; do you still want to go down?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes sir, I know I can really help out.\u2019 He made a hell of a difference. We ended up getting nine more out after he got on the ground. He is the bravest person I\u2019ve ever known,\u2019 Salem said.\n\nNear dusk, as the VC launched another assault, Pitsenbarger fought back with an M-16. Then, Navarro said, he saw him get hit several times as he made his way toward what Navarro thought was another wounded man. Pitsenbarger was shot four times, once between the eyes, and died on the spot. The next day one of Pitsenbarger\u2019s best friends, Henry J. O\u2019Beirne of Huntsville, Ala., a former Air Force pararescueman who had served with him and been his bunkmate, recovered his body. \u2018He was an ordinary man who did extraordinary things,\u2019 said O\u2019Beirne.\n\nThe man called Pits by his friends was born and raised in Piqua, a blue-collar town of 22,000 on the Great Miami River in west-central Ohio, about 30 miles north of Dayton. Pitsenbarger was an only child. His father, Frank Pitsenbarger, said that his son had never been afraid of anything. His friends remembered him as an adventurous youngster who would climb the highest tree or scale the tallest building.\n\nJudy Meckstroth, who worked with him at a local supermarket when he was in high school, said he loved to play poker, was a ladies\u2019 man, won dance contests, and showed concern for other people, both young and old. Meckstroth added that he was \u2018ornery and fun-loving. You didn\u2019t dare walk into the back room because he\u2019d hide behind boxes and jump out and scare you to death. But I never heard anything bad about him. It was nothing to have 10 or 15 girls in the store on weekends; they\u2019d come in to buy a pack of gum just to see him. But he wasn\u2019t big-headed about it. He was just good-looking and had a real magnetic personality.\u2019\n\nBob Ford, a retired Piqua assistant fire chief who knew him most of his life, said Pitsenbarger had two other loves: baseball and playing soldier. \u2018There were lots of war movies then, and we played soldier in the streets and alleys all the time. He lived a block away from [a park] and there were always pick-up baseball games,\u2019 he said.\n\nVeterans of Company C felt so strongly about the 21-year-old airman\u2019s heroism that they\u2013along with his former Air Force colleagues, his high school classmates and his hometown chamber of commerce\u2013worked for more than three decades to see that he finally received, posthumously, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor. On December 8, 2000, Pitsenbarger\u2019s father was presented with his son\u2019s Medal of Honor by then Air Force Secretary Whit Peters in a ceremony at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Looking on were 10 of the Army veterans whose eyewitness testimonials had persuaded the Pentagon and Congress to approve the award Pitsenbarger should have received in 1966. Also present were several of his school classmates and some of his Air Force friends, all of whom had worked to get him the medal. Of the December Medal of Honor ceremony, Bob Ford said, \u2018It was a very sad thing, but a happy sad.\u2019\n\nPitsenbarger was the first Air Force enlisted man to earn the Medal of Honor since the U.S. Air Force was established as a separate service in 1947. In 1945, in the era of the U.S. Army Air Forces, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crewman, Henry Erwin, was awarded the medal for saving his crew and aircraft on a bombing run over Japan. One other Air Force enlisted man received the medal for heroism in Vietnam. John Levitow, an Air Force load master in Vietnam, earned the medal in 1969, three years after Pitsenbarger was killed in the action for which he was posthumously awarded the medal 35 years later.\n\nLevitow himself campaigned for Pitsenbarger\u2019s medal and contended that the deceased airman should be considered the first Air Force enlisted recipient in Vietnam. Levitow died exactly one month before Frank Pitsenbarger was presented with his son\u2019s Medal of Honor.\n\nThe Medal of Honor ceremony in Dayton was emotional for all who attended. \u2018There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house,\u2019 said Cheryl Buecker, who went to Piqua Central High School with Pitsenbarger in the class of 1962. \u2018I was proud the community helped accomplish this,\u2019 she added.\n\nIt was only after the ceremony that details of his courage were made public. Toward that end, W. Parker Hayes, Jr., a historian with the Air Force Sergeants Association, had tracked down the Army veterans who had served with Pitsenbarger. Hayes said that in the 1990s an array of people had approached the association seeking help in honoring Pitsenbarger, including O\u2019Beirne; Salem; Dale L. Potter, of Enterprise, Ore., a chopper pilot who also flew rescue operations with Pitsenbarger; Paul D. Miller, another pararescue specialist; some Piqua residents; and members of the Piqua Chamber of Commerce. All had wondered for years why the Medal of Honor had not been awarded to Pitsenbarger. Buecker and classmate Bob Ford said they had begun talking about the issue 20 years earlier at a class reunion planning meeting.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re a really tight class,\u2019 said Buecker, noting that they held a reunion every five years and always put up a \u2018memory board\u2019 carrying obituaries of classmates, along with news clippings and letters from living classmates who could not attend the reunion. \u2018At each reunion it seemed like there was something new about Bill to go on the board,\u2019 Buecker added. In fact, more than a dozen military facilities around the world have been named for Pitsenbarger since his death. In the early 1990s, the classmates started a campaign to convince the Pentagon he deserved the medal. They talked to aides of their congressmen and wrote letters, but did not get very far until 1996. Then they, along with the chamber of commerce and some Air Force pararescuemen, joined forces with Hayes and his fellow historian, William I. Chivalette, at the Airmen\u2019s Memorial Museum, operated by the Air Force Sergeants Association, near Washington, D.C. Hayes and Chivalette did exhaustive research on Pitsenbarger\u2019s last mission. Hayes collected statements from the Army veterans in 1998 and 1999, and a medal nomination package was sent to the Pentagon. On October 6, 2000, Congress approved a bill that included awarding the Medal of Honor to Pitsenbarger.\n\nThe 1962 class of Piqua Central High School had also felt it was a shame that his hometown had never honored him. In 1992, Cheryl Buecker and her husband Tom, who was president of the 1962 class, persuaded David Vollette, president of the Piqua Chamber of Commerce, to join their effort. In 1993 they got the town government to change the name of Piqua\u2019s 67-acre Eisenhower Park to the Pitsenbarger Sports Complex, with a granite monument and bronze plaque, paid for in part by donations from \u201962 classmates.\n\n\u2018We had a deep desire as a community to see something happen. We knew [Pitsenbarger\u2019s] father was hurt that he didn\u2019t get the medal,\u2019 said Cheryl Buecker.\n\nTom Buecker said that in 1991 he had discussed the medal with aides of the area\u2019s U.S. congressman, Representative John A. Boehner, but nothing much had developed from it. The Bueckers said they did not know the process or what was needed in Washington, or even if it was possible for someone to receive the Medal of Honor after so many years.\n\nIn 1996, Chivalette went to Piqua to gather material to write a monograph on Pitsenbarger. During his visit, high school classmates and chamber of commerce members mentioned their efforts for a Piqua memorial and the Medal of Honor, and the Bueckers discussed the process with him.\n\nIn writing his monograph, Chivalette be-came convinced Pitsenbarger deserved the medal. He researched the case until early 1998, when he turned it over to Hayes, since he was leaving for a new job with the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall in Alabama. Meanwhile, the Sergeants Association had been separately contacted in the spring of 1998 by Air Force pararescuer Paul Miller, who also sought help in trying to obtain the medal for Pitsenbarger. The Airmen\u2019s Memorial Museum assembled a nomination package, with helicopter pilot Harold Salem signing the recommendation. Retired Maj. Gen. Allison C. Brooks of Sequim, Wash., who was in charge of Air Force rescue units in Vietnam in 1966, provided an endorsement, and Representative Boehner recommended approval of the medal and sent the package to Secretary Peters.\n\nOn April 7, 2001, Piqua held a community celebration of Pitsenbarger\u2019s life and heroism, marked by the unveiling of a replica of an Ohio historical marker. There also was a fund-raising dinner for the William H. Pitsenbarger Scholarship Fund, established in 1992 by his father and his late mother, Irene. There is now talk of putting up a statue of Pitsenbarger in the town square. For his father, friends, classmates and the town of Piqua, the ceremonies helped bring what seemed to be a fitting end to an almost forgotten episode of the Vietnam War. \u2018It brought closure for me, and I think for the whole town,\u2019 said his father.\n\nThe article was written by Lacy Dean McCrary and originally published in the June 2002 issue of Vietnam Magazine.

A story circulated that Burns, a 69-year-old cobbler and town constable, had been so outraged by the Confederate invasion of the North that he shouldered a rifle and ventured forth to join much younger soldiers in defending the Union.\n\nThe Legend of \"Brave John Burns\" Library of Congress The stories about John Burns happened to be true, or were at least strongly rooted in truth. He did appear at the scene of intense action on the first day of the Battle of Gettyburg, July 1, 1863, volunteering beside Union troops. Burns was wounded, fell into Confederate hands, but made it back to his own house and recovered. The story of his exploits began to spread and by the time the famed photographer Mathew Brady visited Gettysburg two weeks after the battle he made a point of photographing Burns. The old man posed for Brady while recuperating in a rocking chair, a pair of crutches and a musket beside him. The legend of Burns continued to grow, and years after his death the State of Pennsylvania erected a statue of him on the battlefield at Gettysburg.\n\nBurns Joined the Fighting at Gettysburg Burns was born in 1793 in New Jersey, and enlisted to fight in the War of 1812 when he was still in his teens. He claimed to have fought in battles along the Canadian border. Fifty years later, he was living in Gettysburg, and was known as an eccentric character in town. When the Civil War began, he supposedly tried to enlist to fight for the Union, but was rejected because of his age. He then worked for a time as a teamster, driving wagons in army supply trains. A fairly detailed account of how Burns became involved in the fighting in Gettysburg appeared in a book published in 1875, The Battle of Gettysburg by Samuel Penniman Bates. According to Bates, Burns was living in Gettysburg in the spring of 1862, and the townspeople elected him as constable. In late June 1863, a detachment of Confederate cavalry commanded by General Jubal Early arrived in Gettysburg. Burns apparently tried to interfere with them, and an officer placed him under arrest in the town jail on Friday, June 26, 1863. Burns was released two days later, when the rebels moved on to raid the town of York, Pennsylvania. He was unharmed, but furious. On June 30, 1863, a brigade of Union cavalry commanded by John Buford arrived in Gettysburg. Excited townspeople, including Burns, gave Buford reports on Confederate movements in recent days. Buford decided to hold the town, and his decision would essentially determine the site of the great battle to come. On the morning of July 1, 1863, Confederate infantry began to attack Buford\u2019s cavalry troopers, and the Battle of Gettysburg had begun. When Union infantry units appeared on the scene that morning, Burns gave them directions. And he decided to become involved.\n\nHis Role In the Battle According to the account published by Bates in 1875, Burns encountered two wounded Union soldiers who were returning to the town. He asked them for their guns, and one of them gave him a rifle and a supply of cartridges. According to recollections of Union officers, Burns turned up at the scene of the fighting west of Gettysburg, wearing an old stovepipe hat and a blue swallowtail coat. And he was carrying a weapon. He asked officers of a Pennsylvania regiment if he could fight with them, and they ordered him to go to a nearby woods being held by the \u201cIron Brigade\u201d from Wisconsin. The popular account is that Burns set himself up behind a stone wall and performed as a sharpshooter. He was believed to have focused on Confederate officers on horseback, shooting shooting some of them out of the saddle. By the afternoon Burns was still shooting in the woods as the Union regiments around him began to withdraw. He stayed in position, and was wounded several times, in the side, arm, and leg. He passed out from loss of blood, but not before tossing aside his rifle and, he later claimed, burying his remaining cartridges. That evening Confederate troops looking for their dead came across the strange spectacle of an elderly man in civilian dress with a number of battle wounds. They revived him, and asked who he was. Burns told them he had been trying to reach a neighbor\u2019s farm to get help for his sick wife when he had gotten caught in the crossfire. The Confederates didn\u2019t believe him. They left him on the field. A Confederate officer at some point gave Burns some water and a blanket, and the old man survived the night lying out in the open. The next day he somehow made his way to a nearby house, and a neighbor transported him in a wagon back into Gettysburg, which was held by the Confederates. He was again questioned by Confederate officers, who remained skeptical of his account of how he had gotten mixed up in the fighting. Burns later claimed two rebel soldiers shot at him through a window as he was lying on a cot."}, {"url": "https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/atwar/first-world-war", "page_content": "Summary\n\nAustralia\u2019s involvement in the First World War began when Britain and Germany went to war on 4 August 1914, and both Prime Minister Joseph Cook and Opposition Leader Andrew Fisher, who were in the midst of an election campaign, pledged full support for Britain. The outbreak of war was greeted in Australia, as in many other places, with great enthusiasm.\n\nThe first significant Australian action of the war was the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force\u2019s (ANMEF) landing on Rabaul on 11 September 1914. The ANMEF took possession of German New Guinea at Toma on 17 September 1914 and of the neighbouring islands of the Bismarck Archipelago in October 1914. On 9 November 1914 the Royal Australian Navy made a major contribution when HMAS Sydney destroyed the German raider SMS Emden.\n\nOn 25 April 1915 members of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) landed on Gallipoli in Turkey with troops from New Zealand, Britain, and France. This began a campaign that ended with an evacuation of allied troops beginning in December 1915. The next year Australian forces fought campaigns on the Western Front and in the Middle East.\n\nThroughout 1916 and 1917 losses on the Western Front were heavy and gains were small. In 1918 the Australians reached the peak of their fighting performance in the battle of Hamel on 4 July. From 8 August they then took part in a series of decisive advances until they were relieved in early October. Germany surrendered on 11 November.\n\nThe Middle East campaign began in 1916 with Australian troops taking part in the defence of the Suez Canal and the allied re-conquest of the Sinai Desert. In the following year Australian and other allied troops advanced into Palestine and captured Gaza and Jerusalem; by 1918 they had occupied Lebanon and Syria and on 30 October 1918 Turkey sued for peace.\n\nFor Australia, the First World War remains the costliest conflict in terms of deaths and casualties. From a population of fewer than five million, 416,809 men enlisted, of whom more than 60,000 were killed and 156,000 wounded, gassed, or taken prisoner."}, {"url": "https://www.historynet.com/the-doom-patrol-eight-marines-on-a-suicide-mission-in-vietnam/", "page_content": "In February 1968, eight Marines volunteered for a suicide mission\n\nAfter 32 casualties during the first 30 hours of Operation Pursuit, initiated in mid-February 1968 by the 1st Marine Division to search for enemy rocket caches in the mountains west of Da Nang, Lt. Col. Bill Davis ordered Charlie and Delta companies of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, to get off Hills 270 and 310 and return to their base camps in the flatlands to the east.\n\nA little later that morning of Feb. 16, the acting commander of Charlie Company, 1st Lt. Dana F. MacCormack, whose men were descending from Hill 270, radioed Davis: \u201cHere come the NVA, colonel! I\u2019ve got one more KIA that the last helo did not have room for. We are having a hell of a time carrying this body, and the bones are cutting up the body bag.\u201d Davis, on Hill 310 with the battalion command group, told MacCormack to get Charlie Company off the mountain immediately to avoid any more casualties. And that meant leaving the body behind.\n\nThousands of North Vietnamese Army troops had trekked down the Ho Chi Minh Trail in eastern Laos and moved through South Vietnam\u2019s A Shau Valley before making their way to high ground, including Hills 270 and 310, overlooking an area known as Happy Valley and the Marine positions to the east.\n\nUnits from the 31st NVA Regiment and the 368B Artillery Regiment operated frequently out of Happy Valley before moving into the \u201cRocket Belt,\u201d an arc running north to south around the western side of Da Nang at the ideal range for NVA forces firing Soviet-made 122 mm and 140 mm rockets at Da Nang Air Base, Marble Mountain Air Facility and vital ammunition dumps and fuel depots. The inner edge of arc\u2019s belt was about 5 miles from the Da Nang installations; the outer edge of the belt was about 7\u00bd miles away. If NVA rocket squads were outside that belt on the western side, their rockets would likely fall short. But if they were too close to Da Nang on the inner side of the belt, they might overshoot their targets.\n\nEach battalion of the 7th Marines was responsible for a section of the belt, making sure no enemy rockets got inside the arc and within firing range. The 1st Battalion\u2019s headquarters was on Hill 10, inside the belt. Its 72-square-mile area of responsibility extended westward toward the high ground that included Hills 270 and 310, about 3 miles from Hill 10 (the designations reflected hill elevations in meters).\n\nOn Feb. 13, the day before the start of Operation Pursuit, Davis met with Col. Paul Graham, the 1st Marine Division operations officer. A few days earlier, a large secondary explosion was observed on the saddle-shaped area connecting Hills 270 and 310. The explosion indicated the presence of NVA rocket caches, and Graham relayed an order from the division commander, Maj. Gen. Donn J. Robertson, to conduct a search of that area\u2014one of the toughest jungle/mountain terrains in the battalion\u2019s assigned territory.\n\nOperation Pursuit began at 11 a.m. on Feb. 14 as Charlie Company crossed the western end of Hill 10 while Delta Company departed from Hill 41, about 2 miles to the southeast. Accompanying them were 1st Division combat correspondent Sgt. Robert Bayer and photographer Cpl. R.J. Del Vecchio.\n\nThe two companies linked up on the approach to Hills 270 and 310. The dense jungle growth at the base of Hill 270 channeled the Marines into a single-file column during the slow, exhausting climb that forced the men to hack out a trail with machetes. By 6:30 p.m., Delta Company had secured Objective 1, the saddle between Hills 270 and 310. Charlie Company had secured Objective 2, the top of Hill 270.\n\nThe commander of Charlie\u2019s 2nd Platoon, 2nd Lt. Mark Whittier, later wrote a letter to his wife describing evidence of the enemy that this men discovered: \u201cWe got to the top of Hill 270 and found a bunker and communication system that the [NVA] had been using. Also we uncovered a log that we translated. This bunker had a perfect view of the entire Da Nang area and the diary had accounts of when units left our hill and where they were going\u2026.The last entry in the diary was that \u2018there were beaucoup Marines leaving Hill 10 for this position.\u2019\u201d The bunker had been vacated in haste, and the radio was still on.\n\nCharlie Company used the bunker as an overnight command post and blew it up the next morning, Feb. 15. Around that same time, an enemy ambush wounded four Marines of Delta Company in the saddle area. Charlie Company, with Whittier\u2019s platoon in the lead, moved quickly down the south side of Hill 270 to reinforce the ambushed Delta squad.\n\nSuddenly, Whittier\u2019s point squad, which had reached the saddle, was also ambushed by NVA soldiers concealed in bunkers and \u201cspider holes,\u201d foxholes hidden underneath a camouflaged lid. Three Charlie Marines were killed immediately, and several were wounded.\n\nPfc. Michael J. Kelly, a member of the point squad who had been with the company for only two months, was hit by an enemy bullet that struck a grenade on his cartridge belt. The detonation killed Kelly, severing a leg in the process.\n\nThe point squad\u2019s machine gun team leader, Lance Cpl. Russell Naugle, ran down the trail toward one of the wounded Marines while firing his M60 machine gun from the hip. As the corporal pulled his comrade to safety, he was wounded four times. Naugle died later that day from his wounds and posthumously received the Silver Star.\n\nMedevac helicopters flew in to evacuate the casualties, but the side of Hill 310 above the saddle was covered with such dense jungle undergrowth that the choppers had to lower extraction harnesses for the pickups, often while under fire from NVA rocket-propelled grenades, AK-47 assault rifles and 12.7 mm machine guns. Finally, after five hours of battle and medevac efforts, Charlie Company got out all its casualties except Kelly. When the day ended, Charlie and Delta companies had suffered five killed and 27 wounded.\n\nThe next day, Feb. 16, around 7:30 a.m., after Davis issued the order for Charlie and Delta companies to return to their base camps, his 1st Battalion command group and Delta Company were preparing to move down to the valley floor when Charlie Company commander MacCormack radioed. The lieutenant reported that his men, still in the saddle area, were taking gunfire from bunkers concealed in thick vegetation above them on the north side of Hill 310. Six NVA soldiers were firing at them\u2014so close that MacCormack\u2019s Marines could make out their uniforms, flak jackets and helmets.\n\nA Marine reconnaissance team to the west, on Hill 502, advised Davis that a large NVA force was headed toward the Charlie Marines. The colonel alerted MacCormack, who soon announced that he could see the NVA coming and added that his men were having \u201ca hell of a time\u201d carrying Kelly\u2019s body.\n\nAs the company continued its descent, MacCormack again radioed Davis: \u201cI\u2019ve got five WIA being helped down Hill 270, which is slowing us down, so I had to leave our KIA [Kelly] in a bomb crater on the saddle. We can come back out and get his body later.\u201d\n\nIn early afternoon, out of food and water and low on ammunition, the weary, battle-shocked Marines of Charlie Company arrived at Hill 10 and were met by the actual company commander, Capt. Karl Ripplemeyer, who had been on leave and just returned. Delta Company, meanwhile, had reached its base camp on Hill 41.\n\nDavis radioed the regimental commander, Col. Ross R. Miner, and told him that the Marines were back at the command posts, but added that a dead Marine had to be left behind. A few hours later, Miner told Davis that a B-52 bombing mission was scheduled to strike Hills 270 and 310 and ordered him to send a team to recover Kelly\u2019s body before the bombing started. Davis, however, did not want to risk any more lives in those mountains before the bombing runs were completed and argued against an immediate recovery mission, but Miner wouldn\u2019t rescind his order.\n\nDavis discussed Miner\u2019s order with Ripplemeyer, as well as the battalion operations officer and the officer who coordinated air support for the battalion. Davis decided to use Charlie Company volunteers for the recovery since they knew the location of Kelly\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cIt was 100% a suicide mission,\u201d Whittier, the 2nd Platoon lieutenant, would write to his wife on Feb. 17. \u201cThis is a point I can\u2019t too heavily emphasize.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuicide mission\u201d was an unintentionally appropriate term, given Charlie Company\u2019s longstanding nickname: \u201cSuicide Charley.\u201d The unit had earned its nickname during the October 1942 Japanese assault on Guadalcanal, when 1st Battalion was led by Lt. Col. Lewis B. \u201cChesty\u201d Puller, who later became the Corps\u2019 most decorated Marine and finished his career as a lieutenant general. During that battle, Charlie Company held its line against a far larger Japanese force despite suffering heavy losses. The day after the fight, a white flag of parachute cloth with a picture of a skull and crossbones rose over the company\u2019s position. Emblazoned on the flag was \u201cSuicide Charley.\u201d\n\nThe patrol to recover Kelly\u2019s body had only a few hours to prepare for its departure. A runner was sent to Charlie Company seeking the volunteers, including an experienced squad leader. John D. McCreless, then a 20-year-old sergeant, recalled: \u201cWhen the decision came down to use a squad of volunteers, I got crazy and raised my hand and said I\u2019d lead it.\u201d\n\nLance Cpl. Stephen B. McCashin responded similarly: \u201cWhen I heard they were asking for volunteers, I said anyone who would go back into those mountains again would have to be crazy. I thought it was a suicide mission, but since I\u2019m on my second tour here, I must be crazy, so I decided to go.\u201d\n\nPfc. Joseph A. Hamrick signed up because, he said, \u201cI was the only one of the volunteers who knew exactly where the body was, so even though I had only been in the \u2018Nam\u2019 for a month and had never walked point, I figured I could go right to it.\u201d\n\nThe other Marines on the eight-man patrol were Pfc. Thomas M. Adamson, Lance Cpl. Tyree Albert Chamberlain, Pfc. Alfred P. Granados, Cpl. Billy R. Ranes and Pfc. Pedro A. Rodriguez. Someone\u2014no one can remember exactly who\u2014dubbed the volunteers the \u201cDoom Patrol.\u201d\n\nGranados, the radio operator, remembers their preparations. \u201cOur equipment was light for a short recon patrol\u2014no helmets, flak jackets or cartridge belts, and all but one of the men of the Doom Patrol asked to trade their M16s for the more reliable M14, and permission was granted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were to make no enemy contact, travel by stealth in the dark, get the body and return. If we ran into a superior enemy force, we were to abort, split up and get back any way we could.\u201d\n\nBefore the men departed, a senior staff sergeant told McCreless: \u201cNone of you will probably return alive, but to increase your chances, if things get hairy you can just bring back the leg.\u201d The eight Marines weren\u2019t totally on their own for the mission. The battalion air officer had arranged for continuous air support for the patrol.\n\nAt 2 a.m. on Feb. 17, McCreless\u2019 squad left Hill 10. A little more than an hour later, near the abandoned village of Phuoc Ninh (5)\u2014military maps distinguished villages with the same name by numbering them\u2014the Marines spotted NVA soldiers moving toward their position. Chamberlain opened fire and killed one of them, but the patrol was now compromised. McCreless faced a difficult decision: abort the mission or stay the course. He spoke to the battalion command center and was told to proceed. No one wanted an empty casket sent to Kelly\u2019s family, and the men on the mission knew the odds when they volunteered.\n\nOn the move again toward the base of Hill 270, the Marines observed another enemy patrol, and McCreless stopped for an hour near another abandoned village, Phuoc Ninh (7), a precautionary pause in the dark to make sure there was no other NVA activity in the area before continuing their journey.\n\nBy sunrise, around 5 a.m., the patrol had cleared the open rice paddy areas and started into the dense jungle on the side of the mountain\u2014with a long march still ahead, which meant they would have to conduct their \u201cstealth\u201d mission in broad daylight. Three hours later, the men were in a flat area above the bomb crater where Kelly\u2019s body lay, covered with a poncho. There they waited while pilots in O1-Bird Dog propeller-driven planes called in airstrikes.\n\nOne of the pilots radioed McCreless to tell him that napalm drops by F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers would land just forward of the bomb crater. He instructed the patrol members to take cover, take three deep breaths, exhale and hold their next breath. The napalm struck about a 100 yards in front of the patrol. Granados still remembers the intense heat and dust being sucked past his face into the inferno. The shock waves from the blast seemed to raise him off the ground.\n\nAfter the napalm flames diminished, Granados saw NVA soldiers emerging from bunkers and spider holes. McCreless, worried that the enemy troops were about to move against his seriously outnumbered men, yelled: \u201cGet the leg, and let\u2019s get the hell out!\u201d\n\nMoments later, Ranes and Adamson dashed to the crater. They grabbed the severed leg and quickly strapped it to a backpack that Chamberlain carried. The eight Marines then ran back down the trail, amid the still-smoldering napalm and the enemy fire tearing into trees and brush around them. A final strafing run by F-4 Phantoms silenced the firing.\n\nAfter reaching the flatlands, the patrol came upon Charlie Company\u2019s 1st Platoon, sent to assist the squad if any of the men had been wounded or killed. The platoon escorted McCreless\u2019 squad to base camp, and by 2 p.m. all the Marines were back on Hill 10.\n\nAmid great rejoicing, Davis summoned the men to his quarters and handed them cigars and cold beer to celebrate their incredible accomplishment. (He wasn\u2019t aware at that time that the full body had not been recovered.) As recounted in his autobiography Tet Marine, Davis told the Doom Patrol that he had been a fan of Suicide Charley since the Chosin Reservoir battle during the Korean War. \u201cI\u2019ve been proud of them during all these years, because they did great things at the Reservoir,\u201d he said. \u201cBut never did they do anything greater than YOU did, as volunteers, last night and today.\u201d\n\nMcCreless said: \u201cThe only reason I can think of why we were able to pull it off is that the NVA just couldn\u2019t believe that we were stupid enough to go in there and do what we did. They must have thought we were bait for some kind of trap.\u201d\n\nAfter the celebration, Davis typed a letter to the commander of the 7th Marine Regiment:\n\n\u201cDear Colonel Miner, I\u2019ve never been prouder to be a Marine than at this moment! This magnificent squad [from Suicide Charley] went on what appeared to be a suicide mission. I wish you could have heard this young Marine [Pfc. Joseph Hamrick] describe why he volunteered. He just couldn\u2019t imagine that an empty casket would go to a Marine\u2019s parents. He knew they had to do the job, and while he was scared all the way out, and all the way back, he knew that they just had to succeed. I\u2019ve just lived through an experience that I\u2019ll always hold dear to me. Semper Fi.\u201d\n\nWithin 10 hours of the patrol\u2019s return, the B-52s from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam devastated the high ground on Hills 270 and 310. But the NVA would return to Hill 310, and many more Marines were wounded or killed there the following month during Operation Worth and in August during Operation Mameluke Thrust.\n\nOn March 8, Whittier and McCreless were wounded. Later that day, at the Navy hospital in Da Nang, Whittier died from his wounds. A few days later, McCreless was medevaced to Japan for additional surgery. During fighting on May 30, Doom Patrol volunteer Rodriguez was killed.\n\nMen from E Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, found Kelly\u2019s body on March 25 during Operation Worth. A medevac helicopter picked up the remains and took them to the mortuary in Da Nang. A funeral with a casket containing Kelly\u2019s leg was held in his hometown of Findlay, Ohio, in March 1968. A second funeral, with the rest of his remains, was held in April 1968. \u272f\n\n\u2014Jack Wells served in Vietnam during 1968-69 as an artillery forward observer with Alpha and Bravo companies, 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, and later as executive officer of H Battery, 3rd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division."}], "John Russell was severely wounded on 16 November 1857 in Lucknow, India.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Siege-of-Lucknow", "page_content": "Siege of Lucknow, (25 May\u201327 November 1857), sustained assault and eventual relief of the British \"Residency\" (British governmental headquarters) in India\u2019s northern city of Lucknow, part of 1857\u201358 Indian Mutiny against British rule. The relief of Lucknow consisted of two attempts by the British to rescue Sir Henry Lawrence and a contingent of British and Indian troops, along with several hundred civilians, from the center of Lucknow where they held out under siege conditions for six months.\n\nWith widespread mutinies underway, Commander Lawrence ordered all women and children of Lucknow to take cover in the Residency, the city\u2019s chief fortress, on May 25, and Lawrence himself retreated there on June 30. The Residency was protected by battery positions but was vulnerable because a number of buildings surrounding it were occupied by rebel snipers and artillery. Despite this precarious position, and the death of Lawrence early in the siege, the troops and civilians managed to hold out thanks to the actions of a number of soldiers who were later awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nThe first relief attempt occurred on September 25 when a force under the command of Major General Sir Henry Havelock fought its way across rebel-held territory to Lucknow. However, by the time he reached the Residency, Havelock had lost so many troops that he considered it too risky to attempt to evacuate the civilians. The relief force joined the garrison, improved the defenses, and waited for a second relief.\n\nOn November 16, a much larger force approached Lucknow, led by Lieutenant General Sir Colin Campbell. The force stormed the Secundra Bagh, a walled enclosure blocking Campbell\u2019s route to the Residency. By now, the British soldiers had learned of the massacre at Cawnpore, and no mercy was shown to the rebels. The British reached the Residency on November 19 and began evacuations. By November 27, the residents had been removed and relocated to safe locations. Campbell would return in March and recapture Lucknow.\n\nLosses: British, 2,500 casualties of 8,000 troops; Indian, unknown number of casualties of some 30,000 rebels."}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/indian-rebellion-1857-siege-of-lucknow-2361380", "page_content": "The Siege of Lucknow lasted from May 30 to November 27, 1857, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Following the beginning of the conflict, the British garrison at Lucknow was quickly isolated and besieged. Holding out for over two months, this force was relieved in September. As the rebellion swelled, the combined British command at Lucknow was again besieged and required rescue from the new Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant General Sir Colin Campbell. This was achieved in late November after a bloody advance through the city. The defense of the garrison and the advance to relieve it were viewed as a show of British resolve to win the conflict.\n\nBackground\n\nThe capital city of the state of Oudh, which had been annexed by the British East India Company in 1856, Lucknow was the home of the British commissioner for the territory. When the initial commissioner proved inept, the veteran administrator Sir Henry Lawrence was appointed to the post. Taking over in the spring of 1857, he noticed a great deal of unrest among the Indian troops under his command. This unrest had been sweeping across India as sepoys began to resent the Company's suppression of their customs and religion. The situation came to head in May 1857 following the introduction of the Pattern 1853 Enfield Rifle.\n\nThe cartridges for the Enfield were believed to be greased with beef and pork fat. As the British musket drill called for soldiers to bite the cartridge as part of the loading process, the fat would violate the religions of both the Hindu and Muslim troops. On May 1, one of Lawrence's regiments refused to \"bite the cartridge\" and was disarmed two days later. Widespread rebellion began on May 10 when troops at Meerut broke into open revolt. Learning of this, Lawrence gathered his loyal troops and began fortifying the Residency complex in Lucknow.\n\nFast Facts: Siege of Lucknow\n\nConflict: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n\nIndian Rebellion of 1857 Dates: May 30 to November 27, 1857\n\nMay 30 to November 27, 1857 Armies & Commanders: British Sir Henry Lawrence Major General Sir Henry Havelock Brigadier John Inglis Major General Sir James Outram Lieutenant General Sir Colin Campbell 1,729 rising to approx. 8,000 men Rebels Various commanders 5,000 rising to approx. 30,000 men\n\nCasualties: British: approx. 2,500 men killed, wounded, and missing Rebels: Unknown\n\n\n\nFirst Siege\n\nFull-scale rebellion reached Lucknow on May 30 and Lawrence was compelled to use the British 32nd Regiment of Foot to drive the rebels from the city. Improving his defenses, Lawrence conducted a reconnaissance in force to the north on June 30, but was forced back to Lucknow after encountering a well-organized sepoy force at Chinat. Falling back to the Residency, Lawrence's force of 855 British soldiers, 712 loyal sepoys, 153 civilian volunteers, and 1,280 non-combatants was besieged by the rebels.\n\nComprising around sixty acres, the Residency defenses were centered on six buildings and four entrenched batteries. In preparing the defenses, British engineers had wanted to demolish the large number of palaces, mosques, and administrative buildings that surrounded the Residency, but Lawrence, not wishing to further anger the local populace, ordered them saved. As a result, they provided covered positions for rebel troops and artillery when attacks began on July 1.\n\nThe next day Lawrence was mortally wounded by a shell fragment and died on July 4. Command devolved to Colonel Sir John Inglis of the 32nd Foot. Though the rebels possessed around 8,000 men, a lack of unified command prevented them from overwhelming Inglis' troops.\n\nHavelock and Outram Arrive\n\nWhile Inglis kept the rebels at bay with frequent sorties and counterattacks, Major General Henry Havelock was making plans to relieve Lucknow. Having retaken Cawnpore 48 miles to the south, he intended to press on to Lucknow but lacked the men. Reinforced by Major General Sir James Outram, the two men began advancing on September 18. Reaching the Alambagh, a large, walled park four miles south of the Residency, five days later, Outram and Havelock ordered their baggage train to remain in its defenses and pressed on.\n\nMajor General Sir James Outram. Public Domain\n\nDue to monsoon rains which had softened the ground, the two commanders were unable to flank the city and were forced to fight through its narrow streets. Advancing on September 25, they took heavy losses in storming a bridge over the Charbagh Canal. Pushing through the city, Outram wished to pause for the night after reaching the Machchhi Bhawan. Desiring to reach the Residency, Havelock lobbied for continuing the attack. This request was granted and the British stormed the final distance to the Residency, taking heavy losses in the process.\n\nSecond Siege\n\nMaking contact with Inglis, the garrison was relieved after 87 days. Though Outram had originally wished to evacuate Lucknow, the large numbers of casualties and non-combatants made this impossible. Expanding the defensive perimeter to include the palaces of Farhat Baksh and Chuttur Munzil, Outram elected to remain after a large stash of supplies was located.\n\nRather than retreat in the face of the British success, rebel numbers grew and soon Outram and Havelock were under siege. Despite this, messengers, most notably Thomas H. Kavanagh, were able to reach the Alambagh and a semaphore system soon was established. While the siege continued, British forces were working to re-establish their control between Delhi and Cawnpore.\n\nLieutenant General Sir Colin Campbell in 1855. Public Domain\n\nAt Cawnpore, Major General James Hope Grant received orders from the new Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant General Sir Colin Campbell, to await his arrival before attempting to relieve Lucknow. Reaching Cawnpore on November 3, Campbell, a veteran of the Battle of Balaclava, moved towards the Alambagh with 3,500 infantry, 600 cavalry, and 42 guns. Outside Lucknow, rebel forces had swelled to between 30,000 and 60,000 men, but still lacked a unified leadership to direct their activities. To tighten their lines, the rebels flooded the Charbagh Canal from the Dilkuska Bridge to the Charbagh Bridge (Map).\n\nCampbell Attacks\n\nUsing information provided by Kavanagh, Campbell planned to attack the city from the east with the goal of crossing the canal near the Gomti River. Moving out on November 15, his men drove rebels from Dilkuska Park and advanced on a school known as La Martiniere. Taking the school by noon, the British repelled rebel counterattacks and paused to allow their supply train to catch up to the advance. The next morning, Campbell found that the canal was dry due to the flooding between the bridges.\n\nInterior of the Secundra Bagh after Campbell's attack in November 1857. Public Domain\n\nCrossing, his men fought a bitter battle for the Secundra Bagh and then the Shah Najaf. Moving forward, Campbell made his headquarters in the Shah Najaf around nightfall. With Campbell's approach, Outram and Havelock opened a gap in their defenses to meet their relief. After Campbell's men stormed the Moti Mahal, contact was made with Residency and the siege ended. The rebels continued to resist from several nearby positions, but were cleared out by British troops.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe sieges and reliefs of Lucknow cost the British around 2,500 killed, wounded, and missing while rebel losses are not known. Though Outram and Havelock wished to clear the city, Campbell elected to evacuate as other rebel forces were threatening Cawnpore. While British artillery bombarded the nearby Kaisarbagh, the non-combatants were removed to Dilkuska Park and then on to Cawnpore.\n\nTo hold the area, Outram was left at the easily held Alambagh with 4,000 men. The fighting at Lucknow was seen as a test of British resolve and the final day of the second relief produced more Victoria Cross winners (24) than any other single day.

The pounding alarmed her and she answered immediately. It was Martin Gubbins, an official with the Honorable East India Company. Gubbins was a no-nonsense individual who was not used to mincing words. \u201cBring your children and come up to the top of the house immediately,\u201d he ordered.\n\nInglis and several other women were staying with Gubbins because his house was within the grounds of the Residency, the official British headquarters in the city of Lucknow in northern India. Because the Residency had been transformed into a garrison post, complete with armed troops, it was considered to be a place of refuge and safety.\n\nThousands of Indian soldiers, including sepoy foot soldiers and sowar cavalrymen, were in full mutiny against their British overlords, and the rebellious spirit was like an infection that was almost impossible to contain. The British tried to contain this growing rebellion, but efforts to nip it in the bud proved ineffectual and even ham fisted.\n\nLucknow, the capital of Oudh (modern-day Awadh) Province, nursed its own grievances, and it was only a matter of time before it joined the spreading mutiny. Heeding Gubbins\u2019 command, Inglis quickly dressed herself and her children and went to the roof as fast as she could. After the rising tensions of past weeks, she had an inkling of what to expect, but was still shocked by the view.\n\nIt was 11 pm, but the inky void and its canopy of stars could not erase the terrible spectacle that presented itself. The European cantonments were on fire, with tendrils of yellow and orange flames leaping high into the air. Rebel sepoys were busy looting empty buildings before setting them to the torch. But there was fighting, too. Cannons boomed and the staccato popping of musket fire could be heard distinctly. Soon, a handful of Europeans and loyal Indians were under siege, an epic of endurance that would be long remembered even after British rule in India was only a memory.\n\nThe Great Mutiny had its roots in the political, cultural, and religious turmoil of the 1840s and 1850s. The East India Company grew more high handed and arbitrary, and its lust for wealth and territorial acquisitions more obvious and all consuming. The \u201cdoctrine of lapse\u201d held that if there was no natural heir to a ruling family, the territory or state would be annexed by the British.\n\nSometimes, company dealings were even more direct and arbitrary. In the 1850s it cast covetous eyes on Oudh, a rich and prosperous state in northwestern India. Its ruler was Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, and he was deposed by the British in January 1856 on the grounds of having a corrupt administration. Many of the Nawab\u2019s retainers and officials lost their positions, and some landowners lost their lands because they had no proof of ownership or their title was dubiously acquired.\n\nThe common people, mainly peasant farmers, were burdened with heavy taxes and feared loss of caste and religion with British rule. European missionaries meant well, but could scarcely conceal their contempt for the Hindu religion. Wild rumors circulated in northern India that the British and Europeans were dropping beef and pork pieces in drinking wells at night. Cattle are sacred animals in the Hindu religion, and pork is forbidden to people of the Muslim faith.\n\nThe company\u2019s Bengal army had its own grievances. Many Bengal army sepoys were recruited from higher castes like the Brahmins, and they were very conscious of their privileges. Fearful of losing caste if they traveled overseas, Bengal sepoys initially were exempt from such deployments. The British grew impatient with such arrangements and started to introduce soldiers who were available for foreign service, men like Sikhs from the Punjab and Ghurkas from Nepal. Bengal soldiers resented this seeming loss of prestige.\n\nConservative Indians intensely disliked the changes the British were introducing into the subcontinent. The railroads and telegraph, seemingly works of the devil, were strange and alien in concept. The British also allowed widows to remarry, tried to suppress female infanticide, and abolished sati, the customary practice of a widow throwing herself on her husband\u2019s funeral pyre. These reforms, and the suppression of sati, were deeply resented. Sati was not widely practiced, and other reforms may have had minimal impact on most Indians, but that was not the point. The point was foreign meddling with time-honored Indian customs that were centuries old.\n\nMany Indians regard the Great Rebellion as India\u2019s first war of independence. This is perhaps overstating the case; the deposed rulers and threatened upper classes had their own axe to grind, and common Indian farmers were oppressed and feared for their culture and religion. But it is true that the Great Mutiny planted the seeds of a true Indian nationalism that sprouted later in the century.\n\nThe Great Rebellion of 1857 also was called the \u201cDevil\u2019s Wind,\u201d and it is an apt description. Partly though misplaced idealism, partly through arbitrary and high-handed politics, partly though cultural and racial arrogance, the British sowed the wind and would soon reap the whirlwind.\n\nThe Enfield rifle was introduced in India in the spring of 1857, but rumors spread that its cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The cartridge controversy was the spark that soon had all of northern India ablaze.\n\nIt began at Meerut, where elements of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry refused to accept the cartridges when drilling. No fewer than 85 were court-martialed for their disobedience, and most were sentenced to hard labor. The next morning, which was a Sunday, the remainder of the 3rd Cavalry openly revolted and freed their imprisoned comrades. Other Indian units joined the growing rebellion, and soon no European was safe.\n\nRebel sepoys killed the British officers who tried to stop them, and before long European homes were attacked. Men, women, and children were killed without mercy, and the death toll included 50 Indian servants who tried to conceal or otherwise save their employers. The mutineers, triumphant and nearly ecstatic with joy, marched to Delhi 50 miles away.\n\nDelhi had great symbolic significance, especially because it was the capital of the moribund Mogul empire. Delhi fell to the mutineers, a psychological blow to the British that simultaneously boosted rebel hopes and aspirations.\n\nBrigadier General Sir Henry Lawrence had been chief commissioner of Oudh Province for only a few months when the storm broke. Level headed, experienced, and fair, he did his best to calm the troubled political waters and make things right, but he ran out of time. When he heard of the events that occurred at Meerut and Delhi he knew that Lucknow would be targeted by the insurgents sooner or later.\n\nWhen Lawrence took a survey of the Lucknow area, he did not like what he saw. Troop locations were scattered, often miles apart. The main soldier cantonments were at Muriaon, three miles away from the Residency, and consisted of three regiments of native infantry, the 13th, 48th, and 71st, two batteries of native artillery, and one battery of European artillery.\n\nAt Mudkipur, about a mile and a half farther, the 7th Light Cavalry and two regiments of irregular cavalry, the 4th and the 7th, were south of the River Gumti. The loyalty of all these regiments was problematic, but Lawrence hoped that his recent attempts to make things better might calm an increasingly volatile situation.\n\nLawrence had only one full European regiment on hand, the 32nd Regiment of Foot. It had been in Lucknow for about a year, and its troops were acclimated to India\u2019s temperature extremes. Lt. Col. John Inglis, a seasoned officer who had served with this regiment for many years, commanded the regiment.\n\nOne of the commissioner\u2019s first tasks was to fortify the Residency, his political and administrative headquarters. The Residency was actually part of a complex of detached buildings that included a banqueting hall, post office, treasury, storerooms, and individual houses. Many of the existing structures had been built by the Nawabs of Oudh and were meant for royal pleasures or ceremonial occasions. None of the buildings had been erected for military purposes. The compound was located on higher ground near the Gumti River, with Lucknow, a sprawling metropolis of 600,000 souls, spread out beneath it.\n\nNecessity was truly the mother of invention, and gradually a defensive perimeter took shape that was roughly pentagonal in shape. There were at least 28 buildings in the compound, of which perhaps a half dozen or so were vital to the coming defense. Entrenchments were dug, mounds of earth piled up, and gun batteries established. There were simply too many buildings to defend, so many of the outlying structures were pulled down, partly to provide a better field of fire for the defenders and partly to prevent insurgents from using them as cover.\n\nSeveral formerly private residences within the Residency compound were converted into strongpoints. One example was Anderson\u2019s Post, the home of Captain R.F. Anderson of the 25th Native Infantry. Anderson pulled down a garden wall and in its place dug a moat-like ditch that was filled with a prickly hedge of pointed bamboo sticks. A wooden stockade and a mound of earth completed Anderson\u2019s defenses.\n\nGermon\u2019s Post was another key point, formerly the Judicial Commissioner\u2019s office. It was defended by Captain R.C. Germon and his loyal sepoys from the 13th Native Infantry, supplemented by junior civil servants. These civilians, essentially volunteers, also had their families sheltering there.\n\nThe post was a two-story building largely built of red brick, like many in the compound. The house itself was barricaded on all sides with boxes and furniture, and a wall of earth was supplemented by fascines, rough bundles of brushwood bound together.\n\nTwo batteries, one in the north, and one in toward the south, provided much needed firepower. The half-moon-shaped Redan Battery, which boasted two 18-pounders and a 9-pounder, was named after a famous battery in the recently concluded Crimean War. In contrast, the Cawnpore Battery consisted of an 18-pounder and two 9-pounders. The Cawnpore Battery, which was in a dangerously exposed position, depended on flanking fire from the Martiniere Post and Brigade Mess to be tenable. Indeed, the Cawnpore Battery was considered so dangerous it was relieved daily by a captain and men of the 32nd Foot.\n\nThe Residency building was the heart of the defense. It was a three-story brick building with a main entrance that featured a beautiful double-columned portico. The roof boasted an Italianate balustrade, and the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s large picture windows were shaded from the harsh Indian sun by elegant venetian blinds. But these features were meant to impress and to provide comfort, not for military considerations.\n\nConverting a small palace into a makeshift fort was no easy task. Large stacks of firewood were arranged into a semicircle to protect the front of the building. The wooden wall formed an embankment about five feet high, with embrasures cut into it for 4-pounders. The rampart was strengthened by mounds of dirt, which gave the illusion that it was of a more solid construction that it really was.\n\nBy the end of May, Lawrence thought it advisable to call in all European families from outlying areas and have them shelter in the Residency compound for safety. This made sense but resulted in instances of terrible overcrowding. When their Indian servants eventually ran away, the women would get a taste of real hardship.\n\nThe long-anticipated mutiny at Lucknow began on May 30. It unfolded when sepoys, mainly from the 72nd Native Infantry, finally rose up against the British East India Company. They set fire to the European quarters and killed several British officers foolish enough, or perhaps unlucky enough, to be in the immediate vicinity. Lawrence gathered enough men to confront them; after some desultory fighting, the mutineers were expelled from Lucknow. They would not return in force for another month.\n\nMartial law had been declared, and a number of mutineers had been captured. The prisoners were put on trial; if evidence was lacking, the suspects were released. The few found guilty were promptly hanged.\n\nGoaded by Financial Commissioner Martin Gubbins, who insisted inaction was tantamount to cowardice, Lawrence decided to take the offensive on the last day of June. It was an ill-planned, ham-fisted affair and nearly led to disaster. It began when word was received that a body of rebels were at Chinhat, only eight miles from Lucknow.\n\nLawrence left Lucknow with a small force composed of 300 men of the 32nd Foot, 230 loyal sepoys, 100 Sikhs, and a small detachment of civilian volunteer cavalrymen. One of the horsemen was a Calcutta businessman named L.E. Ruutz-Rees, who left one of the more compelling and candid memoirs of the mutiny period. It was Ruutz-Rees who gave a detailed account of the Chinhat confrontation.\n\nThe advance to Chinhat was badly managed, with the troops marching when the sun was already high and blazing down with full intensity. Indian water carriers quickly decamped when they felt the insurgents were nearby, which did not help the column\u2019s growing needs. Lawrence\u2019s column also marched out without adequate food, and hunger was added to the tormenting thirst.\n\nThe Indian insurgent forces, led by the skillful commander General Barhat Ahmed, numbered 5,000 and were supported by 10 guns. The Lawrence column also had artillery, and British guns were unlimbered to start an artillery duel. The 32nd Foot also advanced, boldly exchanging musket fire with the insurgents\n\nBut suddenly things began to fall apart. Indian artillerymen and a native police unit deserted to the mutineers, and some began firing at their former employers. The British attack faltered, in part due to the extreme heat and lack of water. The Lawrence column fell back, but the orderly retreat soon turned into a rout.\n\nLawrence was emotionally devastated by the massive defeat. \u201cMy God!\u201d a soldier heard him exclaim. \u201cAnd I have brought them to this!\u201d The British had brought along an 8-inch howitzer nicknamed \u201cThe Turk,\u201d and the massive gun was pulled by an elephant. When things started going bad the elephant handlers cut the traces and took off with the pachyderm, leaving the howitzer behind. It was captured by the insurgents, who made good use of it during the coming weeks.\n\nDuring that anxious time it seemed that British rule in India was coming to a swift and abrupt end. The first week of June saw rebellions erupt in Sitapur, Faizabad, Sultanpur, and Salon. The entire province of Oudh was now in rebel hands, with British authority reduced to the tiny patch of ground around the Residency.\n\nIn the end the important princely states of Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kasmir decided to stay out of the insurrection. The smaller states of the Rajputana also stayed neutral. The Sikhs of the Punjab\u2014who had little love for Hindus or Muslims\u2014actively helped the British. They had a warrior tradition and were among the best soldiers the subcontinent ever produced, so their aid was crucial.\n\nBut these developments had little immediate effect on the Lucknow siege. The defenders hoped and literally prayed for relief, but the mutineers were a well trained and powerful enemy. It would be some time before the British could mount a counteroffensive that would have any chance of succeeding. The only thing the Lucknow defenders could do was hope for the best while preparing for the worst.\n\nWhen the siege began there were slightly fewer than 3,000 people at the Residency. There were 1,720 armed defenders, a number that included British soldiers, loyal sepoys, and civilian volunteers. They would provide the backbone of the defense. But a detailed tally included 237 women, 260 children, 50 boys from the Martiniere College, 27 non-combatant Europeans, and 700 noncombatant Indians.\n\nThe 32nd Regiment of Foot was the only full-strength European formation at Lucknow when the disturbances began. A weak company of the 84th Foot was also on hand. The traditional red coat was still worn on active service, but more and more it was being replaced by khaki. The men of the 32nd wore summer khaki shell jackets and blue trousers. A Kilmarnock round cap, complete with cover and curtain to protect the back of the neck from the sun, completed the uniform. Ironically, the 32nd was armed with the model 1842 percussion musket, not the more accurate Enfield rifle-musket, the gun that sparked the mutiny.\n\nThe civilians were whipped into martial shape during the relative lull that occurred in June. A sergeant of the 32nd Foot was assigned as drillmaster, but most of the men were junior civil servants or businessmen who were not used to using firearms. In the early stages of the siege they often missed targets when the insurgents launched attacks. As the weeks went on, those who survived death by wounds or disease did seem to get better as soldiers; hard lessons were learned by a literal baptism of fire.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual Residency recruits during the siege were boys from the Martiniere School. The student body consisted of European and Eurasian boys, and the school had a sterling reputation. School Principal Schilling, six masters, and 67 boys made their way into the Residency on June 18. The younger boys rode elephants while the older boys formed a rear guard and were armed with muskets.\n\nAny boy capable of bearing arms was given a musket and some rudimentary training on how to use it. The armed recruits were between the ages of nine and 15. But the boys also did a variety of tasks, including tending the sick and wounded, washing clothes, bearing messages, and working the punkah fans. Some of these jobs were usually assigned to Indian servants, almost all of whom fled.\n\nThe insurgents began the month of July with a furious bombardment, a veritable hurricane of shot and shell. It was determined that the Machi Bhawan, the dilapidated fortress about three-quarters of a mile from the Residency, could not be held given the large numbers of casualties sustained in the Chinhat fiasco. There was too much enemy gunfire for runners to be sent to the old fort, so a makeshift semaphore was constructed on the Residency roof. It was said that the Martiniere boys had a hand it its design and operation.\n\nAfter one or two abortive attempts the semaphore did manage to convey the message: spike the guns, blow up the fort, and retire to the Residency at midnight. As midnight approached, Colonel Palmer opened the gates and began the trek to the Residency. Luck was with them, and their 15-minute journey was undetected by the insurgents. After their safe arrival, a slow-burning fuse reached the 240 barrels of powder and 594,000 cartridges and blew them up with a deafening roar. It was a cataclysmic blast that shook Regency buildings and blew out many windows.\n\nIt was soon discovered that the buildings were still largely unsafe, in spite of all the sweat and toil that had gone into transforming them into makeshift fortresses. On July 2 a shell crashed into the Residency\u2019s second floor, tearing off the leg of 19-year-old Suzanna Palmer, who was said to be engaged to a company officer. Palmer and a few other women had elected to stay on the second floor, probably because the lower rooms were crowded and stifling almost to the point of suffocation.\n\nPalmer begged medical staff not to remove what remained of her leg, but Dr. Joseph Fayrer insisted, and the operation proceeded. The young woman died in great pain two days later. She was the first civilian casualty, and a foretaste of what was to come. Lawrence had a near miss a day earlier, when an 8-inch shell crashed through a window and landed in a room where he and his staff were staying. The shell failed to detonate, and the commissioner downplayed the incident to his staffers.\n\nTragedy struck the next day. Weary after long hours of inspections, Lawrence finally decided to take a break by lying down on a bed on the Residency\u2019s second floor. While the commissioner was resting, Captain Thomas Wilson stood nearby reading a report to him.\n\nSuddenly the room dissolved into sheets of smoke and flame, the blast accompanied by a deafening roar. An 8-inch shell had once again crashed through, but this time it detonated and mortally wounded Lawrence. A shell fragment smashed the upper part of his thigh and fractured his pelvis. A tourniquet staunched the blood flow, but little else could be done for him.\n\nThe commissioner appointed Major John Banks as his political successor and tapped Lt. Col. John Inglis to take care of military affairs. He was given chloroform to ease his pain, but infection must have set in because his agony grew more intense with each passing hour. Some were unnerved by his tormented moans and piercing screams of agony, and after much suffering he died two days later.\n\nThough forgotten in most histories, the British had a formidable Lucknow opponent in Begum Hazrat Mahal, wife of the deposed Nawab. She was known for her beauty, but also for her efficient rule and keen intelligence. A kind of Indian Boudica, she was a politically savvy warrior queen with a sound strategic sense. Her fiery speeches inspired her soldiers, and it was said she actually led them in battle.\n\nThe day after Lawrence died the Residency defenders could hear music and festive noise coming from the city proper. The Begum was in the process of installing her son, Birjis Qadar, as the new Nawab of Oudh. Since the lad was only 12, the Begum continued to hold power as a kind of regent.\n\nThe European women fought their own battles, conflicts of a more immediate and personal nature. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week, they grappled with terror and despair, with little more than their own courage and religious faith to sustain them. Katherine Bartum found herself assigned to the ironically titled \u201cLadies Quarters,\u201d which she describes as dirty and uninviting. Initially, she and her two-year-old son were crowded into one room along with 15 other women and children.\n\nBartum\u2019s diary details her struggle to keep her son alive as conditions worsened and unsanitary living conditions spread disease. Some of the women and children contracted cholera; there also were outbreaks of smallpox. She recorded her emotional ups and downs; for example, chronicling how her son survived dysentery and a near-fatal fever.\n\nNo place was really safe. Bartum was horrified when a little girl she watched playing in the courtyard was suddenly hit in the head by a cannonball. She fainted from the sheer shock of seeing such a bloody demise, but in time such scenes of death and destruction grew commonplace. The noncombatant casualties mounted, rivaling the number of male battle deaths.\n\nIn some respects the women did have the worst of it. Once the fighting began, the terror was amplified by the fact that they were literally and figuratively in the dark. The underground rooms, known as tykhanna, had little or no natural light. \u201cThere would come the cry of all lights out; the children would cry at being in the dark, and the women would be trembling in fear lest the enemy attack proved successful and the sepoys should get in,\u201d recalled Bartrum.\n\nSounds of battle would filter into the rooms, a chaotic cacophony that included the crash of shells and rattle of musketry, the screams of the wounded, and the shouts and cries of men engaged in the fight of their lives. Women never knew if a door would suddenly open and mutineers might rush in to kill all inside.\n\nBy mid-July the Residency compound was reeking with a sickening stench, an amalgam of smells from human waste and the decomposing bodies of men and animals. During lulls in the fighting the musket was exchanged for a shovel as every effort was made to bury the decaying flesh before pestilence spread. The work was exhausting in the innervating heat and only partly successful. Many of the graves were so shallow that the reeking cemetery was avoided as much as possible.\n\nThe insurgents launched an all-out assault on July 20. Ruutz-Rees was busy cleaning his musket when suddenly the loud cry of \u201cTo Arms!\u201d caused him to pause in his labors. Large numbers of rebels had been seen massing, so every man had to report to his post. Ruutz-Rees started running out of the building when an explosion erupted near the Redan, a blast so powerful the ground beneath his feet shook.\n\nThe insurgents had tunneled underground and planted a mine in hopes of blowing up the Redan. Once a breech in the fortifications was deemed practicable, the insurgents hoped to pour into the Residency compound before the defenders could respond; however, the mutineers had miscalculated, and the Redan was intact. The smoke from the explosion obscured the battery, and the insurgents were not aware of their error until the attack was well underway.\n\nThe Redan\u2019s guns opened up as soon as the enemy was in range, discharging lethal blasts of grapeshot that shredded and lacerated the oncoming ranks. The rebels paused at the Redan but soon renewed their attacks at other posts. Gubbins\u2019 post was one of their targets, a building so battered by days of artillery fire that its upper story was reduced to a shattered, pock-marked ruin.\n\nSensing an opportunity, insurgent sepoys climbed into the Gubbins building to engage the defenders. They were bayoneted for their trouble, and swarming groups of insurgents just below were kept at bay by hand grenades. Lieutenant Gregor Grant proved particularly adept at lobbing grenades but handled one whose fuse was so short it exploded prematurely. The lieutenant\u2019s hand was blown off, and a nearby officer was wounded. Grant\u2019s hand was amputated, but he died from the effects of the wound.\n\nSome of the heaviest fighting that torrid July day came from around the area on the Innes post, a house on the northwest side of the compound once owned by Lieutenant McLeod Innes. A mixed group defended the post, including loyal sepoys of the 13th Native Infantry, some soldiers of the 32nd Foot, and civilian volunteers such as Ruutz-Rees.\n\nAt one point Ruutz-Rees recalled, \u201cOur men, seeing the rebels swarming thick as bees, and nothing but one sea of heads and glittering weapons before them, thought of retreat.\u201d The commander of this post was Lieutenant Loughnan of the 32nd Foot. \u201cGive a shout, my boys, a loud and strong one!\u201d he said. The men complied, lustily yelling with all of their might, \u201cHurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\u201d\n\nThe insurgents, almost as if on cue, suddenly stopped dead in their tracks. It seems the mutineers thought that the long awaited relief column had finally arrived. The column had not arrived, but the pause gave the defenders renewed courage and perhaps a laugh. Momentarily checked, the rebel advance began again, and some managed to get to the base of a wall where the defenders\u2019 gunfire could not reach them.\n\nInsurgent attacks were accompanied by drums, bugle calls, and fierce exhortations by their leaders to kill the Europeans. Yet in all the excitement they had forgotten to bring scaling ladders. \u201cBring the ladders!\u201d the insurgents shouted in their native tongue over the din of battle. Parties of three brought scaling ladders, but in so doing they came within range of defender muskets.\n\nThe soldiers and civilians poured a surprisingly accurate fire on the ladder bearers, and as one fell dead or wounded, the other two dropped their burden and retreated with their stricken comrade. The scaling parties decided to forego the use of ladders and simply climb the ramparts. Some of them did succeed in getting to the top but were quickly bayoneted for their trouble.\n\nSince the Innis post defenders lacked hand grenades, and numbers of insurgents still huddled at the base of the wall, they improvised a solution. They threw bricks and mortar and other missiles of an impure nature\u2014perhaps bottles of urine or beef entrails\u2014at the heads of their attackers and quickly dislodged them.\n\nAs July turned to August hopes for relief started to fade. \u201cAs for death it stares one constantly in the face,\u201d wrote Ruutz-Rees. \u201cNot daily, not hourly, but minute after minute, second after second, my life, and every other\u2019s, is in jeopardy. Balls fall at our feet, and we continue the conversation without a remark; bullets graze our very hair, and we never speak of them.\u201d\n\nThere was enough food to stave off starvation, but nothing more. Bartum recalled the rations included flour, rice, peas, salt, and meat. Rees noted in his dairy that the beef ration was usually studded with flies. \u201cThese scamps flew into my mouth, or tumble into the plate, and float about in it, impromptu peppercorns,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the underground rooms, conditions grew worse by the day. Vermin multiplied, and women and children crawled with lice, which the women called \u201clight infantry.\u201d Rats and mice scurried about, and at night their scampering over faces interrupted many a victim\u2019s fitful sleep. By July the monsoon season was in full swing, but the rains brought more misery than comfort. The air might momentarily freshen, but then the dampness produced a stultifying humidity that sapped strength and weakened resolve.\n\nAugust was ruefully dubbed the \u201cMonth of Mines\u201d because the insurgents persisted in trying to blow up the defenders with subterranean explosives. Men on sentry duty were told to listen for the sounds of digging, and it got so that enemy tunneling became kind of a grim joke. \u201cSo hurrah, my friend, for a celestial trip in the air!\u201d as one defender laughingly told Ruutz-Rees.\n\nThe defenders were fortunate to have a resourceful engineer in their midst. Captain Peter Fulton sought out enemy tunnels before they could be finished and planted with mines, a job he performed with considerable success. The defenders dug shafts as deep as 30 feet. After that, they tunneled horizontally to carve out galleries in the direction of the enemy\u2019s tunnels. Luckily, the soil in the Lucknow area was firm, so little or no shoring up was needed, and the tunnels were short enough not to need ventilation.\n\nAccompanied by a devoted Sikh assistant who carried blasting powder, Fulton would find insurgent tunnels then blow them up. One time he actually broke into a rebel tunnel while the workers were digging. The sudden appearance of the Englishman so surprised the enemy miners that they fled immediately. It was also fortunate that the 32nd Foot hailed from Cornwall because the men had ample experience in mining in their native region.\n\nThe long-awaited rescue came on September 27 when a relief column under Maj. Gen. Henry Havelock and Maj. Gen. James Outram arrived in Lucknow. It had been more than 12 weeks since the siege began, and the defenders were beginning to lose hope. The doors of the battered Bailey Guard Gate, entrance to the Residency compound, were thrown open to allow the Highlanders, Madras Fusiliers, and turbaned Sikhs to enter.\n\n\u201cOh, what welcome! What joy!\u201d exclaimed defender Henry Metcalfe. \u201cComrades shaking hands \u2026 and rough soldiers embracing and kissing little ones.\u201d The elation was genuine, but the rescue was more apparent than real.\n\nA third of the relief force had been killed or wounded during the arduous march, and soon the British found they did not have enough men to fully break the siege. The relief force ended up reinforcing the original garrison but little more. The first siege had lasted 87 days; the second would be another 61 days.\n\nThe Lucknow Residency was finally relieved in November 1857 by troops under Lt. Gen. Sir Colin Campbell. Not wanting to be trapped as his predecessor Havelock had been, Campbell evacuated the Residency in a general retreat that took place over several days. The mutineers were not even aware of the withdrawal until it was too late. The British returned to Lucknow the following year.\n\nThe British Union Jack British had flown day and night during the siege, shot torn and tattered, but still defying its enemies. As a special dispensation, unique in the British Empire, a British flag continued to fly there until Indian independence in 1947.\n\nBack to the issue this appears in"}, {"url": "https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2015/07/letters-from-the-siege-of-lucknow.html", "page_content": "A recent donation to the India Office Private Papers, held at the British Library, gives a fascinating insight into the siege of Lucknow in 1857. Robert Loveday Inglis, a young soldier with the Bengal Army, wrote a series of letters during the siege which formed a kind of journal of life during the struggle for survival at the British Residency in Lucknow during the uprising against British rule in India.\n\nRobert was born in Simla on 14 March 1839 to John Inglis and Louisa Maria Loveday. The family had a tradition of military service in India. Robert\u2019s grandfather on his mother\u2019s side Lambert Richard Loveday was a Lieutenant General in the Bengal Army, and his father John also served in the Bengal Army in Afghanistan, and at various posts around northern India. In November 1856, Robert was accepted as a cadet in the East India Company\u2019s army. He served with the 13th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry during the siege.\n\nFrom General views and special points of interest of the city of Lucknow from drawings made on the spot by Lieut. Col. D.S. Dodgson, with descriptive notices (London, 1860). Images Online\n\nRobert\u2019s letters date from 14 September to 20 November 1857, and are addressed to his mother, who was then at Calcutta. Robert writes about his experiences, the long periods of boredom punctuated by bursts of intense fighting, the lack of food, the plight of the wounded, the horrors of war, and thoughts of his family.\n\nIn one letter dated 16 September, he recalls his shock on first visiting the hospital: \u201cI had no idea the number of our wounded was so great. The beds were all arranged side by side down both sides of a long narrow room. Every here and there you would see some poor fellows with only the stump of their legs or arms\u201d. However, he goes on to comment that he had become in some sense used to the sight of death: \u201cSince then I have seen a great deal of death and though not by any means indifferent, yet I have become so accustomed to it that my feelings now are not the same, at any rate I don\u2019t feel the same awe on passing a death bed as I used to\u201d.\n\nPhoto 32/12 Residency building after the siege Images Online\n\nRobert described many instances of fighting, but was also given to examining the psychological effects of war on him. In killing as many of the enemy as he could, he wondered if he was motivated more by a natural feeling of revenge than by a stern sense of duty, and worried about the brutalising effect of war, confessing to a feeling of triumph when he had succeeded in killing any of the enemy or witnessed them being blown up by a mine.\n\nRobert was wounded shortly before the siege ended, and died in Allahabad on 27 December 1857. His letters were carefully preserved by his family, and were passed down the generations. They were kindly donated to the British Library by Christie Taylor, Robert being her great great uncle.\n\nJohn O\u2019Brien\n\nIndia Office Records\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nLetters written during the siege of Lucknow by Robert Loveday Inglis (1839-1857), Bengal Army, to his mother Louisa Maria Loveday at Calcutta (1857) [Mss Eur F693/1]\n\nUnpublished book by Christie Taylor \"Letters Home of Robert Loveday Inglis\" (2011) [Mss Eur F693/3]"}, {"url": "https://www.thesocialhistorian.com/siege-of-lucknow/", "page_content": "By 1857, India was all but ruled by the East India Company who traded from India on behalf of the British government, their authority was enforced by the army with some 45,000 British soldiers and another 230,000 Indian Sepoys. Even as British infrastructure expanded in India with a network of roads, railways and telegraph lines, the British also sought to convert the Hindu natives to Christianity, meeting with considerable resistance. The Hindu Sepoys were generally proud to serve in the army but were not prepared to abandon their religious beliefs and customs for the British ways.\n\nWhen the Indian Mutiny began on 10 May 1857 in the north of India in the town of Meerut, the violence took the British by surprise. The Indian Sepoys had been issued with the new Enfield rifles and in order to load the new guns, they had to bite off the end of the cartridge before loading the shot into the rifle. The problem was that these new cartridges were lubricated with animal fat, both cow, sacred to the Hindus and pork, an insult to the Muslims and the Sepoys would not use them.\n\nOn the evening before the mutiny commenced, 85 Sepoys, court-martialed for refusing to touch the cartridges, were sentenced to between five and ten years in prison and were placed in goal in Meerut, about 40 miles from Delhi. The following afternoon, the Sepoy prisoners were broken out of gaol and the mob, consisting of both Sepoys and civilians, descended on the British and massacred them, hacking them to death. The rebel mob then left Meerut on horseback, making for Delhi, some 40 miles distant. The hostilities, which came to be known as the Indian Mutiny to the British but as the First War of Independence to the Indians, would continue for more than two years before ending with the fall of Gwalior on 20 June 1858.\n\nFor the wives of the British officers who were stationed in India, the initial reports from Meerut inspired absolute terror. It was reported that few were spared in the savage attack and that the victims of the rebels included Mrs. Chambers, a pregnant woman whose unborn baby was ripped from her womb and Mrs. Dawson, who was burnt to death. After the massacre at Meerut, large numbers of British civilians began to make their way to the Residency in Lucknow. Under the leadership of Sir Henry Lawrence, the British Commissioner, the Residence was fortified, and supplies were stockpiled in preparation for a possible siege of Lucknow.\n\nMrs. Maria Vincent Germon, wife of one of the commanders of an outpost at Lucknow, first heard of the horrible news from Meerut when she dined at the home of the Brigade-Major of Lucknow. On Friday, 15 May 1857, she wrote in her diary:\n\n.it was rather alarming for one living alone as I was, my husband being on city duty. Mr. B\u2014 walked home with me about half-past 8, at 9 I went to bed, taking good care to have a shawl and dressing gown close to the bed. Charlie\u2019s orderly slept in the verandah with the servants, as he had done all the week; the B\u2014-\u2018s had kindly offered me a bed, but I had declined it. I had one door, as usual, open close to the bedroom at which the punkah-wallah pulled the punkah the other two were sleeping by him; the watchman, bearer, orderly, and two doggies, forming quite a guard around the door; the Ayah and her child slept in a room adjoining; and, not withstanding the alarm, I think I never slept sounder in my life. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nThe following morning, Maria Germon dispatched her husband\u2019s meals for the day as usual, the fare consisting of bread and butter, quail, mango-fool and some vegetables and sat in the garden to enjoy her coffee, despite the news of the prior day. That morning, she went into the city, visiting with other families and found that everyone was much distressed at the recent news and that the Residency in the city was being transformed into a sanctuary for ladies and the sick. Becoming increasingly nervous, Maria visited her husband and asked if she could remain with him but he sent her home after calming her. That night when she retired, she armed herself with a dagger which she called an Affghan knife but eventually drifted to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, she arose as usual and set off for church after dispatching her husband\u2019s provisions and observed seven companies of the 32nd Queens entering the military camp. There was much activity that day with troops coming and going and rumours flew back and forth amongst the families. Maria was invited to spend the night with friends but eventually declined. Her husband\u2019s Subadar had sent his salaam and two Sepoys to guard her house and the idea of having Sepoys as guards unnerved her a little but after checking with the Adjutant, she acquiesced to the guards and rested well that night.\n\nBy the following day, Monday, the houses around the Germon residence had been given over to the European soldiers that had recently arrived, forming a guard and the night again passed without incident. Tuesday, reports of atrocities at Meerut and Delhi began to arrive and residents were in quite a state of excitement and unease but that afternoon Maria and Charlie took their usual drive and saw the band playing at the band-stand but few others were driving about. They retired for the evening, Charlie with his double-barreled gun loaded with shot and Maria with her Affghan dagger.\n\nOn Thursday, their Doctor arrived in a buggy with his wife and child, requesting that they be taken in for the night since he feared that there would be a rise. With the guests settled, an alarm of fire was raised and they ran outside to see that flames engulfed the bungalow two doors away. Charlie sent their servants to soak the thatched roof of their bungalow so the sparks would not set it alight and armed himself with his shotgun, telling Maria to run for the Residency should their be a rise but after a time, the flames subsided and nothing more happened. They retired for the night, the danger seemingly past.\n\nThe lull continued until Monday, 25 May 1857 when Charlie was summoned at 3 AM by Sir Henry Lawrence, the Commander, who ordered that all ladies should leave the cantonments and go to the Residency for protection. Maria gathered her belongings, taking her valuables and coffee and provisions, and clambered aboard the carriage of friends. They passed many other carriages filled with ladies and children all heading for the Residence.\n\nOn arrival, the Residency was crowded with ladies and children and they went to see if they could lodge with Doctor Frayrer, whose house was in the grounds of the Residency. Maria, along another lady shared their hostess\u2019s room; three beds under one punkah. The heat was intense and they could not sleep well. During the days, they met at breakfast, then amused themselves with work, reading or music, lunched at 2 and dined at half-past 7. The Padre gave a reading in the evening, they prayed and then retired for the night. Although they shared a room at the Frayrer\u2019s, it was much better than at the Residency where each room was filled with six or eight ladies and their children, their servants crowded onto the verandas.\n\nOn Saturday, 30 May, Maria went to Cantonments and enjoyed both some time with her husband and a luxurious bath, although Charlie fretted that she remained in Cantonments longer than was allowed, but finally she departed and the evening was spent as usual until at about 9 pm, the servants came running in with reports of firing coming from the direction of Cantonments. Rushing outside, they could indeed hear gunfire and could see several fires blazing. Doctor Frayrer ordered the ladies to don their bonnets and to go to the Residency. They gathered what belongings they could carry and met in the dining room to await further orders but finally word was received that although there had been a rising, the rebels had been defeated and fled. They all went to lie down, still dressed in their clothes with their bundles ready, in case of further alarm.\n\nIt was with a great relief that Maria learned that Charlie was all right. He had ridden up with a dispatch from Sir Henry. Although his trousers were soaked in blood to the knee, it was not his but his horse who had been shot in the nose.\n\nIt was the following day, Sunday 31 May, when an order came again for all the ladies to proceed to safety for a rising was expected in the city. They collected their bundles once again and walked in the blazing sun to the crowded Residency where they remained in a miserable state all day: crowded, hot, thirsty and hungry for much of the day. The heat and crowding were so intense in the house that at nightfall, Maria and several other ladies took their bedding up on the roof to sleep in the cool of the night. In the moonlight, they could see the great guns of the compound immediately below them and the moon and stars were in stark contrast to the scene below.\n\nOn Monday, just as Maria was trying to decide where she might find a small corner in which to dress herself, Dr. Frayrer sent word that they might go back to his house which he thought safer than the residency with its overcrowding. Maria took a bath and slept that night in a thick dressing gown until awakened by a slight alarm. She partially dressed and lay down again until morning. The following day passed quietly but on Wednesday they heard that the Commander-in-Chief had died of cholera at Umballah and that Dr. Frayrer\u2019s brother had been killed by insurgents. Two husbands of the women had also been killed. One left a widow and seven children; another a new bride. Reports continued to come in of other Sepoy regiments who had joined the mutiny and it was reported that Colonel Birch, the commandant of the 41st had been shot by his men, his daughter captured by the fugitives.\n\nOne of the women that Maria visited lost her baby and she described her narrow escape on the night of the mutiny in the Cantonments:\n\n\u2026she was down there with all her children, although Sir H L had forbidden ladies to be there at night. She told me, she and the Major were in bed when a Havildar came rushing in, begging her to fly, for the Sepoys were up in the Lines, and immediately after the mutineers came to the house and asked for the Sahib and Mem-Sahib; she fled with her five children, escorted by three friendly Sepoys, first into the servants\u2019 houses, but the bullets came whistling so thick that the Sepoys cut a hole in the mudwall for her to escape at the back. They fled to a village, but the villagers came out and threatened to take their lives if they remained, so they went and took refuge in a dry nullah (a bed of a stream); it was about fifteen or twenty feet deep, so that they had to sit and slide down the bank; the Sepoys lay down on the bank and watched; her poor baby had dysentery, and had nothing on but its night-clothes: no wonder it died a day or two after; but then, she ought not to have been in Cantonments.

C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nAs the days went on, more reports of atrocities too \u2018barbarous and inhuman to be mentioned\u2019 reached Lucknow. The doggies that had lived at their house in Cantonments were without anyone to care for them and it was agreed that they had to be put down which made Maria feel quite wretched and Charlie drowned them in the river. As the horrific reports of massacres and death continued, the defenses at Lucknow were strengthened. Several mortars and two 18-pounders were placed at Cawnpore road. Rumours and alerts of imminent attack continued but came to nothing. Smallpox broke out in the crowded Residency and Maria was relieved to be away from there. On Sunday 21 June, came the first fall of rain and it was welcomed.\n\nI went down with Mrs. F\u2014- to her go-down (store-room) and saw all her stores in case of a siege \u2013 rice and flour \u2013 all in large earthen jars, that reminded one of the jars the thieves were put into in Ali Baba. Certain new reached us today that the enemy are closing around us; there are eight regiments with six guns at Nawab-Gunge, twenty miles from here; it is said that they intend coming here, and encamping in the Dil Koosha.

C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nOn Tuesday, 30 June, Maria wrote:\n\nhe siege now commenced, the enemy began firing on us as they followed the retreating party. Our gates were closed, we got a cup of tea and something for breakfast as best we could, sitting behind the walls to escape the balls; not that I fancy any of us had very much appetite. At last the balls came so thick that we were all ordered down into the Tye Khana (underground room), and kept there. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nIt was Thursday, 2 July when word came that Sir Henry Lawrence had been mortally wounded. A shell had burst in his room at the Residency and he had a fearful wound in his hip. He survived long enough to be given the last Sacrament at Dr. Frayrer\u2019s house where he lingered for another two days. Shelling intensified. When they awoke in the Tye Khana on Friday morning, they found that all of the servants but a few had deserted and were obliged to do the chores themselves even washing plates and dishes, which at least had the fortune of distracting them from their misery.\n\nOn Saturday, 11 July, Maria slipped down some steps and sprained her ankle. Funerals continued for those killed by the shelling and those who died of the cholera and smallpox. By the 13 July, Maria\u2019s face broke out in boils as were the faces of the others, from the effects of scurvy. On the 15 July they gathered on the veranda and sang, but Maria felt the melancholy with the \u2018round shots whizzing overhead, and no one could tell but that the next might bring death with it!\u2018\n\nA letter arrived from the Quartermaster-General on 26 July, saying that two-thirds of the relieving force had crossed the Ganges and would soon come to the relief of those under siege in Lucknow.\n\nI was awoke by a mouse running over my neck, scratching me with its horrid little feet. Still no news! Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nOn Thursday, 6 August an order came to vacate the Residency since it was now unsafe and on Tuesday 11 August, they heard a rumbling noise and found out that one wing of the Residency had fallen, burying six men. Two had been dug out alive but only one survived.\n\nWe passed the night without an accident, though the roof was hit by round shots. Mrs. F\u2014-\u2018s little boy Bobby very ill. he looks a perfect skeleton: as for Mrs. D\u2014\u2013\u2018s youngest boy, you can count his bones; they are only just covered with skin. it is a terrible time for poor children; they pine for fresh air. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nOn Wednesday, 19 August, one of the children died.\n\nAfter breakfast Mrs. D\u2014-\u2018s poor baby was sewed up by Mrs.\u2014\u2013 in a clean table cloth, she having first dressed it in a clean night-dress and lace cap, and crossed its little arms on its breast; the little thing was carried to the hospital to await its burial, at night. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nAttacks came day and night and they never knew when a shell would land in the house, killing them. They suffered on, doing their own cooking with their meagre rations and laundry when they could get enough water.\n\nhe guns of our force heard approaching nearer and nearer. Oh! the thankfulness one feels at the certainty of relief now! I think, if I were stronger, I should be more joyous. The smoke of the guns seen from the top of the Residency! Oh joy! they say they are only four or five miles off! but they have to fight their way in! Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nPrices for supplies were rising with sugar demanding twenty rupees for 2 pounds and one rupee per leaf of tobacco. By mid-September their provisions were running low and rumours circulated that they would run out of beef by the middle of October. The siege had been going on for eighty days. Finally on 24 September they heard guns about ten or twelve miles off and knew that their reinforcements had arrived.\n\nThe guns of our force heard approaching nearer and nearer.

The news they brought from the outside was heartrending and far more horrible than imagined.\n\nAt Jhansi the brutes had burnt the children before their poor mothers\u2019 eyes, and then killed the wives, and then the husbands. At Cawnpore they found only two living beings and a heap of dead women and children, being those who escaped the massacre at the boats. They say the place where the murders were committed was a most heart-rending sight; not a soldier left it with a dry eye. We heard also of the B\u2014-s\u2019 of our regiment having been murdered at Hissar. Ever one was trying to get news of his friends; scarcely one but heard bad news. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nMaria was dismayed to find that the relief troops brought no new provisions with them, but their numbers made it possible to make sorties against the enemy again and the discovery and destruction of three rebel mines boosted everyone\u2019s confidence. The troops gained ground daily in the City against the rebels, blowing up some of the guns that had been bombarding them with shells. But the unvaried diet was taking its toll on the group.\n\nDear Charlie came quite lame \u2013 the doctors say we must all get scurvy, living on the same food, and so long without vegetables. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nWednesday, October 7 marked the anniversary of Maria\u2019s arrival in Calcutta and although the relief troops were pushing back the rebels, an 18-pound shot came in to mark the day. Shots still reached the house daily, sometimes two or three, keeping them all on edge. Two days later a report was received from Cawnpore with the great news that Delhi had been taken by their forces but with a warning that several regiments of the rebels and escaped with guns and were headed to Lucknow, pursued by a large force intent on intercepting them. By the 11th, they had overtaken the mutineers, killing some and dispersing the rest. The new reinforcements were expected to reach Lucknow in less than two weeks, but six days later, new intelligence was received that although the 93rd were to be at Cawnpore on the 23rd, the 23rd were not to arrive until the 2nd of November. Maria worried:\n\nI trust they will not delay it too long; for, famine is too horrible to contemplate. Our daily rations of meat are now 12 oz. for a man, 6 oz. for a woman, and 2 oz. for a child and this is bone inclusive, which is sometimes nearly half; and we have had 9 lbs. (the ration for our party for one day) of which 5 lbs. was actually bone. Then seventeen of us (some choosing to have their rations separate) have 15 lbs. of unsifted flour for our chuppatties, 6 lbs. of grain to be made into dal (this private store food, generally given to horses), 1 lb. 12 oz. of rice, and a little salt. We generally make a stew of the meat and rice and a few chuppatties, as it goes further; but I think the gentlemen generally get up from the table hungry. We have still a little tea, but neither sugar, milk, wine, nor beer; our beverage is toast and water, a large jug of which is always placed on the centre of the table; it is made of the old chuppatties, if an are left of the previous day. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nWednesday, 21 October marked Maria and Charles\u2019 anniversary and despite the circumstances, they contrived a few hours together in the evening. Charlie had managed a pint bottle of champagne and with some milk begged from one place, some sugar from another and a little cocoa that had been saved, Maria made a cup of hot chocolate to celebrate the occasion.\n\nFinally on Monday, 26 October they heard the news they had been waiting for. The Delhi column had defeated the Mhow mutineers and 6000 troops were on their way, and should arrive by the 15 November. Maria noted that they had to cut their rations yet again, and hoped that the three weeks would pass quickly.\n\nOn Thursday, 12 November, Maria spent the day with Charlie, arranging and packing all their belongings, in case the troops arrived and they needed to depart in a hurry. On Saturday, 14 November, the reinforcements took possession of the Kil Doosha and Martiniere. They were almost at the house. On Monday, 16 November, Maria and Charlie and a group of spectators watched from the roof of Charlie\u2019s house as the Cavalry and the Artillery took two enemy guns. The battle raged through the day as they watched their troops advance.\n\nIn the evening on Tuesday, 17 November, Dr. Frayrer came and told them:\n\nAll ladies, and the sick and wounded, are to be out of the garrison before tomorrow night, and can only take what they can carry in their hands. Germon, R. C. \u2018A Lady\u2019s Diary During the Siege of Lucknow.\u2019 Google Books. 1870.\n\nWith the end suddenly in sight, Maria felt panicked and after a sleepless night, she rushed over to tell Charlie the news. She stitches her valuables into her clothes and by dinner time, Charlie had found two old men who could carry a bundle of bedding and Maria\u2019s dressing-case. At the last, Charlie sent word that she was to have the Subadar\u2019s mare to ride. On Thursday, their departure delayed, preparations continued and Maria dressed in all the clothes that she could.\n\nI put on three of each kind of under garments \u2013 a pink flannel dressing-gown, and plaid jacket, and then over all my cloth dress and jacket made out of my habit. I then tied my Cashmere shawl round my waist, and also Charlie\u2019s silver mug, and put on a a worsted cap and hat, and had my cloak placed on the saddle; in my pink dressing gown, I stitched dear mamma\u2019s last present to me, and I filled several pockets with valuables also; in two under ones I had all my little stock of jewelry, and my journal, and some valuable papers. I also wore a bustle, in which I had stitched my Honiton lace wedding dress, veil, &c and two black and white lace shawls; so that I was a pretty good size. Germon, R.

Mutiny broke out on 30 May in the 13th, 48th and 71st Bengal Native Infantry stationed in the cantonment some four miles from the city. They were driven out by the 32nd Regiment of Foot though a number of Europeans were killed.\n\nNews came on 30 June that rebel forces were gathering north of Lucknow. Lawrence set out to meet them with the 32nd Regiment and remaining loyal elements of the Native Regiments. At the Battle of Chinhut numbers of sepoys defected and the force was compelled to retreat to Lucknow where the siege proper began. Lawrence was wounded and died on 4 July being succeeded by Brigadier John Inglis.\n\nAt the end of July Maj-Gen Henry Havelock attempted to relieve the city from Cawnpore but was forced to retire due to lack of forces. In September Maj-Gen Sir James Outram with reinforcements took command at Cawnpore and mounted a relief expedition under Havelock who drove the rebels from their strongpoint at the Battle of Alambagh. Havelock fought his way through to the Residency but it proved impossible to evacuate the sick and non-combatants. He therefore remained besieged while a small force occupied the Alambagh.\n\nIndian Mutiny 1857-58 The British Empire website\n\nSiege of Lucknow Wikipedia\n\nThe Story of the Lucknow Residency Google Books\n\nWilliam Oxenham's VC Wikipedia\n\nRobert Aitken's VC Wikipedia\n\nDenis Dempsey's VC Wikipedia\n\nHenry Gore-Browne's VC Wikipedia\n\nThomas Duffy's VC Wikipedia\n\nGeorge Lambert's VC Wikipedia\n\nAbraham Boulger's VC Wikipedia\n\nPatrick Mylott's VC Wikipedia\n\nJames Thompson's VC Wikipedia\n\nSamuel Lawrence's VC Wikipedia\n\nWilliam Dowling's VC Wikipedia\n\nLucknow, Uttar Pradesh Wikipedia\n\nHistorical books online\n\nA Personal Journal of the Siege of Lucknow by Capt R P Anderson 1858\n\nA Personal Narrative of the Siege of Lucknow by L E Ruutz Rees 1858\n\nThe defence of Lucknow: a diary recording the daily events during the siege of the European Residency by at Staff Officer 1858 (Google Books)\n\nA Memoir, Letters, and Diary of the Rev.

It had all the dramatic elements of a siege and even better, a happy ending. It became indeed a paradigm for later British colonial conflicts. There were the initial reverses, the spectacle of the \u2018thin red line\u2019 battling against overwhelming odds, heroism in the face of adversity, the stoicism of the ladies living in appalling conditions, the death of a gallant commander, finally the sound of bagpipes on the wind and a relief column marching into the British position with flags flying and kilted highlanders leading the way. It was said the news of the relief was sent in the shape of a Latin sentence that when translated read, \u201cI am in luck, now.\u201d\n\nLucknow, on the banks of the River Gomti, was the capital of Oudh. The state, annexed the year before in a move, which caused great resentment amongst the Indians, was ready to rise and Lucknow itself was full of the hangers-on of the old regime who were eager to reverse their recent dispossession. Henry Lawrence who, with his brother John, had recently worked wonders in the Punjab governed it. Lawrence knew the dangers of the British position in Lucknow and when mutiny swept through Oudh not long after the events at Meerut, he was reasonably well prepared. He decided to make his stand inside the Residency compound and unlike Wheeler at Cawnpore he fortified it strongly. Into this 33 acre refuge Lawrence gathered the entire European community of Lucknow and a garrison of about 1,700 men. Half the defending force were sepoys who had remained loyal to the British.\n\nThe only formed \u2018unit of British troops\u2019 were the 32nd (Cornwall) Regiment, under the command of Colonel Inglis. Inside the Residency compound there were nine separate buildings and a high mud-wall strengthened by earthworks formed the perimeter. Lawrence had prepared the position as much as possible. Trenches and gun pits had been dug, wire-entanglements laid out and booby traps set. Unfortunately, the Residency was almost in the centre of the city. On its eastern side stood the old palace of the kings of Oudh. To the north flowed the river. All round, however, were the narrow streets and lanes of the old city sometimes coming up to the very walls of the compound itself.\n\nThe defence of Lucknow 1857\n\nWhen the mutiny broke out in Lucknow toward the end of June, the sepoys did try to storm the walls but were always beaten back. Twice they breached the perimeter and British sallies to regain lost ground or eliminate strong points near the walls became necessary and commonplace. As at Cawnpore, the main problem was the constant barrage of artillery and musket fire that the mutineers were able to pour into the compound. One of the first shells killed Lawrence when it crashed into the billiard room in which he was staying. On being asked if he was hurt, he replied, \u201cI am killed.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just then, but he died two days later. His death was a great blow to the British and a creeping fatalism began to spread through the Residency. Command passed to Colonel Inglis.\n\nA further misery was soon added to the sniping, the shelling and the direct assaults on the perimeter \u2013 the sepoys began tunnelling. Trying to undermine the walls, the charges the sepoys detonated sometimes exploded well inside the compound. The 32nd were forced to counter-mine and some of the fiercest battles of the siege were fought deep in the hot clammy earth with pistols, shovels and fists. Many of the Cornishmen were former tin miners, who were used to working underground. Their experience overcame resulted in the failure of the mutineers to enter the Garrison. Sorties were mounted by volunteers to destroy the threat of the guns, the most famous of which was by Captain Bernand McCabe.\n\nCaptain Bernard McCabe\u2019s sortie at Lucknow\n\nFood started to run short, the casualties started to mount, rats swarmed everywhere and the July sun burned down on the now filthy, hungry and dispirited defenders. In the middle of August, a message reached Lucknow that told of a relief force beginning its march. Four days, the note promised, would see an end to their troubles. Welcome news indeed as the garrison had been reduced to 350 British soldiers and 300 loyal sepoys, with over 550 women, children, sick and wounded to look after. The four days came and went with no sign of any assistance. The days became weeks and still no-one came.\n\nFinally, 90 days after the siege began, gunfire was heard on the outskirts of the city. Two days later, on September 25th, a mob rather than an army burst into the residency. The lead troops were highlanders and in their furious push into the Residency they bayoneted a few loyal sepoys by mistake. The highlanders\u2019 uniforms were ragged and patched and their bearded faces were grimy with the smoke of powder. They were under the joint command of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram and had fought a gruelling campaign up from Cawnpore. Unfortunately, there were only a thousand of them and no sooner had the Residency gates closed behind them than the siege continued. Now at least the fear of the mutineers exploiting a breach in the wall had been considerably reduced, but the extra mouths to feed placed an almost intolerable burden on the already over-stretched commissary department. The bombardments and the mining continued and everything started to run out. Doctors had no more medicines to give the sick and wounded. The rations became smaller every day and it seemed as if Havelock and Outram\u2019s gallant march might have been in vain after all. Once again eyes and ears were strained for signs of relief. Throughout it all, the Union Jack, which flew from the Residency roof, was never taken down, as custom dictated it should each evening. Day and night it hung limply from the flagpole \u2013 a symbol of British defiance.\n\nThe Residency in Lucknow\n\nAnd then in October word came that another force was on the way. It was led by Sir Colin Campbell, a Crimean War veteran whose Highland Brigade had broken the Russian left flank at the Battle of the Alma and seen off their cavalry at Balaclava. A talented soldier of great courage, he was probably the only senior commander to have survived the Crimean war with his reputation intact. The arrival of the force was imminent. A tall Irish post office worker by the name of Henry Kavanagh came forward and volunteered to slip out of the Residency, make contact with the relief column and guide it back through the city. Kavanagh had gained a reputation for courage in the underground battles of the mines and countermines and his offer was avidly accepted. Wearing Indian clothes and with his face blackened with oil, Kavanagh made his way past sepoy checkpoints, swam the River Gomti and found a British picket. Eight days later he returned and led Havelock and Outram through the streets to a meeting with their rescuer. When the three generals met, surrounded by the cheers of the soldiery, Havelock announced in a singularly un-embellished sentence, \u201cSoldiers, I am glad to see you.\u201d\n\nThe Relief of Lucknow \u2013 November 1857\n\nThe relief force, which included the 53rd (Shropshire) Regiment (later to form part of the KSLI) made no attempt to enter the Residency for its numbers were small. Instead it pacified the city long enough for the inhabitants of the Residency to be withdrawn. On November 18th the withdrawal began with, of course, the women and children leaving first. The city was not completely quiet and much of the withdrawal was made under fire. When the non-combatants were safe, the garrison left. It was no proud march past and the soldiers broke step to disguise their leaving. Finally the rearguard slipped out and the Residency and city of Lucknow were given up to the mutineers. The British remembered to take down the Residency flag before they left.\n\nThe whole force now made its way back to Cawnpore and safety. With their going the mutiny sputtered out into a sordid series of punitive hunts and guerrilla engagements. Lucknow was retaken the following year and though sporadic fighting continued into 1859, with the relief of the Residency the mutiny was effectively over and it was only a matter of time before the British re-established themselves as rules of the north of India.\n\nIn recognition of the gallantry of the 32nd at Lucknow, the following statement was issued from Buckingham Palace on 14th May 1858: \u201cHer Majesty Queen Victoria, in consideration of the enduring gallantry displayed in the defence of Lucknow, has been pleased to direct the 32nd be clothed, equipped and trained as a Light Infantry regiment\u201d. Although there had been \u2018light troops\u2019 in the British Army in the 1740s, such as the Highlanders at Fontenoy (1745), it was the colonial war between France and England in North America which established the concept of \u2018Light Infantry\u2019 in the British Army.\n\nIn the North American Wars of the 1750s, the heavy equipment, conspicuous red and white uniforms and close formation fighting of the British Army proved to be wholly unsuitable when operating in close country against Indians and French colonists, who had highly developed field-craft and marksmanship skills.\n\nFrom the formation of the Earl of Huntingdon\u2019s Regiment, in 1685, through to present day operations, the Light Infantry and its antecedent Regiments have distinguished themselves in often untold honour."}, {"url": "https://glosters.tripod.com/IM3.htm", "page_content": "Indian Mutiny 1857-9\n\nBRITISH INFANTRY REGIMENTS :\n\n1/5th Foot - Northumberland Fusiliers\n\nMajor James Egbert Simmons - Killed in action at Lucknow - 29th September 1857\n\nMemorial at St. James Church, Churchill, Avon - \"James Egbert T.

The same afternoon intelligence was received from Futtepore that sepoy mutineers of the Dinapore Regiment, with three guns, had passed the Jumma with the intention of either attacking Futtehpore or crossing over into Oude. The camp was immediately struck, and we arrived at the camping ground of Futtehpore at midnight.\n\n\n\nColonel Powell then made arrangements for marching at daylight upon the enemy, who were reported to be about 24 miles distant at Khujwa, beyond the village of Binkee (Bindki). The column of attack consisted of 162 men of HM 53rd Regt., under Major Clarke, 68 of the Royal Engineers under Captain Clerke, 70 of a depot detachment under Lieutenant Fanning of HM 64th Regt., and 103 of the Naval Brigade under Captain Peel. It marched at daylight and was joined from the garrison of Futtehpore by a company of the 93rd Highlanders, 100 in number, under Captain Cornwall, and two 9-pounder guns under Lieutenant Anderson, Bengal Artillery.\n\n\n\nAfter marching for 16 miles the column halted for refreshment, and then resumed the march at a rapid pace, passing through the village of Binkee at about 1-30pm, where the intelligence was confirmed that the enemy was at hand. The troops pressed on without interruption; the Highlanders advancing in skirmishing order, supported by the Royal Engineers and followed by the 53rd Regt. in column, and then by the Naval Brigade. The depot detachment was with the baggage. We advanced along the road which led straight for the village of Khujwa, and saw that the enemy's right occupied a long line of high embankment on our left of the road, which embankment, screened by a grove, continued towards the village; and that their left was higher up on the other side, with their guns posted in the centre on the road - two of them in advance, and one on a bridge near the village.\n\n\n\nA round shot coming down the road coming down the road opened the battle at about 2.20pm, and the column was ordered to edge to the right and advance on the guns through the cornfields - the skirmishers of the 93rd and the Royal Engineers pushing on both sides of the road. The enemy's artillery was well served and did great execution, and the flank fire of the musketry was very severe. The gallant Colonel Powell, himself on the left of the road, pressed on the attack, and had just secured two guns of the enemy, when he fell dead with a bullet through his forehead.\n\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, the Naval Brigade had advanced on the right of the 53rd and carried the enemy's position in their front. It was then that the death of Colonel Powell was reported to me, and I was requested to assume command.\n\n\n\nThe great force of the enemy, the long line of their defences, and the exhaustion of both officers and men after such long marches, rendered our position truly critical. The front of the battle had become changed to the line of the road, and the enemy, with all their force behind their embankments, threatened to intercept our rear. I left Lieutenant Hay, RN., supported by the two 9-pdr. guns, to hold the position which his party had gallantly carried, and which secured our flank; and collecting as many fresh troops as were available, assisted principally by Lieutenant Lennox, Royal Engineers (Captain Clerke being unfortunately severely wounded), and by Ensign Truill, (who had been promoted to Lieutenant on September 29th) of the 53rd, we rushed across the road, and passing round the upper end of the embankments, divided the enemy's force and drove them successively from all their positions. The enemy then retired in confusion, leaving us masters of their camp and with two of their guns and a tumbrel in our possession.\n\n\n\nThe late hour of the evening (it was half past four when the enemy fired their last shot) and the excessive fatigue of the troops prevented any pursuit; we therefore spoiled their camp and, leaving it with cheers, formed on the road by the bridge near the village and sent out parties to collect our dead and wounded.\n\n\n\nWith the body of the Colonel on the limber of the gun he had so gallantly captured, we then returned and encamped near the village of Binkee. Our loss in the action was very severe, amounting to 95 killed and wounded.\n\n\n\nThe behaviour of the troops and of the Naval Brigade was admirable, and all vied with each other and showed equal courage in the field. The marching of the 53rd and the accurate firing of the Highlanders deserving especial commendation.\n\n\n\nI received the greatest assistance from Captain Cox, HM 75th Regiment., whom I would wish to bring to the favourable notice of H.E. the Commander-in-Chief, and the arrangements of the field hospital under Dr. Grant, HM 53rd, and those of the Quarter-master's Department under Captain Marshall, were everything that I could wish.\n\n\n\nThe total number of the enemy was reported to be about 4,000 men, 2000 of whom were sepoys who fought in their uniform. Their loss was estimated at about 300 killed.\n\n\n\nI have, etc., WILLIAM PEEL, Captain, RN., Commanding\n\n\n\nNAVAL BRIGADE KILLED AND WOUNDED AT KHUJWA ON NOVEMBER 1ST, 1857\n\n\n\n\n\nRank and Name\n\n\n\nEdward Hay.

Gyah, May 6, 1858.\n\nSir,\n\nI deeply regret to inform you of the death of Captain Sir William Peel, KCB, of HMS Shannon, which occurred at Cawnpore on the 27th ult. from small pox.\n\nI have given myself a commission to act as Captain of the Shannon until the pleasure of his Excellency Sir Michael Seymour is known, as I consider the presence of an officer of that rank is necessary with the Brigade.\n\nI have, etc., Jas. W. Vaughan, Act. Captain. Commanding Shannon's Naval Brigade.\n\n\n\nSir William Peel had arrived at Cawnpore on 19th April 1858 and was looked after by Padre Moore and his wife in their home, the old ruins of General Wheeler's bungalow.\n\n\n\nVICTORIA CROSSES WON BY THE SHANNON NAVAL BRIGADE\n\n\n\nCaptain Peel and Edward Daniel had already been awarded VCs in the Crimea, but the Naval Brigade were awarded a further five during the Indian Mutiny. They were to:-\n\nLieutenant Thomas Young; On 16 November 1857 at Lucknow, India, naval guns were brought up close to the Shah Nujeff mosque, and the gun crews kept up a steady fire in an attempt to breach the walls, while a hail of musket balls and grenades from the mutineers inside the mosque caused heavy casualties. Lieutenant Young moved from gun to gun giving encouragement, and when he and Able Seaman Hall were the only survivors, all the rest being killed or wounded, Lieutenant Young took the last gunners place and between them they loaded and fired the gun.\n\nLieutenant Nowell Salmon; For conspicuous gallantry at Lucknow, India, on 16th November 1857, when Captain Peel called for volunteers to climb a tree which was overhanging the wall of the Shah Nujeff, in order to spot the enemy position and to dislodge the mutineers who were throwing bombs and firing on the ground crews below. Lieutenant Salmon and Able Seaman John Harrison responded to the call and succeeded in carrying out this dangerous task. John Harrison was killed and Lieutenant Salmon was fired upon and wounded in the thigh.\n\nLeading Seaman John Harrison; On 16th November 1857 at Lucknow, India, were called for to climb a tree near the wall of the Shah Nujeff mosque in order to spot the enemy's position and then to dislodge the mutineers who were throwing grenades and firing on the gun crews below. Leading Seaman Harrison, together with the Lieutenant Salmon responded to the call and succeeded in performing this dangerous service, but the lieutenant was wounded in the thigh and John Harrison was killed.\n\nAble Seaman Hall; On 16th November, 1857 at Lucknow, India, naval guns were brought up close to the Shah Nujeff Mosque, and the gun crews kept up a steady fire in an attempt to breach the walls, while a hail of musket balls and grenades from the mutineers inside the mosque caused heavy casualties. Able Seaman Hall and Lieutenant Young, in command of the gun crews were, after a time, the only survivors, all the rest having been killed or wounded, and between them they loaded and served the last gun. [Hall, a Canadian, was the first non-white man to win the Victoria Cross]\n\nAble Seaman Edward Robinson; On 13th March 1858 at Lucknow, India, some sandbags on top of the earthworks were on fire. The enemy were only 50 yards away at this time, but able Seaman Robinson, under heavy fire, jumped up and extinguished the fires in some of the bags and threw others clear. He was severely wounded.\n\n\n\nTHE MEMORIAL\n\n\n\nThe officers and crew of HMS Shannon raised \u00a3350 to erect a monument to Sir William Peel and in memory of those who died during the campaign in India. It was the intention that the memorial would stand in front of the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth Dockyard. Originally there was a small gun captured at Lucknow and placed at the base of the monument and presented, as a trophy to the Shannon's Naval Brigade, by Lord Clyde GCB (formerly Sir Colin Campbell).\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\nVolume 7 of William Laird Clowes \"The Royal Navy: a history from the earliest times to the death of Queen Victoria\" contains an account of the contribution of the Naval Brigades to the suppression of the Indian Mutiny.\n\n\n\nThe following web sites contain information about Captain Sir William Peel, third son of Sir Robert Peel, who died at the age of 33 years following a distinguished career, during which he won the Victoria Cross in the assault of the Redan at Sevastopol in the Crimea, before going on to take part in the actions in India:\n\nNational Maritime Museum\n\nThe Sandy Community Web site\n\n\n\nA memorial plaque to Captain William Peel, in the Royal Garrison Church, was destroyed when the church was bombed in 1941.\n\n\n\nIn 2005 the Shannon memorial was moved some 120 metres eastwards along the seafront to make way for an expansion of the hovercraft terminal. There was some debate at this time about the number, provenance and position of the cannon at the base of the memorial. They were originally thought to have come from the Crimean War but this is now in doubt; there is also a possibility that there were originally six cannon, the 1876 image clearly showing four at the corners and possibly one each on the east and west sides.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to Brandon Smith and Jennifer Stringer for providing information for this page]\n\n\n\n"}]}
