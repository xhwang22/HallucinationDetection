The former Miss Michigan and student of marketing and management\u2014who stated a life ambition of establishing a performing arts foundation for disadvantaged children\u2014beat out 50 other contestants for the prestigious honor. Two months later, the six-foot beauty came very close to yet another milestone, when she finished as first runner-up in the Miss Universe pageant.\n\nGist\u2019s Miss USA pageant victory marked a life achievement of rising above obstacles.

But\u2026 my mother couldn\u2019t afford all those things,\u201d she told Ardis Carthane in Jet. Despite such difficulties, however, Gist\u2014who was an honors student in high school\u2014maintained a confident outlook, and today looks at her past as important in building strength. \u201cI do believe that some of the negative things in my childhood are positive for me now. They made me what I am today,\u201d she told Jet, adding, \u201cI had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don\u2019t have to become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home.\u201d\n\nAfter becoming the first black Miss USA, Gist had these words of advice for other ground-breakers: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be the first at something\u2026. You know you don\u2019t have to wait around and wait for someone else to do it. Go for it. Just because someone else hasn\u2019t done it before you \u2026 you never know, you might have what it takes to be the first.\u201d Gist sees her winning the title as another important step in black achievement. As quoted by Carthane, Gist said: \u201cIt\u2019s all a part of taking pride in our [people\u2019s] heritage and culture. \u2026 We are people destined for greatness.

Take a peek into our conversation below.\n\nWhen did you fall in love with the performing arts?\n\nI was seeking attention. I wouldn\u2019t stop singing and dancing around the house and I became my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s entertainment. I remember getting up on the table and singing the song You Are My Starship. My mom saw that in me and got me involved with dance. I danced competitively. When I started to develop muscles not suitable for dance, I had to make the choice to continue dancing or play sports.\n\nHow did you prepare yourself for the Miss USA Pageant?\n\nI took the most unconventional way to get there. I competed in Miss Michigan, so former Miss Michigan wouldn\u2019t ask me to do it anymore. Michigan is not a big pageant state. In other states like Texas and Florida the prize package is significantly larger, almost the same as winning Miss USA. That prize money helps you pay for the car, the trainer, the coach. With the money I got, I could only get coaching for one weekend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI had a moment of doubt when I was in the registration area of Miss USA. I knew there were two other black girls but they weren\u2019t there yet and I felt so out of place. At that moment, someone came around like only your mom can do, so I know it was God sent. They grabbed me and said, \u201caht aht stand up tall, you have a right to be here just like anyone else, you are just as beautiful and talented, you just go out there and let your light shine.\u201d\n\nNegativity and doubt can creep in no matter what you are doing. Don\u2019t let it stay, whatever it is, shut it down and remember who you are.\n\nCarol Gist for the April 2021 BLAC\u00ae Spring Fashion Issue\n\nTell us about your time competing for Miss Universe?\n\nThe Miss Universe competition opened up my eyes. Meeting all the women from different countries, we shared things and worked out language barriers with pictures. We learned that we think the same, we have the same hopes and dreams. It wasn\u2019t a race thing or a nationality thing, it was just a woman thing.\n\nYou went to the Historical Detroit Cass Tech for High School. What did you study?\n\nI was a business administration Major with a performing arts minor. My mother had her own business; she was always working and hustling. I knew I would do something with business but I wanted my creative outlet as well so I was in choir.\n\nYou have spent your time wisely in school. How many Degrees did you achieve?\n\nI have two associates degrees and a dual Bachelor\u2019s degree Management and Marketing/International Business from Northwood University. I received my first Masters Degree in 2014, in Kinesiology in Sports Science. In 2020 I finished my second Masters Degree in Sports Administration. Both Master degrees were received at Wayne State University. My last one will be a PHD and I am seeing what it would take to be a Physical Therapist.\n\nI can\u2019t stay in one spot for too long or doing one thing for too long. I look forward to the next chapters.\n\nYou have held many titles over the last 31 years, can you list them for us?\n\nOf course, I was in:\n\nHotel Restaurant Management,\n\nA Host\n\nI sang\n\nVideo DJ Host on BET Network\n\nStay at home Wife and Mother\n\nTrack and Volleyball coach\n\nPersonal Trainer\n\nGroup Fitness Trainer\n\nManaging a staff of trainers\n\nPageant Coaching and Judging\n\nWellness Coaching\n\nTriathloner\n\nMakeup Artist\n\nNail Tech\n\nHair Stylist\n\nArcheress\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Carole Gist?\n\nI am still very competitive. My next thing is archery, I am on an all woman team called the Elite Angels. I am writing a few books. A majority of the content is based on a healing journey. That book will lead me into the next thing I want to do, conference speaking. I also want to travel. I want to unapologetically get up and go. I am focused on doing things because I want to not because I have to. I am pursuing my happiness everyday.\n\nCarol Gist for the April 2021 BLAC\u00ae Spring Fashion Issue"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/carole.gist/2489482", "page_content": "Mission United States of America; Mission World\n\nThe Mission United States of America beauty pageant has been held annually since 1952 to select the Americans entrant in the Mission Universe pageant.; The Mission World pageant is the oldest surviving major international beauty pageant.\n\nThe Mission United States of America beauty pageant has been held annually since 1952 to select the Americans entrant in the Mission Universe pageant.; The Mission World pageant is the oldest surviving major international beauty pageant."}, {"url": "https://fashionchandigarh.com/carole-gist-miss-usa-1990/", "page_content": "Carole Gist is an American TV host, Fitness professional, model, and first African American woman to win the Miss USA title.

The former Miss Michigan and student of marketing and management\u2014who stated a life ambition of establishing a performing arts foundation for disadvantaged children\u2014beat out 50 other contestants for the prestigious honor. Two months later, the six-foot beauty came very close to yet another milestone, when she finished as first runner-up in the Miss Universe pageant.\n\nGist\u2019s Miss USA pageant victory marked a life achievement of rising above obstacles. As she described herself in Jet, Gist was not a \u201cstereotypical all-American winner.\u201d Raised in a single-parent home, Gist often relocated with her mother and siblings, and lived in some of the roughest neighborhoods of inner-city Detroit. \u201cMy home was broken into a lot,\u201d she said. Money was scarce in her family, and Gist\u2019s early ambitions towards the arts were affected: \u201cI wanted to dance and I wanted to learn to play the piano and violin. But\u2026 my mother couldn\u2019t afford all those things,\u201d she told Ardis Carthane in Jet. Despite such difficulties, however, Gist\u2014who was an honors student in high school\u2014maintained a confident outlook, and today looks at her past as important in building strength. \u201cI do believe that some of the negative things in my childhood are positive for me now. They made me what I am today,\u201d she told Jet, adding, \u201cI had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don\u2019t have to become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home.\u201d\n\nAfter becoming the first black Miss USA, Gist had these words of advice for other ground-breakers: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be the first at something\u2026. You know you don\u2019t have to wait around and wait for someone else to do it. Go for it. Just because someone else hasn\u2019t done it before you \u2026 you never know, you might have what it takes to be the first.\u201d Gist sees her winning the title as another important step in black achievement. As quoted by Carthane, Gist said: \u201cIt\u2019s all a part of taking pride in our [people\u2019s] heritage and culture. \u2026 We are people destined for greatness. We have it in our blood, we have the knowledge and the knack.\u201d Gist is a reminder, according to Carthane, that \u201cthough a person doesn\u2019t grow up with\n\nFull name, Carole Anne-Marie Gist; born c. 1970; mother, Joan Gist; father, David Turner; raised in Detroit, Ml.
