Blain, a 2022 Guggenheim Fellow and Class of 2022 Carnegie Fellow, is one of the most innovative and influential young historians of her generation. She is an award-winning historian of the 20th century United States with broad interests and specializations in African American History, the modern African Diaspora, and Women\u2019s and Gender Studies. She completed a Ph.D. in History from Princeton University in 2014.\n\nShe is a Full Professor of Africana Studies and History at Brown University and a columnist for MSNBC--covering race, gender, and politics in historical and contemporary perspectives.\n\nBlain is the author of Set the World on Fire: Black Nationalist Women and the Global Struggle for Freedom, which was published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2018.

You may also need to have relevant professional / academic experience on your CV, in addition to your publications.\n\nOther admission requirements vary. Some universities state that the applicant must be a current staff member, whereas others allow external candidates to apply (so it is always best to check with the individual institution). In the UK, PhD by publication is more common among staff members, but this PhD model is becoming a popular option for early career researchers in other parts of the world, such as Scandinavia.\n\nApplication process\n\nThe PhD by publication route isn\u2019t normally advertised and students don\u2019t usually begin by searching for a supervisor and presenting a research proposal. Instead, universities encourage applicants to contact the head of department in the relevant subject area before applying. They will discuss your previous research and advise you on the application process.\n\nThe application generally involves a postgraduate application form consisting of a CV and a supporting statement, outlining how the publications fit together, methodologies (and why they were used), a brief discussion of findings and most of all, how this research has given a unique and original contribution to the field. You won\u2019t normally need to provide a research proposal as you aren\u2019t planning an extensive new project.\n\nWhich universities offer a PhD by publication?\n\nThis type of doctorate degree is less common than the traditional one and isn\u2019t usually advertised. Also, due to some universities only offering this form of the degree to internal staff, information about it may not be publicly available.\n\nSo, if you are curious about doing a PhD in this way, the best way to find out more about it is by getting in touch with someone at your university of interest. You can also try contacting the people responsible for relevant PhD programmes or discussing opportunities at PhD open days and study fair events."}, {"url": "https://www.ted.com/speakers/natsai_audrey_chieza", "page_content": "Operating at the intersection of design, nature and technology, Natsai Audrey Chieza is an internationally recognized leader in the rapidly emerging field of biodesign.\n\nWhy you should listen\n\nNatsai Audrey Chieza is founder and creative director of Faber Futures, an innovation lab and creative agency exploring the potential of living systems and biotechnologies to generate new models for sustainable futures.

This nearly 1,000-page book examines the \u201ctechno-social\u201d turn in architecture, taking MIT's School of Architecture and Planning as its exemplar.\n\nIn essays and interviews, prominent architectural historians and educators examine the postwar \u201cresearch-industrial\u201d complex, its attendant cult of expertise, and its influence on life and letters both in America and abroad. Paying particular attention to the ways that technological thought affected the culture of the humanities, the social sciences, and architectural design, the book traces this shift toward complexity as it unfolded, from classroom practices to committee deliberations, from the challenges of research to the vicissitudes of funding. Looking closely at the ways that funded research drew academics towards a \u201cproblem-solving\u201d and relevance-seeking mentality and away from the imported Bauhaus model of intuition and aesthetics, the book reveals how linguistics, information sciences, operations research, computer technology, and systems theory became part of architecture's expanded toolkit.\n\nThis is a history not just of a school of architecture but of the research-oriented era itself. It offers a thoroughgoing exploration of the ways that policies, politics, and pedagogy transformed themselves in accord with the exponential growth of institutional power."}, {"url": "https://hu.gatech.edu/about/", "page_content": "David L.

He is a leading researcher in the biomechanics of animal locomotion. The study of flying, swimming and running dates back hundreds of years, and has since been shown to be an enduring and rich subject, linking areas as diverse as mechanical engineering, mathematics and neuroscience. Dr. Hu\u2019s work in this area has the potential to impact robotics research. Before robots can interact with humans, aid in minimally-invasive surgery, perform interplanetary exploration or lead search-and-rescue operations, we will need a fundamental physical understanding of how related tasks are accomplished in their biological counterparts.\n\nHu\u2019s work in these areas has generated broad interest across the fields of engineering, biology and robotics, resulting in over 30 publications, including a number in high-impact interdisciplinary journals such as Nature, Nature Materials, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences as well as popular journals such as Physics Today and American Scientist. Dr. Hu is on editorial board member for Nature Scientific Reports, The Journal of Experimental Biology, and NYU Abu Dhabi\u2019s Center for Center for Creative Design of Materials. He has won the NSF CAREER award, Lockheed Inspirational Young Faculty award, and best paper awards from SAIC, Sigma Xi, ASME, as well as awards for science education such as the Pineapple Science Prize and the Ig Nobel Prize.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Hu\u2019s research has also played a role in educating the public in science and engineering. He has been an invited guest on numerous television and radio shows to discuss his research, including Good Morning America, National Public Radio, The Weather Channel, and Discovery Channel.
