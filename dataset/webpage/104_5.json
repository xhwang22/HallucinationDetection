{"Tony La Russa Jr. has 2,728 wins, the sixth-most by any manager in major league history.": [{"url": "https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Tony-La-Russa/606806", "page_content": "(born 1944). American professional baseball manager Tony La Russa led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011). He also accumulated the third most managerial wins (2,728) in major league history.\n\nAnthony La Russa, Jr., was born on October 4, 1944, in Tampa, Florida. He signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \u201cA\u2019s\u201d) out of high school. Though he spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nIn 1983 La Russa guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first play-off appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s. He quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most dominant team in baseball. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the major leagues for three straight seasons (1988\u201390), each of which also ended with the Athletics\u2019 winning the American League (AL) pennant. The team was upset in two of its World Series appearances during this period, but the A\u2019s did defeat the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. La Russa and the A\u2019s won another division title in 1992, but after the team posted three consecutive losing seasons (1993\u201395), he opted out of his contract and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s third managerial stint was even more successful than his first two. In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa again led St. Louis to the World Series title. He retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He was named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002. In 2013 he was selected for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30218070/chicago-white-sox-name-tony-la-russa-76-new-manager", "page_content": "Tony La Russa, the Hall of Famer who won a World Series with the Oakland Athletics and two more with the St. Louis Cardinals, is returning to manage the Chicago White Sox -- 34 years after they fired him.\n\nLa Russa, 76, rejoins the franchise where his managing career began more than four decades ago. He takes over for Rick Renteria after what the White Sox insisted was a mutual agreement to split.\n\n\"We are extremely excited about the future of this team,'' general manager Rick Hahn said Thursday. \"As we showed in 2020, this is a young, talented club that we expect to only grow better and better in the coming years. Adding in a Hall of Fame manager who is recognized as being one of the best in the history of the game, we are a step closer to our goal of bringing White Sox fans another championship.''\n\nLa Russa inherits a team loaded with young stars and productive veterans that made the playoffs for the first time since 2008, only to sputter down the stretch and get knocked out in the wild-card round.\n\nHe becomes the oldest manager in the major leagues by five years. Houston's Dusty Baker is 71.\n\n\"It was very difficult to sit and think about what's going on downstairs. It's always more fun downstairs. My heart was always in the dugout,\" said La Russa, who has served in front office jobs for multiple teams since 2014.\n\n\"I think all managers would understand this, how rare it is to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning. ... The last few days, as this has gotten closer, my internal response has been excitement. No regret. I'm fired up and ready to go.\"\n\nLa Russa later took to Twitter as well.\n\nFired up to join @whitesox, a contending team in a tough division. Add my best efforts to theirs. Lots of comments. Some supportive and some not. Get to work and see the results. \u2014 Tony La Russa (@TonyLaRussa) October 30, 2020\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, La Russa joins Jack McKeon as the only managers in MLB history to take over a team at age 75 or older. McKeon was 80 when he took over the Marlins in 2011.\n\n\"While I have had other inquiries about managing since retiring, this opportunity with the White Sox brings together a number of important factors that make this the right time and the right place,'' La Russa said. \"The on-field talent is amazing, and the front office, led by Kenny Williams and Rick Hahn, has done everything necessary to create an atmosphere of long-term success. All of those factors aligned to make this a tremendous opportunity, and I am excited to get going as soon as possible by building a coaching staff and getting to work.''\n\nLa Russa, who started his managing career with the White Sox during the 1979 season, is returning to the dugout for the first time since 2011, when he led St. Louis past the Texas Rangers in the World Series. He also won championships with Oakland in 1989 and the Cardinals in 2006.\n\nAll-Time Managerial Wins Tony La Russa ranks third in wins among managers in major league history and is second only to Connie Mack for games managed. Manager Wins Connie Mack 3,731 John McGraw 2,763 Tony La Russa 2,728 Bobby Cox 2,504 Joe Torre 2,326\n\nLa Russa is 2,728-2,365 with six pennants over 33 seasons with Chicago, Oakland and St. Louis. He was enshrined in Cooperstown in 2014. Only Hall of Famers Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763) have more victories.\n\nLa Russa got his first major league managing job at age 34 when the White Sox promoted him from Triple-A to replace the fired Don Kessinger. He took over that August and led them to a 522-510 record over parts of eight seasons.\n\nThe 1983 team won 99 games on the way to the AL West championship -- Chicago's first playoff appearance since the 1959 Go-Go White Sox won the pennant. But he was fired in 1986 by then-general manager Ken Harrelson after the White Sox got off to a 26-38 start.\n\nChairman Jerry Reinsdorf has long regretted allowing that move and remains close with La Russa. Now, they're reuniting.\n\n\"His hiring is not based on friendship or on what happened years ago, but on the fact that we have the opportunity to have one of the greatest managers in the game's history in our dugout at a time when we believe our team is poised for great accomplishments,'' Reinsdorf said.\n\nLa Russa was asked if his relationship with Reinsdorf is why he got the job.\n\n\"If there was any truth to what you're saying, it would not be reading Jerry Reinsdorf correctly,\" La Russa said. \"His major interest on the baseball side is what's best for the Chicago White Sox and the fans who drive to the ballpark in droves. He understands how much I love the game. I understand how much he loves it. Beyond that, I don't think its a factor.\"\n\nThe move is a surprise considering how long it has been since La Russa was in the dugout. Hahn said the White Sox were looking for someone who has \"experience with a championship organization in recent years.''\n\n\"This was made with the intent solely on putting us in the best position to win championships,\" Hahn said. \"It's easy to fall back on some old narratives that this was about friendship or potentially righting old wrongs. In the end, Tony was the choice because we believe Tony is the best man to help us win championships over the next several years.\"\n\nBack In The Saddle The 34 years between managerial jobs with the same team for Tony La Russa is the longest span, by far, in MLB/NFL/NHL/NBA history. Span Manager Yrs Team 1986-21 Tony La Russa 34 CWS 1931-55 Dick Irvin 23 Chi. (NHL) 1954-76 Paul Richards 21 CWS 1933-55 Bucky Harris 21 Det. Elias Sports Bureau\n\nFormer Houston manager AJ Hinch and ex-Boston skipper Alex Cora fit that championship-experience description. Both were suspended by Major League Baseball for the 2020 season for their roles in the Astros sign-stealing scandal, and both lost their manager jobs. Their punishments ended this week.\n\nThough he hasn't been in a dugout in nine years, La Russa has remained a part of the game.\n\nShortly after retiring, he went to work in the league office for two years, assisting former Yankees manager Joe Torre in on-field discipline issues.\n\nIn May 2014, he was hired by the Arizona Diamondbacks to oversee their baseball operations. They signed Zack Greinke to a $206.5 million deal following the 2015 season. La Russa was demoted to an advisory role following a 93-loss season in 2016 and joined Boston's front office as a special assistant to then-president Dave Dombrowski in November 2017.\n\nLa Russa was with the Red Sox when they hired Cora and won the World Series in 2018. And he spent last season as a senior adviser for baseball operations with the Los Angeles Angels, assisting in player development. Whether any of manager Joe Maddon's eccentricities rubbed off on him remains to be seen.\n\nMaddon keeps a loose and fun atmosphere, whether it's having a magician or zoo animals at the ballpark or showing up for a spring training workout decked out in tie-dye with a 1970s van blasting Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Shining Star.'' La Russa, of course, was known more for his scowl than his smile. Now he's taking on a vibrant and outgoing team, where sky-high bat flips by Tim Anderson seem almost as common as pop flies.\n\nThen again, he's no stranger to managing outsized personalities. He had Rickey Henderson and Jose Canseco in Oakland, after all.\n\n\"I always reasoned that if it's sincere, I don't have a problem with it,\" La Russa said about younger players showing emotion. \"You want your players passionately involved in the competition.\"\n\nThe White Sox have never made back-to-back playoff appearances. But after ending a string of seven losing seasons, they are in position to change that.\n\nThey have a core of young players on team-friendly deals, starting with Anderson. Veteran Jose Abreu put himself in the running for AL MVP by driving in 60 runs. Ace Lucas Giolito pitched his first no-hitter.\n\nEloy Jimenez hit .296 with 14 homers and 41 RBIs. Luis Robert, who agreed to a six-year, $50 million contract in January, showed star potential in a roller-coaster rookie year. He got off to a great start and hit a massive homer in the playoff series against Oakland, though he also slumped in September.\n\nNow the White Sox are banking on La Russa to help push them to championships, just as he did with Oakland and St. Louis.\n\n\"This hiring today is another indication we've moved on to that final, most exciting stage,\" Hahn said. \"That's the one competing for championships.\"\n\nESPN's Jesse Rogers and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2021/02/28/tony-la-russa-first-spring-training-game-white-sox-manager/6864311002/", "page_content": "PHOENIX \u2014 Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf looked at the scoreboard Sunday afternoon, cringed at the outcome it displayed, and then saw No. 22 slowly leaving the dugout.\n\nThere was Tony La Russa, walking off the field after managing his first game in over nine years \u2013 3,411 days to be exact \u2013 and his first game as White Sox manager in 35 years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to give him one more game,\u2019\u2019 Reinsdorf cracked. \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t push me.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe White Sox lost 7-2 to the Milwaukee Brewers in a meaningless, six-inning spring training game, but in typical La Russa fashion, he acted as if they lost a critical September game during the pennant stretch.\n\n\u201cI think you've got to practice winning,\u2019\u2019 La Russa said. \u201cYou get 30 chances [during spring training games] so you don't want to wait until Opening Day. Whether the team or a manager, you're supposed to be using those games to anticipate and make decisions.\n\nFollow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules\n\n\u201cThat's why I like it, in the sense that when I get to Opening Day or October, there really isn't any difference in the concentration and the process.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s this approach, of course, that made La Russa one of the greatest managers in baseball. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014 and, with 2,728 wins, is just 35 wins away from tying John McGraw for the second-most victories by a manager in baseball history.\n\nAnd, of course, passing McGraw would give La Russa the most wins by any manager who didn\u2019t own his own team, Reinsdorf points out. Connie Mack sits atop the leader board with 3,731 wins.\n\n\u201cIt was like back to the future,\u2019\u2019 Reinsdorf said. \u201cIt made me realize how much time has passed. I remember first time I met Tony was January, 1981. That\u2019s 40 years ago. We were in [GM] Roland Hemond\u2019s office at the old Comiskey Park.\n\n\u201cThe first time I talked to him, I came out of that meeting thinking this guy is really smart. I never envisioned the friendship that developed over the years.\u2019\u2019\n\nNow, here is La Russa, 76, six pennants and three World Series championships later, back in uniform, trying to take the White Sox, a team with just one title since 1917, to the promised land.\n\nLa Russa, who began his first managerial stint with the White Sox in 1979, before any current MLB player was born, has drawn rave reviews from his players this spring. The apprehension about his age and adjusting to the modern-day player have vanished two weeks into camp.\n\nJose Abreu, the reigning American League MVP, talked about La Russa welcoming him into camp after missing the first five days with COVID-19, complete with balloons and three 12-foot-long banners.\n\n\u201cThat was a very, very good surprise,\u201d Abreu said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that. I think that came from the organization, maybe Tony had something to do with it. Those are the little things, the little details that make you feel proud to be a White Sox player and make you feel proud to be a baseball player.\u201d\n\nWhite Sox batting champion Tim Anderson effusively praised La Russa during his zoom call with reporters last week.\n\n\u201cJust to see what page he's on is definitely awesome,\" Anderson said. \u201cJust have conversations with him, very motivating. The drive to want to win, he has that. I'm behind him 110%. That's the ultimate goal, to win and to win a World Series here. \u2026\n\n\u201cI think we got the right man.\u2019\u2019\n\nFive things to watch:MLB spring training games begin in Arizona, Florida\n\n'Lucky' to be alive:Padres outfielder Tommy Pham said he is lucky to be alive after stabbing in October\n\nSpring training may have just begun, but already, La Russa appears to have won the players' respect.\n\nThe White Sox players will always be able to say they\u2019re part of history. They\u2019re the first team to be managed by a man who has already been inducted into the Hall of Fame as a manager.\n\nJake Burger, who played his first game for the White Sox in three years after twice rupturing his Achilles, talked about the emotions of not only returning to the field, but playing for La Russa.\n\nBurger, a St. Louis native who attended Missouri State University, was at Busch Stadium for Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, when David Freese\u2019s heroics forced a Game 7 with his walk-off homer.\n\n\u201cSeeing that emotion from that team, and coming back from that deficit,\u2019\u2019 Burger said, \u201cthat\u2019s a manager I want to play for. He\u2019s a winner. That\u2019s the type of manager I want to play for. \u2026\n\n\u201cLearning from Tony is unbelievable.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe players say they haven\u2019t seen any signs of arrogance or brashness by La Russa, despite his resume. Why, he could have insisted that the White Sox issue him No. 10, his uniform number throughout his Hall of Fame career. But the uniform number belongs to infielder Yoan Moncada.\n\nLa Russa never even thought about asking Moncada if he\u2019d consider switching numbers. He instead quietly chose 22, the same uniform number he last wore as a White Sox minor league manager in 1978 and 1979 in Knoxville and Iowa.\n\nWho knows if La Russa is the missing piece, but the White Sox believe the timing for his return is perfect, taking over a team loaded with talent with their greatest expectations since the spring of 2006, the year after they won the World Series. The front office believes his strengths will be evident with an improvement in team fundamentals, along with pitching decisions late in games.\n\nIt was just Day 1, but with La Russa back in uniform, and fans back in the stands at Camelback Ranch, it seemed like old times.\n\n\u201cIt's the way the game's supposed to be played,\u2019\u2019 La Russa said, who had about a dozen players and coaches tell him how good it felt seeing fans again. \u201cAfter what we went through last year, it's a dramatic difference. \u2026\n\n\u201cI was hoping we'd get a 'W' for us. But win or lose, you learn a lot.\u2019\u2019\n\nYep, even at the age of 76 with a plaque hanging in Cooperstown.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tony-La-Russa", "page_content": "Tony La Russa, byname of Anthony La Russa, Jr., (born October 4, 1944, Tampa, Florida, U.S.), American professional baseball manager who led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011) and was one of the winningest managers in major league history.\n\nLa Russa signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \u201cA\u2019s\u201d) out of high school. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, but he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nBritannica Quiz Baseball\n\nThe cerebral La Russa\u2014who earned a law degree shortly before assuming managerial duties in Chicago\u2014proved to be a natural leader in the clubhouse. He developed a managerial style that consisted of frequent in-game situational substitutions that came in response to the great attention he paid to the nuances and flow of a particular game (which occasionally led to criticism that La Russa \u201covermanaged\u201d). In 1983 he guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first playoff appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign and a strained working relationship with the team\u2019s new general manager (former outfielder Ken Harrelson, who left the announcing booth to spend only one tumultuous season running the White Sox) led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s.\n\nLa Russa quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most-dominant team in baseball.

In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa led St. Louis on improbable comebacks to clinch a postseason berth (after trailing in the Wild Card standings by 8 1/2 games with a month remaining in the regular season) and to win the World Series (after twice being one strike away from elimination). La Russa retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He had been named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002.\n\nThree years after his retirement from managing, La Russa joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as the team\u2019s chief baseball officer. He was demoted to an advisory role with the franchise following the 2016 season after the Diamondbacks ran off three consecutive losing campaigns during his tenure, and he left the team after the 2017 season. La Russa then joined the Boston Red Sox as an assistant to the team\u2019s general manager. After the 2020 season he returned to the Chicago White Sox as general manager. In his first season back with the team, Chicago finished first in the Central Division, and La Russa won his 2,764th game, which moved him into second place for most career wins by a general manager.

The Sox let go of previous manager Rick Renteria despite reaching the playoffs in 2020, the team\u2019s first postseason trip in a dozen years.\n\nLa Russa began his playing career with the Kansas City A\u2019s, debuting in the majors as an infielder in 1963. He spent most of his six-year career with the club, and made the move to Oakland with them. In 1979 he got his first manager gig, with none other than the White Sox, but in 1986 they fired him and he returned to Oakland to lead the A\u2019s. The rest is history \u2014 three World Series trips and one championship with Oakland, then another three NL pennants and two championships at the helm of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nIn terms of all-time records, La Russa\u2019s 2,728 wins as a manager rank third behind Connie Mack and John McGraw, and he\u2019ll surely pass McGraw now as he trails by just 35. Those victories came at a strong .536 rate over 33 seasons, and he\u2019s one of only 10 skippers ever to nab three World Series titles. His four Manager of the Year awards are the most ever, tied with Bobby Cox, and he won them with three different clubs spanning both leagues.\n\nLa Russa is already one of the most accomplished managers in the history of the sport, before even getting to the strategic legacy he left, especially in terms of bullpen usage and his innovation of the modern 9th-inning closer role. Now he\u2019s back for a second run with the White Sox at age 76, guiding a dynamic young roster that just announced its presence with a breakout season.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an unusual move \u2014 literally, it\u2019s unprecedented to bring a HOF manager out of retirement, and he\u2019s now the oldest active boss by half a decade (over Dusty Baker). There\u2019s also criticism about the personal connections involved, and whether the close friendship between La Russa and team owner Jerry Reinsdorf is superseding the best competitive interests of the club. South Side Sox had some different targets on their wish list.\n\nBut from an A\u2019s fan perspective, this is a no-lose. If La Russa does well, then it\u2019s fun to see one of our old legends back in action. If he doesn\u2019t, then a rising AL contender who projects as a notable upcoming league rival may have just set themselves back.\n\n***\n\nElsewhere in the AL Central, the Detroit Tigers settled on A.J. Hinch as their new manager. They had also interviewed current A\u2019s coach Mark Kotsay, so from an Oakland perspective it\u2019s good news that the Tigers went in a different direction instead poaching one of our own.\n\nHinch managed the Arizona D\u2019Backs from 2009-10, and was last seen leading the Houston Astros from 2015-19 and winning a title in \u201817. However, when the Astros\u2019 cheating scandal came to light, he was suspended for the entire 2020 season and released.\n\nNow the 46-year-old is eligible to return, and it only took until Friday for a new team to bite at the opportunity. Hinch inherits a rebuilding Tigers club that lost 114 games in 2019 and inched their win percentage up to around .400 this summer (23-35). He has experience in such a setting, though \u2014 he took over a Houston team that had lost 92 games the previous season and 324 combined the three years before that, and immediately oversaw their rapid improvement.\n\nLike La Russa, Hinch began his MLB playing career with the A\u2019s, as a catcher in 1998 two years after they drafted him out of Stanford. He was later dealt to the Royals in the Johnny Damon trade, and a couple seasons later he played 27 games for the Tigers (and then four for the Phillies before retiring).\n\nTigers fans appear happy with the hiring, as the community poll at Bless You Boys is overwhelmingly positive. Here are some more details from from BYB.\n\nLa Russa reactions\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say, having interviewed Tony in 2019: There\u2019s no lack of fire still in that man.

He has the third most managerial wins (2,728) in major league history behind Connie Mack and John McGraw.\n\nLa Russa was born in Tampa, Florida on October 4, 1944, to Anthony and Olivia (Cuervo) La Russa.\n\nTony La Russa's Career\n\nLa Russa agreed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \"A's\") out of high school. He spent most of his 16-season playing profession in the minor leagues while showing up irregularly in the majors with the A's (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise relocated), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs.\n\nTony La Russa SOURCE: MLB\n\nHe was named the chief of a minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big league mentoring job came the next year when he assumed control over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nIn 1983, he led the White Sox to a 99 win season and the team's first playoff appearance in 24 years.\n\nIn 1986, his old club, the Athletics, called him to take over as manager after which La Russa inherited a team that was 31-52 trailing in the 7th place. The Athletics under Russa's tutelage, went 45-34 the rest of the season to finish in 3rd place in 1986. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the majors for three straight seasons (1988-90). Each of the seasons, the Athletics ended with them winning the American League pennant. They also defeated the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. The Tampa-born manager led the A's to another division title in 1992.\n\nIn 1993 he moved to St Louis Cardinals. In his first season, he guided the team to the first of seven division titles the Cardinals would win during his tenure. In 2004, he guided the Cardinals to a National League pennant victory. Two years later, he helped the team win the World Series. He gave the Cardinals another World Series in 2011. La Russa has been named the AL's Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992). He joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as their chief baseball officer, three years after he retired from managing. After leaving the team at the conclusion of the 2017 season, he joined the Boston Red Sox (in October 2020) as an assistant to the team's general manager. He was coming out of retirement to replace Rick Renteria as their manager.\n\nLa Russa was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014. He is among the number of major league managers in baseball history who have graduated from law school or passed a state bar exam; others being James Henry O'Rourke, John Montgomery Ward, Hughie Jennings, Miller Huggins, Muddy Ruel, Jack Hendricks, and Branch Rickey.\n\nTony La Russa's Net Worth and Salary\n\nLa Russo's net worth is estimated at around $30 million, as per numerous sources. MLB is known for keeping the details relating to the salary and net worth of general managers and coaches classified. Sources, nonetheless, claim GM salaries generally range from $500,000 to $2.5 million, with a few of those exceeding the higher figure.\n\nTony La Russa guided his teams to three World Series titles, six league championships, and 12 division titles. SOURCE: Getty Images\n\nAlthough MLB players are reported to make a lot of money, that, however, is not the case with general managers. Even the most substantially paid field generals don't come close to cracking eight figures. But considering La Russo's 50+ years of affiliation with the billion-dollar sports franchise, his fortune could very well be in the bracket of tens of millions. Also, most managers have a lot of incentives included in their contracts.\n\nTony La Russa's Wife and Children\n\nLa Russa is currently the husband of Elaine Cooker, co-founder of the Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation. They have been married for more than forty years. They married in December 1973.\n\nThe couple share two daughters, Bianca Tai, 33, and Devon Kai, 30. Tony and Elaine are the founders of Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation headquartered in Walnut Creek, California. In 2020, the Chicago White Sox manager said it was his wife, Elaine who talked him into going vegetarian.\n\nTony La Russa and his family \u2014 (from left) daughter Bianca, wife Elaine, daughter Devon \u2014 at the La Russas\u2019 Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) in Walnut Creek.

That is where visitors will find La Russa: in profile, lips creased, eyes focused, a strategist in bronze. The first sentence of the text below his image cites his 2,728 victories, the third most for a manager.\n\nThe plaque went up in 2014, and La Russa never expected the numbers to change. After starting his managing career with the Chicago White Sox in 1979, he seemingly finished it 32 years later with a victory in Game 7 of the World Series for the St. Louis Cardinals. Managing would not be part of his future.\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d probably get the chance,\u201d La Russa said on Thursday. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would want it.\u201d\n\nBut La Russa left a hint, right there on the plaque, one of the few in the gallery without a logo on the cap. La Russa managed the Cardinals and the Oakland Athletics to three World Series appearances each, but he gave the White Sox equal standing in his reasoning: They gave him his start, and he remains a close friend of the team\u2019s owner, Jerry Reinsdorf."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Tony-La-Russa/6000000159898842861", "page_content": "About Tony La Russa\n\nAnthony La Russa Jr. (/l\u0259\u02c8ru\u02d0s\u0259/; born October 4, 1944) is an American professional baseball manager who is the manager of the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is the former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals and Oakland Athletics and a former professional baseball player. In November 2019, he joined the Los Angeles Angels as a senior advisor of baseball operations. His MLB career has spanned from 1963 to the present, in several roles. In 33 years as a manager, La Russa guided his teams to three World Series titles, six league championships and twelve division titles. His 2,728 wins is third most for a major league manager, trailing only the totals of Connie Mack and John McGraw.\n\nAs a player, La Russa made his major league debut in 1963 and spent parts of five major league seasons with the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics, Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs. After a shoulder injury during the 1964\u201365 off-season, he played much of the remainder of his career in the minor leagues until retiring in 1977. Following his playing career, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Florida State University.\n\nLa Russa was named manager of the White Sox in the middle of the 1979 season and guided the White Sox to an American League West division title four seasons later. Despite being fired in the middle of the 1986 season, the Athletics hired him less than three weeks later, and La Russa led the A's to three consecutive American League championships from 1988 to 1990 and the 1989 World Series title. He left Oakland following the 1995 season to manage the Cardinals, and led the team to three National League championships and the 2006 and 2011 World Series titles. La Russa retired after winning the 2011 title and 33 seasons as a major league manager. Three months later, he accepted a position assisting fellow former manager Joe Torre, the executive vice president for MLB operations. In 2014, he became the Chief Baseball Officer for the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nOn December 9, 2013, he was unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame by the 16-member Veterans Committee. The induction ceremony was held at Cooperstown, New York, on July 27, 2014.[1] On August 16, 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum.\n\nFurther Reading: Wikipedia"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/page/tonylarussa/", "page_content": "On Tony La Russa's Hall of Fame plaque, it will tell you all about the 2,728 games and three World Series he won as a big league manager. But there's so much that plaque can't possibly tell you.\n\nIt can't tell you about that look in his eye on game day, as his brain shifted into turbo-drive, racing through a ballgame at a speed most managers couldn't comprehend. It can't tell you about the thousands of hours of intense preparation La Russa poured into every one of those 5,097 games he managed, looking for edges and opportunities many of his peers wouldn't have recognized if they'd flashed on the computer screen in blinking red lights.\n\nAnd there is no way that plaque can sum up all the ways in which La Russa invented -- or is that reinvented? -- modern managing. He never, ever accepted the idea that a manager's job was just to keep the troops happy and to write out the lineup card. He left his imprint on every game he managed. He found bullpen matchups for every occasion. He hit the pitcher eighth. He never stopped searching for seemingly innocent quotes, glances and purpose pitches he could use to pour fuel into his team's tank.\n\nSo it doesn't seem adequate to call La Russa just a manager. He was a game-changer. In every way. For three amazing decades.\n\n-- Jayson Stark\n\nHALL OF FAME GALLERY\n\nSee more photos of Tony La Russa and the other five members of the 2014 class.

La Russa was also arrested for drunken driving in 2007, when he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DUI in Jupiter, Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLa Russa, 76, was hired on Oct. 29, nine years after he last managed. The White Sox fired Rick Renteria on Oct. 12. La Russa has 2,728 career wins, third most for a manager in Major League Baseball history.\n\n\n\nGO DEEPER White Sox's hiring of Tony La Russa raises more questions\n\nGO DEEPER White Sox manager Tony La Russa arrested for DUI\n\nWhat we know\n\nJames Fegan, White Sox beat writer: Since the arrest came in February and the charges were filed the day before La Russa was officially hired \u2014 albeit a few days after the team had a fundamental agreement in place \u2014 the tremendous support this hire had from chairman Jerry Reinsdorf continued unabated. La Russa's introductory press conference revealed that a wide-reaching manager search was mostly subsumed into Reinsdorf's pursuit of La Russa, and clearly this incident did not derail that focus.\n\nWhat this means for the White Sox\n\nFegan: At least for now, tremendous embarrassment. The La Russa hire was already controversial because it brought him back to managing nine years after he retired and after his divisive comments on national anthem protests. It was also controversial in the White Sox organization because it cast aside a chance to lure the top available candidates for a sought-after job managing an exciting young team on the rise, in favor of someone with close contact to ownership.\n\nNow it's revealed that it was done despite a troubling second DUI arrest for La Russa. The White Sox could be on the cusp of an exciting run, but instead are making headlines this offseason for the wrong reasons.\n\n(Photo: Jeff Curry / Getty Images)"}]}
