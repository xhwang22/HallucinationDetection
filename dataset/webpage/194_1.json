Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://www.classicfm.com/artists/kirill-karabits/", "page_content": "Biography\n\nUkranian conductor Kirill Karabits is in his sixth season as Principal Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Classic FM's Orchestra in the South of England.

He became the first Ukrainian named principal conductor of a major orchestra in the U.K. when he assumed that position with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 2009.\n\nKarabits was born in Kiev, Ukraine, on December 26, 1976. His father, Ivan Karabits, was a composer and conductor. Young Kirill studied piano, composition, and musicology, but when he was 13, he became interested in the idea of becoming a conductor. He studied at Kiev's Lysenko Music School and then moved on to the city's Petro Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine, also known as the Kiev Conservatory. In 1995, he moved to Austria for studies at the Musikhochschule Wien, where he earned a diploma in 2000. He also studied at the International Bach Academy in Stuttgart, Germany, working with famed Bach conductor Helmuth Rilling, as well as Peter G\u00fclke. By the time he completed his studies, Karabits had already launched his professional career as associate conductor of the Budapest Festival Orchestra. He held the same position with the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra from 2002 to 2005, and then led France's Strasbourg Philharmonic from 2005 to 2007. After several guest conducting appearances with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in the U.K., he was unanimously approved by the orchestra's musicians as its principal conductor; he ascended the podium in 2009 and remained in that position as of 2020 after several contract extensions. Karabits also served as artistic director of the I, CULTURE youth orchestra in Poland in the mid-2010s, and as the general music director of the Deutsches Nationaltheater and the Staatskapelle Weimar from 2016 to 2018.\n\nKarabits has amassed a substantial recording catalog, issuing albums with several of the aforementioned ensembles on the Onyx, Decca, and Audite labels, among several others. He has conducted Russian and Western music with equal enthusiasm, recording a complete cycle of Prokofiev's symphonies for Onyx with the Bournemouth Symphony. In 2020, he released a recording Liszt's Dante Symphony and the rarer Tasso: Lamento e Trionfo symphonic poem with the Staatskapelle Weimar for Audite."}], "Kirill Karabits studied at the Kiev Conservatory and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.": [{"url": "https://bachtrack.com/interview-kirill-karabits-bournemouth-symphony-orchestra-september-2019", "page_content": "When Kirill Karabits was appointed Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 2009, he thought it was the right place to practise and develop his mainstream repertoire. Ten years later it has become his most adventurous place. \u201cI can experiment and do pieces which I can\u2019t do anywhere else,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe programmes I introduce are received with interest and curiosity by the orchestra and I think the most significant achievement is that the audience, in all our residencies, still believes in us. It\u2019s all a question of balance. Of course the audience wants to hear music they know, but you have to push them a little bit, challenge them. We are mutually supporting each other and the audience joined us on our journey.\u201d\n\nKirill Karabits \u00a9 Konrad Kwik\n\nThat journey started with a Beethoven cycle, for Karabits the turning point in his growth together with the orchestra. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing unusual, but it was a very important element in our relationship. I said \u2018If we can find each other in Beethoven, then we can do anything together.\u2019\u201d Not only did they find each other, it was followed by a successful cycle of Prokofiev symphonies in 2014 after which Karabits realised that the audience and the musicians were ready \u2013 and hungry \u2013 for an even more adventurous step. \u201cI thought discovering unknown masterpieces that got lost in history or for political reasons would be a way to connect to my roots,\u201d the Ukrainian conductor explains. Their Voices from the East series continues to prove to be incredibly popular with both critics and audiences and opened some completely new names to people. \u201cI\u2019d consider Kara Karayev or Boris Lyatoshynsky classical composers, but it\u2019s different in the UK. For Avet Terterian\u2019s Third Symphony we brought two duduk players (an Armenian folk instrument) from Yerevan to Poole. It\u2019s very interesting and special music and the result was absolutely astonishing.\u201d\n\nFor the composer\u2019s Fourth Symphony, their orchestral librarian Alastair Simpson had to organise the one handwritten (and unpublished!) score of the first edition from the Terterian Estate in Armenia. But why go to all this trouble? \u201cBecause it is a unique piece of music that the composer wrote, the score is still pure. The composer only gives you ideas and directions, but he tells the conductor that he has to shape the piece himself.\u201d\n\nKarabits\u2019 and the audience\u2019s fondest memories of the last ten years are not of the mainstream performances, but of the more unusual ones, programmes that challenged the musicians and listeners alike: Shostakovich\u2019s Fourteenth Symphony sung in Russian, Prokofiev\u2019s Second (\u201ca very difficult piece to listen to, even for musicians\u201d) or a semi-staged version of Salome. Amongst those stellar moments, one shines the brightest: the recording of his father\u2019s concertos for orchestra. \u201cIn the Ukraine it\u2019s actually the other way around. There, I am still considered the son of my father.\u201d Ivan Karabits, a student of Lyatoshynsky, was a prolific composer, conductor and professor at the Kiev Conservatory. His concertos combine elements of Mahler, Shostakovich and Ukrainian folk music and represent the traditional concertos for orchestras in the 20th century, starting with Bart\u00f3k, Lutos\u0142awski and Shchedrin. \u201cThis music is a showcase in which the orchestra presents all its capacities, all its emotions.\u201d\n\nFor a short period during his student years, Karabits followed in his father\u2019s composing footsteps. \u201cIt was an important time in my life, but I was always more passionate about conducting. It\u2019s difficult to start a career as a conductor and composition was the closest to it. If you decide to dedicate your life to composition, you need to do only that, you need to have something to say, something new, and I felt that there was so much music composed already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been more interested in being the interpreter. Composers don\u2019t create an intimate version of a piece and it is our job to demonstrate what the composer wants. Some composers let you add a little bit more of yourself, others stay away and hide, because everything is in the score already. But it\u2019s not enough to do what\u2019s written in the score, you have to believe in it and tell the whole story. Stravinsky, for example, wrote most of what he wanted into the score; Liszt, on the other hand, gives you complete freedom. He\u2019s not only giving you freedom, he\u2019s asking you to interpret his music. What you see on paper is only a symbolic way of notational ideas that he wants you to experience. You have to put Liszt\u2019s music completely through yourself, otherwise it becomes dull and uninteresting.\u201d\n\nManuscript of Vor hundert Jahren \u00a9 Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music\n\nLiszt also plays a significant role in the BSO\u2019s upcoming season. Together with the British dramaturg Gerard McBurney, Karabits brings to stage the long-lost piece Vor hundert Jahren (A hundred years ago), an orchestral melodrama composed by Liszt to accompany the play by Friedrich Halm. Although its first performance during the festivities celebrating Schiller\u2019s 100th birthday in November 1859 was favourable received, it was never published and only one autograph score survived. \u201cIt\u2019s a work for two actors, some visual elements and orchestra. I\u2019ve already conducted the original German version in Weimar [where Karabits has been Music Director for the past three years] and we will perform an English translation [by Richard Stokes] in Poole and London.\" In the current political climate in the UK, with the country asking again whether it is part of Europe and its culture, Karabits agrees that the work might be quite challenging and provocative. \"It\u2019s about the unification of Germany, so there are some open questions\u2026\"\n\nFor the Beethoven festivities, including the Beethoven Weekender at the Barbican in February, Karabits has his very own approach. \u201cIt\u2019s music that pushes the limits. His symphonies are iconic, but you have to make the orchestra vibrate, you have to make the music speak. Masterpieces are sometimes presented like music in a museum. But this music is still very much alive, it still influences today. There\u2019s no such thing as right and wrong, there\u2019s only a convincing element that comes through the energy, the emotional investment of the orchestra. It\u2019s the feeling of doing something on the limit.\u201d\n\nOther Karabits highlights for next season include a semi-staged performance of Elektra, \u201cthe culmination of what we\u2019ve already started with Salome\u201d; working with their artist-in-residence, Gabriela Montero; and welcoming some of the BSO\u2019s favourite soloists, including Steven Isserlis.\n\nAnd his goals for the next ten years? \u201cI\u2019m mainly interested in continuing our series Voices from the East. Performing unknown music doesn\u2019t sound special at all, but every project, every piece has the power to change you. The BSO has always taken risks, they believe in works to become masterpieces. They played the world premiere of Lutos\u0142awski\u2019s Cello Concerto and gave the UK premiere of several works by Tchaikovsky, Richard Strauss and Saint-Sa\u00ebns. I want to broaden the repertoire for symphony orchestras, I want to create something new. The last ten years have been quite a journey, but the journey still continues.\u201d\n\nClick here for all upcoming concerts of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra\n\nThis interview was sponsored by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra"}, {"url": "https://www.eclassical.com/conductors/karabits-kirill/", "page_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2009 eClassical.com\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

Following the tradition of Mahler and Schostakovich the musical language of Ivan Karabits has deep roots in Ukrainian and Slavonic symphonic and folk tradition of past centuries and has left a deep influence on various generations of Ukrainian composers of the second half of XX-th century.\n\nBorn in 1945 in a Greek village Yalta in the Donetsk region of Ukraine he graduated from the Kiev Conservatory in 1974 where he studied with prominent Ukrainian composer Boris Lyatoshinsky. Ivan Karabits began winning recognition while still a student at the age of 24 when he became as a laureate of all-Union competition for young composers. He has since won many more awards and honor for his works and held the title of \u201cPeople Artist of Ukraine\u201d. Professor of the composition at the Kiev Tchaikovsky Music Academy, founder and artistic director of the Ukrainian Internatinal Festival \u201cKiev Music Fest\u201d, music advisor to the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine, member of Ukraine\u2019s State Comission on UNESCO Affairs, chairman of the jury of international competition for young pianists in memory of Vladimir Horowitz, Music Director of the State ensemble of soloists \u201cKiev Camerata\u201d.\n\nHis works are frequently performed throughout the countries of the former Soviet Union, and many of his compositions have been heard by audiences in France, Germany, Finland, Italy, Argentina, England, and the United States.\n\nThe initial period of creative work of the composer is characteristic of the free use of dodecaphony. The works of the early period (1st sonata for cello, sinfonietta for string orchestra, sonatina for piano) are characteristic of expressive type of expression and search of the individual style. In 70-80s the composer displayed his interest in conceptual immensity in implementation of philosophical problems (themes of Motherland, memory, moral obligations). There was a priority of symphonic genres in their correlation with scene and vocal genres, instrumental concert (\u201cSad Bozhestvennykh Pisen (Garden of Divine Songs) Concert for choir, soloists and orchestra) versified by H. H. Skovoroda, \u201cKyivski Fresky (Kyiv Frescoes) opera-oratorio, three concerts for orchestra).\n\nSymphonic style of I. Karabits displayed draft for dramatic type as the main one in synthesis of different genre fundamentals (in correlation of epos, drama and lyrics in \u201cPiat Pisen Pro Ukrainu\u201d (Five Songs about Ukraine) epic symphony, conflict dramatic and lyric fundamentals in the Third Symphony). Music lexis of composer reflects the various vectors of style landmarks: different genre and style layers of Ukrainian folklore (duma, plangent song, instrumental affectations) and national professional music art (remarkable chants, canticle, choir culture of baroque, stylistics of B. Liatoshynsky), music classics of the 20th century (G. Mahler, D. Shostakovich, S. Bartok, I. Stravinsky) and modern trends, mass genres.\n\nUniversality of music language of the works of next period was determined by the synthesis of different elements of modern composers techniques (non-serial dodecaphony, pointillism, clusters, aleatory composition, sonority) in combination with new acoustical and new modal pitch organization, interception of different style trends (neoclassicism, neobaroque, neoimpressionism, jazz lexis). In sphere of images there is the increase of tragic principle and actualization of the theme of penitence (Concert No. 3 \u201cHolosinnia\u201d (Lamentations), concert-triptych for orchestra), a new implementation of the theme of pantheism (\u201cMusic from Waterside\u201d)"}, {"url": "https://www.yuanfanyang.com/media", "page_content": "Yuanfan Yang performs the Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16 with the Royal Northern Sinfonia, conducted by Kirill Karabits.

Only 2.3% of works programmed in the 2018-19 season by 15 of the world\u2019s major orchestras were written by women. A survey of the same 15 major orchestras for this current season reveals a tiny improvement \u2013 of 3,997 works being performedin 2019-20\u2019s concerts, 142 have been written by female composers, ie 3.6%. Progress is glacially slow, and the gender imbalance is too often framed as a problem for women alone to grapple with. (I am reminded of Marin Alsop, who, when asked why there are so few women conductors, will reply \u201cI dont know. Ask the men.\u201d) And so, on International Women\u2019s Day, we asked 10 of the UK\u2019s leading male conductors to nominate a female composer whose music deserves wider recognition. Their responses have been fascinating, and prove that there is a vast wealth of music out there that can enrich our musical lives. Imogen Tilden\n\nGermaine Tailleferre (1892-1983), chosen by Edward Gardner\n\nGermaine Tailleferre (1892-1983) Photograph: Lipnitzki/Roger Viollet/Getty Images\n\nI came across Germaine Tailleferre when researching French orchestral music of the early part of the 20th century and was shocked that I hadn\u2019t heard of her before. The Ballade for Piano and Orchestra is a beautiful woven tapestry, but for me the great works lie in her chamber music; a string quartet full of colour, perhaps overlooked because of its brevity. Listen to Valse Lente and Arabesque, both miniatures that have a surface of the nonchalant style that\u2019s so reminiscent of that period of French music, but with an undercoat of wistful pain. Image is a gem, with an orientalist slant that reminds me of her friend and mentor Ravel and a harmony that looks forward, like Boulanger, to Messiaen.\n\nEdward Gardner is the principal conductor designate of the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nBetsy Jolas (b. 1926), chosen by Simon Rattle\n\nBetsy Jolas Photograph: L\u00e9onard Roussel\n\nBetsy Jolas is one of those people I used to read about. She formed the Domaine musical (a concert society) with Pierre Boulez and took over Messiaen\u2019s position as composition professor at the Paris Conservatoire. I would think, \u201c[Hers] must be interesting music\u201d, but I\u2019d never had the opportunity to hear a note of it. That is, until I met Betsy at a dinner party. I was sat next to her and fell completely in love! When you start talking to her, she tells you about when Var\u00e8se came to dinner, and when she sang the Verdi Requiem conducted by Toscanini. She\u2019s truly a walking encyclopaedia. \u201cIf her music is one tenth as extraordinary as she is, then we really have something,\u201d I thought. That evening I was able to hear some of her music on YouTube, and by the end of the next week I had commissioned a piece from her for the Berlin Philharmonic, as part of the Tapas series. She came up with a beautiful 13-minute composition called A Little Summer Suite. It\u2019s full of depth, humour and thought. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the kind of piece a young person could write. It has a wisdom of a certain age. The Berlin Philharmonic leapt on it with joy. We realised immediately how well she could hear everything and how she knew exactly what she wanted. Her music is wonderful. I was thrilled to have introduced her to the Berlin audience, and to be able to bring her music to London three years later in a concert in February 2019.\n\nSimon Rattle is music director of the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nFranghiz Ali-Zadeh (b. 1947), chosen by Kirill Karabits\n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s Franghiz Ali-Zadeh in 2000. Photograph: Hiroyuki Ito/Getty Images\n\nThis week I conducted the music of Franghiz Ali-Zadeh with the Minnesota Orchestra. Franghiz is one of Azerbaijan\u2019s leading composers, and the roots of her music lie in the traditions of her native country. She often combines modern symphonic traditions with the folk art form called Mugham. Using her unique musical language in the symphonic, chamber and choral compositions, she continues the tradition of her teacher, the iconic composer of Azerbaijan, Kara Karayev (1918-82), who himself studied with Shostakovich in Moscow. Franghiz\u2019s work is a unique blend of European and eastern music. At Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra we\u2019ve recorded Karayev within our exploration of repertoire from former Soviet countries, Voices from the East. I discovered this music through my late father, the Ukrainian composer Ivan Karabits; it means a lot to me, to bring these voices to UK audiences.\n\nKirill Karabits is chief conductor of Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. The next concert in the Voices from the East series is on 6 May.\n\nGra\u017cyna Bacewicz (1909-1969), chosen by Nicholas Collon\n\nAs a child, Bacewicz was a violin prodigy and highly proficient pianist, who aged 23 went to study composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. Bacewicz became one of Poland\u2019s leading composers, paving the way for other female composers from younger generations, while simultaneously performing as leader of the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra. I\u2019m planning to programme her Music for Strings, Trumpets and Percussion in my first season as chief conductor with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Written in 1958, it\u2019s a blistering piece; acerbic, virtuosic, full of rhythmic drive. It\u2019s for a very unusual lineup; the string writing alongside percussion is reminiscent perhaps of Bart\u00f3k, but Bacewicz adds five trumpets on top \u2013 I imagine them placed around the back of the strings, inviting us into some kind of infernal dance.\n\nNicholas Collon is founder and principal conductor of Aurora Orchestra.\n\nElla Milch-Sheriff (b. 1954), chosen by Omer Meir Wellber\n\nMelting pot ... Omer Meir Wellber with Ella Milch-Sheriff. Photograph: Jens Gerber\n\nI greatly admire the music of Ella Milch-Sheriff, a composer from Israel. Last week I premiered a work of hers at the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig that was a huge success. Her music is important for political and social reasons: she represents second generation holocaust survivors and she lives and breathes controversial Israeli society. Hebrew is her mother tongue but her closeness to the German language is dominant. In her operatic work she constantly deals with specific German-Jewish-Israeli complexities and puts them in human context \u2013 and that is very important in today\u2019s world. Her music reflects a melting pot of Arab, Mediterranean and Israeli culture through her use of various instruments from different backgrounds and playing with colours in beautiful and very unique orchestrations, making the listener aware and conscious of conflict, but also of unity.\n\nOmer Meir Wellber is chief conductor of the BBC Philharmonic.\n\nLouise Farrenc (1804-1875), chosen by Lars Vogt\n\nCelebrated ... Louise Farrenc. Photograph: The Picture Art Collection/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nLouise Farrenc\u2019s music was widely performed and celebrated during her lifetime but has largely fallen into obscurity since. Well-known as a concert pianist, she taught at the Paris Conservatoire and composed a wide range of works, including three fantastic symphonies and a large assortment of chamber music. As musical director of Royal Northern Sinfonia, I was excited to have Farrenc\u2019s unapologetic and powerful Third Symphony brought to life earlier this season. There is no doubt that she faced an enormous challenge in having her ability recognised, but Farrenc\u2019s work firmly stands its ground among the symphonic greats that dominated music of the mid-19th century.\n\nLars Vogt is music director of the Royal Northern Sinfonia.\n\nShruthi Rajasekar (b. 1996), chosen by Robert Hollingworth\n\nNumbers is a great title for a piece: a series of sung numbers and overlapping time signatures that is funky to conduct and fun for the singers. Its Indian-American composer, Shruthi Rajasekar, was one of three young female composers (out of four) on the National Youth Choir of Great Britain Young Composers Scheme last summer. They all wrote pieces for the choir during the course, but this one stood out to me because it was very different from vocal music with expressive text to worry about. The lack of that freed the singers to listen even more and to have fun. The numbers reference our current digital ones and zeroes, also the decimal system (leading to a nicely lopsided section in two groups of a fast five) and even the Babylonian system of 60, thus the constant appearance of \u201c59\u201d. But the numbers aren\u2019t academic \u2013 they\u2019re fun: along with some unusual instructions to the singers such as \u201cimperious, but less certain\u201d. I researched some of her other pieces on her website and enjoyed the Indian rhythmic influences, but still I come back to this enjoyable piece that does what it says on the tin.\n\nRobert Hollingworth is director of I Fagiolini.\n\nGalina Ustvolskaya (1919-2006), chosen by Vasily Petrenko\n\nExistential expressionism ... Galina Ustvolskaya.\n\nRussian-born Ustvolskaya\u2019s legacy is an example of almost ultimate existential expressionism, an individual cry against life\u2019s circumstances, and a search for spiritual comfort in very uncomfortable living conditions. In her music she was, probably, a direct descendant of Mahler and Shostakovich. She also had an exceptional and unusual life, living almost as a hermit for many years.\n\nVasily Petrenko is chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.\n\nDora Peja\u010devi\u0107 (1885-1923), chosen by Sakari Oramo\n\nDora Peja\u010devi\u0107 was a largely self-taught Hungarian-Croatian composer. Her musical output consists mostly of songs and piano music, but she also wrote what is considered the first symphony by a Croatian composer. Her Symphony in F sharp minor (1916-1917, revised 1920) is a very ambitious, large-scale work and shows the composer in complete control of her means: the form is unorthodox but compelling with some very interesting kaleidoscopic moments, the orchestration quite dark in colours and the expression very passionate. The first complete performance was in Dresden in 1920 and was very favourably reviewed. Peja\u010devi\u0107 was a member of an important noble family but later became distanced from her class and embraced modern ideas of a merit-based society, as opposed to the old ways of aristocratic entitlement. In her development as a composer, she made her way from the earlier, salon-like small-scale pieces to her later music, such as the Symphony and the Phantasie Concertante for piano and orchestra.Her creative life was cut short by complications from childbirth in 1923.\n\nSakari Oramo is chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.\n\nKaija Saariaho (b. 1952), chosen by Santtu-Matias Rouvali\n\nFor most people, Finnish music means one thing: Sibelius. But since his time, new generations of composers have taken Finnish composition forward in a number of directions. The most prominent of those is Kaija Saariaho. To say she is a modern-day Sibelius wouldn\u2019t be right, but, with a shared history and culture come themes that you find from a lot of Nordic composers: the landscape of the north, journeys and storytelling. Kaija\u2019s music tells stories from all over the world \u2013 and even from beyond the stars. From her electronic works in the 1980s in Paris, to her more recent pieces such as her clarinet concerto D\u2019Om le Vrai Sens, her music always draws me in to its narrative, with its vivid details. Where other composers can get lost in sound effects or structure, she always lets her music breathe and paint a picture.\n\nRather than her operas, it\u2019s her music for orchestra that I have been conducting for years. One memory that is particularly special is my debut with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France in Paris in a programme of all-Finnish music, including the French premieres of three of Kaija\u2019s pieces: Asteroid 4179: Toutatis, Laterna magica and Leino Songs (sung by the Finnish soprano Anu Komsi). I\u2019ve been proud to conduct Kaija\u2019s music at both orchestras where I am chief conductor, in Tampere, Finland, and Gothenburg, Sweden, so I look forward to bringing her music to London.\n\nSanttu-Matias Rouvali is principal conductor designate of the Philharmonia."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/8132476/", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits (born December 1976, Kiev ) is a Ukraninian conductor.
