The band is especially recognized in the evolution of the country-rock music genre and what has come to be referred to as the San Francisco Sound.\n\nThe band whose original lineup was made up of a group of friends were discovered by local disc jockeys with a new record label looking for musicians to sign. In their early career, their sound was a blend of folk and beat music but as their career progressed, they incorporated various musical genres like country rock and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe band was active between 1964 to 1969 and then 1974 to 1975. Some of their well-received songs like Laugh, Laugh has made it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the songs that shaped Rock and Roll. During the height of their popularity, they were considered teen idols and appeared on various television music variety shows like Shindig, American Bandstand, Hullabaloo, and films like Wild Wild Winter and Village of Giants.\n\nWho are the members of The Beau Brummels Rock Band?\n\nSal Valentino was the brain behind the band when it first began. He was the one who dreamed of it before going on to introduce others to form The Beau Brummels.\n\nHe began to perform at a young age with a series of appearances on television. His performances got him a regular gig at a club (El Cid, San Francisco). To form a much-needed band he called on his childhood friend Ron Elliot who was a guitarist and songwriter. Ron then recruited the other members which included Declan Mulligan (singer/ rhythm guitarist), Ron Meagher (bassist), and Victor Savant (pianist).\n\nAs they performed at the club, they got a more lucrative deal to perform at another club (Morocco Room, San Mateo, California. The owner of the club (Rich Romanello) invited disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell to listen to them at the club as they were looking for new acts to sign to their upcoming record label (Autumn Records). They quickly signed them and their early records were produced by Sly Stone.\n\nThe Beau Brummels band\u2019s original members include the following\n\nSal Valentino as lead vocalist, tambourine. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Elliott as lead guitarist, backing vocals and occasional lead vocals. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Meagher as bassist and backing vocals (1964- 1967, 1974)\n\nDeclan Mulligan as the rhythm guitarist, backing vocals and harmonica.(1964- 1965, 1974-75)\n\nJohn Peterson as the drummer. (1964- 1966, 1974-75)\n\nThe subsequent members of The Beau Brummels include\n\nDon Irving as guitarist and backing vocals. (1965-1966)\n\nDan Levitt played the banjo and guitar (1974-1975)\n\nPeter Tepp played the drums for their 1975 tour.\n\nAs much as they tried to keep it together, the band naturally went through changes in personnel over time. Mulligan left the band in 1965 and was replaced by Don Irving.\n\nElliott left the group next as he constantly suffered seizures due to his diabetic condition. So he had difficulty touring with the band.\n\nIn 1966, Irving got inducted into the armed forces so had to leave. Peterson left the band to join Harpers Bizarre. Meagher was also drafted into the military.\n\nIn 1974, four of the original members with a new member came together to work on another album which was then released in 1975.\n\nWhere are they?\n\nAfter recording a self-titled studio album that was released in 1975, The Beau Brummels members split up again but continued to appear in several incarnations between the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. They featured in shows alongside The Dinosaurs, The Smithereens, and performed at shows like the Baypop Festival 2000, Summer of Love Festival 2002.\n\nDespite the band split of several years, Valentino didn\u2019t release his first solo album until 2006. The album was titled Dreamin\u2019 Man and he went ahead to release two more solo albums in late 2006 and 2008. Unfortunately, John Peterson died on the 11th of November 2007 due to a heart attack.\n\nAs recently as 2013, the original band members came together again to record a studio album that was released on Bay Sound Records in March. The new album contained fifteen songs written by Elliott and some drum tracks recorded by late Peterson in 1965. They did the re-recording of some of their well-known songs including \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d, \u201cJust a Little\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d.\n\nAlthough the band members continue to concentrate on their individual lives and careers, the band remains a favorite for Classic Rock Lovers."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/ron-meagher/", "page_content": "Ron Meagher (born October 2, 1941, Oakland, California, USA) is best known as bassist of American rock band The Beau Brummels.

The band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar and main songwriter), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). The Beau Brummels were discovered by Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewart\u2014later known as Sly Stone\u2014produced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music, and has been described as early and influential folk rock. Much like their contemporaries, The Byrds, their early music drew comparisons to the Beatles. Their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.\n\nThe Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single, \"Laugh, Laugh\", for which they would later be credited for setting the aesthetic foundation for the San Francisco Sound. The band's popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965's Introducing the Beau Brummels, and the Top 10 single \"Just a Little\". The group's commercial success declined by the following year, at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. After recording an album of cover songs, Beau Brummels '66, the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums: Triangle in 1967 and Bradley's Barn in 1968.\n\nThe band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan's departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66, Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre, reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of Triangle. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members. The duo worked with prominent Nashville session musicians to record Bradley's Barn before parting ways in 1969 to focus on solo material and participate in projects by other artists. The five original Beau Brummels reformed in 1974, and the band released an eponymous album the following year."}, {"url": "https://mentalitch.com/the-history-of-the-beau-brummels/", "page_content": "The Beau Brummels are an American 1960s pop rock band originating from California in the early 1960s. The initial lineup consisted of lead singer Sal Valentino, guitarists Ron Elliott and Declan Mulligan, bassist Ron Meagher and drummer John Petersen. They were initially known for their beat music/pop sound that was reminiscent of the British Invasion bands, but later in their career they defined their own style by incorporating country, folk, garage and psychedelic rock, making them one of the key pioneers of the \u2018San Francisco Sound\u2019 in the 1960s. The band broke into the charts with \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d and went up a notch higher there with \u201cJust A Little.\u201d They were a talented and promising band who stressed importance on original content. However, Autumn label was financially too small to be able to promote their records on a national scale; it was later sold to Warner Bros. Records, who later ordered the band to record an album of Top 40 hits at the time, although the Brummels\u2019 original material, while considered their strengths, was ignored by the label. Then the band released two albums, Triangle (1967) and the country-infused Bradley\u2019s Barn (1968) \u2013 both of which were applauded by the critics. The band also underwent personnel shifts, due to Ron Elliott\u2019s illness (Don Irving came to replace him), while Meagher and Petersen left for military service. In 1974, the four original Brummels members (plus one new member) got together to record their self-titled album in 1975 before fading from the limelight, with each of the members pursuing other musical projects. In 2013, the remaining original members resurfaced to record their latest album Continuum.\n\nFormation\n\nThe origins of Beau Brummels were from San Francisco, California. Sal Valentino (lead vocals, tambourine) and childhood friend Ron Elliot (lead guitar, vocals, and songwriting) as well as other musicians Declan Mulligan (guitars, vocals), Ron Meagher (bass) and John Petersen (drums) were regular performers at a local club El Cid. Then they moved to a more lucrative gig at another club Morocco Room, in the neighboring city of San Mateo. Meanwhile, disc jockeys Tom Donhaue and Bobby Mitchell were looking for fresh new talents for their just-established label Autumn Records. After being invited by the club\u2019s owner to see the Beau Brummels play, the two men came to the Morocco Club and watched one of the band\u2019s performances. Autumn Records signed the Beau Brummels right away, making them one of the label\u2019s first artists. Sly Stewart \u2014 who would later be known as Sly Stone of the famed R&B/funk band Sly and the Family Stone \u2014 was the producer of the Brummels\u2019 early recordings\n\nRise to popularity\n\nThe Beau Brummels released their first single in late 1964, \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d which was written by Elliott. The single was the first to emerge from the Bay Area as an answer to the British Invasion, which was dominating the US music scene at that time. \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d drew strong comparisons to the British Invasion groups particularly the Beatles and the Zombies, and its combination of folk, rock and beat music was seen as unprecedented, even before the arrival of The Byrds\u2019 \u201cMr. Tambourine Man\u201d. \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d became the Beau Brummels\u2019 first hit, peaking at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100. It predated the release of the group\u2019s debut LP Introducing the Beau Brummels which came out in April 1965.\n\nThe album\u2019s second single \u201cJust a Little\u201d had been co-written by Elliot and his frequent songwriting partner Bob Durand, and was released around the same time their album came out. \u201cJust a Little\u201d became the Beau Brummels\u2019 best-performing single, reaching its peak position at #8 on the pop chart. Introducing the Beau Brummels stalled at #24 on the Billboard 200 album chart.\n\nAt the height of the band\u2019s popularity, the Beau Brummels were seen as teen idols. To capitalize on their new found fame, the band appeared on several television productions such as American Bandstand, Shindig!, Hullabaloo and the cartoon series The Flintstones (as the animated version of themselves, the Beau Brummelstones). They appeared in movies as well, such as Village of the Giantsand Wild, Wild Winter.\n\nLater career"}, {"url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Declan-Mulligan-original-member-of-the-Beau-16613940.php", "page_content": "\u201cLaugh, Laugh,\u201d the hit single by the Beau Brummels band, begins with a mournful harmonica warble that recurs throughout the brief 1964 ballad.\n\nThat harmonica was played by Declan Mulligan, an Irish singer, guitarist, bassist and original member of a band that considered a foundation for what became know as the San Francisco sound in the 1960s.\n\nMulligan lasted less than a year with the Beau Brummels, but that included a second hit single, \u201cJust a Little,\u201d an album, \u201cIntroducing the Beau Brummels,\u201d and TV performances on Dick Clark\u2019s \u201cWhere the Action Is,\u201d \u201cShindig!\u201d and \u201cHulabaloo.\u201d In the highest form of flattery, Mulligan and his mates were depicted as the Beau Brummelstones in the Flintstones episode \u201cShinrock a Go-Go.\u201d\n\nThe Brummels faded fast but resurfaced in the mid-1970s with Mulligan back in the act. A reunion album, \u201cBeau Brummels,\u201d was released in 1975 with Mulligan playing a larger role on guitar and vocals. Various iterations of the band, with Mulligan out front, were regulars at the Abbey Tavern in San Francisco.\n\nMulligan died Nov. 2 at his home in Petaluma, said his wife, Tanya Mulligan. He suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and had a series of strokes. He was 83.\n\n\u201cPeople give bands like the Byrds and the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful credit for adapting the British influence into an American theme,\u201d said Alec Palao, a British reissue producer and archivist living in El Cerrito. \u201cBut the Brummels were ahead of all the others. They were the first American band to respond to the British invasion with innovation rather than imitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d was a top 20 single, and \u201cJust a Little\u201d cracked the top 10. He was a major presence in concert, adding dance licks and stage moves that ramped up the excitement.\n\n\u201cHe brought a new enthusiasm that you didn\u2019t normally find in American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll at that time,\u201d Palao said. But he had ambition to be a lead singer, an avenue that wasn\u2019t open to him in the Brummels, which was led by songwriter Ron Elliott and lead singer Sal Valentino. Mulligan went back to Ireland but returned to front a variety of bands he formed \u2014 the Samuele Peeps, Black Velvet Band, Mulligan Stew and the Californians, which toured England and Ireland, according to his wife.\n\n\u201cDeclan was a good man and more mature than the rest of us,\u201d said Valentino, who played later with Mulligan at both the Abbey Tavern and Shannon Arms, classic Irish bars on San Francisco\u2019s west side. He was still performing until five years ago, when he suffered a fall and lost the use of his left arm.\n\nAll the while he worked full time as a counselor and music teacher for adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities at Cedars of Marin, a nonprofit in Ross. Mulligan, known there by the first name John and in the music scene as Dec, started as a driver for the medical department and then moved to the Community Connections Program, which involved taking clients on field trips.\n\nEvery week for nearly 20 years, Mulligan took clients to a music studio in Novato where he\u2019d teach them to drum and sing while he played guitar or piano \u2014 and led the vocals. Favorites included \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d and \u201cShe Loves You\u201d by the Beatles, and \u201cEdelweiss\u201d from \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just one big glorious event with people singing and banging on drums,\u201d said Susan Francis, a community connections instructor at Cedars. \u201cJohn just made it so wonderful and entertaining for the clients.\u201d\n\nAround the Cedars campus and among the Ross neighbors, Mulligan was known for his blarney, with a joke and a laugh for everyone. He even wrote songs that he played for the staff. He retired four years ago, and clients still ask about him. So do the neighbors and customers at Comforts, the San Anselmo cafe where he stopped on his way to work for coffee and a half-hour chat.\n\n\u201cEveryone just loved him,\u201d Francis said. \u201cHe was a very, very popular guy.\u201d\n\nJohn Declan Mulligan was born April 8, 1938, in Fethard, Tipperary County, and raised in a house built by his grandfather. Known as \u201cDec\u201d or \u201cDeco\u201d from childhood, he attended boarding school at Rockwell and attended University College in Dublin. But most of his time was spent watching American Westerns and riding ponies pretending he was Will Rogers. After his uncle returned from a trip to the U.S. with a guitar, he pretended he was Elvis Presley.\n\nMulligan first immigrated to Toronto, where he became an insurance agent, the career of his father. He then came to San Francisco to work at the Fireman\u2019s Fund insurance company in Laurel Heights. He gravitated to the Irish dances in the Sunset. At one of these events, he heard Elliott and John Petersen performing. That was the start of the Beau Brummels, which first went by the name the Irish Californians even though Mulligan was the only Irishman in the band.\n\nThe band got its start at the Morocco Room on El Camino Real in San Mateo. A demo started circulating about \u201ca band that was tearing it up on the Peninsula,\u201d and that demo caught the ear of Tom Donahue, the Big Daddy disc jockey on KYA radio. Donahue, who had his own record label, Autumn Records, went down with his producer, Sylvester Stewart, and the band was signed on the spot, Palao said.\n\nStewart, who went on to adopt the stage name Sly Stone and form his own act Sly and the Family Stone, produced \u201cLaugh, Laugh,\u201d and every track that Mulligan played on. Donahue used his power in the industry to promote the single nationwide. DJs would intimate that this was a new British band.\n\n\u201cIf \u2018Laugh, Laugh\u2019 hadn\u2019t been released on some small San Francisco independent label, it would have been a No. 1 record,\u201d said rock \u2019n\u2019 roll author and former Chronicle pop music critic Joel Selvin. \u201cDec\u2019s haunting harmonica part gave the song its key musical hook, floating through the track like a stream.\u201d\n\nIn 1965, when the Beau Brummels were at their peak and both \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d and \u201cJust a Little\u201d were in heavy radio rotation, 16-year-old Tanya Goodhill was sent to DJ\u2019s nightclub in North Beach to interview the band for the Washington Eagle, the school paper at George Washington High School in the Richmond District, where she was a junior.\n\nTanya\u2019s mother insisted she come along for the interview. The band was rehearsing, and only Mulligan bothered to come down off the stage and meet them. Goodhill\u2019s mother, Monica, was so charmed that she invited him over for dinner.\n\nNothing happened for another 25 years, until both she and Mulligan had been married and divorced with five kids from previous relationships. They were married in San Francisco in 1991 and later moved to Petaluma.\n\n\u201cIt was a real love story, and it has been like that ever since,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile working full time at Cedars, Mulligan became a scratch golfer and kept writing music. A single, \u201cNative Son,\u201d co-written by Mulligan and Vince Welnick of the Tubes, was released as a B-side single by the Brummels in 1983.\n\nThe band lives on, and an eight-CD remastered box set titled \u201cThe Beau Brummels \u2014 Turn Around: The Complete Recordings 1964-1970\u201d has been released. It includes songs written and sung by Mulligan that never made it past the demo stage.\n\n\u201cDec\u2019s importance to the early days of the Beau Brummels is clearly reflected in the recordings that can be heard on this set,\u201d Palao said. \u201cHis enthusiasm in the recording studio is there for all to hear.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe campaign was set up to defray the cost of medical expenses. In addition to his wife of 31 years, Mulligan is survived by a son, Sean Mulligan; stepsons, Sean Winkel of Chico, Jason Winkel of Forest Knolls and Scott Winkel of Raleigh, N.C.; stepdaughter, Ali Galetti of San Anselmo; four grandchildren; and his shih tzu, Ivan.\n\nSam Whiting is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
