Ananda Bose, who assumes the challenging position of governor of the politically sensitive state of West Bengal, is no ordinary politician but carries the reputation of being an innovator in his distinguished civil services career. The 71-year-old former bureaucrat is a retired Union secretary who has made a mark wherever he worked. Bose joined the IAS in 1977 in the Kerala cadre and has held the offices of university vice-chancellor, additional chief secretary and district collector in Kerala.\n\nA prolific writer and columnist, Bose has published 40 books in English, Malayalam and Hindi, including novels, short stories, poems and essays. He is a recipient of 29 international and national awards for his outstanding contribution in various fields. He served as chairman of the working group that prepared the national development agenda for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBorn on January 2, 1951, in Mannanam village in Kottayam district of Kerala, Ananda Bose\u2019s father P.K. Vasudevan Nair was a freedom fighter and follower of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It was Nair who added \u2018Bose\u2019 to his son\u2019s name.\n\nIn his early career, Ananda Bose was an English lecturer. He subsequently joined the State Bank group of banks as a probationary officer in Bengal and worked in the remote areas. He joined the IAS at the age of 26.\n\nDuring his tenure as the sub-collector of Kasargod, Bose, in 1978, initiated Gramotsav, a festival celebrating the culture and art forms of villages. The idea got replicated across Kerala and even today, the event forms an important part of the state\u2019s tourism calendar.\n\nAs the district collector of Kollam, Bose, in 1985, founded the Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra to provide cost-effective and environment-friendly housing solutions to the people. The initiative later became a part of the national housing policy. \u201cHis greatest contribution has been to introduce low-cost housing technology to Kerala. He did it brilliantly with the support of Sarala Gopalan, then revenue secretary of Kerala,\u201d says S.M. Vijayanand, former chief secretary of Kerala and former Kollam district collector.\n\nDuring his first meeting with Narendra Modi in 2014, while the latter was Gujarat chief minister, Bose introduced the idea and submitted a proposal. His ideas had also impressed former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who called him an \u2018inspired\u2019 civil servant.\n\nBose joined the BJP in 2019 but staying away from the local politics of Kerala, he networked with national leaders. After the 2021 Kerala assembly poll, PM Modi had sought his suggestions to revive the BJP in the state. His report did not go down well with the current BJP leadership in Kerala. But Bose has survived their annoyance and now got governorship of a critical state like Bengal, where former governor and current vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar had several confrontations with the Trinamool Congress government. \u201cAnanda Bose\u2019s appointment as Bengal governor will make Kerala BJP leaders more uncomfortable,\u201d says a senior BJP leader from Kerala.\n\nSubscribe to

V. Ananda Bose, IAS, a Secretary level officer of the Government of India serving as the Administrator, National Museum, and Vice-Chancellor, National Museum Institute, has the spotlight firmly trained on him. Not surprising, for this bureaucrat heads the five-member panel appointed by the Supreme Court to assess the wealth in the cellars of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple.\n\nAnanda Bose was not ready to reveal his findings but said that his mission was to make a scientific plan that would help assess the wealth in the vaults. When asked whether the artefacts of historical and archaeological value would be moved to a museum, he said, \u201cThat is one of the mandates of the Supreme Court. Assessing the value of these artefacts is tough. How can one put a price on these priceless antiques? In the National Museum, we have the famous Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-Daro. What price can we put on something like this? It's only when we take some of them for exhibitions abroad, for the sake of insurance, that we put a price tag on them. We have now decided not to take the AA category artefacts out of the museum after one of them got damaged a bit,\u201d informs Ananda Bose, who has consistently attempted to think out-of-the-box, made innovative decisions.\n\nIn his three plus decades in service Ananda Bose has proved that he is game for challenges and his administrative innovations, like Nirmithi Kendra, the cost-effective housing solution, that has won international recognition and the District Tourism Promotion Council have made a perceptible impact in society.\n\nConcept changing\n\nYet, the latest appointment made him a bit apprehensive. But he got cracking quickly. He called on experts, understood the urgent needs and has now started work on a slew of projects. \u201cThe concept of museums is changing. Museums can longer be an abode of dead artefacts. They must function as a hub for disseminating knowledge, of cultural activities. We have embarked on projects that will transform our museums,\u201d informs Ananda Bose.\n\nOne important project that Ananda Bose is piloting is the People's Museum. \u201cAs I said, museums should connect with the people. They must act as a bridge between the past and future through the present. Museum activities, as this project envisions, moves out of the limits of the secure museum space right into the middle of the people. There are three segments here, like the campus museums, community museums and the panchayats museum. The National Museum will provide these museums authenticated replicas to exhibit. But they will also have to replenish the stock by collecting antiques from within the local area that has relevance to the culture and heritage of the place.\u201d\n\nThese museums will also function as a centre for cultural activities with performances from the local artistes, painting and sculpture workshops. Initiatives have been taken by various states including Kerala. Museums in the country, a large majority of them at least, lack basic visitor amenities. They do not have information desks, book and souvenir shops, audio tours, restaurants or cafes, ramps for the aged etc.\n\n\u201cYes, this is true. We have now embarked on a mission to upgrade our museums. In fact, the National Museum is in the process of a makeover. It will be a complete renovation and our aim is to make it one of the best, internationally. We will include the best of talent in museology, architecture and interior decoration for this. Some of the other museums like the Chattrapati Sivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Mumbai, Indian Museum, Kolkata, The Salarjung Museum, Hyderabad, and some others are also in the process of modernisation.\u201d\n\nBarrier-free museums\n\nAnanda Bose also hinted at some of the other innovations he proposed to introduce at these renovated museums. \u201cWe will make the museums barrier-free. There will be ramps to give easy access to the aged and physically challenged. We have already put in place a system to enable the visually-impaired to walk through and appreciate art at the National Museum. We have installed monograms, signs and Braille inscriptions to make objects in the museum visually-impaired-friendly. .\u201d\n\nAnother significant project Anand Bose is working on is upgrading the National Museum Institute into a cultural university. \u201cThe proposal has been accepted by the Human Resource Development Ministry, a detailed project has been finalised; the department has given the go ahead. It requires legislation, detailing has to be done.\u201d This is part of the two projects that are going to be upgraded, the other being the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Sports, Sriperumbudur."}]}
