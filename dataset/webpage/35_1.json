For example, in a move still hailed by state troopers two decades later, Mr. Flanagan went after foreign envoys who would race along the highway and invoke diplomatic immunity when caught. Because he could not punish them, he decided he would kick them off the road.\n\nThe bold policy - applauded across the country - prompted the State Department to determine that diplomatic immunity did not extend to traffic violations and left officials free to issue summonses.\n\nWhat his colleagues say they will miss most is his affable nature, even temper and the knowledge that his door is always open. What Mr. Flanagan will miss most is the day-to-day routine.\n\nThere have been exciting moments. Like the day in 1967 when Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin of the Soviet Union met President Lyndon B. Johnson at Glassboro State College and two Soviet chauffeurs had a little too much applejack. Or the one in February 1981 when he accompanied a heavily armed military convoy carrying $1 billion in gold bullion being returned to Iran after the hostages were released.\n\nBut the most rewarding part of the job, he said, has been relationships with his associates and working with all types of people, from union officials, legislators and bankers to contractors and restaurant and gasoline concessionaires.\n\nOne thing he will not miss is the 3 A.M. ring of his bedside telephone. (He has instructed the police to call him if there is a serious accident.) Nor does he mind leaving behind the bureaucratic process of permit reviews, which is one of the reasons he left the job and its $139,600 annual salary, the second-highest in state government. (The highest-paid job is that of chief executive officer of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The $165,000-a-year post is currently held by Robert E. Mulcahey Jr. The Governor gets $85,000 a year.) In fact, Mr. Flangan might have stayed around if the authority's $2.2 billion expansion project had not become mired in Federal reviews. Construction on the first 11 miles, from East Brunswick to Monroe, is already under way. The rest, expected to cost more than $1.7 billion, may not begin for two more years and will be left to his successor, Frank B. Holman, former chairman and executive director of the state Republican Committee.\n\nOver the last few months Mr. Flanagan has spent his days in meetings with Mr. Holman, who started work Dec. 7. Between trying to transfer more than 25 years of knowledge and finishing up last-minute projects he has mulled over nine job offers and rejected most because he does not want to work full time (he will still serve as a consultant to the authority).\n\nLike many retirees, he plans to travel. One of his first stops will be China. Not really one for sightseeing, he will, instead, help the Chinese build their first toll road - from Beijing to a port city 88 miles away. After that? ''It's anyone's guess,'' he said. ''But I read about this developer in Hong Kong who wants to model a highway after the turnpike. I'll definitely give him a call.''"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/William_J._Flanagan_Jr.", "page_content": "What we do.

Born and raised in Alberta, he has been recognized for his transformative and entrepreneurial leadership.\n\nAs soon as he was appointed, President Flanagan launched the largest and most ambitious program of academic and administrative restructuring ever undertaken by a Canadian university. With a vision for the University of Alberta for Tomorrow (UAT), he set the goal of turning the university\u2019s acute financial pressures into a strategic transformation, repositioning the U of A for long-term success.\n\nWith the creation of an entirely new and university-wide operating model, UAT dramatically enhanced the efficiency of administrative services through the establishment of shared service centres and the introduction of new technologies. By 2023, the U of A will have permanently reduced its administrative costs by $127 million annually.\n\nWith the establishment of three new colleges \u2014 the College of Social Sciences and Humanities, the College of Natural and Applied Science, and the College of Health Sciences \u2014 the university grouped 13 existing faculties into three discipline-aligned colleges, with the goal of elevating interdisciplinary teaching and research with global impacts. With a more dynamic, nimble and aligned academic structure, the university is now positioned to be an even stronger driver of economic growth, innovation and creativity in Alberta, Canada and the world.\n\nWith UAT, a significantly higher proportion of funding and resources now goes directly into classrooms and research, generating greater impact while enabling the university to more quickly and collaboratively drive international research opportunities that address the world\u2019s greatest challenges.\n\nThe transformation and associated savings achieved under UAT since 2020 are unprecedented in Canadian post-secondary history. The University of Alberta is now more sustainable, poised for ambitious enrolment growth and prepared to lead globally with purpose. Amid these profound changes, the university has continued to advance in international rankings, recently placing fifth in Canada and 92nd in the world \u2014 its best showing ever. The University of Alberta also ranked 11th globally in the 2022 Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, which assesses universities\u2019 impact in relation to the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nPrior to his appointment at the U of A, President Flanagan served as dean of law from 2005 to 2019 at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ont. Through his transformative vision during his tenure, he led major initiatives elevating the delivery of education in law: the establishment of the faculty\u2019s PhD program; the founding of the Centre for Law in the Contemporary Workplace; a major expansion of the business law program; an online undergraduate Certificate in Law Program; an online Graduate Diploma in Legal Services Management, and a new online Graduate Diploma in Immigration and Citizenship Law.\n\nIn addition to his academic leadership roles, President Flanagan has an extensive record of service and engagement in the broader community. His dedicated work in support of HIV/AIDS research and initiatives has made him a well-recognized and respected public figure. He is the former chair and a current director of the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research\u2019s National Working Group and served as board chair of the AIDS Committee of Toronto \u2014 Canada\u2019s largest community-based HIV service organization \u2014 as well as on the Ontario HIV Treatment Network and Canada AIDS Russia Project. In recognition of his community service, he was named to the Honour Roll of the Ontario AIDS Network in 2011.\n\nCurrently, President Flanagan is a member of the Universities Canada Research Committee. From 2011 to 2014, he was president of the Council of Canadian Law Deans and served on the National Action Committee on Access to Justice in Civil and Family Matters.\n\nPresident Flanagan holds a BA (English and Philosophy) from Carleton University, a JD from the University of Toronto, a DEA in International Economic Law from Universit\u00e9 Paris I-Sorbonne, and an LLM from Columbia University. He joined the Faculty of Law at Queen\u2019s University in 1991, where he founded the faculty\u2019s International Law Program at the Queen\u2019s University Bader International Study Centre at Herstmonceux Castle in the U.K. His scholarly work spans property law, corporate law and international trade law.\n\nBill Flanagan is married to his husband Saffron Sri, a registered dietitian who works in the healthcare sector.\n\nBiographie de Bill Flanagan\n\nBill Flanagan est devenu le 14\u00e8me pr\u00e9sident et vice-chancelier de l'Universit\u00e9 de l'Alberta en juillet 2020.
