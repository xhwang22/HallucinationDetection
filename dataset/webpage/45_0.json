The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Twila-Shively", "page_content": "Twila Shively [\u2033Twi\u2033] (March 20, 1920 \u2013 November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player.

Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78) hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45) and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches) and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana.

An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m), 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\n\nTwila Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (n\u00e9e Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with this headline: \u201cShe\u2019s Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\u201d.\n\nIn 1944 Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78) hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45) and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches) and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years.\n\nTwila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer.\n\nShe is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nBatting\n\nGP AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI SB BB TB SO BA OBP SLG 614 2141 274 429 42 20 4 166 255 523 291 322 .200 .296 .244\n\nFielding"}, {"url": "https://aagpbl.org/profiles/twila-shively-twi/542", "page_content": "\u201cTwi\u201d played softball in the Chicago softball leagues as early as 1942 when a headline in the Chicago Daily News said that she \u201cLooks Like a Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb, and Has Baseball \u2018Savvy\u2019 Plus a Pretty Face.\u201d Twi was a member of Chicago\u2019s National Girls Baseball League\u2019s (NGBL) Rockola Music Maids team in 1944. The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://tenniscompanion.org/american-tennis-players/", "page_content": "American Male Tennis Players\n\nFrom John McEnroe to Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Arthur Ashe, American men are some of the most recognizable names in tennis.\n\nHowever, well before any of these players were alive, Bill Tilden and Don Budge were among a strong contingent of American tennis players making a name for themselves.\n\nKeep reading to explore the most influential retired male tennis players from the United States, including their most noteworthy accomplishments.\n\nJimmy Connors\n\nAmerican, Jimmy Connors, is one of the best ever to play the game, highlighted by his success at Grand Slams. He claimed eight victories in singles, a number he could have extended further if he wasn\u2019t banned from the French Open from 1974 to 1978 due to his participation in World Team Tennis, which had scheduling conflicts with the ATP.\n\nHe also only played the Australian Open twice, which was pretty typical until the mid-1980s for American tennis players because of the distance.\n\nJimmy had a stellar career record of 1274-283 for an 81.8% winning record. He also was successful in doubles, having claimed titles at Wimbledon and the US Open. In July of 1974, he ascended to world No. 1, which he held for 268 weeks in his career, 84 consecutive.\n\nJimmy Connors has coached Andy Roddick, Maria Sharapova, and Eugenie Bouchard, which helped maintain his post-retirement exposure in the tennis world.\n\nBirthday September 2, 1952 Retired 1996 Height 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) Hall of Fame 1998 Highest Rank 1 Career Titles 109 singles / 16 doubles Grand Slam Titles 8 singles / 2 doubles Olympic Medals \u2013\n\nJohn McEnroe\n\nAs famous for saying, \u201cyou cannot be serious\u201d at Wimbledon in 1981 as he is for his success on the court, John McEnroe is one of the game\u2019s best.\n\nMcEnroe claimed seven singles and nine doubles titles at Grand Slam events during his career, with all of those titles coming at the US Open and Wimbledon.

Shriver and regular doubles partner Martina Navratilova are the only women's pair to complete the Grand Slam in a calendar year, winning all four majors in 1984. She was ranked as high was world No. 3 in singles, and world No. 1 in doubles.Playing styleShriver was well known for her variety, including sharp volleys and all-round solid technique at the net. She also possessed a strong slice forehand and underspin approach, which set her apart from the rest of the women's field, but she had a comparatively weak chip backhand. She was known for being a serve-and-volleyer.CareerShriver first came to prominence at the 1978 US Open where, as a 16-year-old amateur, she reached the women's singles final. She defeated the reigning Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova in a semifinal. Shriver then lost to Chris Evert in the final.

Listed at 5 ft 6 in (168 m), 128 pounds, she batted and threw right-handed. Twila Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with this headline: \u201cShe\u2019s Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\u201d. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars. Shively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field Shively collected a.196 batting average and a.276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a.968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies\" Penny O\"Brian (236). Her most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (247), runs scored (78) hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45) and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches) and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit\"s players averaged under.200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the.300 mark (316). She also coached the school\"s softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer\"s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Twila_Shively", "page_content": "Twila I. Shively\n\nBats Right, Throws Right\n\nRight, Right Height 5' 6\", Weight 128 lb.\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nTwila Shively played six years in the AAGPBL for three different teams.\n\nShe debuted in 1945 and hit .196/.280/.234 with 46 steals in 106 games for the Grand Rapids Chicks. She led AAGPBL outfielders with 234 putouts. She was also 5th in the league in steals behind Sophie Kurys, Helen Callaghan, Dottie Kamenshek and Shirley Jameson. She was 1 for 10 in the postseason. Her best season came in 1946, when she hit .247/.340/.296 with 75 stolen bases and 78 runs in 111 contests for the Chicks. She was third in outfield putouts (213), 4th in assists (17), tied for the lead in double plays (5) and 4th among starters in fielding percentage (.969). She also was among the offensive leaders in total bases (121, between Betsy Jochum and Thelma Eisen), hits (101, 9th between Eleanor Dapkus and Jochum, tied for 9th in doubles (9) and tied for third in runs (even with Kamenshek, trailing Kurys and Lib Mahon). In the playoffs, she was Grand Rapids' top hitter at .286 but they fell 3 games to 2 to the Rockford Peaches in the first round.\n\nShively batted .206/.266/.249 with 51 swipes in 1947. In the playoffs' first round, she was 4 for 17. In the finals, she was only 4 for 24 but stole a team-high 8 bases as Grand Rapids beat the Racine Belles in 7 games. In 1948, she was reassigned to the Chicago Colleens, a new team. The AAGPBL executives thought she would be a big draw because she had played with the Rockolas for the National Girls Baseball League in Chicago in 1944. She resented the move, liking her Grand Rapids club. She didn't even finish up 1948 in Chicago, also playing for the Peoria Redwings, and producing far below her 1945-1946 level at .156/.302/.190 with 36 steals.\n\nMoving to first base with Peoria in 1949, the Decatur native made 35 errors and hit only .187/.304/.222 with 18 steals. She ended up with the 1950 Redwings at .192/.287/.252 with 29 stolen bases, returning to her traditional outfield spot. Overall, she had hit .200/.296/.244 with 255 steals and 274 runs in 614 games.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a physical education teacher and coach (softball and volleyball) at Washington High School for 30 years. She later was a volunteer for Meals on Wheels. She died due to complications from Alzheimers."}]}
