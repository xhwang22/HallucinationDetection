{"Raymond Harry Brown was an Australian-born American physicist and inventor.": [{"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/raymond-harry-brown/", "page_content": "Raymond Harry \"Ray\" Brown (born November 7, 1946) is an American composer, arranger, trumpet player, and jazz educator. He has performed as trumpet player and arranged music for Stan Kenton (early 1970s), Bill Watrous, Bill Berry, Frank Capp \u2013 Nat Pierce (Juggernaut Big Band), and the Full Faith and Credit Big Band.\n\nBrown joined Kenton in September 1971, succeeding Gary Lee Pack [b. 1950; Director of Jazz Studies (retired), University of Southern Maine], holding the jazz trumpet chair and serving as an improv clinician. The Kenton trumpet section included Mike Vax, Jay Saunders, and Dennis Noday. Brown also contributed arrangements for Kenton, including \"Mi Burrito\" and \"Neverbird.\" Brown remained with the Kenton Orchestra until November 1972.\n\nBefore joining the Kenton Orchestra, Brown had served as arranger and trumpeter with the Studio Band of The United States Army Field Band at Fort Meade, Maryland (1968\u201371). His tenure with the Army Band and Kenton coincided closely with that of Jay Saunders \u2014 trumpet player, and jazz educator, who, while with the Kenton Orchestra, eventually played lead trumpet.\n\nBrown also has performed with Mundell Lowe, Leroy Vinnegar, Ray Brown (jazz double-bassist), Thad Jones, Jimmy Heath, Steve Gadd, and Billy Hart.\n\nBrown conducted the recording session of the Roy Hargrove Quintet entitled Roy Hargrove with Strings, Moment to Moment, released May 2000 on Verve. He has appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival frequently as conductor of his wife Susan Cahill Brown's Monterey Jazz Festival Chamber Orchestra in collaboration with Charlie Haden, Kenny Barron, Michael Brecker, Ralph Towner, Gary Burton, and Terence Blanchard.\n\nBrown currently leads his own big band, the Great Big Band, which has performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival, the San Jose Jazz Festival, the Santa Cruz Jazz Festival, the Lake Tahoe Music Festival, as well as jazz venues in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nRay is currently on the faculty of Cabrillo College in Aptos, California, teaching Jazz improvisation, arranging, and Jazz ensembles.\n\nFormal education\n\n1964 \u2014 Graduated Freeport High School (New York)\n\n1968 \u2014 Bachelor of Music, Ithaca College School of Music (attended 1964-68)\n\n19?? \u2014 Master of Science, C.W.

Susan holds a Bachelor of Music from Ithaca College (1971) and a Master of Fine Arts from Sarah Lawrence College (1974), where she studied with Dorothy DeLay. She also did post grad work at the University of Colorado (1975). Ray and Sue were married Aug 26, 1973, and together, they have three daughters, one of whom, Karin, is a violinist and is married to cellist Daniel Levitov. Karin earned degrees in music from Oberlin Conservatory of Music (1998) and Juilliard. Daniel is a member of the preparatory faculty at the Peabody Institute.\n\nRay, born 1946 in Oceanside, New York, grew up in Freeport, New York. He has three older brothers, Glenn Edward Brown (1937\u20132007), Stephen Charles Brown, Roger V. Brown and a younger sister, Jeanne De Martino.\n\nGlenn taught music for 28 years.\n\nSteve is a jazz guitarist, bassist, drummer, composer, and arranger. For 45 years, Steve was professor of music and director of jazz studies at the Ithaca College School of Music (retired 2008). One of Steve's many life achievements is that he formalized jazz studies in 1968 at Ithaca College School of Music, a long-standing, well-known music institution within a well-known liberal arts college that was founded in 1892 solely as a conservatory of music.\n\nRoger, a civil engineer, played bass. He did two tours with Astrud Gilberto.\n\nJeanne, a pre-school teacher, played flute.\n\nGlenn, Steve, and Ray all earned music degrees from Ithaca College \u2013 Steve: Bachelor of Music (1964) and a Master of Music (1968); Ray: Bachelor of Music (1968). Ray's nephew (Steve's son) \u2013 Miles Brown \u2013 is a jazz bassist, performer, and music educator.\n\nRay's father, Glenn Earl Brown (1914\u20131965; 1936 graduate of Ithaca College School of Music), was the District Music Supervisor of Public Schools for Long Beach, New York. He was also director of bands at Long Beach Jr. Sr. High School from 1938 to 1965. As a pioneer in jazz education at the scholastic level, he introduced stage bands to Long Beach public schools in 1939. He also ran a music camp \u2014 Lake Shore Music Score \u2014 at Lake Winnipesaukee, Center Harbor, New Hampshire. Glenn Brown had been, for more than 14 years, a marimba soloist with the Xavier Cugat Orchestra.\n\nRay's mother, Marie Brown (n\u00e9e Ward) (1916\u20132002), taught English at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside for 28 years, where, before retiring from the Oceanside School District in 1982, she served as curriculum coordinator and English department chairwoman. She earned a Bachelor of Music degree from the Ithaca College School of Music in 1935, where she played piano, saxophone, and clarinet. She also held a Masters in English from Hofstra University.\n\nSelected compositions/arrangements\n\nCompositions/arrangements for the Stan Kenton Orchestra\n\n\u201cCall Me Mister\u201d (Kenton Chart Nos. 565 & 1168)\n\n\u201cHit and Run\u201d \u2013 EP305104 \u00a9 1972 V1718P086 (Kenton Chart No. 488)\n\n\u201cIs There Anything Still There?\u201d \u2013 EP304505 \u00a9 1972 V1718P086 (Kenton Chart No. 800)\n\n\u201cMi Burrito\u201d \u2013 EP354892 \u00a9 1973 V1718P086 (Kenton Chart No. 975)\n\n\u201cNeverbird\u201d (Kenton Chart No. 564)\n\non YouTube\n\nArrangement for the Stan Kenton Orchestra\n\n\u201cAngel Eyes\u201d, Matt Dennis & Tom Adair, arr Ray Brown\n\nOther compositions/arrangements\n\n\u201cRoute 81 North\u201d (arrangement)\n\n\u201cClyde's Glides\u201d\n\n\u201cDouble Fault Blues\u201d\n\n\u201cAfterThoughts\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Opener\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Man Willie\u201d\n\n\u201cTomas Gatos\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur Author\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo Rare T-Bones\u201d\n\n\u201cProcrastination City\u201d \u2013 copyright no.

For his achievements, Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics. As a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University during the late 1960s, he was harshly criticized for advocating the use of selective breeding and sterilization to address what he believed to be the genetically inherited intellectual inferiority of the Black race.\n\nFast Facts: William Shockley Known For: Led the research team that invented the transistor in 1947\n\nLed the research team that invented the transistor in 1947 Born: February 13, 1910 in London, England\n\nFebruary 13, 1910 in London, England Parents: William Hillman Shockley and May Shockley\n\nWilliam Hillman Shockley and May Shockley Died: August 12, 1989 in Stanford, California\n\nAugust 12, 1989 in Stanford, California Education: California Institute of Technology (BA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (PhD)\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (BA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (PhD) Patents: US 2502488 Semiconductor Amplifier; US 2569347 Circuit element utilizing semiconductive material\n\nUS 2502488 Semiconductor Amplifier; US 2569347 Circuit element utilizing semiconductive material Awards and Honors: Nobel Prize in Physics (1956)\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (1956) Spouses: Jean Bailey (divorced 1954), Emmy Lanning\n\nJean Bailey (divorced 1954), Emmy Lanning Children: Alison, William, and Richard\n\nAlison, William, and Richard Notable Quote: \u201cA basic truth that the history of the creation of the transistor reveals is that the foundations of transistor electronics were created by making errors and following hunches that failed to give what was expected.\u201d\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nWilliam Bradford Shockley Jr. was born on February 13, 1910 in London, England to American citizen parents and raised in the family\u2019s home in Palo Alto, California. Both his father, William Hillman Shockley, and his mother, May Shockley were mining engineers. Having grown up around gold mining in the American West, May Shockley had graduated from Stanford University and became the first woman to serve as a U.S. Deputy Minerals Mining Surveyor.\n\nIn 1932, Shockley earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the California Institute of Technology. After getting his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1936, he joined the technical staff of Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, where he started experimenting with electronic semiconductors.\n\nDr. William Shockley at APA Convention, 1971. Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\nShockley married Jean Bailey in 1933. The couple had one daughter, Alison, and two sons, William and Richard before divorcing in 1954. In 1955, Shockley married psychiatric nurse Emmy Lanning, who would stay by his side until his death in 1989.\n\nDuring World War II, Shockley was selected to head the U.S. Navy\u2019s Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Group, working to improve the accuracy of Allied attacks on German U-boats. In July 1945, the U.S. War Department assigned him to conduct an analysis of probable U.S. casualties involved in an invasion of the Japanese mainland. Shockley\u2019s report\u2014projecting from 1.7 million to 4 million U.S. deaths\u2014swayed President Harry S Truman to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, essentially ending the war. For his contributions to the war effort, Shockley was awarded the Navy Medal for Merit in October 1946.\n\nDuring his prime, Shockley was known as an accomplished rock climber who, according to family members, relished the risky activity as a means of sharpening his problem-solving skills. During his early adulthood, he became quite popular, becoming known as a skilled amateur magician and imaginative practical joker.\n\nPath to the Transistor\n\nJust after World War II ended in 1945, Shockley returned to Bell Laboratories where he had been chosen to join physicists Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen in directing the company\u2019s new solid-state physics research and development group. Assisted by physicist Gerald Pearson, chemist Robert Gibney, and electronics expert Hilbert Moore, the group worked on replacing the fragile and failure-prone glass vacuum tubes of the 1920s with smaller and more dependable solid-state alternatives.\n\nVacuum tube & transistor, functional forebearers of semiconductor chips. The LIFE Picture Collection / Getty Images\n\nOn December 23, 1947, after two years of failures, Shockley, Brattain, and Bardeen demonstrated the world\u2019s first successful semiconducting amplifier\u2014the \u201ctransistor.\u201d Bell Labs publicly announced the breakthrough at a press conference on June 30, 1948. In what turned out to be a classic understatement, a company spokesman suggested that the transistor \u201cmay have far-reaching significance in electronics and electrical communication.\u201d Unlike vacuum tubes, transistors required very little power, generated far less heat, and required no warm up time. Most importantly, as they were refined to become \u201cmicrochips\u201d connected in integrated circuits, transistors were capable of performing millions of times more work in millions of times less space.\n\nBy 1950, Shockley had succeeded in making the transistor less costly to manufacture. Soon, transistors were replacing vacuum tubes in radios, televisions, and many other electronic devices. In 1951, at age 41, Shockley became one of the youngest scientists ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1956, Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their research in semiconductors and the invention of the transistor.\n\nPicture dated 1956 of three miniature M-1 transistors seen on the face of a dime. OFF/AFP / Getty Images\n\nShockley would later credit what he called \u201ccreative-failure methodology\u201d for his team\u2019s invention of the transistor. \u201cA basic truth that the history of the creation of the transistor reveals is that the foundations of transistor electronics were created by making errors and following hunches that failed to give what was expected,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nShockley Semiconductor and Silicon Valley\n\nShortly after sharing the Nobel Prize in 1956, Shockley left Bell Labs and moved to Mountain View, California, to pursue his goal of developing the world\u2019s first silicon transistor\u2014the silicon chip. In a one-room Quonset hut at 391 San Antonio Road, he opened the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first high-tech research and development company in what would become known as Silicon Valley.\n\nA sidewalk sculpture in front of the original location of the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View, California. The Shockley four-layer diode is shown. Dicklyon/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain\n\nWhile most transistors being produced at the time, including those Shockley\u2019s team had created at Bell Labs, were made of germanium, researchers at Shockley Semiconductor focused on using silicon. Shockley believed that though silicon was harder to process, it would offer better performance than germanium.\n\nPartly because of Shockley\u2019s increasingly abrasive and unpredictable management style, eight of the brilliant engineers he had hired left Shockley Semiconductor at the end of 1957. Known as the \u201ctraitorous eight,\u201d they founded Fairchild Semiconductor, which soon became an early leader in the semiconductor industry. Over the next 20 years, Fairchild Semiconductor grew to be the incubator of dozens of high-tech corporations, including Silicon Valley giants Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD).\n\nUnable to compete with Fairchild Semiconductor, Shockley left the electronics industry in 1963 to become a professor of engineering sciences at Stanford University. It would be at Stanford where his focus abruptly turned from physics to controversial theories on human intelligence. He argued that uncontrolled breeding among people with inherently low IQs posed a threat to the future of the entire human race. Over time, his theories became increasingly race-based\u2014and exponentially more controversial.\n\nThe Racial Intelligence Gap Controversy\n\nWhile teaching at Stanford, Shockley began to investigate how genetically inherited intelligence might impact the quality of scientific thinking among different racial groups. Arguing that the tendency of people with lower IQs to reproduce more frequently than those with high IQs threatened the future of the entire population, Shockley\u2019s theories became ever more closely aligned with those of the eugenics movement of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe academic world first became most aware of Shockley\u2019s views in January 1965, when the internationally recognized physicist delivered a lecture titled \u201cPopulation Control or Eugenics\u201d at the Nobel Foundation\u2019s conference on \u201cGenetics and the Future of Man\u201d at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota.\n\nIn a 1974 interview on the PBS television series \"Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.,\" Shockley argued that allowing persons of lower intelligence to reproduce freely would eventually lead to \u201cgenetic deterioration\u201d and \u201cevolution in reverse.\u201d Just as controversially, he pitted science against politics in arguing that the Great Society social welfare programs and racial equality policies of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson were ineffective in closing what he perceived as the racial intelligence gap.\n\n(Original Caption) Princeton, N.J.: William Shockley, a Nobel prize-winning physicist, speaks to newsmen here after Roy Innis, general director of the Congress of Racial Equality dropped out of a scheduled debate. Subject of the debate was to be Shockley's controversial view that blacks are genetically less intelligent than whites. Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\n\u201cMy research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro\u2019s intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment,\u201d Shockley stated.\n\nIn the same interview, Shockley suggested a government-sponsored program under which persons with Intelligence Quotients (IQs) below the average of 100 would be paid to take part in what he called a \u201cvoluntary sterilization bonus plan.\u201d Under the plan Buckley called \u201cunspeakable\u201d in the post-Hitler era, persons who volunteered to be sterilized would be given a $1,000 incentive bonus for every point below 100 they scored on a standardized IQ test.\n\nShockley was also the first donor to the Repository for Germinal Choice, a high-tech sperm bank opened in 1980 by millionaire Robert Klark Graham for the purpose of spreading the genes of humanity\u2019s best and brightest. Called the \u201cNobel Prize sperm bank\u201d by the press, Graham\u2019s repository claimed to contain the sperm of three Nobel winners, though Shockley was the only one to publicly announce his donation.\n\nIn 1981, Shockley sued the Atlanta Constitution for libel after the newspaper published an article comparing his voluntary sterilization plan to the human engineering experiments conducted in Nazi Germany. Though he eventually won the suit, the jury awarded Shockley only one dollar in damages.\n\nEven though expressing his views irreparably damaged his scientific and academic reputation, Shockley would recall his research into the effects of genetics on the human race as having been the most important work of his career.\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nIn the wake of the negative reaction to his opinions on genetic racial inferiority, Shockley\u2019s reputation as a scientist was left in shambles and his groundbreaking work in creating the transistor was largely forgotten. Shunning public contact, he secluded himself in his home on the campus of Stanford University. Aside from issuing occasional angry diatribes on his genetics theories, he rarely communicated with anyone but his faithful wife Emmy. He had few friends and had rarely spoken to his son or daughters for over 20 years.\n\nWith his wife Emmy by his side, William Shockley died of prostate cancer at age 79 on August 12, 1989 in Stanford, California. He is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California. His children remained unaware of their father\u2019s death until they read about it in the newspaper.\n\nLegacy\n\nWhile clearly tarnished by his eugenicist views on race, genetics, and intelligence, Shockley\u2019s legacy as one of the fathers of the modern \u201cInformation Age\u201d remains intact. On the 50th anniversary of the invention of the transistor, science writer and biochemist Isaac Asimov called the breakthrough \u201cperhaps the most astonishing revolution of all the scientific revolutions that have taken place in human history.\u201d\n\nVintage illustration of a 1950s portable transistor radio. GraphicaArtis/Getty Images\n\nIt has been suggested that the transistor had as great an impact on daily life as Thomas Edison\u2019s light bulb or Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s telephone had before it. While the pocket-size transistor radios of the 1950s were amazing at the time, they merely foretold the advances that were to come. Indeed, without the transistor, today\u2019s modern marvels like flat-screen TVs, smartphones, personal computers, spacecraft, and of course the internet, would still be the fancy of science fiction.\n\nSources and Further Reference"}, {"url": "https://academicinfluence.com/rankings/people/black-scholars/physicists", "page_content": "Our list of influential Black physicists is as diverse as the field of study. These leaders in the field of physics are conducting research in areas like nuclear research, medicine, astronomy, and more. They are paving the way for the next generation of physicists.\n\nCheck out The Colleges with the Most Influential Black Graduates for a look at influential thought leaders in all fields.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhysics is one of the oldest disciplines and is still seen as foundational for all other areas of science. Among those on our list of influential Black physicists are people who make discoveries in areas such as nuclear power, semiconductors, medicine, astronomy, and more. Physicists who achieve a high degree of influence do so by making breakthroughs and by mentoring younger scientists.\n\nPhysicists are people who study matter and energy. This includes the motion and properties of physical objects and the properties of waves and states of matter. Physicists analyze and predict the behavior of the physical world by making mathematical models, and often work with engineers and those in other fields to develop useful devices. Solid state physicists, also known as condensed matter physicists, study the properties of materials, particularly the materials we need to operate our computers and devices. Medical physicists apply physics to the needs of medicine, and develop the technical foundations of radiology and nuclear medicine. These are just two of the many physics-related subfields that prospective physicists might consider studying.\n\nWhile many important advances in the field of physics have been made by Black physicists, the number of college degrees awarded to Black people in the discipline of physics remains fairly low. According to the American Physicists Society, the number is around 3% of the total physics degrees awarded in the United States. In fact, the numbers have worsened over time.\n\nAccording to Forbes , Black Americans earned more than twice as many STEM degrees as they did 20 years ago. But in physics, the percentage of Black Americans earning Bachelor\u2019s degrees has plummeted over that same interval .\n\nTo discover the reason behind the lack of Black representation in the field of physics, the American Institute of Physics developed a task force called TEAM-UP and conducted their own study of the phenonmenon. The task force identified six major findings and developed recommendations to help boost the number of Black physicists. Essentially, a sense of belonging and a supportive environment were two missing pieces to the puzzle. The report calls for action at every level to affect real positive change.\n\nBlack Physicists Making Important Contributions to the Field Below are highlights of the accomplishments of a few of the 25 influential Black physicists in our ranking: Prominent astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has done research in cosmology, stellar evolution and formation, and galactic astronomy. He is the current director of the Hayden Planetarium, and is known for his popular books on astronomy, his work with NASA, hosting PBS series and talk shows, and developing a space themed video game.\n\nShirley Ann Jackson has served on several advisory boards to the government, has been a delegate to the General Conference of the International Atomic Industry Agency, and has done research in condensed matter physics. Her work is well known in the nuclear research.\n\nSylvester Gates was a pioneering researcher in supersymmetry and supergravity, related to the study of string theory.\n\nMedical physicist Hadiyah-Nicole Green specializes in the development of targeted cancer therapies using lasers and nanoparticles. She has been awarded a grant by the Department of Veteran Affairs, and is the founder of a non-profit cancer research foundation.\n\nFor more the most famous Black scholars of the last 30 years, visit our Influential Black Scholars page.

Howard\n\nSir Harry Percy Brown (1878-1967), engineer, public servant and company director, was born on 28 December 1878 at Hylton, County Durham, England, son of George Brown, a former superintendent of the London Telegraph Office, and his wife Sarah Emma, n\u00e9e Dawson. Educated at Bede College, Durham, and Durham College, Newcastle upon Tyne, he entered the Post Office and advanced quickly. On 28 September 1904 he married Emily Aldous in the Anglican Church of St Andrew, Leytonstone. In 1913, as an adviser to the Indian government, he introduced management by telephone of rail traffic and dock-handling in Calcutta. Next year Brown was made responsible for the technical planning and management of all telephone and telegraph plant in Great Britain. In 1916 he was placed in charge of 'emergency communications' for home defence. This work, which entailed a high degree of inventiveness and improvisation, won him an M.B.E. in 1918.\n\nOn the invitation of the W. M. Hughes government, Brown arrived in Australia late in 1922 to act as technical adviser on a three-man Postal Advisory Committee that had been commissioned to draw up a 'reconstruction' programme for postal and telegraph services. His early work so impressed W. G. Gibson, the postmaster-general, that by December he had manoeuvred the retirement of the secretary of the department, J. Oxenham, and secured Brown's accession as secretary and director. The appointment was initially controversial. The installation of an 'import', on a salary (\u00a32500) well above that of any other Federal public servant, drew criticism from within the Post Office, from the press and from the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. Dissatisfaction subsided within six months, however, and the next five years proved a triumph for Brown as the department underwent a period of rapid and overdue development. Allowing for the underlying economic boom and for the decisions taken before his arrival, Brown clearly gave marked impetus to this expansion.\n\nHis first undertaking was to strengthen central administration. Previously the State offices had been the main organs, but in his first four years six major sections were created at central office, Melbourne \u2014 telegraphs and wireless (1923), telephones (1924), postal services (1924), correspondence, records and staff (1926), chief inspectors' (1926) and research (1927). He also shaped new patterns of staff promotion: the pre-eminence of the career generalist was diminished by the near-abolition of the senior positions of chief clerk and clerk. It was later said that Brown tended to give undue weight to technical qualifications in administrative appointments.\n\nThe first engineer to be permanent departmental head, Brown had a personal impact on postal technology. After initial lethargy from departmental engineers, in 1925-31 he pushed through the linking of all State capitals by 'carrier wave' channels, an apparatus conveying multiple circuits on each trunk line. He similarly spurred on mechanized mail-handling, the system completed in 1930 at the Sydney General Post Office being the most extensive in the world.\n\nBrown attached as much importance to public relations as to administration and technology. To raise morale, and hence efficiency, a personnel branch was set up at central office. The interest taken by him in staff matters was intense and never condescending. The same thought was given to his market, the public. Subscriber surveys, advertising campaigns, and press releases were used on an unprecedented scale. These measures had considerable success in improving the poor image of the department. Brown himself received a prominence in the press extraordinary for a Commonwealth public servant.\n\nAs he did with the postal and telegraph services, Brown played a key role in the growth of wireless broadcasting between 1923 and 1928. A very active intermediary in the negotiations between industry interests and the minister, he was later credited with the formulation of the 'dual system' of 'A' and 'B' class stations enacted under the Wireless Agreement Act, 1924, and the wireless telegraphy regulations. While he probably did not instigate the 1928 decision of the government to purchase the assets of the 'A' stations \u2014 at the time he was actively representing Australia at conferences in Washington and London \u2014 he was, as chairman of the Wireless Broadcasting Advisory Committee, the central figure in the planning of the 'National Broadcasting Service' in 1929-30.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in July 1932, the Postmaster-General's Department continued to have responsibility for the technical side of the national service, something which Brown prized. The department also retained its wide powers over the commercial ('B') stations and Brown, though he always preferred and was renowned for his methods of conciliation and persuasion, was not afraid to deploy these powers. At least three times \u2014 in 1931, 1936 and 1938 \u2014 he was a willing party to acts of political censorship, which he believed were necessary in times of 'crisis'. He also viewed with some dismay the growth of newspaper-controlled radio stations; in 1935 he helped to frame regulations to limit the number of stations owned by one licensee, a measure which, later weakened by Cabinet, proved of little consequence.\n\nIn the field of posts and telegraphs, Brown throughout the 1930s maintained his exacting managerial standards and his flair for public relations. The impact of the Depression could not be warded off, but the department's net profit for the years 1933-39 was an impressive \u00a318 million. His most auspicious initiative in this period was his plan in 1935 for a daily air mail service to all Australian capitals without surcharge, a scheme which was eventually compromised in Cabinet. In 1938-39 he sat on the Defence Communications Committee, completing arrangements for the wartime control of communications.\n\nOn 3 October 1939 Brown's resignation was announced, seemingly precipitated by proposals to transfer to the A.B.C. some of the department's technical powers in broadcasting and to devolve some of the administrative functions of the director-general. In December he took up the appointment of chairman and joint managing director of the British General Electric Co. Pty Ltd, a position he had earlier declined.\n\nIn May 1940 Brown returned to the Commonwealth public service in the new wartime position of co-ordinator-general of works, his company 'releasing' his services as a war gesture. His task was to advise the Australian Loan Council on the degree of civil and military urgency of the major capital works planned by the State governments. Based on consultation with State officials, his submissions and arguments before the Loan Council facilitated the necessary reduction in civil works expenditure in 1940-42.\n\nIn August 1943 the Loan Council decided to retain Brown's services as executive of the National Works Council, planning post-war works to provide employment during demobilization and reconversion. To this end he submitted three reports, collating \u00a3150 million worth of projected works. In this phase perhaps an equally important service was his persuading State bodies to place all resource orders to war production authorities through him. In contributing to resource co-ordination he had been able to draw on his experience in rationalizing supply and distribution in the P.M.G. in 1926-27, and from his long membership of the Commonwealth Stores Supply and Tender Board.\n\nBrown's pre-eminent reputation brought him extra wartime tasks. In 1940 he submitted a report on the standardization of State power-supply systems. From July to November 1941, he acted as part-time director of war organization of industry, under a minister but without a department. He was a member of the Treasury's advisory committee on financial and economic policy, and early in 1943 he investigated charges against the New South Wales director and the deputy director of the Allied Works Council. In 1944-45 he wrote a report which provided the framework for the post-war Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme.\n\nFollowing a serious illness in August 1945, Brown resigned from the public service. He remained, however, a co-opted member of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research until 1952, this arrangement stemming from his formative membership of the Radio Research Board in 1927-39. He did not retire from his post with British General Electric until 1953, having presided over the establishment of local manufacture of small-horsepower motors and light industrial products.\n\nPhysically and intellectually robust, Brown was a great and powerful public servant. Gracious and high-minded by nature, he was capable of shrewdness with ministers and sternness with critics. He cherished the Empire and voted conservatively all his life. He had settled religious beliefs. Radiating his conviction of the personal rewards of public service and of the ultimate good of scientific advance, he aspired to social leadership, but his standards were not as lofty or as stern as those of his contemporary, Lord Reith. For all his polish and discipline, Brown was very much at home in the Australia of the inter-war period. He had been appointed C.M.G. in 1934 and was knighted in 1938. Survived by two sons and a daughter, he died in Sydney on 5 June 1967. His estate was valued for probate at $145,817."}]}
