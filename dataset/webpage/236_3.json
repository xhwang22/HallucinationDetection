{"Ted Childs earned a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.": [{"url": "https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/", "page_content": "About the Program Choosing a Computer Science Path There are two ways to study Computer Science (CS) at UC Berkeley: Be admitted to the Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) major in the College of Engineering (COE) as a freshman. Admission to the COE, however, is extremely competitive. This option leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. This path is appropriate for people who want an engineering education. Select the Computer Science major in the College of Letters & Science (L&S) on the UC Berkeley application. Once admitted to UC Berkeley, students may petition to be admitted to the L&S Computer Science major after successful completion of the prerequisite courses to declare and if they are in good academic standing. More information may be found here. This path is appropriate for people who are interested in a broader education in the sciences and arts (such as double majoring in other L&S fields), and/or are not sure at the time of application that they can gain admission to EECS. This option leads to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. There is no difference in the CS course content between the BS and BA programs. The difference is in what else you take: mainly engineering, or mainly humanities and social sciences. In particular, an interest in hardware suggests the EECS route; an interest in double majoring (for example, in math or cognitive science) suggests the L&S route. Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science For information regarding the BS degree, please see the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences program information in this Guide. Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science This CS major is for students enrolled in the College of Letters & Science (L&S). Berkeley emphasizes the science of computer science, which means much more than just computer programming. It includes the theory of computation, the design and analysis of algorithms, the architecture and logic design of computers, programming languages, compilers, operating systems, scientific computation, computer graphics, databases, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. Our goal is to prepare students both for a possible research career and long-term technical leadership in industry. We must therefore look beyond today's technology and give students the primary ideas and the learning skills that will prepare them to teach themselves about tomorrow's technology. Declaring the Major (BA only) Students who selected Computer Science on their UC Berkeley application must complete the prerequisite courses and be in good academic standing in order to declare the Computer Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to petition for admission to the major can be found on the Petitioning to the Computer Science Major website. Transfer students must select the Computer Science major on their application to UC Berkeley in order to be considered for this major. Transfer students admitted to UC Berkeley who chose Computer Science on their application will be directly admitted to Computer Science. More information may be found here. Questions may be directed to the CS advising office, 349 Soda Hall, 510-664-4436, or via email at cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu. Five-Year BS/MS Program This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well.

Glassdoor ranks data scientist as the third best job in the U.S. for 2022, citing high job satisfaction, top salaries, and abundant job openings.\n\nThis page explains how to become a data scientist. We cover experience and education requirements, look at certifications and job search strategies, and outline the steps to become a data scientist.\n\nWhat Education Do Data Scientists Need?\n\nEducation requirements for data science professionals vary by position, employer, and industry. Data scientists typically need at least a bachelor's degree in computer science, data science, or a related field. However, many employers in this field prefer a master's degree in data science or a related discipline.\n\nData analysts and data engineers usually need a bachelor's degree. Becoming a data scientist or computer and information research scientist usually requires a master's.\n\nSome data science professionals hold a mix of education levels. For example, someone might earn a bachelor's in computer science and complete a data science bootcamp. Or, they might complete a bachelor's in an unrelated field and then earn a master's in data science.\n\nIn general, career opportunities and salaries increase as people earn higher degree levels. A graduate degree can also help job applicants stand out from candidates with just a bachelor's.\n\nRequirements to Become a Data Scientist\n\nThere is more than one way to enter the data science field. Data scientist requirements differ by employer, industry, and location. Aspiring professionals can meet data scientist job requirements in various ways.\n\nThe typical process to become a data scientist includes at least a four-year college degree in computer science, data science, or a related field. Many data scientists also pursue graduate education, professional certifications, and bootcamps.\n\nMost data scientist jobs require some relevant professional experience. Students can gain experience while still in school through internships, capstone projects, and fellowships.\n\nBelow, we outline in detail some of the steps to become a data scientist.\n\nSteps to Become a Data Scientist\n\nSeveral paths can lead to a career as a data scientist. Below, we list the steps to become a data scientist based on different paths.\n\nBachelor's Degree Path\n\nEarn a bachelor's degree. Most data science jobs require at least a four-year bachelor's degree. Consider majoring in data science, computer science, or mathematics. Take classes in computer science, business, and statistics. Complete an internship. Getting internship experience develops career-relevant skills and can lead to job offers. Pursue professional certifications. Earning a professional certification is not required for becoming a data scientist, but it can help you prove your skills to potential employers. Get entry-level professional experience.

Data science master's programs usually take 1-2 full-time years to complete.\n\nWhat Is a Data Scientist?\n\nNew technologies help organizations easily collect large amounts of data. But, they often do not know what to do with this information. Data scientists use advanced methods to help bring value to data. They collect, organize, visualize, and analyze data to find patterns, make decisions, and solve problems.\n\nData scientists need strong skills in programming, data visualization, communication, and mathematics. Typical job responsibilities include gathering data, creating algorithms, cleaning and validating data, and drafting reports. Nearly any organization can benefit from the contributions of a trained data scientist. Potential work sectors include healthcare, logistics, and banking and finance.\n\nHow Much Experience Do Data Scientists Need?\n\nData scientist requirements for professional experience depend on the role and workplace. In general, data scientist positions are not entry-level jobs. Successful candidates need some relevant experience.\n\nBefore becoming a data scientist, some people start out in related information technology positions. These stepping-stone roles may include data analyst, market research analyst, or data engineer.\n\nData science degree programs and bootcamps often include internships, fellowships, and capstone projects. These experiences provide hands-on practice that can help graduates land a job offer. Some employers let job applicants substitute education for experience, or vice versa.\n\nProfessional Certifications\n\nProfessional certifications are not a requirement for becoming a data scientist. However, a certification can help you stand out and show your expertise to potential employers. Getting certified can help you earn a higher entry-level salary and open the door to more career advancement opportunities.\n\nIn some cases, a data science certification may persuade an employer to hire someone who does not meet all of a job's stated education or experience requirements.\n\nSAS Data Science Certification This certification demonstrates the ability to use SAS and open source tools to manipulate big data. Certified professionals know how to use machine learning models to make business recommendations. Applicants complete the SAS data curation professional, advanced analytics professional, and AI & machine learning credentials to earn the data science certification.\n\nAzure Data Scientist Associate Microsoft's data scientist associate certification shows knowledge and experience with Azure machine learning and Azure databricks. Applicants must pass the Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure exam. The credential demonstrates skill in implementing machine learning, managing Azure resources, and deploying machine learning solutions.\n\nSenior Data Scientist The senior data scientist certification signifies data science knowledge and data leadership potential. Candidates pay a $775 fee that covers exam prep resources, a digital badge, and a credential kit. The certification requires 3-5 years of analytics and research experience and a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\nPrincipal Data Scientist The principal data scientist credential offers four tracks for different applicants. It indicates high-level knowledge of data science and analytics technologies. Depending on the track they qualify for, candidates must pursue various exams and assessments to earn the credential. Once awarded, the designation never expires.\n\nProfessional Spotlight: Interview with a Data Scientist\n\nWhy did you choose to become a data scientist?\n\nPrior to data science, I was a professor. But I (and many of my fellow young Ph.D.s) gradually realized that the academic job market has serious problems that prevent it from absorbing and properly utilizing all of the talented candidates who are getting their doctorates. Data science offers a way for people with strong mathematical and statistical backgrounds to apply their industry knowledge and research acumen to problems in the private sector in a much livelier job market (also for substantially better pay than is offered in academia). I also felt that data science, as a fast-growing, dynamic field, would allow me to expand my skills and insights faster than in academia.\n\nCan you describe your path to a career in data science?\n\nMy first problem once I decided to switch careers was how, exactly, to transition. While I was highly educated, I had no specific certifications or qualifications that many jobs were looking for. That is why I chose to enroll in The Data Incubator. The Data Incubator specializes in taking candidates with strong academic backgrounds and helping them to learn how to conduct and communicate data science effectively in the private sector. They also help to match their students with prospective employers, which enabled me to get my first job in data science at Cova Strategies (which later transitioned to a role at NNData as senior data scientist).\n\nWhat are some high and low points for this career? What challenges might a data scientist face?\n\nWhile I am likely not in a good position to comment on career highs and lows (I have not been in data science for that long), I can say that the biggest challenge I faced in data science was believing myself to actually be qualified. Even after getting my first data science role, I felt much of the same imposter syndrome that plagues many people, especially those coming from academia.\n\nWhat type of person does well in this role?\n\nPeople who have a strong grasp of mathematics and statistics and can learn and apply new techniques rapidly. Data science is a rapidly evolving field; methods change, new techniques develop, and there is always something relevant to discover, understand, and integrate into new or even existing projects. No one can stay informed on every topic, so there will inevitably be times when you have to learn on the fly to use the latest or best techniques to solve a problem.\n\nWhat advice do you have for students considering a career in data science?\n\nFirst, as I mentioned earlier, data science is much more an exercise in mathematical and statistical reasoning than anything else, so don't neglect your mathematics! Second, be prepared to be a pioneer. While many people have attempted to solve almost any problem (Stack Overflow is proof of that), few have likely tried to solve the problems you will be facing with the exact intention that you have. Be prepared to combine solutions together, modify code, or apply technologies in ways they may not have been initially intended. That's what makes data science into a \"data art,\" and that's what makes it fun! Third, especially if the student is coming from a graduate program, know your value. If you have (or are about to have) a Ph.D., you probably know something! You are more qualified than you likely give yourself credit for, and should not let yourself forget that. Finally, getting your foot in the door in any industry can be hard. Try and find some certification program, course, or something that signals to companies that you are serious and able to apply your skills to meet their needs. Beyond that, just remember that, like any career, a career in data science is a journey. Be prepared for the unexpected and to find your ideal niche in a company (and the wider industry) where you may not initially expect.\n\nAndrew Graczyk, Ph.D. Dr. Andrew Graczyk is a graduate of The Data Incubator. He also earned his Ph.D. in economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in December 2017. His research specialties in game theoretic modeling, Bayesian statistics, and time series analysis allowed him to synthesize novel models to capture adverse incentives responsible for behavior that other models struggle to explain. Prior to his career in data science, he developed experience working with a wide variety of data and topics from asset bubble formation to housing markets to environmental regulation and agriculture. As a senior data scientist at NNData, Dr. Graczyk applies his multifaceted experience with data and theory to create robust, flexible, and holistic solutions to problems using cutting-edge machine learning and statistical techniques.\n\nThe Job Hunt\n\nPlaces to look for data scientist positions include professional organizations, job fairs, and networking opportunities at annual conferences.

Changing the search from \"Wexelblat\" to \"van Dam\" says Andries (Andy) van Dam earned the second Ph.D. in computer science in May 1966, also at Penn. Their two degrees are from the Graduate Group in Computer and Information Sciences in the Electrical Engineering Department.\n\nA similar search for \"first Ph.D. in computer science woman\" (without quotes) produces numerous sources saying the first Ph.D. in computer science to a woman was earned in 1968 by Barbara Liskov at Stanford. She was Barbara Huberman at the time and earned the degree from the Computer Science Department.\n\nBut at virtually the same time in June 1965, two other degrees were completed: Sister Mary Kenneth Keller, BVM, earned a Ph.D. from the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin, and Irving C. Tang earned a D.Sc. from the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department at Washington University in St. Louis. [In an amazing coincidence, Keller and Tang received their doctoral degrees at commencements the same day, June 7, 1965. (Thanks to Vesna Kovach for this discovery.) -- RLL Sept 1, 2015] The purpose of this article is to show that in the United States, Keller and Tang were not just earlier but also first, thereby providing a more accurate historical record.\n\nAlthough many believe it is of interest to know the first degree, a few say it does not matter. However, a first degree is sometimes noted in biographical information, either for oneself or for others. And judging from the interest and encouragement expressed when I sought people's help in determining the first degree, it apparently does matter to many, including buffs of computer science history.\n\n'First Computer Science Ph.D.' and Previous Discussions\n\nVarious definitions of a Ph.D. in computer science are possible. For this article, a computer science Ph.D. must be officially designated with \"computer science\" in the name of either its field or its awarding department (or program). First means the earliest officially designated computer science degree. Degrees not officially designated computer science are excluded, even with a thesis on a topic then or now considered to be computer science, because determining the first Ph.D. degree on a computer science topic would be difficult, if not impossible. It would be equally difficult to use the courses or examinations taken to determine the first. The definition of computer science Ph.D. is thus based on syntax, not semantics. Both Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Doctor of Science) degrees are included; Ph.D. is used for both. Honorary degrees are excluded.\n\nUsing this definition, Keller and Tang earned computer science Ph.D. degrees, as did Wexelblat, van Dam, and Liskov. For these five degrees, the field is the same as the department. Wexelblat, van Dam, and Liskov each relied on statements made by others and never saw the need to research the issue. Additional information about the first degree is available. [5]\n\nOthers have discussed the question of who was first. Amber Bouman [1] recognizes Keller as the first woman while noting that Barbara Liskov is often cited as the first woman. For her guest lecture in computing history, Katherine Deibel [2] includes on two slides,\n\nSister Mary Kenneth Keller: First woman to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science (University of Wisconsin-Madison). . .\n\nThe First Ph.D.s in Computer Science? The first Ph.D.s designated as \"Computer Science\" were awarded by the University of Pennsylvania: Richard Wexelblat (December, 1965), Andries van Dam (May, 1966). Keller earned her Ph.D. in May [sic], 1965 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nResearch Approach and the Result\n\nTwelve schools, listed below with first graduates, had established computer science departments or programs by the end of 1965. Given Keller's and Tang\u2019s degree dates of June 1965 (and assuming no other school had a pre-1966 department), these are the only possibilities that could have awarded the first computer science Ph.D.\n\nThe data on early departments and first graduates are the result of extensive searches through many sources. Possible schools came mainly from works by Aaron Finerman [3] and Robert Gensler [4]. Finerman included a chapter on \"Organization\" by Frank Beckman (pages 48-58) and a table of \"U.S. Institutions Offering Degree Programs in Computer Science\" (pages 217-220). Gensler listed \"Miami University founded 1963,\" but I found no pre-1966 Ph.D. department at either Miami University (Ohio) or at University of Miami-Coral Gables.\n\nTo help find data and determine pre-1966 departments, I contacted early computer science Ph.D.s for their recollections and suggestions. Web search was crucial, as expected. Several Ph.D. graduates searched Web sites of their degree-granting departments or used other knowledge to provide full or partial information. Other department Web sites provided information, sometimes even a history. So did department anniversary celebrations, whether recorded electronically or on paper. Searching university libraries online gave dates for some degrees, suggested whether degrees were computer science, supplied names of relevant graduates and sometimes indicated the absence of degrees before the end of 1965. The Mathematics Genealogy Project [6] with its varied searches proved very useful. Emails sent to people who might have knowledge yielded results, as did emails to possible departments. As with any historical study, it was necessary to interpret and resolve conflicting information.\n\nHere, then, are the twelve computer science departments or programs (plus entries for Princeton and North Carolina) founded pre-1966 with their first degrees (preserving whether \"Science\" in a name is singular or plural). The order is generally by date founded. The degree date could be date of graduation, defense, or when all requirements were met, including library filing. Some dates do not include a month, another reason the dates are not strictly comparable.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Graduate Group in Computer and Information Sciences, founded in 1959 in the Electrical Engineering Department: Initial Ph.D. graduate, Richard Wexelblat in December 1965. The Computer and Information Sciences Department started by 1972. Princeton University's Digital Systems program was founded in the late 1950s or early 1960s in the Electrical Engineering Department. I did not determine an initial graduate which might be in 1960 or 1961. A joint Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department started in the mid 1970s, and the current Computer Science Department began in 1985. Purdue University, Department of Computer Sciences, October 1962, was the first Computer Science Department in the United States: Karl Usow, June 1966. University of Wisconsin - Madison, Computer Sciences Department, July 1964: Sister Mary Kenneth Keller, June 1965. University of North Carolina, Information Sciences Department, July 1964: Paul Oliver and Jan Prokop, May 1969. University of Virginia, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department, November 1964: William Wulf, June 1968. The current Computer Science Department dates to a 1986 separation. University of Michigan. Two entries: Communication Sciences Graduate Program, 1957: John Holland, 1959. Communication Sciences Department, 1964, renamed Computer and Communication Sciences Department, 1967. I discovered no graduates of the departments to mention. The current Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department is a 1984 merger of Electrical and Computer Engineering with Computer and Communication Sciences. University of Illinois. Computer Science Department started 1964 and added graduate degrees 1966. I discovered no graduates to mention. Stanford University, Computer Science Department, January 1965: William McKeeman and Raj Reddy, 1966. Carnegie Mellon University. Two entries: Computer Science Department, July 1965: Renato Iturriaga and Thomas Standish III, 1967. The Systems and Communications Sciences interdisciplinary program, 1961: Jerome Feldman and Ralph London, June 1964, both through Mathematics. Cornell University, Computer Science Department, 1965: Joel Sturman, 1966. University of Iowa, Computer Science Department, 1965: Morteza Rahimi, December 1968. University of Utah, Computer Science Department, 1965: Charles Carr, June 1969. Washington University in St. Louis, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department, 1965: Irving Tang, June 1965.\n\nStanford had a Computer Science Division in the Mathematics Department starting in 1961. The division awarded masters degrees, but I found no Ph.D.s from the division. Ph.D.s apparently continued as standard mathematics degrees until the Computer Science Department started in January 1965.\n\nInformation is included for Princeton, North Carolina, Michigan's Communication Sciences (program and department), and Carnegie Mellon's Systems and Communications Sciences, even though \"computer science\" is not part of the names of fields or departments; these degrees are excluded in determining the first. Michigan and Carnegie Mellon are listed by the department dates rather than program dates. From the start, I intended to exclude the Systems and Communications Sciences program. But including the others led me to add Carnegie Mellon's Systems and Communications Sciences.\n\nThus Sister Mary Kenneth Keller and Irving C. Tang are the first to earn computer science Ph.D.s in the United States. Even though my search for data was thorough, I welcome improvements to the historical record that refute the conclusion or add data. Note that although I found no woman after Keller and before Liskov, there may be one or more because I searched only for the first degrees and thus stopped short of determining the second woman.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFor their significant help in various ways in uncovering material, understanding it, and then presenting it, I am grateful to Ed Lazowska, Barbara Liskov, Bobbi London, Jude Shavlik, Larry Travis, Andy van Dam, Dick Wexelblat, Bill Wulf, and Bryant York.\n\nReferences\n\nAll Web pages were accessed November 21, 2012.\n\n[1.] Amber Bouman, \"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History,\" March 2011, http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/15_most_important_women_tech_history\n\n[2.] Katherine Deibel, \"Women in Computing,\" Guest lecture in CSEP 590, A History of\n\nComputing, University of Washington, November 2006, Slides 25 and 26.\n\nwww.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/csep590/06au/lectures/slides/Deibel_Nov_22.ppt\n\n[3.] Aaron Finerman (ed.), University Education in Computer Science, Proceedings of Graduate Academic Conference in Computing Science, Stony Brook, New York, June 5-8, 1967, ACM Monograph, Academic Press, N.Y., 1968.\n\n[4.] Robert Gensler, \"The IBM 650: Little Computer, Big Impact,\" Paper for CS 630, The\n\n\"Science\" of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Fall 2007. http://www.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs630/spring07/ (Select Final Papers and then Robert Gensler.)\n\n[5.] Ralph L.

London Anonymous I believe Clarence Arthur Ellis was the first African American to receive a computer science PhD, from the University of Illinois in 1968 or 69. Dennis Frailey As one of the earlier PhDs in CS (1971, Purdue) I recall those early 1960's fondly. The issue for those of us contemplating a CS PhD and deciding which school to go to was not only which universities offered the degree (very few) but which ones offered genuine CS courses. Most CS programs of that era were really EE programs or Math programs or Communication Science programs masquerading as Computer Science. At the time, it seemed that only the students knew what computer science really was, whereas the faculty all tended to think CS was a minor specialty within some other, more established discipline. The choice one had to make was whether to get a mathematician's view, an electrical engineer's view, or some other view. We all wanted to take courses like operating systems and compiler design, but were offered things like numerical analysis and formal language theory and circuit design (with vacuum tubes, no less!). [I recall when the students proposed a course in data bases and the faculty decried that as a topic with no academic substance.] Of course, hiring a genuine computer expert for the faculty was difficult for many schools because most computer experts were out in industry making computers happen and few of them had the doctorates and other qualifications required for acceptance in a tenure-track academic position. It all settled out in the 1970's and 1980's as those of us with CS PhDs began to proliferate - at least in most schools. But as late as the 1990's I recall visiting an undergraduate \"CS\" program where they thought every CS student needed to have a half dozen math courses (beyond Calculus), but had no courses in operating systems or data bases and the compiler course was deeply theoretical. CACM Administrator \"Clarence Ellis is the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in Computer Science (1969).\" Source: http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/computer-science/ellis_clarencea.html --Ralph L. London Anonymous Any discussion of \"Who Earned First Computer Science Ph.D.?\" that omits early pioneers because of department-name terminology or country is regrettably narrow. Just for one example, consider David Wheeler's 1951 thesis \"Automatic Computing With EDSAC\" from the University of Cambridge - this is unquestionably Computer Science. CACM Administrator What the commenter finds regrettably narrow, some find useful and interesting. I encourage others to expand the search, which might mean going back to the 1930s or earlier. --Ralph L. London Bruce Bailey Who was the first to graduate with a Computer Science degree (B.A.) from the University of California, Berkeley?\n\nI claim I, Bruce W. Bailey, did. Because I was the first in the Computer Science class of '69 but I graduated a quarter early.\n\nI've always wondered whether someone beat me to it though.\n\nI believe that Jim Gray was the first to graduate with a PhD in Computer Science from UCB. He was a TA for a couple of my classes, and I later worked with him at Tandem Computers.\n\nMay he rest in peace. ga gamba \"(and assuming no other school had a pre-1966 department),\" Why would one need to assume this? A simple google search gives us the result that Purdue University established the nation's first computer science department in 1962 and the first class of post-graduate students (MS and PhD) entered that same year. The undergrad programme started in 1967. This article, https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2544&context=cstech, presents Purdue's CS history and even names the two fellas who received its first PhD degrees. BTW, it's kind of unusual a person would receive a PhD the same year one enrolled and at the same year the department opened. This is not to say things weren't done differently in the 1960s, but if you read the article about Purdue I linked to, you'll see one if the biggest obstacles then was the absence of CS-related textbooks, especially those appropriate for post graduate students. CACM Administrator My aim was to determine the first Computer Science Ph.D., not the first Computer Science department, although I noted that Purdue was the first department. The assumption (no other pre-1966 department) was mentioned because there was a remote possibility I could have missed a department that awarded a degree before June, 1965. Concerning the last paragraph, some Ph.D. work might have been completed in another department or program before a Computer Science Department was founded. A department might also have been renamed. --Ralph L.

The curriculum for distance programs typically mirrors in-person classes, often with the same instructors. Distance learners can access most, if not all, of the same resources as on-campus students.\n\nHowever, online programs differ from their on-campus counterparts in several key ways.
