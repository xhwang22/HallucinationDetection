She most recently played for Turbine Potsdam in the German Bundesliga and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League. Deines was a fourth round pick (23rd overall) of the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012. The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014 but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015, before the 2015 season began.\n\nEarly life\n\nDeines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989, to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first *le ever. Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state *le games, winning three of them. Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer *ociation Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Florida following the semifinal. Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup.\n\nDeines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1\u20130 victory over Seattle Prep.\n\nDeines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams.\n\nDeines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDeines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals. She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American.\n\nAs a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence. She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. She made 12 appearances for the club, scoring one goal. Following the conclusion of the W-League season, Deines and her Sounders teammate and fellow University of Washington alum, Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez, played for Stjarnan Women in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur. Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression. Playing professionally in Iceland also allowed me an opportunity to keep practicing and playing games on a daily basis which would not have been the case if I would have stayed in the United States.\"\n\nSeattle Reign FC, 2013\u201314\n\nIn February 2013, Deines signed with the Seattle Reign FC as a free agent for the inaugural season of the NWSL.

She grew up playing in the Seattle area, joining the Seattle Sounders Women when she was still in high school. She played for the University of Washington while completing her undergraduate degree in communication and media.\n\nIn 2012, she was named UW\u2019s Female Athlete of the Year and awarded the Tom Hansen Pac-12 Conference Medal \u2013 for the student athlete who displays performance and achievement in leadership, academics and athleticism.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cI always wanted to play professionally,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter graduating from UW, Deines found herself with nowhere to play because the United States Women\u2019s Professional Soccer League disbanded. \u201cIt was a sad time for women\u2019s soccer,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, like many others in that situation, Deines played abroad. She joined Stjarnan FC in Iceland, helping her team win the Icelandic Cup, among other accomplishments.\n\nDeines later joined the Seattle Reign FC in 2013, after the formation of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL), and played two seasons before retiring in 2015.\n\nDuring that time she continued to play abroad in the offseasons, playing for FFC Turbine Potsdam located just outside Berlin, Germany. They became the top team in the Frauen-Bundesliga, the country\u2019s women\u2019s soccer league.\n\n\u201cFinance was never even on my radar,\u201d Deines said. She said she felt she had already achieved everything she wanted to achieve in soccer, and she was drawn to finance because it focuses on long-term goals. She said soccer, on the other hand, focused on what needed to happen each day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a competitive person, and I was ready for something else,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I near graduation and get ready to work for a firm, the idea that I am hopefully working my way up to the top motivates me. I enjoy thinking about what climbing that next rung looks like and how there\u2019s no ceiling to what you can accomplish.\n\n\u201cThe fact that finance has no limits \u2013 that in and of itself is definitely a big motive.\u201d\n\nAn old family friend and PLU alumna, Darcy Johnson, referred her to the MSF program.\n\n\u201cWhen I visited PLU I had a really good feeling and I could envision myself here,\u201d Deines said. \u201cI always wanted to achieve financial security and I had a really good gut feeling that PLU would be a good fit.\u201d\n\nDeines said she likes the opportunity to help others reach their financial goals. As far as the Women of Influence Award, she said she was pleasantly surprised with the honor. In some ways, she said, the award is a sort of validation, or a sign of heading in the right direction.\n\nMSF program director Cynthia Smith said she was not at all surprised that Deines got the award."}]}
