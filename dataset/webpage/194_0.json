He\u2019ll become conductor laureate, focusing his concerts there on the music of his homeland, Ukraine. It\u2019s repertoire that has featured regularly in his Bournemouth programmes throughout his tenure, and he included a sample of it in his guest appearance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The Third Symphony by Boris Lyatoshinsky is apparently the best-known work by a composer whose stature in Ukraine, according to Karabits, is similar to that of Sibelius\u2019s in Finland.\n\nComposed between 1948 and 1951, the Third Symphony carries the title \u201cPeace Shall Defeat War\u201d. It\u2019s a noisy, bellicose piece, whose stylistic roots seem to stretch back into the 19th century as far as Mussorgsky. Violence and menace haunt all four movements, epitomised by a ubiquitous three-note motif, but even the big tune that emerges in the finale does not provide the catharsis and resolution that the title seems to demand. Nevertheless it was the finale that drew criticism from the Soviet authorities; Lyatoshinsky was accused of \u201cbourgeois pacificism\u201d and pressurised into revising it in 1954, so that the symphony\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d premiere did not take place until the following year, though Karabits opted to perform the original version.\n\nCertainly the BBCSO played it magnificently for him, letting as much light and air into the congested textures as possible, and their performance was greeted with great enthusiasm. But the whole concert had Ukrainian connections, for the soloist in Rachmaninov\u2019s Third Piano Concerto beforehand had been the Ukraine-born Anna Fedorova. There were a few moments in her performance when the co-ordination between soloist and orchestra seemed touch and go, but otherwise the performance flowed naturally enough, and Fedorova continued the Ukrainian theme in her encore, Valentin Silvestrov\u2019s The Messenger, in which fragments of Mozart move in and out of focus, framed by spare, chilly chords."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/17/bournemouth-symphony-orchestra-kirill-karabits-review-ukraine-sibelius", "page_content": "Conductors don\u2019t normally receive a standing ovation before they have even reached the podium, but these are not normal times. Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://www.ebu.ch/news/2023/04/3-questions-to-conductor-kirill-karabits", "page_content": "Sasha Gusov Conductor Kirill Karabits\n\nAs the current situation in Ukraine made it impossible for the Horowitz Competition to take place in Kyiv, the World Federation of International Music Competitions offered its support and assistance for its 2023 edition, being held in Geneva from 13-21 April. As part of its ongoing commitment to supporting emerging musical talent around the world, EBU Music is proud to sponsor the Audience Prize, to be given after the Final round. It will be conducted by Ukrainian artist Kirill Karabits, Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, who also assumes the role of Chair of the Jury. As the first in-person round was about to take place, he answered our 3 questions.\n\nThis year, the competition is being held in Geneva, hosted by the WFIMC, which embodies quite a symbol of international solidarity. In your view, in what way is this edition special for the 29 young selected participants? And on your side, how do you engage with young musicians?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m sure that this special competition will remain in history as a symbol of support and solidarity between Ukraine and Switzerland. Competitions are made to discover talent in the first place, and as there will be a lot of attention on this particular competition, it will surely serve the young participants and their future professional careers. I personally find that working with young musicians is all about sharing - sharing your experiences - and passing them to the young and future generations, which should be essential to every human being.\n\nAs a Ukrainian musician, what does Vladimir Horowitz represent for you? What impact did he have on your musical journey?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m very proud that Vladimir Horowitz was born in Kyiv. But thinking about his role in music, I believe that he became a man of the world, really. As a young musician I learned from him that as a pianist one can, and probably should, make music happen using exclusively their fingers and without drawing too much attention to the performer. The performer, in his case, is a sort of instrument that connects the audiences with the music itself. Of course, Vladimir Horowitz was serving the music in the first place.\n\nTo chair the Jury and conduct the Final round of the competition isn't common. How do you see this double role?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI have participated in a number of competitions as a conductor over the years but it will be my first experience of being also a chair of the jury.

However, that definitely won't be the end of relations between conductor and orchestra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarabits and the BSO have performed cycles of Beethoven, Brahms and Prokofiev, given UK premieres of works from CPE Bach to contemporary music from Azerbaijan, and championed music from both eastern Europe and Karabits\u2019 native Ukraine through their ongoing series Voices from the East.\n\nKarabits is the BSO\u2019s second longest-serving chief conductor after its founder Sir Dan Godfrey. Upon standing down from his chief conductor, Karabits will become Bournemouth's conductor laureate, artistic director, Voices from the East.\n\nTogether, Karabits and the BSO have performed a wide range of repertoire, from rediscovered CPE Bach to new music from Azerbaijan. Highlights have included focussed seasons of Beethoven, Brahms, Britten and Shostakovich, Elgar, Prokofiev and Walton. During this time, the orchestra have performed with soloists including Sunwook Kim, Nicola Benedetti, James Ehnes, Catherine Foster, Steven Isserlis, and Robert Levin.\n\nUnder Karabits\u2019 leadership, the Orchestra has also commissioned new music from a range of composers, including Franghiz Ali-Zadeh, Anna Korsun, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Sir James MacMillan. It has also given a number ofUK premieres, of works such as Penderecki\u2019s Fourth Symphony and CPE Bach\u2019s St John Passion (1784).\n\nThe \u2018Voices from the East\u2019 series, meanwhile, has been a majpor feature of the last few years at Bournemouth. Through performances and a series of recordings for Chandos, audiences have been introduced to music from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and the Ukraine, with composers Kara Karayev, Boris Lyatoshynsky, Chary Nurymov and Avet Terterian becoming familiar names.\n\n'I immediately felt this was a very special group of musicians, and, artistically, we have continued to grow together over the last fifteen years,' says Karabits. 'It feels like a home from home \u2014 and never more so than during these last few years, where this community of musicians and audience has been of great support. The warmth, friendship and open-minded approach here is very special, and I am deeply proud to continue my journey as Conductor Laureate, Artistic Director, Voices from the East.'\n\nMore like this\n\nCarol Paige, musician trustee and principal second violin, said: 'Working alongside Kirill has been a voyage of discovery! His musicality radiates from him when he\u2019s on the podium, inspiring us all to play our hearts out in order to produce the most thrilling live performances, which I know have been enjoyed as much on the stage as off amongst our loyal audiences.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://kirillkarabits.com/biography/", "page_content": "Chief Conductor: Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra\n\nKarabits is an inspired architect\u2026.He has an energising presence on the podium, without being domineering\u2026he paced the whirlwind finale in a way that brought the house down.\n\nSince 2008 Kirill Karabits has held the position of Chief Conductor of Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.

Ten years later it has become his most adventurous place. \u201cI can experiment and do pieces which I can\u2019t do anywhere else,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe programmes I introduce are received with interest and curiosity by the orchestra and I think the most significant achievement is that the audience, in all our residencies, still believes in us. It\u2019s all a question of balance. Of course the audience wants to hear music they know, but you have to push them a little bit, challenge them. We are mutually supporting each other and the audience joined us on our journey.\u201d\n\nKirill Karabits \u00a9 Konrad Kwik\n\nThat journey started with a Beethoven cycle, for Karabits the turning point in his growth together with the orchestra. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing unusual, but it was a very important element in our relationship. I said \u2018If we can find each other in Beethoven, then we can do anything together.\u2019\u201d Not only did they find each other, it was followed by a successful cycle of Prokofiev symphonies in 2014 after which Karabits realised that the audience and the musicians were ready \u2013 and hungry \u2013 for an even more adventurous step. \u201cI thought discovering unknown masterpieces that got lost in history or for political reasons would be a way to connect to my roots,\u201d the Ukrainian conductor explains. Their Voices from the East series continues to prove to be incredibly popular with both critics and audiences and opened some completely new names to people. \u201cI\u2019d consider Kara Karayev or Boris Lyatoshynsky classical composers, but it\u2019s different in the UK. For Avet Terterian\u2019s Third Symphony we brought two duduk players (an Armenian folk instrument) from Yerevan to Poole. It\u2019s very interesting and special music and the result was absolutely astonishing.\u201d\n\nFor the composer\u2019s Fourth Symphony, their orchestral librarian Alastair Simpson had to organise the one handwritten (and unpublished!) score of the first edition from the Terterian Estate in Armenia. But why go to all this trouble? \u201cBecause it is a unique piece of music that the composer wrote, the score is still pure. The composer only gives you ideas and directions, but he tells the conductor that he has to shape the piece himself.\u201d\n\nKarabits\u2019 and the audience\u2019s fondest memories of the last ten years are not of the mainstream performances, but of the more unusual ones, programmes that challenged the musicians and listeners alike: Shostakovich\u2019s Fourteenth Symphony sung in Russian, Prokofiev\u2019s Second (\u201ca very difficult piece to listen to, even for musicians\u201d) or a semi-staged version of Salome. Amongst those stellar moments, one shines the brightest: the recording of his father\u2019s concertos for orchestra. \u201cIn the Ukraine it\u2019s actually the other way around. There, I am still considered the son of my father.\u201d Ivan Karabits, a student of Lyatoshynsky, was a prolific composer, conductor and professor at the Kiev Conservatory. His concertos combine elements of Mahler, Shostakovich and Ukrainian folk music and represent the traditional concertos for orchestras in the 20th century, starting with Bart\u00f3k, Lutos\u0142awski and Shchedrin. \u201cThis music is a showcase in which the orchestra presents all its capacities, all its emotions.\u201d\n\nFor a short period during his student years, Karabits followed in his father\u2019s composing footsteps. \u201cIt was an important time in my life, but I was always more passionate about conducting. It\u2019s difficult to start a career as a conductor and composition was the closest to it. If you decide to dedicate your life to composition, you need to do only that, you need to have something to say, something new, and I felt that there was so much music composed already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been more interested in being the interpreter. Composers don\u2019t create an intimate version of a piece and it is our job to demonstrate what the composer wants. Some composers let you add a little bit more of yourself, others stay away and hide, because everything is in the score already. But it\u2019s not enough to do what\u2019s written in the score, you have to believe in it and tell the whole story. Stravinsky, for example, wrote most of what he wanted into the score; Liszt, on the other hand, gives you complete freedom. He\u2019s not only giving you freedom, he\u2019s asking you to interpret his music. What you see on paper is only a symbolic way of notational ideas that he wants you to experience. You have to put Liszt\u2019s music completely through yourself, otherwise it becomes dull and uninteresting.\u201d\n\nManuscript of Vor hundert Jahren \u00a9 Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music\n\nLiszt also plays a significant role in the BSO\u2019s upcoming season. Together with the British dramaturg Gerard McBurney, Karabits brings to stage the long-lost piece Vor hundert Jahren (A hundred years ago), an orchestral melodrama composed by Liszt to accompany the play by Friedrich Halm. Although its first performance during the festivities celebrating Schiller\u2019s 100th birthday in November 1859 was favourable received, it was never published and only one autograph score survived. \u201cIt\u2019s a work for two actors, some visual elements and orchestra. I\u2019ve already conducted the original German version in Weimar [where Karabits has been Music Director for the past three years] and we will perform an English translation [by Richard Stokes] in Poole and London.\" In the current political climate in the UK, with the country asking again whether it is part of Europe and its culture, Karabits agrees that the work might be quite challenging and provocative. \"It\u2019s about the unification of Germany, so there are some open questions\u2026\"\n\nFor the Beethoven festivities, including the Beethoven Weekender at the Barbican in February, Karabits has his very own approach. \u201cIt\u2019s music that pushes the limits. His symphonies are iconic, but you have to make the orchestra vibrate, you have to make the music speak. Masterpieces are sometimes presented like music in a museum. But this music is still very much alive, it still influences today. There\u2019s no such thing as right and wrong, there\u2019s only a convincing element that comes through the energy, the emotional investment of the orchestra. It\u2019s the feeling of doing something on the limit.\u201d\n\nOther Karabits highlights for next season include a semi-staged performance of Elektra, \u201cthe culmination of what we\u2019ve already started with Salome\u201d; working with their artist-in-residence, Gabriela Montero; and welcoming some of the BSO\u2019s favourite soloists, including Steven Isserlis.\n\nAnd his goals for the next ten years? \u201cI\u2019m mainly interested in continuing our series Voices from the East. Performing unknown music doesn\u2019t sound special at all, but every project, every piece has the power to change you. The BSO has always taken risks, they believe in works to become masterpieces.

Energised by conductor Kirill Karabits, the symphony hurtled along at speeds that might have made a professional orchestra hang on to their music stands. Nothing daunted, the NYO responded with tremendous verve and an all-for-one unanimity that made for a gripping performance.

It was good to hear this music again \u2013 especially as convincingly masterminded by Karabits \u2013 after better acquaintance with the opera itself.\n\nFollowing the interval, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony sounded noble and organic. Karabits kept things moving, particularly in the slow movement. The Scherzo was notably fleet-of-foot and the Trio \u2013 with its aching oboe opening \u2013 never cloying. The transition to the Finale was effortlessly natural and the repeated scalic surges, for once, didn\u2019t outstay their welcome.

As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Kirill_Karabits", "page_content": "What we do.
