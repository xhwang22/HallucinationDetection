How has that been going?\n\nI haven\u2019t played a terrorist since \u201c24,\u201d and believe me, when I chose the role it wasn\u2019t because of its political background but [because] the role was so dimensional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre the roles you\u2019re offered pretty diverse?\n\nPretty diverse. After \u201cHouse of Sand and Fog,\u201d I played a professor in \u201cX-Men[: The Last Stand],\u201d I played Anna in \u201cThe Lake House.\u201d Right after that, I played a Turkish lady in \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\u201d I played Dr. Adani in \u201cThe Exorcism of Emily Rose,\u201d and I played Dr. Helen Crawford on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d I was so happy when I was reading the script, when I realized my name was Helen Crawford \u2014 an American name.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood backlot moments\n\nDo you think those kinds of opportunities are also available to other Middle Eastern actors?\n\nFirst you\u2019ve got to be lucky. If you\u2019re in love with this profession, then the industry would like to work with you. The same thing will happen with other actors.\n\nYou write about the performance you gave \u2014 but we never saw \u2014 in \u201cThe Adjustment Bureau.\u201d What happened?\n\nOh, my God, I loved that role. As actors, we all know we\u2019re at the mercy of the editing table, but not to this extent, never had I experienced it. The director, George Nolfi, decided I should play God. Everything went great until I got a call from the director who was asking to have lunch with me. He was on the verge of crying. He said, the distribution company believes that you cannot play this role.\n\nBecause God couldn\u2019t be a Muslim woman?\n\nThat\u2019s right, although if I\u2019m asked what religion I am, I say I was born a Muslim. I don\u2019t introduce myself as a Muslim woman, but I guess the distribution company put the dots together and felt it\u2019s too early for this.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times\n\nTo say \u201cit\u2019s too early\u201d implies your belief that eventually that will come.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take time, but eventually it will happen.\n\nBy the way, I was amused by your Tehran story about tracking down your burglars, who were people you knew, because you didn\u2019t want to pursue charges and the cop who was with you wanted to make an arrest, you \u201ctipped\u201d him. We call that a bribe.\n\nYes, that\u2019s right, we bribed him. I had given the thief my word that I was never, ever going to mention his name or press charges. That\u2019s why we had to tip the policeman. That\u2019s a nice way of putting it.\n\nAnd I gather that when you were nominated for your supporting actress Oscar, you were less than impressed when Renee Zellweger (who later won for \u201cCold Mountain\u201d) didn\u2019t bother to respond to Holly Hunter\u2019s invitation to lunch with your fellow nominees.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I was more appalled than Holly herself, who was the host.\n\nSo coming up for you is \u201cThe Last Knights.\u201d Can you talk about it?\n\nThey may change its name. It was filmed in Prague during the winter and hopefully it will be on the silver screen in December. I worked with Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman. I portray Morgan\u2019s wife, Lady Bartok \u2014 again, a non-Iranian character. I loved working in Prague. It feels like you\u2019re waking up in a museum.\n\nVIDEO: Upcoming summer films\n\nI was curious to know why you didn\u2019t write about \u201cIranium,\u201d the 2011 documentary you narrated about Iran\u2019s nuclear threat. You and the film were criticized for implicitly calling for war against Iran, but you\u2019re proud of your outspokenness. Why didn\u2019t you write about it?\n\nYes, that was pretty scandalous. The reason I didn\u2019t write about it was that what the Iranians were saying was irrelevant to the making of it, the purpose that I had in lending my voice to it. I was more than happy to lend my voice to it so it would shed light on the doctrines of this religious dictatorship.\n\nThe film talks about Iranian people\u2019s desire to rejoin the international community. Where does the Green Movement of protesters stand, as far as you know?\n\nThe Green Movement has gone underground. We\u2019re all looking toward the election this June 14. It won\u2019t make a difference. I\u2019ve heard there are parents in Iran who\u2019ve said that on the election day, they\u2019re going to lock their doors and won\u2019t allow their children to leave the house, let alone go vote. They are afraid. If I were in Iran, I would do the same thing. If my vote isn\u2019t going to make a difference and if my child\u2019s vote is going to cost him his life, I\u2019m not going to vote at all.\n\nWhen you spoke against torture in Iranian prisons on CNN, you write that your brother was arrested the next day and imprisoned for a year. Did you have any regrets about that?\n\nHonestly, no, because I hold my mother responsible for it. She was the one who was on the phone 24/7, begging me not to say anything. Maybe this was the tragedy of my life, but I stood up to my mother.\n\ncalendar@latimes.com\n\nPHOTOS AND MORE"}, {"url": "https://liverampup.com/p/shohreh-aghdashloo-husband-daughter.html", "page_content": "The 69-year-old \u2018The Expanse\u2019 star Shohreh Aghdashloo has had her share of setbacks off-screen due to her roller-coaster marital life.\n\nHer rough road to marriage includes her failed first marriage.

She has since performed in a number of Touzie\u2019s plays, successfully taking them to national and international stages, primarily in the Iranian diaspora. Though born to a Muslim family, she never practised the religion.\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo Education\n\nShe earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations at Brunel University because of her interest in politics after having to leave her home country.\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo Career\n\nHer first major film role was in The Report (Goz\u0101resh) (1977) directed by Abbas Kiarostami, which won the Critics Award at the Moscow Film Festival.

Both films were banned in her home country; but, in 1978, Aghdashloo won acclaim for her performance in Sooteh Delan (Broken-Hearted), directed by Ali Hatami, which established her as one of Iran\u2019s leading actresses.\n\nAfter establishing a theatre and film career in Iran, Aghdashloo moved to England during the Iranian Revolution in 1979, subsequently becoming a U.S. citizen.

Following numerous starring roles on the stage, she made her film debut in Chess of the Wind (1976). Her next two films The Report (1977) and Sooteh Delan (1977) garnered critical acclaim and established Aghdashloo as one of Iran's leading ladies, although the films were banned in Iran itself.\n\nAghdashloo moved to England during the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and then to the United States, subsequently becoming a U.S. citizen. After several years playing small roles in television and film, her performance in House of Sand and Fog (2003) brought her several film critics' awards and a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other film appearances include The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), X-Men: The Last Stand and The Nativity Story (both 2006), The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016).\n\nIn television, she is best known for her roles as Dina Araz in the fourth season of 24 and as Chrisjen Avasarala on The Expanse (2015\u20132022). For her role as Sajida Talfah in the HBO miniseries House of Saddam (2008), she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. In 2013, she released her autobiography titled The Alley of Love and Yellow Jasmines.\n\nEarly life\n\nAghdashloo was born Shohreh Vaziri-Tabar (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631) in Tehran, the daughter of Effie (n\u00e9e alSadat) and Anushiravan Vaziri-Tabar. She has three brothers: Shahram, Shahriar and Shahrokh. Her stage name is from the family name of her first husband, painter Aydin Aghdashloo. After their marriage in 1972 when she was 19 and he was 31, she began attending theatre workshops, against the wishes of her family. She had always wanted to be an actress, and soon began playing leading roles in Iranian theatre and film. They did not have children and were divorced in 1979, when she left Iran for England at the start of the Iranian Revolution.\n\nOnce Aghdashloo arrived in England, she earned a bachelor's degree in international relations at Brunel University because of her interest in politics after having to leave her home country. She was already familiar with England, as her parents had taken her to London as a child. She then continued to pursue her acting career, which brought her to Los Angeles. In 1987, Aghdashloo married actor/playwright Houshang Touzie. They have a daughter, Tara Touzie, born in 1989. She has since performed in a number of Touzie's plays, successfully taking them to national and international stages, primarily in the Iranian diaspora. Though born to a Muslim family, she has stated that she is non-practicing.\n\nCareer\n\nAghdashloo in 2008\n\nAghdashloo first began working as a theatre actress at the age of 19, when she starred in a theatrical adaptation of the novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North (1973). Aghdashloo made her American film debut in 1989 in a starring role in Guests of Hotel Astoria. Her television debut came on September 25, 1990, in a guest role in the two-hour episode of the NBC television series Matlock, titled \"Nowhere to Turn: A Matlock Mystery Movie\". In the years that followed Aghdashloo appeared on screen sporadically, including in the widely panned Surviving Paradise (2000), written and directed by Kamshad Kooshan.\n\nIn 2001 Aghdashloo was cast opposite Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly in director Vadim Perelman's House of Sand and Fog (2003) for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Following this exposure Aghdashloo had a prominent recurring role in Season 4 of the Fox television series 24, playing Dina Araz, a terrorist undercover in Los Angeles as a well-to-do housewife and mother. In an interview with Time magazine, Aghdashloo stated that although she had previously resisted reinforcing the stereotype of Muslims as terrorists, the strength and complexity of the role convinced her to accept it. Iranian film scholar Hamid Naficy criticized Aghdashloo's acting in \"the sensationalist film The Stoning of Soraya M.\" as \"discredit[ing] her vow not to play in films that stereotype Middle Easterners, including Iranians.\" In the period that followed, Aghdashloo made guest appearances on several well-known television series, such as Will & Grace, ER and Grey's Anatomy. She also played supporting roles in films such as X-Men: The Last Stand as Dr. Kavita Rao, The Lake House, The Nativity Story as Elizabeth, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.\n\nIn 2008, Aghdashloo served as an official festival judge at the second annual Noor Iranian Film Festival in Los Angeles, while she also played the lead character of Zahra Khanum in the film The Stoning of Soraya M., marking her first leading role in a feature-length American film. In the same year, she also portrayed Sajida Talfah in the HBO original miniseries House of Saddam for which she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. Speaking to a crowd of over 1,400 people at George Washington University's Lisner Auditorium on September 12, 2009, Aghdashloo, author Dr. Azar Nafisi, and Dr. Dwight Bashir, Associate Director for Policy at the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, added their voices to those concerned about human rights in Iran and the persecution of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Iran. Aghdashloo's talk in particular was posted to YouTube. On October 9, 2010, the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans awarded Aghdashloo their Career Achievement Award during its first annual gala.\n\nAgdashloo continues to act in films, such as The Odd Life of Timothy Green, Septembers of Shiraz and Star Trek Beyond; and on television, guest starring on series such as House, M.D., The Simpsons, Grimm, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and NCIS. She also voiced characters for the video games Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, Destiny and Destiny 2; starred in the London revival of the play The House of Bernarda Alba at the Almeida Theatre as Bernarda Alba; and narrated the audiobook And the Mountains Echoed, by Khaled Hosseini.\n\nAghdashloo recently starred in Amazon Prime Video's acclaimed television series The Expanse, as UN Deputy Undersecretary of Executive Administration Chrisjen Avasarala, a \"smart and passionate member of a political family legacy who has risen high in the ranks of Earth's governing body without once standing for election\".\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1976 The Chess Game of the Wind / Shatranj-e Baad Lady\u2019s Maid First film role in Iran, directed by Mohammed Reza Aslani 1977 The Report Azam Firuzkui 1978 Sooteh-Delan Aghdas 1989 Guests of Hotel Astoria Mrs. Pori Karemnia First American film role 1991 Raha Raha 1993 Twenty Bucks Ghada Holiday 2000 Surviving Paradise Pari First English language Iranian-American feature film distributed theatrically in the United States, written and directed by Kamshad Kooshan 2001 America So Beautiful Exiled Actress 2002 Maryam Mrs. Homa Armin 2003 Possessed Woman Short film by Shirin Neshat Pulse Woman Mystic Iran Narrator Documentary film by Aryana Farshad House of Sand and Fog Nadereh 'Nadi' Behrani Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nNational Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress (3rd place)\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nOnline Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nNominated\u2013Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nNominated\u2013Vancouver Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress 2005 The Exorcism of Emily Rose Dr. Sadira Adani Babak and Friends \u2013 A First Norooz Farah Animated film 2006 American Dreamz Mrs. Nazneen Riza The Lake House Dr. Anna Klyczynski X-Men: The Last Stand Dr. Kavita Rao The Nativity Story Elizabeth 2008 The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 Professor Nasrin Mehani The Stoning of Soraya M.

Perhaps no one has endured/experienced this more over the years than Shohreh Aghdashloo, who has seen great actors who just happen to be Middle Eastern break out of the \u201cterrorist\u201d roles that they had long only been offered to find real work in primetime and features.\n\nBefore being nominated for an Oscar in for 2003 for her brilliant turn in House Of Sand And Fog, she too was offered only terrorist roles. On the eve of the Persian holiday Norooz (New Year), Deadline interviewed the Iranian-born Aghdashloo about what she has seen happen over the past 25 years and how it has changed now that a real call for diversity has taken hold in Hollywood.\n\nRelated Story 'Bachelorette' Choice Could Be Thorny For Franchise Lacking Diversity In Leads\n\nBefore the audition for her career-changing role in House Of Sand And Fog, she said was offered parts as \u201ca terrorist on a plane, a terrorist on the Earth.\u201d All of them were one-dimensional roles, she said. Hollywood has evolved, but it took years.\n\nTwenty-five years ago it was a different mind-set, and she brought up two experiences to illustrate what she meant. Years ago, a casting agent in Los Angeles (since retired) told her that she ran to a type and she was very limited in the roles she would be able to get; English is Aghdashloo\u2019s second language. In response, she said, \u201cI may be limited in your world, but not in my world.\u201d She kept going to auditions, refusing to give up.\n\nFinally, she was sent to an audition for a popular TV series that called for a Middle Eastern woman. \u201cI was asked to meet with the casting director and when I walked in, I heard the casting director say, \u2018No, we are looking for a downtrodden Middle Eastern woman, you\u2019re too beautiful, go home.\u2019 \u201d So she did, and decided to put to practice what she had told the casting director \u2014 see no limits. In other words, she believed she could, so she did.\n\n\u201cI went home, and with my husband Houshang Touzie who is a writer, we started our own Farsi-speaking production company. I found non-union actors \u2014 stage actors \u2014 who were willing to become part of our group and we started putting on plays and touring around the world.\u201d\n\nTwelve years later came a call from DreamWorks for the role in Sand And Fog. But, the call came after producers actually went into the Iranian community of shopkeepers and restaurant owners in Beverly Hills and Westwood and asked them who their favorite actress was.\n\n\u201cMy name was pronounced so many different ways \u2014 Abdahloo, Agdaloo \u2014 so, when they called me, they said whatever your name is would you like to come audition for the role?\u201d\n\nAfter Sand And Fog, which garnered Aghdashloo a Best Supporting Actress nomination, the actress said she\u2019s never stopped working. She has since spent a season on the Emmy-winning 24, then ended up winning an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Mini-Series or Movie for her portrayal of Saddam Hussein\u2019s wife in HBO\u2019s House Of Saddam.\n\nThe actress, who also works with a non-profit called Mother Miracle in India to help school children, continues to be cast in roles in TV, film, and for voice-overs. But, she admits that she still always keeps one eye on legit theater. \u201cI still do theater,\u201d she says. \u201cI love theater. That is something that I cannot stop doing. I love it. I love it.\u201d\n\nHer film Septembers Of Shiraz, a story set against the backdrop of the Iranian revolution, will get a theatrical release in June via Momentum Pictures. Aghdashloo experienced the Iranian Revolution first-hand during the 1970s.\n\n\u201cArt reflects life and life reflects art. Hollywood has changed tremendously over the years but it took a long time to change. At the time that I was cast in House Of Sand And Fog, American society was just evolving into a more cosmopolitan society and Hollywood was trying to adapt itself where it could,\u201d said Aghdashloo. \u201cLet\u2019s do not forget the years that we went through when the economy started deteriorating because that was another problem. Therefore, they were trying to sell products only in the United States and now everyone is thinking globally. I will never forget Nike\u2019s (adage), \u2018Think Globally, Act Locally.\u2019 Now its vice versa. We are a global economy.\u201d\n\nAghdashloo just returned from filming alongside Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac in Terry George\u2019s The Promise \u2014 a love story set against the Armenian genocide in the last days of the Ottoman Empire, from producers Eric Esrailian, William Horberg, Mike Medavoy and Ralph Winter.\n\nShe is now also a lead character in Syfy\u2019s The Expanse, playing a powerful politician and master manipulator.\n\nWe asked how she thought such long-standing stereotypes could be broken. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest and logical and reasonable here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame anyone for wrongdoing. If we want change, we have to change it ourselves. We must change the wrong situation into the right situation and do it the right way. Not nagging, not complaining, not overthinking, not casting a shadow, not blaming people for what they don\u2019t know because they don\u2019t know any better. We can only do it by peaceful co-existence. We cannot blame and fight for our hard times that some of us are going through.\u201d\n\nShe said the last couple of years, especially, she has seen a surge in the kinds of roles all of her Middle Eastern actor friends are getting. \u201cMy friends who were only offered terrorists roles are now in primetime roles,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them have been hired now for pilots. I cannot even tell you how many offers I\u2019ve had for pilots.\u201d And, she said, they are for key and substantial roles.\n\nIn fact, her husband Touzie was in Showtime\u2019s Emmy-winning Homeland, playing Iran\u2019s intelligence chief. Actress Nazanin Boniadi was a fan favorite also on Homeland (there was outcry when her character, Fara, was killed off), and Shaun Toub is on Grimm.\n\n\u201cEverybody has the right to get an opportunity to shine. After all, we are in the land of dreammakers.

However, her family did not want her to pursue a career in acting. Shohreh only started attending theatre workshops after her marriage to Aydin Aghdashloo. Shohreh relocated to England from Iran in 1979, at the start of the Iranian Revolution. She was already familiar with England as Shohreh and her parents had previously been to London as a child. She was only 19 years old when she made her first-ever acting appearance in the theatrical production of the novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North (1973). Shohreh made her debut Iranian language theatrical film appearance in The Chess Game of the Wind in 1976. Later, in 1989, she was cast in her first American theatrical film, Guests of Hotel Astoria as Pori Karemnia. Her passion for acting brought her to Los Angeles, California. After having left Iran, Shohreh started to take an interest in politics, hence, pursuing her bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations. She is very fond of the taste of chocolate and Coca-Cola. Shohreh was brought up in a family of the Muslim religion. She has since denounced her practice of the religion. Her film credits include The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), X-Men: The Last Stand, The Nativity Story (both 2006), The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2013), and Star Trek Beyond (2016). She has had rhinoplasty in the past. Shohreh is the first Iranian actress to cross into mainstream Hollywood cinema and to be nominated for an Oscar.

At the age of 51, she emerged onto the international stage with her Oscar-nominated supporting performance as the wife of a former Iranian military officer reduced to working-class status upon the family's immigration to America in \"House of Sand and Fog\" (2003). From there, the actress was cast in many roles as highly educated, sophisticated professionals on primetime dramas and in films, including \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" (2006). Aghdashloo also maintained a commitment to Iranian social and political issues with productions like \"Maryam\" (2002) and \"The Stoning of Soraya M.\" (2008), which showcased her powerful screen presence and a versatility that helped break down the Western screen's limited notions about Middle-Eastern life and women."}]}
