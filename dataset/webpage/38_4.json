Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that.

She began her professional musical journey in 2015. Prior to that, she was the lead singer of \u2018From Above,\u2019 a British pop girl group formed in 2008 and managed by renowned American record executive and talent manager Mathew Knowles. They went on to participate in the ninth season of The X Factor Bootcamp in 2012.\n\nIn 2015, Seyi decided it was time to pursue a solo career with the release of her debut album \u2018Seyi or Shay\u2018 under Island Records. She has worked and collaborated with a variety of artists around the world including Teyana Taylor, Wizkid, King Promise, Olamide, Timaya and Patoranking.\n\nUnorthodox Reviews caught up with Seyi Shay to learn more about her musical journey, achievements, her new song \u2018Pempe\u2019 with Yemi Alade and her plans for the future.\n\n1. Let\u2019s get started with your new song \u2018Pempe\u2019. I personally loved your chemistry with Yemi Alade in the video. Tell us how you guys connected and what influenced the song\u2019s creation.\n\nYemi and I have had love for each other since 2013 when I did my first Industry Night in Lagos, a night where an act headlines an intimate show for friends and industry colleagues. She came and opened for me and she was so good that I had to take her number and we continued our friendship. I recorded the song in Ghana with producer Kel P and a songwriter called Flash. The song is just me venting about the injustices women in my industry face at the hands of social media and men. The record is full of energy and vibes, Yemi being an energy Queen herself, and having faced similar persecution on social media, seemed to be the perfect person to feature on the record. She heard it once and immediately \u2018vented\u2019 on her verse too.\n\n2. Is \u2018Pempe\u2019 the lead single for your impending Project? What should we expect from the body of work?\n\nPempe is not actually the lead single from my forthcoming project. Pempe is a stand-alone record that just needed to come out. My forthcoming project is again filled with vibes but if I had to put it in a music genre, I\u2019d say it\u2019s very soul and r&b. I hope to release it by the end of Summer 2021.\n\n3. A lot of people may not know about some of your great musical feats like how you were the lead singer of \u2018From Above\u2019 (a band that assisted Beyonc\u00e9 while on tour). Do tell us how your musical journey began and why you decided to go solo.\n\nBeing in a girl band had its ups and downs. We were together for 3 years under the management of Mathew Knowles and it was a learning experience for me. There I learnt everything I know, from performance to media, to singing and recording at the industry level. I started singing professionally at age 15. I wrote a heap of songs for myself and other well-known artists and projects. Check out my discography on Wikipedia. I\u2019d say I started off as a songwriter mainly but my first love is definitely singing and performing. The group broke up because the other ladies wanted to do other things but I wanted to pursue music so I moved back home to Nigeria and continued doing my thing.\n\n4. You are quite vocal when it comes to the injustices in society. Recently you were an advocate for the End Sars movement. What are some of the other pertinent issues you think a typical Nigerian faces?\n\nWe face a lot! Our economy itself is an injustice, bad governance and very little hope for our children. I\u2019m currently very interested in and advocating for young ladies and women. I hope to provide mentorship and help open doors for their future in business and industry.\n\n5. Do you have any unusual habits or rituals before a performance?\n\nI just pray\u2026 no habits.\n\n6. How would you describe a perfect Seyi Shay day.\n\nWake, gym, cook, eat, watch a good movie or go to the spa and end with a loud night out with my friends. lol\n\n7. When you\u2019re not busy making music, what do you do for fun?\n\nI travel, go out clubbing, I eat out.\n\n8. Which young African artists are you rooting for or currently have on your playlists?\n\nI love Tems, I love Chike too.\n\n9. What are the biggest distractions in your life?\n\nI\u2019m very focused. Laser vision.., I must say though that when I\u2019m in love I do get a bit distracted but which girl doesn\u2019t??\n\n10. What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind?\n\nA legacy that speaks of one who came, saw, achieved, succeeded, set global trends, challenged, inspired a generation and conquered."}, {"url": "https://www.boomplay.com/artists/11242", "page_content": "Current #2,530\n\nAll Time #886\n\nSeyi Shay (born December 21, 1985) is the popular stage name of Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua.

The group signed a recording deal with Sony\u2019s Columbia Records and was managed by Mathew Knowles\u2019 Music World Entertainment company. In November 2013, Shay signed an endorsement deal with telecommunications service provider Etisalat. In July 2015, she signed a record deal with Island Records. Shay released her debut studio album Seyi or Shay in November 2015. It was supported by the promotional singles \u201cIrawo\u201d, \u201cRagga Ragga\u201d, and \u201cChairman\u201d.\n\nLife and career\n\nShay was born and raised in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents. Her mother was from Northern Nigeria and her father is a native of Ife. She has two elder brothers and an elder sister. She and her siblings were raised by their single mother. Shay grew up in a religious setting and felt like a single child during her adolescence. She started visiting Nigeria when she was two years old and eventually attended the Command High School in Maryland, Lagos. She went back to London to complete her undergraduate studies. Her interest in music was influenced by members of her household. Her late mother was a chorister and her sister used to compose songs for TV. Moreover, her brother was a radio and club disc jockey. Shay joined her secondary school choir and started performing at the age of 6. She performed for the London Community Gospel Choir during their world tour, which included 13 cities in Japan. Shay was applauded for her performances in Japan. She studied music at a local UK college and went on to study business management at the University of East London. In an interview with Lanre Odukoya of Thisday, Shay said that her mother wasn\u2019t a staunch supporter of her musical ambitions. Moreover, her mother wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. Prior to departing the Earth, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nHer music career took an upswing when she signed her first-ever record deal with No Apology, a record company affiliated with George Martin (commonly referred to as the \u201cFifth Beatle\u201d). In 2006, Shay formed a girl band in the UK called Boadicea; they were managed by Ron Tom, the founder and manager of All Saints and Sugababes.
