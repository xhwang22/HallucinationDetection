Michael Dobbs\n\nReminder Publications\n\nENFIELD, Conn. \u2013 Roger Leblanc said his email has been bursting with messages from former students because of what one of them posted on the web about the retired Longmeadow High School (LHS) teacher.Actress Bridget Moynahan wrote a blog for Teacher Appreciation Week on the website for Jumpstart \u2013 a literacy program \u2013 and named Leblanc as a teacher who made a difference.Leblanc toldthe essay about him was \u201creally nice\u201d and he noted that oftentimes teachers are not aware that what they did made a positive difference in a student\u2019s life.Moynihan, a 1989 LHS graduate, has had a busy career as an actress and is currently one of the stars of the CBS series \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201dLeblanc remembered her fondly and said, \u201cShe was a very, very special student in so many ways.\u201dHe taught at LHS for 40 years before retiring in 2003. He is now coordinating as a volunteer several social service programs in the Thompsonville section of Enfield, Conn. His activities include helping out with a meal program as well as one that gives eligible students backpacks loaded with necessary school supplies.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of things to help families,\u201d he said. The goal of the volunteer program is to help families navigate through the social system bureaucracy and receive the assistance they need to be self-sufficient.Leblanc said he and many other teachers understand they may not receive from students as the students move on to the next class and the next grade. He has followed some of his students through their careers and frequently \u201csees a name that brought back memories.\u201dHe said that although he loved teaching, retiring when he did was the right time as there was more and more emphasis on \u201cteaching to the test\u201d and providing solutions to \u201csolve society\u2019s ills.\u201dThe following is what Moynahan wrote on www.jstart.org on May 6:\u201cTeachers. They are so important. When I look back at some of my favorite teachers, I can\u2019t help but feel lucky to have had so many wonderful people in my life that are passionate about education and caring for others.\u201cI grew up in a small town in Massachusetts, Longmeadow, where I went to school until I was 18 years old. Although there are many teachers that stand out in my mind, I will never forget my junior year English teacher, Mr. Leblanc. Mr. Leblanc stood in the hallway every morning and greeted every student as they walked into school. He stood calmly and peacefully with his hands clasped behind his back and a smile on his face, wearing slacks and a white collared short-sleeved shirt. While I\u2019m sure that he had other shirts, this is how I distinctly remember him. One thing that never changed about his wardrobe was a button that he wore every single day. The button read, \u201cI CARE.\u201d\u201cMr. Leblanc was and is one of the most thoughtful people that I have ever met. He was a passionate teacher who not only cared about homework and test scores; he cared about his students. I will never forget the time that he took me out of my typing class (yes, we had typing class, and yes this makes me feel old!) because he noticed that I wasn\u2019t acting like myself and thought something might be wrong. He was right. I was thankful to be seen that day and I was thankful to be heard. He helped me when I was down and steered me back in the right direction. I am forever grateful for that day in class, and for teachers like Mr. Leblanc that look past the textbooks and curricula, and into the eyes of their students.\u201cMr. Leblanc taught for 40 years. I have not spoken to or seen him since I graduated from Longmeadow High School in 1989. I recently read, to no surprise, that he is volunteering 30 hours a week in a nearby town. Why? Because he cares. Mr. Leblanc, if you\u2019re out there and somehow find yourself reading this blog, thank you for noticing, thank you for listening, and thank you for believing.\u201cAll across the world, teachers are changing the way children think, giving young adults a chance, and providing hope for a better tomorrow. I am so appreciative of all the amazing teachers that I\u2019ve had, and still have in my life, as I can continue to grow and learn new things every day. Happy Teacher Appreciation Week to Mr. Leblanc and to all teachers out there making a difference.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Bridget_Moynahan/", "page_content": "Bridget Moynahan\n\nKathryn Bridget Moynahan (born April 28, 1971) is an American actress and former model best known for her role as Erin Reagan in the police drama Blue Bloods.

Dave Larsen of the Dayton Daily News reported that the subplot involving Moynahan and Affleck was \"the film's weakest point\". The Sum of All Fears received ambivalent reviews, but was a commercial success, earning $193 million at the box office. Her next role was as a CIA trainee in The Recruit (2003). The movie was not well received, with Mike Clark of USA Today commenting that The Recruit is \"less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend\".\n\nIn 2004, Moynahan starred alongside Will Smith in Alex Proyas' science-fiction movie I, Robot, loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection of the same name. Moynahan portrays Dr. Susan Calvin, a specialist in robot psychology. Upon release, I, Robot received mixed reviews, though critics enjoyed Moynahan's performance. Daniel Neman of Richmond Times-Dispatch, who disliked the film, concluded that she \"turns in an able performance as Dr. Calvin, the convenient character.\" With revenue of $347 million worldwide, the film remains Moynahan's most commercially successful picture to date. Her next movie was in 2005's Lord of War, a political crime thriller, as Ava Fontaine Orlov, the wife of Nicolas Cage's character. In 2006, Maxim named her number 96 on its annual \"Hot 100\" list.\n\nIn September 2006, away from film, Moynahan starred as Whitney Crane in the ABC television drama series Six Degrees, co-starring alongside Jay Hernandez, Erika Christensen, Hope Davis, Dorian Missick, and Campbell Scott. The series centered on six residents of New York City and their respective relationships and connections with one another, based on the idea of six degrees of separation. It debuted on September 20, 2006, and was watched by almost 13.3 million viewers. Six Degrees debuted to varied reception, with David Hinckley of the New York Daily News writing, \"In theory, it's an intriguing concept for a series. But in practice, Six Degrees doesn't work at all in drawing you in at the start.\" The series was cancelled after one season in May 2007.\n\nMoynahan's next film role was in the November 2006 thriller Unknown, about a group of individuals kidnapped, and trying to work together how to escape from their captors. She was next seen in 2007, in Gray Matters, starring alongside Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh, before being cast in Henry Bean's comedy-drama Noise, as Helen Owen, the wife of David Owen (Tim Robbins). The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2007 Rome Film Festival and was released in theaters in 2008.\n\nIn December 2008, Moynahan guest-starred in two episodes of the ABC television comedy-drama Eli Stone, playing the titular character's (Jonny Lee Miller) former girlfriend.

She dated NFL quarterback Tom Brady from 2004 until December 14, 2006. Her representative confirmed their split to People in December 2006, stating that they had \"amicably ended their three-year relationship\".\n\nOn February 18, 2007, Moynahan's representative confirmed to People that she was more than three months pregnant, and that Brady is the father. On August 22, 2007, she gave birth to a baby boy, John Edward Thomas Moynahan. In a July 2008 interview in Harper's Bazaar, Moynahan discussed her willingness to raise her son as a single mother.
