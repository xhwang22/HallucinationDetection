{"Harry S. Kennedy was the second-longest-serving senator in American history.": [{"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/history-of-the-us-senate", "page_content": "In fact, both houses of Congress must approve identical pieces of legislation\u2014known as bills\u2014in order for them to become law. Since the early 1800s, both chambers of the U.S. Congress have been based in the Capitol building in Washington , D.C.\n\nWhile some so-called bicameral (\u201ctwo chambers\u201d in Latin) legislatures around the world feature two separate bodies with distinct levels of power\u2014such as the House of Lords and the House of Commons in the U.K. Parliament \u2014the Senate and House of Representatives actually have roughly the same amount of power in the U.S. government.\n\nThe United States Senate is the upper house of the legislative branch of the federal government, with the House of Representatives referred to as the lower house. In the United States, the terms \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d house are not literal; they date back to a time in the 1780s when the Senate and House of Representatives met on the upper and lower floors of Federal Hall, their base in the former U.S. capital of New York City.\n\nThe Founding Fathers and the Senate\n\nAlthough the U.S. Senate in its present form dates back to 1789, the year Congress as it is currently constructed met for the first time, it was not part of the original unicameral (\u201cone chamber\u201d) legislature established by the Founding Fathers.\n\nInitially, the Founding Fathers, or \u201cframers\u201d of the U.S. Constitution, drafted a document called the Articles of Confederation, which was written in 1777 and ratified in 1781 by the Continental Congress (a temporary legislative body with representatives from each of the 13 colonies, which became the original 13 states).\n\nThe Articles established a unicameral Congress and the Supreme Court, but no Office of the President. Indeed, the first Congress had wide-ranging powers that included the authority to declare war and sign and negotiate treaties. Other government functions, such as taxation and the collection thereof, were left to the states.\n\nThis original Congress was made up of members elected by each of the states, which were represented equally. However, it soon became clear that this form of government was inadequate in many ways\u2014namely, the more-populated states complained that they should have greater representation in the government than their smaller counterparts and that the unicameral legislature did not provide adequate checks and balances against potential abuse of power.\n\nThe Difference Between Congress and The Senate\n\nWith the writing of the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in 1787, the framers effectively went back to the drawing board and created a bicameral legislature.\n\nIt was modeled after similar forms of government in Europe that dated back to the Middle Ages. Notably, from their perspective, England had a bicameral Parliament as fact back as the 17th century.\n\nThe Constitution established the two houses of Congress, with the Senate featuring two members from each state, appointed to six-year terms, and the House of Representatives made up of varying members from each state, based on population, elected to two-year terms.\n\nImportantly, the Constitution originally stipulated that while members of the House of Representatives were elected by the citizens of each state (meaning: those eligible to vote), members of the Senate were instead appointed by the individual legislatures of the 13 states.\n\nThis was the case until 1913, with the passage of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, which effectively changed the process to what it still is today, with Senators elected to six-year terms by the citizens of their respective states.\n\nWhat Does a Senator Do?\n\nOriginally, the framers intended to have the House be focused on more pressing, everyday concerns, while the Senate would be the more deliberative, policy-centric body. However, these distinctions have generally blurred over the decades since, and now the two houses hold the same amount of power, and essentially have the same duties.\n\nThat said, the Senate does play a unique role in the functioning of the U.S. government. For example:\n\nImpeachment: While the House of Representatives initiates impeachment proceedings against government officials, including the President, it is the Senate that investigates the charges and tries the cases against the officials, effectively acting as a prosecutor and jury. Since 1789, the Senate has tried 20 federal officials, including three presidents.\n\nCabinet, Ambassadorial and Judicial Nominations: The President has the power to appoint members of his presidential cabinet (including secretaries to the various agencies of the federal government), U.S. ambassadors to foreign countries and the United Nations, and justices of the Supreme Court and other federal judges. However, the Senate holds the power to vet and approve these appointments. Appointees who fail to receive Senate approval cannot assume their posts.\n\nTreaties: While the President holds the power to negotiate and make treaties with foreign governments, the Senate must ratify these agreements, and the body does hold the power to amend treaties as it deems necessary.\n\nCensure and Expulsion: Article 1, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution gives both houses of Congress the right to punish members for \u201cdisorderly behavior.\u201d In the Senate, members can be \u201ccensured\u201d (a formal term essentially meaning condemnation or denouncement), which is a formal disapproval. The Senate, by a two-thirds majority, can also vote to expel a member for disorderly conduct, a far more severe punishment. Since 1789, the Senate has censured nine members and expelled 15.\n\nFilibuster and Cloture: The procedure known as filibuster\u2014essentially open debate used to delay or block a vote on legislation\u2014has been employed numerous times throughout history. In 1957, Senator Strom Thurmond famously filibustered for more than 24 hours in an attempt to delay a vote on the Civil Rights Act of that year. His filibuster included a full reading of the Declaration of Independence. Since 1917, with the passage of Rule 22, the Senate can vote to end a debate with a two-thirds majority, in a procedure known as cloture. In 1975, the Senate modified the cloture rule to enable enacting of the tactic on a three-fifths majority (60 of the 100 members).\n\nInvestigations: Both houses of Congress can conduct formal investigations of wrongdoing on the part of the Executive Branch (the president and/or his cabinet) as well as other officials and agencies. One of the most famous Senate investigations involved the Watergate scandal, which led to the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.\n\nContested Elections: The Constitution also gives each house of Congress the power to be the judge of the \u201celections, returns and qualifications of its own members.\u201d Since 1789, the Senate has developed procedures for judging the qualifications of its members and settling contested elections.\n\nSenate Leadership\n\nThe Senate\u2019s leadership also differs from that of the House of Representatives.\n\nFor example, in addition to being the first person to succeed the President, should the person elected to the position be unable to fulfill the role (as a result of death, illness or impeachment), one of the duties of the Vice President of the United States, who is elected to office on the same \u201cticket\u201d as the President, is to serve as the \u201cPresident of the Senate.\u201d\n\nIn this role, the Vice President has no vote, unless a vote on legislation results in a 50-50 split. In this case, the Vice President casts the vote to effectively break the tie. Since 1870, no Vice President has had to perform this task more than 10 times during his term in office.\n\nLike the House of Representatives, the Senate also has Majority and Minority Leaders. The Majority Leader represents the party with the majority of seats in the Senate. The Majority Leader coordinates with committee chairs and their party members to schedule debate on the Senate floor.\n\nBoth the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, who represents the party with fewer seats in the Senate, also advocate for their respective party\u2019s positions on various issues and pieces of legislation being debated in the body.\n\nThe current leaders of the Senate are Vice President Mike Pence and president pro tempore Chuck Grassley.\n\nSources:\n\nOrigins and Development: The U.S Senate: United States Senate.\n\nThe Two Houses of the United States Congress: The Center on Representative Government, Indiana University.\n\nArticles of Confederation: Digital History, University of Houston."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/ted-kennedy", "page_content": "Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy (1932-2009), the youngest brother of President John Kennedy (1917-1963), was a U.S. senator from Massachusetts from 1962 to 2009, making him one of the longest-serving senators in American history. Kennedy entered the Senate after winning a 1962 special election to fill the seat vacated by his brother John when he became president. During his career on Capitol Hill, Ted Kennedy was a spokesman for liberal causes, including civil rights, health care and immigration. A leader of the Democratic Party, he was known for his ability to work with those on both sides of the political aisle. In 1980, Kennedy, whose reputation was tarnished by a 1969 car accident, made a failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Dubbed the \u201cliberal lion of the Senate,\u201d he died of cancer at age 77 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Childhood and Education\n\nEdward Moore Kennedy was born in Boston on February 22, 1932, the youngest of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. (1888-1969), a wealthy financier who served as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and later as ambassador to Great Britain, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (1890-1995), the daughter of a Boston politician.\n\nDid you know? In 2011, Ted Kennedy\u2019s son Patrick, an eight-term U.S. congressman from Rhode Island, resigned from politics. His exit marked the first time since 1947\u2013when John Kennedy became a U.S. congressman from Massachusetts\u2013that no member of the Kennedy family held elective office in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs a child, Kennedy moved between his family\u2019s homes in Massachusetts, New York, Palm Beach and London, and attended 10 schools before graduating from Milton Academy in Massachusetts in 1950. He went on to attend Harvard University, the alma mater of his father and three older brothers. During his freshman year, he was expelled after a classmate took a Spanish exam in his place. Kennedy then enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving from 1951 to 1953, mostly in Europe. Afterward, he re-enrolled in Harvard, where he became a more serious student and played on the football team.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, he attended the University of Virginia School of Law. While still a law student, he managed his brother John\u2019s successful 1958 reelection campaign to the U.S. Senate, where he represented Massachusetts. The following year, Kennedy earned his law degree and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Election to the U.S. Senate\n\nWhen John Kennedy made his 1960 run for the White House, Ted Kennedy campaigned for him in the Western states. A licensed pilot, he barnstormed around the region, meeting with delegates and trying bronco riding and ski jumping as a way to connect with people.\n\nIn November 1960, John Kennedy was elected America\u2019s 35th president. The following month, a Kennedy family friend, Benjamin Smith (1916-1991), was appointed to fill the president-elect\u2019s vacated Senate seat until a special election was held. On November 6, 1962, Ted Kennedy, who earlier that year had turned 30 (the minimum age requirement for a U.S. senator), won the special election in Massachusetts to serve out the remainder of his brother\u2019s Senate term, ending in January 1965. Massachusetts voters reelected Kennedy to the seat eight more times, in 1964, 1970, 1976, 1982, 1988, 1994, 2000 and 2006.\n\nWith John Kennedy in the White House, Ted Kennedy in the Senate and their brother Robert (1925-1968) serving as the U.S. attorney general from 1961 to 1964 and as a U.S. senator from New York from 1965 to 1968, the glamorous, wealthy, Irish-Catholic Kennedys were often referred to as an American political dynasty.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Marriages and Family\n\nIn 1958 Ted Kennedy married Joan Bennett (1936-), who he met through his sister Jean (1928-); both women had attended Manhattanville College in New York. The couple had three children\u2014Kara (1960-), Edward Jr. (1961-) and Patrick (1967-)\u2014before divorcing in 1982. In 1992, Kennedy married Victoria Reggie (1954-), a Washington attorney with two children. Kennedy often spent time with his family sailing, which he described as his favorite pastime.\n\nTragedy Strikes the Kennedys\n\nOn November 22, 1963, tragedy struck the Kennedy family and the nation when 46-year-old President John Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. He was the third Kennedy sibling to perish. The oldest child, Joseph Kennedy Jr. (1915-1944), a Navy pilot, died in World War II, and the second-eldest daughter, Kathleen (1920-1948), was killed in a plane crash in France. In June 1964, Ted Kennedy escaped death when the small plane he was riding in crashed in Massachusetts in bad weather, killing two people and leaving Kennedy with a broken back and other injuries that required a six-month hospital recuperation.\n\nOn June 5, 1968, tragedy struck again when 42-year-old Senator Robert Kennedy, who had just won the Democratic presidential primary in California, was assassinated in Los Angeles.\n\nWith Robert\u2019s death, Ted Kennedy became the family patriarch\u2013his father Joseph had suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1961\u2013and a surrogate father to his two slain brothers\u2019 13 children.\n\nIncident at Chappaquiddick\n\nOn July 18, 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in a controversial event that would mar the rest of his career. He accidentally drove his car off a bridge on Massachusetts\u2019 Chappaquiddick Island, killing his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne (1940-1969), who drowned. Kennedy did not report the incident to the authorities for nearly 10 hours, claiming the delay was due to the fact that he had suffered a concussion and was exhausted from attempting to rescue Kopechne.\n\nThe 37-year-old senator pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended sentence. However, Kennedy was plagued by questions about his behavior. He later referred to his actions as \u201cinexcusable\u201d and said that Kopechne\u2019s death \u201chaunts me every day of my life.\u201d\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Bid for the White House\n\nIn November 1979, Ted Kennedy announced he would run against President Jimmy Carter (1924-) for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy won primaries in New York, California and eight other states, but his campaign was disorganized and hurt by lingering questions about Chappaquiddick. At the August 1980 Democratic National Convention, he withdrew his bid for the presidency and went on to deliver a fiery speech in which he said, \u201cFor me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end. For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\u201d\n\nKennedy never made another bid for the presidency.\n\nThe Liberal Lion of the Senate\n\nSome historians have called Ted Kennedy one of the most effective legislators in the history of the U.S. Senate. During nearly 47 years on Capitol Hill, his office wrote some 2,500 bills, over 300 of which became law. Additionally, over 550 bills that he co-sponsored became law. A skilled orator and gifted storyteller, Kennedy was known for his ability to collaborate with Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nHe successfully fought for legislation concerning education, immigration reform, increases to the federal minimum wage, voting rights, AIDS care, various consumer protections and equal rights for minorities, the disabled, women and gay Americans. In 1972 he was the driving force behind the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which provides food assistance and access to health services for low-income women and their children, and he was instrumental in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which banned workplace discrimination against and required public accommodations for the disabled.\n\nKennedy referred to universal health insurance as \u201cthe cause of my life,\u201d and for decades worked to achieve national health reform. Kennedy\u2019s widow Victoria was present when President Barack Obama (1961-) signed historic health care legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in March 2010.\n\nIn foreign policy matters, Kennedy was an opponent of the Vietnam War and in 2002 voted against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq. He worked for human rights in South America in the 1970s, championed U.S. government sanctions against apartheid-ruled South Africa in the 1980s, and helped broker a peace agreement in Northern Ireland in the late 1990s.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Final Years\n\nIn May 2008, Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. That August, despite his poor health, he made a rousing speech in his distinct Massachusetts accent at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. In his speech, the senator, who earlier that year had endorsed Barack Obama for president, invoked the legacy of the Kennedy family when he stated, \u201cAnd this November the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans\u2026The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on.\u201d\n\nOn August 25, 2009, the 77-year-old Kennedy succumbed to brain cancer at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. At his funeral, which was attended by three former U.S. presidents, the late senator was eulogized by President Obama. Kennedy was buried at Virginia\u2019s Arlington National Cemetery, near the graves of his brothers John and Robert. Kennedy\u2019s memoir, \u201cTrue Compass,\u201d was published posthumously in September 2009."}, {"url": "https://en.as.com/latest_news/what-senators-have-served-the-longest-in-the-us-senate-n/", "page_content": "In order to become a US Senator, you must first be at least 30 years old.

Three of the top twenty-five longest serving Senators are still in their jobs. Only one of them will have to face off a challenger this year, Chuck Grassley from Iowa.\n\nBut even if he should be victorious, a fairly likely outcome as he\u2019s been well ahead in the polls throughout the 2022 campaign, he still won\u2019t be the oldest currently serving Senator. Grassley would need another two terms in office to beat the current record of service and age to boot. Here\u2019s a look.\n\nThe longest serving US Senators\n\nSenator Robert C Byrd is the current record holder for the longest-serving US Senator. He served for a little more than five decades in the upper chamber of the US Congress elected for the first of nine times in 1958. He was in office for 51 years, 5 months, 26 days until his death in 2010 at the age of 92. He is also the longest-serving member of the US congress elected to the House of Representatives in 1952.\n\nThe three currently longest-serving US Senators in order are Democratic Senator from Vermont Patrick J. Leahy, followed by Republican Senators Chuck Grassley from Iowa and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky. Between them they have a combined service of nearly 127 years. They are currently third, eight and fifteenth, respectively, on the list of the top twenty-five longest-serving US Senators.\n\nTen longest-serving US Senators\n\n1 Robert C Byrd (D-WV) Jan 3, 1959 - Jun 28, 2010 51 years, 5 months, 26 days 2 Daniel K Inouye (D-HI) Jan 3, 1963 - Dec 17, 2012 49 years, 11 months, 15 days 3 Patrick J Leahy (D-VT) Jan 3, 1975 - present 47 years and counting 4 Strom Thurmond (D, R-SC) Dec 14, 1954 - Jan 3, 2003 47 years, 5 months, 8 days 5 Edward M Kennedy (Ted) (D-MA) Nov 7, 1962 - Aug 25, 2009 46 years, 9 months, 19 days 6 Orrin G Hatch (R-UT) Jan 3, 1977 - Jan 3, 2019 42 years 7 Carl T Hayden (D-AZ) Mar 4, 1927 - Jan 3, 1969 41 years, 10 months 8 Chuck Grassley (R-IA) Jan 3, 1981 - present 41 years and counting 9 John C Stennis (D-MS) Nov 5, 1947 - Jan 3, 1989 41 years, 1 month, 29 days 10 Ted Stevens (R-AK) Dec 24, 1968 - Jan 3, 2009 40 years, 10 days\n\nWho is the oldest US Senator?\n\nThere are a number of factors that result in incumbent US Senators winning reelection every six-years. Since 1964, 80 percent of them have seen off challengers to return to Washington DC for another term. This means that some have managed to keep their jobs well into their golden years.\n\nThe oldest serving US Senator ever upon leaving office was Strom Thurmond. At the ripe age of 100, he had been the longest-serving US Senator at that time but has now slipped to fourth place. The Dixie-crat turned Republican over the Democratic Party\u2019s Civil Rights program in 1956 became a prominent leader of a more conservative GOP. He passed away a few months after retiring.\n\nCurrently Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein beats out Senator Grassley as the oldest sitting US Senator by just under three months, both are currently 89 years old. While Senator Grassley is up for reelection in 2022, Senator Feinstein will be on the ballot in 2024.

A 2018 survey showed 82 percent of Americans supported implementing term limits for members of Congress. If term limits were passed in Congress, which members of Congress would no longer be allowed to serve? We put together a list of the longest-serving members of Congress as well as historical record holders for longest tenure in office. The members of Congress included in this blog have served for at least 36 years in the House, Senate, or a combination of both. In matters where there was a tie for the amount of time served in Congress, members were sorted first by uninterrupted service, chronological order, senators over representatives, and Senate and House seniority. To provide a comparison to current members of Congress\u2019s tenure length, we also included former members of Congress that hold records for the longest service.While there have been efforts made by both former President Trump and others in the past to limit the number of terms senators can serve, there are currently no term limits for Congress. Proposed term limits have been proposed to limit service to two consecutive terms, totaling 12 years of service consecutively. These measures, however, have never been enacted into law.The most recent proposed term limit legislation was introduced in the House by Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN-02) in November 2021, which would limit incoming members of Congress to serve a maximum of three two-year terms consecutively. So far, this joint resolution has garnered 79 cosponsors, all of whom are Republicans. If this bill had been passed during these representatives\u2019 tenure, their careers may have been cut short.There are 13 active members of Congress that have the longest tenure of service, some of whom have served only in one chamber and some of whom have served both the Senate and House of Representatives. These are members of Congress actively serving that have the longest combined record of service on anyone currently serving in Congress.The average age of members of Congress skews older than the average age of most Americans, with the average American being 20 years younger than their representative in Congress. As of 2015, 19 percent of Americans eligible to run for Congress are 65 or older . With Congress meant to reflect the diversity (including age) of the United States population, it\u2019s notable that 40 percent of current senators and 26 percent of representatives are 65 or older. Less than 5 percent of members of Congress are between the ages of 25 and 40, despite the fact that 33 percent of the over-25 population in the U.S. are under 40 years of age.When meeting with a member of Congress, examining their tenure in office and their age help you develop an understanding of what issues may matter to them based on their legislative history and experience. Understanding these factors can better inform your strategy when interacting with members of Congress to achieve your policy goals. A member of Congress that has served for more than 40 years may have immense institutional knowledge but may require more thorough education on your issues depending on their policy areas of expertise. However, with a longer tenure comes a more clear record of how they may react to your issues. Say you\u2019re planning to meet with a representative who has been in office for more than 40 years. Before your meeting, do some research into their legislative and professional experience to better plan your messaging strategy\u2014 what legislation have they sponsored in the past? Which committees have they sat on? What was their profession before assuming office? How do they talk about your issues on social media?

If they were both sworn into office in January 1963, wouldn't they both would have the same number of years of service? In any case, if Sen. Inouye is the fourth longest serving senator, who is the fifth?\n\nIt is true that both Kennedy and Inouye were first elected to the Senate on Nov. 6, 1962. But Kennedy was running in a special election -- to fill the seat left vacant when Sen. John F. Kennedy, his brother, was elected president in 1960. (An interim appointee, Benjamin Smith II, was a placeholder, serving until Teddy was old enough to run.)\n\nAnd because it was a special election, Kennedy was sworn in shortly after the election to fill the seat -- on Nov. 7th. That's why he's more senior than Inouye, who is fourth all time.\n\nNumber five is Carl Hayden, an Arizona Democrat.

Could you tell us about where you were born?\n\nDaniel Inouye: I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. In fact, I can just about picture it for you. Across from the Pacific Club. Ironically, the Pacific Club was a club for the titans of industry. The Big Boys. But I think it might be a bit more interesting if I told you a few years before then\u2026\n\nMy grandparents, from the southern island of Japan, Kyushu, walked all the way from Kyushu to Tokyo, Yokohama, to get on a ship \u2014 and this was the first of July, I believe, or fourth of July \u2014 on the Shanghai Maru. It took about 30 days, arrived in Honolulu about the 25th of July, 1899. To work in a plantation. They were given about three days of health examinations and such, and on the 28th they were shipped off to the island of Kauai. And there they worked in the plantations for over 20 years. They had a goal to make $300, because the family had a debt that had to be paid, which was a matter of honor for them. My father had had gone over as a child of two. About that time a law was passed by the United States making it impossible for any one of these immigrants to become naturalized, no matter how good they were. But that was the beginning.\n\nMy father was, I would say, a Buddhist. My grandparents are Buddhist. My mother, on the other hand, was a child of immigrant parents also, from Hiroshima, on the island of Maui, but at the time of her birth her mother died. And then her father died four years later, so here she was literally on the street. Because her father was a plantation worker, and no longer in existence, so that house went to the next worker. But fortunately, about a month after his passing, a young Hawaiian couple came by, took her by the hand, and took her home, and in the Hawaiian fashion adopted her: hanai. She was also brought up as a Buddhist as a child. But about a year after the Hawaiian family had discovered her, she was also discovered by the Methodist pastor in Lahaina. And he took the attitude \u201cOrphans belong in orphanages,\u201d and so shipped her off to Honolulu as a young child. But here everything changes. She went to the orphanage, and on the first Sunday afternoon all the young girls of Asian extraction were lined up, and the bishop of the church came by and they went through the ritual: \u201cWhat is your name? What would you like?\u201d And the answer was always, \u201cA piece of candy.\u201d My mother had no idea what it was. So she said, \u201cI want a home.\u201d And the bishop took her home, believe it or not, and she was adopted by the bishop. So until she passed away, her two sisters were blonde and blue-eyed, her brother blond and blue-eyed, and her father\u2019s name was Daniel Kleinfelter. Dr. Bishop Daniel Kleinfelter. I\u2019m named after him. So that\u2019s my beginning.\n\nHow about school? Do you have an early memory of school in Hawaii?\n\nDaniel Inouye: Yes, they were all public schools. I went to kindergarten, and I had a lovely time there. It was an Episcopal kindergarten. My mother and my father were Methodist, but I became, very proudly, a Holder of the Cross. And it became a big time for me, at the age of four, walking down the aisle. So that was my first big achievement. And on Christmas Eve I was the first King in the Three Kings of Orient. So that was another great achievement. I\u2019ll never forget those days. They were good days.\n\nWere you a good student? Did you like school?\n\nDaniel Inouye: I was the eldest son. And from as early as I can recall it was pounded into me that you are the eldest son, you are to make certain sacrifices. And the word \u201chonor.\u201d Can you imagine a three-year-old kid, being lectured about honor? But that became a key word. For example, when I left Hawaii to put on the uniform I was 18 years old. My father and I were on the streetcar, going towards the departure point, and the only thing he said was, \u201cWhatever you do, do not dishonor the family. Do not dishonor the country. And if you must die, die with honor.\u201d I\u2019m an 18-year-old kid and he\u2019s telling me that! And I understood exactly what he meant. While I was the eldest, I had a sister, right below me, and two brothers.\n\nHow about books that you read when you were a child? Was there any particular book that you enjoyed?\n\nDaniel Inouye: The first book that I recall reading was The Three Bears. Mama, Papa, Baby Bear. And that was my mother reading it to me. I must have been about two years old, but I\u2019ve loved bears ever since!\n\nHow about when you were a little bit older? Was there a teacher or mentor or another adult that inspired or challenged or motivated you?\n\nDaniel Inouye: The first motivating teacher came in about my first year in high school. Now if you can picture me at that time, we hardly wore shoes. As I told a committee once, a committee that questioned my application for the Honor Society. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear shoes?\u201d And I told them very clearly, \u201cShoes are for funerals, church services, weddings and extraordinary days. Otherwise, I am barefooted.\u201d And that\u2019s the way most of my colleagues were, young kids.\n\nDo you have any early memories of discrimination?\n\nDaniel Inouye: I was too young. We all lived in enclaves \u2014 the Japanese area, Filipino area, Chinese, Hawaiian \u2014 but in school we were all together. Most of the teachers were white, but most of the students were either Asian or Polynesian, and a few white. And in Hawaii \u2014 this may sound strange \u2014 at that time, those of Portuguese ancestry didn\u2019t consider themselves white. \u201cWe are Portuguese.\u201d They were very proud of it. Very insular people, hard working, but they always differentiated themselves. So when we said \u201cwhite\u201d in Hawaii, in my generation, it did not include the Portuguese. So in elementary school I\u2019d say it was one percent White and the rest were \u201cUs.\u201d It was the same thing in intermediate school and high school. In high school I think the largest group were of Japanese ancestry.\n\nDid you find that different groups were discriminated against?\n\nDaniel Inouye: We had a segregated school system. Most people don\u2019t remember that, because that\u2019s a long, long time ago. It was called English Standard Schools. You had to pass certain examinations. Not just written, but the spoken language. And usually, those of us who came from these enclaves would not make the test. Because, for example, I took the test just for the hell of it and I got a perfect paper. But when I faced a teacher, she immediately knew I spoke pidgin, and I flunked! But that\u2019s the way it was. English Standard Schools, it was a public school. About ten percent were non-white, 90 percent were White. This went on until about 1956, and it was completely wiped out then.\n\nDid something happen around this time that motivated you to study medicine?\n\nDaniel Inouye: When I was in the seventh grade, during one of the sporting events, wrestling, I fell the wrong way and I fractured my elbow. Compound fracture. It was rather bad. The bone protruded. But somehow, my parents couldn\u2019t afford a first class orthopedic surgeon, so believe it or not we got one of these judo specialists, like a sports physician. And naturally he didn\u2019t do a good job, because this was a compound fracture. To make a long story short, my mother finally took me to Shriners (Hospital), and got hold of Dr. Craig, a very important person. He was the head orthopedic surgeon. He looked me over, and he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d We had surgery, turned out well, good enough to be admitted into the service. I never forgot him, because about a week after my surgery, my mother and I went to his office, and there my mother said, \u201cIt may take us a lifetime, but I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d He said, \u201cDid I ever mention a fee?\u201d He said, \u201cAll you do is pay for the operating room, which is $25. And my services? Your payment will be you\u2019ll be a good student.\u201d And here I was. And right then, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be an orthopedic surgeon.\u201d\n\nAt what point did you join the Red Cross as a medical aide?\n\nDaniel Inouye: I was about 16 then, in my first year of high school. A lot of the kids took part, and I wanted to know something about first aid. Not because I wanted to be a doctor, but I thought first aid was fine. By 1941 I was a rather senior fellow. Even at the age of 17 I was in charge of all the medical aid men. We had this Aid Station. This is in 1941, just before the attack. So when the attack came, our Aid Stations were already set. Now these Aid Stations were for local problems. We had an ambulance and it worked out well. So I worked in the Aid Station on the night shift and went to school during the day. And on December the 7th, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d call it an honor, but people tell me that I picked up the first civilian dead, and somehow I did not faint or throw up. I did my job.\n\nTell us about the attack on Pearl Harbor. Can you tell us how that day started out for you?\n\nDaniel Inouye: I was, like the rest of the family, getting ready for church. It was Sunday, December 7, 1941. And as every Sunday, I had the little radio on, listening to music, and the disc jockey was saying, \u201cThe next song is this and this and this\u2026\u201d. And he\u2019d be playing, and I was putting on my necktie, and all of a sudden he started screaming, \u201cThe Japs are bombing us! This is no exercise!\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, this is crazy. It must be part of the show.\u201d You know? Because Orson Welles had done something like that just about that time. So I didn\u2019t take it seriously. But then he kept on it. Screaming and yelling. No music. So I decided to go out, and I looked out towards Pearl Harbor, and my God! There were puffs, anti-aircraft, and aircraft flying, and all of a sudden three of them, flew above us, above me. It was grey with red dots on the wing. I knew they were Japanese. I used some profanity then, but I figured the world had come to an end there. So I called my father and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better come out and take a look,\u201d and I immediately knew what I have to do. I took off my Sunday clothes, put on my work clothes, went to the Aid Station, and I was away for about a week.\n\nSo you saw the first casualties come in that day?\n\nDaniel Inouye: On the first day I was in charge of that team, stretcher team. First was a woman, I\u2019ll never forget, part of her head was sliced off. Shrapnel. But ironically, it happened that these shells were our shells. In the excitement, the crew in charge of the anti-aircraft battery had forgotten to put the timer on. See, the shells have to have a timer, so that when it gets up to a certain height it explodes. Sometimes you want it lower, sometimes you want it higher. But this time they forgot to do it, so it just went up and down. It hit the ground and exploded. And so it just happened that it hit right in our neighborhood. The first one was this old lady having breakfast. The second one was about six people, the shops had just opened. And the worst one was a mother holding her child. Her head was sliced off, her legs were sliced off. And the baby\u2019s head \u2014 clop! \u2014in the bottom. There\u2019s a little story to this, because that afternoon the husband, who happened to be away on the other side of the island doing some work, came by for them when the war started, and looked for his family, came to the Aid Station. \u201cIs my wife wounded?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see her.\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And he insisted, and the doctor said, \u201cShow her to him.\u201d I said, \u201cDoc, if you show that remains to him, he\u2019s going to go nuts.\u201d Sure enough, he ended up in the insane asylum. That\u2019s how it happens. So I was ready for the war.\n\nYou were ready to sign up. Is it true they wouldn\u2019t take you at first?\n\nDaniel Inouye: I had gone to the Draft Board to say, \u201cI want to sign up,\u201d and they said, \u201cNo, you are 4-C.\u201d I had no idea what 4-C was, though. So I had to inquire, \u201cWhat is a 4-C?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re enemy.\u201d Ho! To be told by a fellow American that you\u2019re an enemy, that\u2019s stunning. I could never forget that. I was just 18 at that time. And like most young men I wanted to serve my country. Put on a uniform and do our business. Well, about three weeks after the bombing we got word that we of Japanese ancestry, were declared to be 4-C. 1-A is physically fit and mentally alert. 4-F is, something\u2019s wrong with you physically or mentally. 4-C is the designation for \u201cenemy alien.\u201d I was made an enemy, and as a result, I was not qualified to put on the uniform. So I couldn\u2019t be drafted, I couldn\u2019t volunteer. So we got together, Japanese Americans, and began petitioning the President to say, \u201cLook, give us an opportunity to show our stuff.\u201d And in December of 1942 a decision was made, was announced in January, that they\u2019ll take volunteers to form a Japanese American regiment. And 85 percent of those in Hawaii who were qualified volunteered. Pretty good. To make a long story short, I got in at 18. I was second to the last to get in, because I was exempted, \u2019cause I was in the Aid Station, and I was in college as a pre-med. Doctors and pre-meds were set aside as essential, and those of us in the Aid Station were considered essential. So I quit school, I quit my job, and I went back and I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d So I got in. I was one of the youngest in the regiment. I got a commission. I was too young, but they gave me a commission when I was 20. But at the age of 19 I was a platoon leader.\n\nWhile you were trying to enlist, wasn\u2019t this the same time that Japanese Americans on the mainland were being interned?\n\nDaniel Inouye: A decision had been made, just about the same time, to put them all in camps. So initially they were put in whatever was available. So thousands spent time in Santa Anita race track, where the horses slept. Those were strange days for them. And when the camps were made, they were just wooden shacks. They were shipped off to faraway, desolate places in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Arkansas, away from big cities and such, 120,000 of \u2019em. And none of them had committed a crime. Later on, after the war, when the investigations were held \u2014 not a single violator of the law.\n\nWhat were the feelings of your community in Hawaii about what was happening to Japanese Americans on the mainland?\n\nDaniel Inouye: We had no idea, because everything was censored. The newspapers were all censored. There were people who knew about it, but not a young kid of 17 or 18.\n\nI had no idea. When we got on the ship to go to California, it was my first trip outside Hawaii. We had no idea where we were headed for. When we got to Oakland the word came down we were going to Mississippi. And the only thing that most of us could think about in Mississippi was what we read. They lynch people there. That\u2019s what you read in the papers. So the outlook wasn\u2019t that good. We got on the train, and we were told that whenever we approached a city, a word will come down and we bring down the shade. Understandably, because if we went through this railroad station and the shades were up, and people looked in and saw me, they would think I\u2019m a prisoner of war. I look Asian. So they thought the best way to avoid problems is to lock up the train, and we would lift up the shades when we left the town or the village or the city. So we saw beautiful America \u2014 Grand Canyon and places like that. But when we got to Mississippi \u2014 this must have been about five days later \u2014 we expected the worst, and lo and behold, there were about 50 women lined up at the train station in gray Red Cross uniforms. They were all white women. And it was quite an eye-opener, because in Hawaii I had never been served by a white woman. Most of the waitresses and waiters where I went to dine, the little coffee shops and such, were all Japanese or Chinese or Filipinos. So this was elegant white ladies serving us coffee and donuts. And then, later on, several families opened their farms and invited us to come over. But the real kicker was the U.S.O. About a month after we arrived there, they sent an invitation: \u201cWe\u2019re having a dance for you. So if you\u2019re interested, we\u2019ll be at this auditorium,\u201d what have you. And I decided I\u2019d go. My first dance was with a blonde! Never had one before. That\u2019s achievement! When you consider coming up with the background I had, it was an achievement. How can you ever forget that? It was very pleasant. It gave us a little drive that America wasn\u2019t bad, even if they declared that I was an enemy alien. And I was an enemy alien until the end of the war.\n\nWhat was basic training like? Did you get more or less training than other units?\n\nDaniel Inouye: We got more than the usual amount of basic training because we trained as a unit. Not to train us off to be shipped off to some division, or some regiment. We were a special unit, and as such we became a combat team. We had our own artillery, our own engineers, our own medic. So it was a unit that could be deployed anywhere. Self-sufficient.\n\nHow long was the basic training?\n\nDaniel Inouye: Eleven months. That\u2019s long, because usually it\u2019s about six months. We had to train to do battle as a unit, not just to fire as individuals.\n\nDid you learn something after you joined the military that you hadn\u2019t known before you signed up?\n\nDaniel Inouye: You must keep in mind that my mother was a devout Methodist. She was a member of the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union. Saloon busters, you know? So going to church was part of my life. At the time of December the 7th, I was a Sunday School teacher. Sang in a choir. I would say I was a good Christian boy. Read from the Bible. I still do. The Ten Commandments. And so here I am now in uniform, and we get out to the firing range, and I find that I\u2019m the best shot in the company. I couldn\u2019t make sense of it, because I had never fired a gun in my life. And the instructor said, \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re good. You don\u2019t have any bad habits. You just follow instructions.\u201d So my first assignment, which lasted about a month, I was a sniper. But then they made me an assistant squad leader, so they gave me a couple of stripes. I was too young for that.\n\nYou were an assistant squad leader?\n\nDaniel Inouye: Yep. I became assistant squad leader, and went overseas as such. But in the first battle, everything happens, the squad leader gets killed, I become squad leader. And before you know it I was platoon leader. It was a mess.\n\nWhy do you say that you were too young for that?\n\nDaniel Inouye: Eighteen? Shaved twice a week. There was only one person younger than me. I had to convince my fellow soldiers that I was worthy of being a sergeant. These guys were older, bigger, and I\u2019m a Sunday School teacher. I had to do a lot of things to prove myself to them. Don\u2019t mess with me.\n\nWe have one more question about the 442nd Regiment. Was it integrated?\n\nDaniel Inouye: It was segregated. In the beginning, most of our officers were white, but as we moved along in the war, my colonel had a policy, if there were men worthy of leadership, we make them leaders. On my 20th birthday they submitted my name. I had no idea. I figured I was too young at that age. But one day I found out I was a lieutenant.\n\nIn 2000, President Bill Clinton honored you with the highest military decoration the United States can bestow, the Medal of Honor. This was 55 years after the war. Do you think that was too late?\n\nDaniel Inouye: No, I was surprised. It was something. I knew that a study had been made, because a bill had been introduced to see if Distinguished Service Crosses could be upgraded, not just for us, but throughout the Army, and 21 of us got upgraded. I\u2019ve always felt that if I am deserving of the Medal of Honor, there are many, many others who are. I felt a little bad receiving it, so I received it on behalf of the fellows, because there\u2019s no such thing as a single-handed war. There\u2019s always a support group, and if you didn\u2019t have people who supported you, you couldn\u2019t fight a war.\n\nIn 2009, you were appointed as the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. One question that is on a lot of American\u2019s minds right now is how do we dig our way out of our debt?\n\nDaniel Inouye: That\u2019s a good question. The bill that we have provided, which has always been passed by the Senate, as it\u2019s part of the Administration\u2019s request, but it was always balanced. So much money income, so much we spend. But it\u2019s a heavy load, because I\u2019m also chairman of the subcommittee on defense appropriations and we\u2019re engaged in two wars now, plus a few other small ones around the world, and it takes a lot of money. The other thing is\u2026\n\nMost people may not think about it, but the aftermath of war is very costly. Costly not just in lives, but the treatment. Because of the efficiency of our transportation system, the efficiency of our medical technicians, people are surviving. If you go to Walter Reed right now, you\u2019ll see dozens of double amputees, and you\u2019ll see triple amputees and quadruple amputees, which was almost impossible in World War II. They did not survive. We had one of the highest casualties in Europe, my regiment. We were also the most decorated in the history of the United States. But no double amputee survived, and I know we had several. No brain injuries survived. So what happens? Imagine yourself as a wife, and you have to look at a brain-injured husband for the rest of your life, and he can\u2019t talk to you. But we\u2019re paying for this. That\u2019s the easy part, money payment. But how do you pay for the misery? So if we can, we should be able to avoid war.\n\nSenator, what does the American Dream mean to you? How do you define the American Dream?\n\nDaniel Inouye: It\u2019s a dream where you live a life that\u2019s powerful, one in which you can get married if you want to, raise kids if you want to, get educated to the limit of your capacity, and do what makes you happy, because we all are looking for the good life. We don\u2019t want to go through life with just fighting, fighting, fighting. I\u2019ve gone through life. I got into Congress when we had just started Vietnam. Before that, I had friends going to Korea. My brothers went to Korea. And these were war after war after war. Today, we have a powerful military that serves as a deterrent, but the enemy we have today is not like World War II, where you sign a piece of paper and the war is over. Today they\u2019re not in uniform. In my time we knew what the enemy looked like, we knew his weapons systems and such. Today, your cab driver may be the person, you have no idea. I don\u2019t know how we got into this fix, but we\u2019re there.\n\nThank you so much for talking with us today, Senator.

April, 1936. Photographer unknown. Courtesy: John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. Kennedy Family Collection. John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. KFC586N\n\nEarly Life and Family Influences\n\nOn February 22, 1932, Joseph and Rose Kennedy welcomed their ninth child into the world at St. Margaret\u2019s Hospital in Dorchester, MA. They named their son Edward Moore Kennedy after Mr. Kennedy\u2019s secretary and close family friend, Edward Moore. As the youngest of his siblings, \"Teddy\" was the adorable baby brother who everyone showered with attention. He was energetic, friendly, outgoing, and loved to make others laugh. Teddy revered his older brothers Joe Jr., Jack, and Bobby, and aspired to be like them and follow in their footsteps. Ted placed enormous pressure on himself to live up to the standards set by them and public sentiment alike.\n\n\n\nTed\u2019s childhood was shaped by a demanding family with high expectations. Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy had their own strong ambitions and encouraged their children to be like-minded. His parents also possessed a very keen sense of public image making and as their wealth, fame, and family grew, an outward appearance of perfection for themselves and their children became paramount.\n\n\n\nFrom strict regulation of the children's diets, to orthodontics, to placement in private schools, and an emphasis on athleticism, the Kennedy children were expected to be models of perfection. Mrs. Kennedy later said \u201cI was happy, optimistic, and proud. I had made up my mind to raise my children as perfectly as possible. What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?\u201d\n\n\n\nMrs. Kennedy took every opportunity to educate her children. Ted later remarked, \"Mother was...Our Pied Piper into the world of ideas. She led us on educational outings to the museums and to concerts, to Concord and Bunker Hill and the Old North Church, rattling out and providing math challenges to us along the way...She was moderator of our topical dinner table conversations, the topics - geography one night, the front page headlines the next\u2026 announced in advance on cards that she wrote out and pinned to a billboard near the dining room.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Kennedy also played a large role in preparing his children for a successful future. He expected them to be tough and independent, often reminding them that Kennedys never cry and that second place was not good enough. He led debates around the dinner table and encouraged competition. Ted later reflected, \"We grew up in an atmosphere of high-spirited competitiveness.\" Despite the family's wealth, the children were taught to be modest and develop a sense of responsibility for those less fortunate than themselves.\n\n\n\nMost crucially, Mr. Kennedy taught his children that family meant everything and to look out for one another. He also made certain that his children were being raised with access to a rich array of life experiences. When Ted was just six years old, his father moved the entire family to London after he was appointed to serve as ambassador to Great Britain by President Franklin Roosevelt. The family regarded their time in England with a special fondness. With the British press eager to feature them in publications, their image was further galvanized at home and abroad."}, {"url": "https://time.com/6226087/edward-kennedy-biography/", "page_content": "The town of Pawling, in the foothills of the Berkshires, is some 70 miles north of New York. For more than a century, it has been a haven for the wealthy and the famous fleeing Gotham\u2019s grime and clamor. Jean Kennedy Smith and her husband Stephen owned a pastoral estate there. In the years after her brothers John and Robert were murdered, the Smiths would invite itinerant Kennedys and good friends like the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and his wife Alexandra, to join them. They would hike, gossip, and enjoy fine food and drink. The memories they shared were bittersweet, and yet the time was pleasant.\n\nIn November 1972, on the weekend after Thanksgiving, the Smiths and the Schlesingers were joined by Jean\u2019s brother Ted, the senator from Massachusetts. They played tennis and talked politics. A few weeks earlier, President Richard Nixon had scored a landslide victory over George McGovern. Kennedy proposed that \u201crace was the hidden issue of the campaign and felt rather pessimistic about the possibility of stopping the drift of low-income whites, who feel threatened by racial change, into the Republican Party,\u201d Schlesinger wrote. \u201cTed was especially scornful of Nixon as the first President since Hoover who did not move the racial justice issue forward.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of McGovern\u2019s defeat, Kennedy was a favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976. That Sunday morning, Kennedy pulled Schlesinger aside. He had been giving much thought to issues like trade, and the effects of a globalized economy on American workers, Kennedy said. What travel, what speeches, what moves within the party did Schlesinger recommend?\n\n\u201cIt was evident that he had already thought about it very carefully and intelligently,\u201d the scholar wrote in his journal. The senator seemed \u201ca much-changed person from the Ted Kennedy of a decade ago. He\u2026 is entirely capable of noise and boisterousness; but he is fundamentally much more serious, and\u2026consistently comes back to issues\u2026trade, Ireland, his health program\u2026\u201d\n\nSchlesinger had a publisher\u2019s deadline to meet and departed for Manhattan. Alexandra stayed behind. Just before lunch, she and the Smiths were joined by \u201ca gorgeous Hungarian girl,\u201d Alexandra reported to her husband. \u201cThis turned out to be a girl Teddy had picked up on the train from New York to Pawling.\u201d The romance, Alexandra said, \u201cwas moving fast.\u201d\n\nTed Kennedy was 40, married, and the father of three young children. His presidential hopes for 1972 had been snuffed by the scandal over the death of Mary Jo Kopechne, who drowned in his car in a late-night accident on Chappaquiddick Island in 1969. His foes then, and ever after, would wield his reputation as a rake to wound him. But here he was, enticing a young woman on a train.\n\n\u201cHow is one to put together the senator, so serious about issues, so absorbed by political strategy, with the playboy, picking unknown Hungarian girls up in trains?\u201d Schlesinger asked his diary. \u201cIf fornication were the purpose, he could undoubted find plenty of girls he knows already. Why run the extra risk? Do tensions build up inside him that require this particular outlet? Or is it an inherent lack of self-discipline? Or perhaps he is unconsciously seeking another disaster that might rule him forever out of the Presidency?\u201d\n\nIt was a perplexing thing\u2014to identify the causes of the \u201cflaw in someone who has become otherwise a most able and impressive man\u201d\u2014 the historian wrote.\n\nSen. Edward Kennedy and his brothers, John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy , are shown at Hyannisport, Massachusetts. Being the complete politician is something the Senator learned from his father and brothers. Bettmann Archive\n\nTed Kennedy was the youngest of three brothers who had instrumental roles in the landmark movements for social justice which transfused American politics in the 20th century. At his death in 2009, at the age of 77, he was hailed by Republicans and Democrats, the media, and the President of the United States as the \u201cLion of the Senate.\u201d In the history of the American republic, only four men have served longer than his 46 years in the U.S. Senate. Given the collaborative nature of American government, it would mean little to cite the thousand bills and amendments that bore Kennedy\u2019s name. He could not have done it alone. But it is valid to list the causes to which he made a significant contribution. His life serves as a lens through which to look at liberalism.\n\nDo poor folk, seniors, children and working families have ready access to affordable health care and prescription drugs? Have the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals been reduced from their menacing Cold War status? Do public schools face higher standards, and receive federal aid? Do young people, blacks and other minorities have access to vote? Have the inequities of the Vietnam-era draft been replaced by a fairer, volunteer army? Do the National Institutes of Health stand guard against diseases like AIDS, or Covid-19? Did the minimum wage keep pace with time? Do women get their fair share of athletic and academic scholarships, and are they otherwise treated as equal to men? Can immigrants of all races bring their families to the U.S.? Are hotels, airports, trains, stores, jobs, schools, and restaurants open to the disabled, to gays, and to darker-skinned Americans?\n\n\u201cIt is your misfortune that you are part of such a prodigious family,\u201d the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote to Kennedy in 1989. \u201cAlone no one would imagine you had an equal.\u201d\n\nAlong with civil rights, the crusade for universally accessible health care was \u201cthe cause of his life,\u201d said Kennedy. He spent 28 of his 46 years in Congress serving in conservative, Republican presidencies\u2014playing defense against their sustained attack on liberal principles. He managed, like a courier bearing a vital message through a World War I battlefield, to keep that cause intact and take part in its attainment. When Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 his thoughts were of his mother, who died young of cancer, and of Ted Kennedy, who had succumbed to brain cancer the previous summer, after helping to craft the final bill. \u201cHe was given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow,\u201d Obama said, at Kennedy\u2019s funeral. He was \u201cthe greatest legislator of our time.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s engaging personality and political gifts\u2014his jocular temperament; fame and family, one-on-one negotiating skills\u2014were assets in the chamber, as were his way with a song, and his gift for camaraderie. He could storm on the Senate floor\u2014as when he single-handedly launched the successful opposition to the nomination of Robert Bork, a conservative idealogue, to the Supreme Court in 1987.\n\nYet in a way unimaginable in today\u2019s polarized era, Kennedy as gifted at identifying and recruiting Republican colleagues who were receptive to bipartisan collaboration on health care, civil rights, and other issues. Here is a partial list of the Republican leaders who joined with Kennedy on landmark measures that improved American lives: Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, Bush, McCain, Dole, Hatch, Romney, Dirksen, Simpson, Javits, Kassebaum, Quayle, Gramm, Graham, Baker, Scott, Lott, Rudman, Weicker, Hatfield, Danforth, Jeffords, Lugar, Brownback and Brooke. In our current divide it is enlightening\u2014indeed, somewhat stunning\u2014to study his legislative success.\n\nNow, when the once-mighty Senate has mortgaged its independence to presidencies, popular idiocies and party donors, Kennedy\u2019s methods are especially worth examination. He leveraged his wealth and fame wisely, spending that family coin like a philanthropic heir, on social justice and expanded health care and other benefits for those who had not been blessed, as he had, with good looks, education, and a family fortune. He began by recruiting top notch talent to his staff. These aides acted as scouts, gathering reports of promising political stirrings on Capitol Hill. With an issue in hand, Kennedy would tap the expertise of noted scholars, scientists, doctors, and business folk\u2014 often by inviting the flattered experts to tutoring sessions or \u201cissues dinners\u201d at his home. Kennedy would then prepare, rehearse and study, until he knew the goal, and the ways to get there, as well as any colleague.\n\nThus armed, Kennedy was ready to drive a bargain. He knew the important senators, of both political parties, and the partisan environment in their states. He knew what personal and political factors could influence them. Was Senator X in trouble with organized labor, or another interest group back home? Did Senator Y have a brother with a learning disability or a personality disorder, that would make the senator more amenable to mental health reform? How about Senator Z, who was facing a tough re-election\u2014wouldn\u2019t his name on a bill with Ted Kennedy, and a bill-signing ceremony at the White House, swing votes? He knew how to exploit the lure of legacy. Senators are men and women of vanity, conceit and ego. Collaboration with a Kennedy earned them a celebrated place in history.\n\nKennedy\u2019s story is no dull slog through the arcana of legislating, however. It is rich with drama and contention. He was born into great wealth and prominence. Yet his father was absent, his mother cold. He was shipped from boarding school to school. And then much of his adult life was marred by grief and horror.\n\nConsider the blows that fortune dealt him; it is a long list, and almost any one of its entries would serve as a defining\u2014and potentially incapacitating\u2014moment in an individual\u2019s life.\n\nIn 1964 Kennedy was rescued near death, with a broken back, from the remnants of an airplane that crashed in an orchard on a foggy night. The pilot and the passenger sitting next to the senator\u2014one of Kennedy\u2019s aides\u2014were killed. Kennedy could not walk for six months and lived in pain for the rest of his years. Such an ordeal, for almost anyone, would be the riveting moment of their lives. For Kennedy, it was almost parenthetical.\n\nAirplane disasters would claim the lives of three members of his family\u2014a brother, a sister and his nephew, John Kennedy Jr. Another sister was enfeebled, mentally, by a surgeon\u2019s error. Ted\u2019s first wife, Joan Bennett Kennedy, suffered from alcoholism. All three of their children\u2014sons Patrick and Ted Jr., and daughter Kara\u2014were stricken by cancer. Pause and imagine: having three children, and all of them contract cancer before they reach middle-age. Kennedy had his own struggle with alcohol, and all three of his children would be treated for substance abuse.\n\nAll memorable, commanding events\u2014and all relegated to footnotes by the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, shot by crazy men, five years apart.\n\n\u201cWhere else but in gothic fiction, where else among real people, could one encounter such triumphs and tragedies, such beauty and charm and ambition and pride and human wreckage, such dedication to the best and lapses into the mire of life; such vulgar, noble, driven, generous, self-centered, loving, suspicious, devious, honorable, vulnerable, indomitable people?\u201d the writer and diplomat, Clare Boothe Luce, asked about the Kennedys.\n\nThe flawed youngest brother was a sensualist, with a merry disposition, whose privileged upbringing led him to take risks in search of thrills and pleasure\u2014believing that his status and wealth would allow him to wriggle free from consequences. In 1969, after a day of sailing and too much drink, he drove off a crude wooden bridge on Chappaquiddick. His car came to rest, upside down, in nine feet of water. His companion that night, a young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. He did not notify the authorities until ten hours had passed, the life was gone from the young woman, and traces of liquor had faded from his bloodstream. He was convicted of leaving the scene of a harmful accident and sentenced to two months in jail. The sentence, as was customary, was suspended. He made a televised appeal to the voters of Massachusetts and was reelected six times thereafter.\n\nTwo sailing companions of Senator Edward M.

(Photo by Bettmann Archive/Getty Images) Bettmann Archive\n\nThe guilt he bore, mingling with his other griefs, turned Kennedy toward a life of frenetic activity, some of which led to the bottom of a glass, comely companions and a tabloid roasting, and some to his restless, ceaseless pursuit of legislative accomplishment. His constituency, seeing this, cut him slack\u2014in ways unimaginable in the #MeToo era. On the day in 1993 that Kennedy became the longest-serving senator in Massachusetts history, Martin Nolan of the hometown Boston Globe turned to Shakespeare, likening Kennedy to Sir John Falstaff, and quoting the fat knight\u2019s plea to Henry V.\n\n\u201cIf to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned,\u201d said Falstaff. \u201cNo, my good lord\u2026for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more valiant, being, as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish him not\u2026.Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.\u201d\n\nAs his biographer, I came to my own literary analogy. I found him, in his quest for redemption, much like Joseph Conrad\u2019s flawed protagonist, Lord Jim\u2014a young naval officer who, in a moment of panic, flees a ship jammed with terrified passengers caught in a maelstrom, and so is consigned to a life of atonement. \u201cWhen yet very young, he became chief mate of a fine ship,\u201d Conrad wrote, \u201cwithout ever having been tested by those events that show in the light of day the inner worth of a man\u2026not only to others but also to himself\u2026`I shall be faithful,\u2019 he said\u2026letting his eyes wander upon the waters, whose blueness had changed to a gloomy purple under the fires of sunset.\u201d\n\nAs part of my research, I searched Schlesinger\u2019s unpublished diaries, discovering that the historian had recorded Kennedy\u2019s private accounts of the accident on Chappaquiddick. In public, Kennedy attributed the ten-hour delay between the accident, and his reporting it to the police, as the product of a shocked and confused state of mind. But after talking to her brother in the days after the accident, \u201cJean thinks that he panicked\u2014that he hoped\u2026he could find some way to cover it up,\u201d Schlesinger told his diary.\n\n\u201cIt was not, she says, that he was worried about the Presidency:`He didn\u2019t want to be President. He was sure that he would be killed if he became President.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was rather that he could not bear the thought of letting down the family, of destroying all that Jack and Bobby had done,\u201d Schlesinger wrote. \u201cWhat happened to John and Robert Kennedy was beyond their control, while Edward Kennedy\u2019s wounds are self-inflicted\u2026He is accusing and punishing himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe diving was very difficult: the water was black, the current swift and filled with blinding sand. None of them could see the body,\u201d Schlesinger wrote. \u201cEveryone agrees that Ted was not drunk in any serious sense. But he did have three drinks, and it might be argued that this amount of liquor, small as it was, constituted the margin that propelled the car off the bridge.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s behavior had historic consequences. He ducked confrontations with Nixon over Watergate, and Supreme Court appointments. Doomed by the \u201ccharacter\u201d issue, his 1979-80 primary challenge to a Democratic president paved the way for Reaganism. And, like no time since the accident on Chappaquiddick, Kennedy\u2019s political standing was shaken by events in Palm Beach in 1991, when his nephew\u2014who Kennedy had roused from bed for some late-night carousing\u2014was accused of rape. The scandal\u2014and the intense examination of Kennedy\u2019s personal behavior that followed\u2014muzzled the liberal lion at the historic instant when Clarence Thomas, a Supreme Court nominee, faced accusations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill, a former aide.\n\nAs a political reporter for the Boston Globe, I covered Kennedy through the Palm Beach scandal, the Thomas-Hill hearings, the 1994 re-election campaign and the senator\u2019s curative marriage to his second wife, Vicki. At one point, I proposed that Kennedy resembled a great white shark, ever moving, propelled by the realization that to pause, to reflect, would be to drown in sorrow. A few days later, in the mail, came his sketch of a great white, signed: \u201cTed the Shark.\u201d\n\nSenator Ted Kennedy at the White House for an event promoting peace in Ireland on September 11, 1998. David Hume Kennerly-Getty Images\n\nOur frenzied celebrity culture and the undying commercial value of the Kennedy saga has combined, over the years, to be enormously distortive. \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older I have begun to marvel\u2026at how much of my life I have spent among ghosts,\u201d wrote Ted Kennedy\u2019s niece, Amanda Smith, in a thoughtful introduction to a volume of her grandfather Joseph\u2019s correspondence. \u201cThey are such restless spirts as only the strange 20th century cocktail of celebrity, technology and collective memory could produce\u2026revivified for eternity in documentaries, news footage, miniseries and their reruns.\u201d It pushed Ted and his family into the realm of Elvis, Marilyn and the Beatles, said Smith, \u201cin the Oz of superstardom.\u201d Her family, Smith reckoned, has generated more words than anyone or any one event\u2014with the possible exceptions of Jesus Christ, or the American civil war.\n\nTed Kennedy was unique among his brothers in that he was granted the gift of years. This exposed him, however, to the deconstruction of the New Frontier, and the colossal proliferation of late 20th century celebrity scandal mongering. The two older brothers were frozen by death. Not so with Ted. The world got to see him comb gray hair. The question asked by Schlesinger in his journal\u2014How to correlate the lion with his flaws?\u2014remains unanswered. The dialectic has failed to produce a reliable consensus.\n\nThis much is certain, I concluded. He never got to choose his life. He was the last-born, the jokester, promoted by violent fate to pick up a fallen standard. His forays were marked by self-destruction. He did worst when the odds looked good, shined brightest when the cause seemed lost.\n\n\u201cOn you, the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared,\u201d Onassis once write to her brother-in-law. In private, she suspected that he had an urge \u201cto self-destruct,\u201d she once said, \u201cfrom the fact that he knows he will never live up to what people expect of him.\u201d\n\nWhen Kennedy campaigned for the presidency in 1980, \u201che was running because it was expected of him,\u201d said his friend, college roommate and Senate colleague, John Tunney. Kennedy had just \u201chalf his heart and half his mind in the campaign.\u201d Kennedy won just 38 percent of the vote in the Democratic primaries.\n\nHe never saw the Oval Office. His legacy will always be tainted by his failures. And yet, above all, his is a towering, parabolic story of resilience. Through a life of grief and guilt and physical suffering, Kennedy spurned despair. He persevered. His goals, as even his ideological foes came to recognize, were generous and compassionate\u2014\u201cto make gentler the human condition\u201d\u2014he liked to say, echoing the ancient Greeks. It was no small goal; no small life.\n\nAdapted from Farrell\u2019s Ted Kennedy: A Life, published by Penguin Press\n\nContact us at letters@time.com."}, {"url": "https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/edward-m-kennedy", "page_content": "Edward M. Kennedy was the third longest-serving member of the United States Senate in American history. Voters of Massachusetts elected him to the Senate nine times\u2014a record matched by only one other senator. The scholar Thomas Mann said his time in the Senate was \u201can amazing and endurable presence. You want to go back to the 19th century to find parallels, but you won\u2018t find parallels.\u201d President Obama has described his breathtaking span of accomplishment: \u201cFor five decades, virtually every major piece of legislation to advance the civil rights, health, and economic well being of the American people bore his name and resulted from his efforts.\u201d He fought for and won so many great battles\u2014on voting rights, education, immigration reform, the minimum wage, national service, the nation\u2018s first major legislation to combat AIDS, and equality for minorities, women, the disabled and gay Americans. He called health care \u201cthe cause of my life,\u201d and succeeded in bringing quality and affordable health care for countless Americans, including children, seniors and Americans with disabilities.\n\nUntil the end, he was working tirelessly to achieve historic national health reform. He was an opponent of the Vietnam War and an early champion of the war's refugees. He was a powerful yet lonely voice from the beginning against the invasion of Iraq. He stood for human rights abroad\u2014from Chile to the former Soviet Union \u2014 and was a leader in the cause of poverty relief for the poorest nations of Africa and the world. He believed in a strong national defense and he also unceasingly pursued and advanced the work of nuclear arms control.\n\nHe was the conscience of his party, and also the Senate\u2018s greatest master of forging compromise with the other party. Known as the \u201cLion of the Senate,\u201d Senator Kennedy was widely respected on both sides of the aisle for his commitment to progress and his ability to legislate.\n\nSenator Kennedy was Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Previously he was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and served on that committee for many years. He also served on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. He was a leader of the Congressional Friends of Ireland and helped lead the way toward peace on that island.\n\nHe was a graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia Law School. He lived in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, with his wife Vicki. At the time of his passing, he was survived by her and their five children Kara, Edward Jr., and Patrick Kennedy, and Curran and Caroline Raclin, and his sister Jean Kennedy Smith.\n\nHometown: Hyannis Port\n\nBorn: February 22, 1932; Boston, Mass.\n\nDied: August 25, 2009\n\n\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nFamily: Wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy; three children, two stepchildren\n\nEducation: Harvard University, B.A. 1956 (government); International Law School, The Hague (The Netherlands), attended 1958; U. of Virginia, LL.B. 1959\n\nMilitary Service: Army, 1951-53\n\nCareer: Lawyer\n\nElected: 1962 (7th full term)\n\nPolitical Highlights: Suffolk County assistant district attorney, 1961-62; sought Democratic nomination for president, 1980\n\nChronology:\n\n\n\n1962\n\nEdward M. Kennedy is elected to the United States Senate.\n\n1964\n\nSenator Kennedy made his maiden speech on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964. The senator also strongly supported the Economic Opportunity Act, which was signed on August 20, 1964. The EOA mandated that programs would be \"developed, conducted and administered with the maximum feasible participation and the residents of the areas and members of the groups served.\" It also established community action programs, including ABCD, to mobilize resources that could be used in a direct attack on the roots of poverty.\n\n1966\n\nSenator Kennedy, through an amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act, helped create a national health center system. In 1966, the nation's first comprehensive neighborhood health center was established by Tufts University in cooperation with ABCD at the Columbia Point Housing Project in Dorchester.\n\n1968\n\nAs a result of Senator Kennedy's championing of bilingual education, the Bilingual Education Act was passed by Congress in 1968-- the first time Congress had endorsed funding for bilingual education. The Bilingual Program, a federally funded program through Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was updated with the Improving American's Schools Act of 1994.\n\n1970\n\nSenator Kennedy continued his commitment to senior citizens by supporting Older American Community Service Employment. He also supported the Voting Rights Act Extension, in order to protect the Civil Rights gains made in the 60's. In response to the skyrocketing costs of home heating, which particularly affected low-income families and elders, the Senator actively worked on creating a fuel assistance program.\n\n1971\n\nSenator Kennedy became Chairman of the Senate Health Subcommittee, enhancing his ability to champion the cause of quality health care for all Americans.\n\n1972\n\nSenator Kennedy has a special commitment to the Meals on Wheels program for senior citizens, which he helped strengthen in 1972. This program offers nutritional meals to homebound seniors. Another priority for Senator Kennedy was the Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program. This program, popularly known as WIC, offers food, nutrition counseling, and access to health services for low-income women, infants, and children under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.\n\n1973\n\nSenator Kennedy worked to continue and improve legal services and emergency health services for the poor and improved educational opportunities for the handicapped.\n\n1975\n\nAs part of his work on a wide range of domestic programs affecting the poor, Senator Kennedy championed the national Family Planning Initiatives.\n\n1979\n\nSenator Kennedy became Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and was influential in providing access for women and minorities in judicial nominations.\n\n1981\n\nSenator Kennedy garnered Congressional support for Low-Income Energy Assistance Programs (Fuel Assistance) ensuring that low-income and working poor families do not have to choose between eating and heating their homes.\n\n1982\n\nIn the wake of budget restraints under President Reagan, Senator Kennedy sponsored the Job Training Partnership Act with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, which proposed to educate and train the nation's front-line workforce, It strengthened program requirements, provided better targeting of services to reach those most in need, and provided higher quality services. Senator Kennedy also successfully resisted efforts to eliminate the Summer Jobs Program.\n\n1983\n\nOn becoming a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he opposed the untested Star Wars Program and strongly supported Nuclear Arms Control.\n\n1987\n\nSenator Kennedy supported a Minimum Wage Increase and the Welfare-to-Jobs Incentives, increasing the job-readiness skills and disposable income for low-income and working poor individuals.\n\n1992\n\nAs a strong proponent of Early Childhood Education, Senator Kennedy assisted in the Expansion of the Head Start Program which increased the number of low-income children served by 25%. Senator Kennedy also championed the Head Start Improvement Act which maintained quality, extended services and authorized the purchase of buildings to enhance program stability. His work on the Summer Jobs for Youth Program resulted in a $500 million supplemental appropriation that was allocated for fiscal year 1992 and provided an additional 300,000 youth with summer employment.\n\n1994\n\nAs Chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy worked closely with President Clinton to expand opportunities for working families. His leadership brought about the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which provided seed money for local school-to-work programs designed and run by local business, education, community and labor leaders. He also sponsored the Human Services Reauthorization Act which guaranteed the extension of ABCD and all Community Action core funding. It also put Head Start on a path to reach all eligible children by expanding the program to cover pregnant women and children under 3. This Act also reauthorized the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families pay their heating bills.\n\n1997\n\nSenator Kennedy, in his senior role in the Senate and as an acknowledged national spokesperson for the disadvantaged, continued to work on a vast array of domestic programs in the wake of an increasingly conservative Congress. He demonstrated his ongoing commitment at the dedication of the $8 million ABCD-controlled, HUD-funded conversion of the abandoned Michelangelo School in Boston's North End to 71 units of affordable elderly housing.\n\n1999\n\nAfter the passage of the 1996 Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act (welfare \"reform\"), Senator Kennedy acted to assist those most difficult to employ with Welfare-to-Work Initiatives. These initiatives provide individuals with access to job training, adult education, job placement, child care, transportation assistance and case management, and therefore really give families the opportunity to leave welfare and start life anew. ABCD, in partnership with Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries, initiated a successful welfare-to-work program which was strongly supported by Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy championed the cause of the ABCD Urban College of Boston with the US Department of Education.\n\n2000\n\nSenator Kennedy was the lead sponsor of the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act, which addressed the complex factors that have led to pervasive health disparities between minorities and other Americans in the United States. The approach included a commitment to research on minority health, and improved data systems to track the extent and severity of minority health problems. The law also included an authorization for significant resources to help enhance the delivery of health care to minorities. In addition, the Senators Kennedy and Frist sponsored legislation to improve the nation\u2019s ability to respond to outbreaks of infectious disease. The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act included initiatives to control the spread of germs resistant to antibiotics, and to protect the country against bioterrorism. Also that year, Kennedy authored the Pediatric Graduate Medical Education program (GME), which provided essential support for training programs at children\u2019s hospitals across the country.\n\n2001\n\nSenator Kennedy, as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, worked with Democrats and Republicans to pass the landmark No Child Left Behind Act. The law contained substantial reforms to help close the achievement gap in public schools and improve the quality of education for all of the nation\u2019s students. In addition, following the attacks of September 11th, 2001, Senator Kennedy called together various disaster relief and mental health organizations to plan a coordinated response to the mental health needs of families of victims of the tragedy. His leadership provided immediate avenues for collaboration between disaster response agencies and ensured a timely and comprehensive response.\n\n2002\n\nFollowing September 11th and the anthrax attacks in October of that year, Senator Kennedy introduced the bipartisan Bioterrorism Preparedness Act to help the country prevent, prepare for, and respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The law helped upgrade federal capacities to respond to bioterrorism, improved the response at the state and local level, and paved the way for new treatments and diagnostics. Senator Kennedy also sponsored the bipartisan Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, which expanded the country\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to help identify individuals who have violated visas, or have links to terrorist organizations. The law safeguarded the entry of more than 31 million persons who enter the US legally each year as visitors, students, and temporary workers, striking an appropriate balance between isolating criminals and upholding America\u2019s immigrant traditions.\n\n2003\n\nAs a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Kennedy sponsored an amendment to provide funding for the procurement of additional armored Humvees for use in the war in Iraq. Senator Kennedy acted in response to reports that one quarter of all American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan occurred in unarmored Humvees, and that thousands more soldiers have been injured or disabled for life. The additional funding was used to purchase Up-Armored Humvees and armor add-on kits for the vehicles to meet the safety needs of American troops. In addition, Senator Kennedy led the effort to pass legislation that significantly enhanced law enforcement tools related to the exploitation and abduction of children. The PROTECT Act provided funding for AMBER Alert notification systems along U.S. highways, and awarded grants to states for the implementation of improved communication technologies.\n\n2004\n\nSenator Kennedy was a leading cosponsor of legislation to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The legislation included bipartisan improvements to the program that provides special education services to six and a half million students in the U.S. The reauthorization provided for at least 30,000 additional special education teachers, improved education training, and expanded technologies available to disabled children. Senator Kennedy also sponsored and helped pass the Project Bioshield Act, which created a federal funding stream to guide America\u2019s medical and biotechnology researchers in creating stronger defenses to biological threats. The National Institutes for Health, as well as universities and research institutions in Massachusetts and around the country, will benefit from the initiative, and lead the way in developing new bio-defense countermeasures such as vaccines, immunizations, and other treatments.\n\n2005\n\nDuring consideration of the Iraq supplemental spending bill, Senator Kennedy introduced an amendment to ensure armored Humvee production remained at maximum levels. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Kennedy was successful in his efforts to pass Humvee-production legislation in 2003. However, mismanagement at the Pentagon had left production far short of what was needed to provide adequate security for US troops. Senator Kennedy\u2019s amendment boosted funding to put production back on track. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst natural disasters in the country's history, Senator Kennedy joined his Senate colleagues in passing emergency funding to assist in the recovery efforts. In addition, the Senator met face-to-face with relief organizations working to provide support to victims, and discussed with them the best ways to implement relief and support services for those affected by the tragedy. Senator Kennedy also sponsored and helped pass emergency education funding for schools impacted by Katrina, and introduced the bipartisan Gulf Coast Recovery and Preparedness Act.\n\n2006\n\nSenator Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the Family Opportunity Act, which provided states the opportunity to expand Medicaid coverage to children with special needs, allowing low- and middle-income families with disabled children the ability to purchase coverage under the Medicaid program. For many disabled children, Medicaid is the only health insurance program offering sufficient benefits to cover the required care, such as physical therapy and medical equipment. The Family Opportunity Act allows parents of disabled children to go to work and earn above poverty wages without losing coverage for their children.\n\n2007\n\nSenator Kennedy led the successful effort to pass the first increase in the federal minimum wage in more than 10 years. His bill raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour and helped more than 13 million Americans, including the parents of more than 6 million children. Senator Kennedy renewed the Ryan White Care Act with greater focus on prevention, chronic care, quality of life, and new and emerging therapies. Congress also passed legislation proposed by Senator Kennedy to strengthen FDA's regulatory authority over drugs after they are approved. The bill was termed by experts to be the most significant strengthening of drug safety in a century.\n\nSenator Kennedy's College Cost Reduction and Access Act authorized the largest increase in student aid since the GI bill in 1944 and established a loan forgiveness program to allow more college graduates to go into public service. The Senator held the first Congressional hearing on Iraqi refugees, and was the lead sponsor on legislation granting special immigrant visas to Iraqis who worked with US forces. Following an immigration raid on a factory in Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy worked with the Department of Homeland Security to develop guidelines on humanitarian screening for workers arrested in such raids.\n\n2008\n\nSenator Kennedy worked with Senator Enzi, with the help of Senator Milkulski, to pass the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which reauthorized the Higher Education Act for the first time in a decade. This legislation focused on four major areas: expanding grant aid for the neediest students; addressing the ethical scandals in the student loan marketplace; simplifying the application process for Federal financial aid; and holding colleges more accountable for their costs. After more than 10 years of effort, Senator Kennedy and Senator Domenici worked together to enact the Mental Health Parity Act, requiring insurance companies to provide benefits for mental illnesses equal to the benefits for physical illnesses and assuring equity for 113 million Americans. Senator Kennedy also led the enactment of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, prohibiting insurers and employers from discriminating against people due to their genes.\n\n2009\n\nSenator Kennedy championed the health and employment provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included incentives for the adoption of health information technology, provisions to expand access to unemployment insurance and to help those who lose their jobs to keep their health insurance, and investments to improve the quality of health. Senator Kennedy was also a leader in passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to restore workers' ability to fight pay discrimination, the first major legislation signed by President Obama. In addition, Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, led the enactment of the Serve America Act, which expands service opportunities for Americans of every age. Senator Kennedy had long been a leader in seeking to strengthen federal hate crime law. In 2009, the Senate passed the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, and is working to see that this long overdue legislation is finally enacted into law\n\nSenator Kennedy's Health Committee was also the first committee in Congress to pass comprehensive health reform legislation called for by President Obama -- the Affordable Health Choices Act that will reduce health costs, protect individuals' choice in doctors and plans, and assure quality and affordable health care for all Americans."}, {"url": "https://largest.org/people/us-senators/", "page_content": "The United States Congress, or upper chamber, works in conjunction with the United States House of Representatives, or lower chamber, to serve as the legislature of the United States.

Kennedy was the third longest-serving member of the United States Senate in American history. Voters of Massachusetts elected him to the Senate nine times\u2014a record matched by only one other senator. The scholar Thomas Mann said his time in the Senate was \u201can amazing and endurable presence. You want to go back to the 19th century to find parallels, but you won\u2018t find parallels.\u201d President Obama has described his breathtaking span of accomplishment: \u201cFor five decades, virtually every major piece of legislation to advance the civil rights, health, and economic well being of the American people bore his name and resulted from his efforts.\u201d He fought for and won so many great battles\u2014on voting rights, education, immigration reform, the minimum wage, national service, the nation\u2018s first major legislation to combat AIDS, and equality for minorities, women, the disabled and gay Americans. He called health care \u201cthe cause of my life,\u201d and succeeded in bringing quality and affordable health care for countless Americans, including children, seniors and Americans with disabilities.\n\nUntil the end, he was working tirelessly to achieve historic national health reform. He was an opponent of the Vietnam War and an early champion of the war's refugees. He was a powerful yet lonely voice from the beginning against the invasion of Iraq. He stood for human rights abroad\u2014from Chile to the former Soviet Union \u2014 and was a leader in the cause of poverty relief for the poorest nations of Africa and the world. He believed in a strong national defense and he also unceasingly pursued and advanced the work of nuclear arms control.\n\nHe was the conscience of his party, and also the Senate\u2018s greatest master of forging compromise with the other party. Known as the \u201cLion of the Senate,\u201d Senator Kennedy was widely respected on both sides of the aisle for his commitment to progress and his ability to legislate.\n\nSenator Kennedy was Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Previously he was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and served on that committee for many years. He also served on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. He was a leader of the Congressional Friends of Ireland and helped lead the way toward peace on that island.\n\nHe was a graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia Law School. He lived in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, with his wife Vicki. At the time of his passing, he was survived by her and their five children Kara, Edward Jr., and Patrick Kennedy, and Curran and Caroline Raclin, and his sister Jean Kennedy Smith.\n\nHometown: Hyannis Port\n\nBorn: February 22, 1932; Boston, Mass.\n\nDied: August 25, 2009\n\n\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nFamily: Wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy; three children, two stepchildren\n\nEducation: Harvard University, B.A. 1956 (government); International Law School, The Hague (The Netherlands), attended 1958; U. of Virginia, LL.B. 1959\n\nMilitary Service: Army, 1951-53\n\nCareer: Lawyer\n\nElected: 1962 (7th full term)\n\nPolitical Highlights: Suffolk County assistant district attorney, 1961-62; sought Democratic nomination for president, 1980\n\nChronology:\n\n\n\n1962\n\nEdward M. Kennedy is elected to the United States Senate.\n\n1964\n\nSenator Kennedy made his maiden speech on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964. The senator also strongly supported the Economic Opportunity Act, which was signed on August 20, 1964. The EOA mandated that programs would be \"developed, conducted and administered with the maximum feasible participation and the residents of the areas and members of the groups served.\" It also established community action programs, including ABCD, to mobilize resources that could be used in a direct attack on the roots of poverty.\n\n1966\n\nSenator Kennedy, through an amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act, helped create a national health center system. In 1966, the nation's first comprehensive neighborhood health center was established by Tufts University in cooperation with ABCD at the Columbia Point Housing Project in Dorchester.\n\n1968\n\nAs a result of Senator Kennedy's championing of bilingual education, the Bilingual Education Act was passed by Congress in 1968-- the first time Congress had endorsed funding for bilingual education. The Bilingual Program, a federally funded program through Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was updated with the Improving American's Schools Act of 1994.\n\n1970\n\nSenator Kennedy continued his commitment to senior citizens by supporting Older American Community Service Employment. He also supported the Voting Rights Act Extension, in order to protect the Civil Rights gains made in the 60's. In response to the skyrocketing costs of home heating, which particularly affected low-income families and elders, the Senator actively worked on creating a fuel assistance program.\n\n1971\n\nSenator Kennedy became Chairman of the Senate Health Subcommittee, enhancing his ability to champion the cause of quality health care for all Americans.\n\n1972\n\nSenator Kennedy has a special commitment to the Meals on Wheels program for senior citizens, which he helped strengthen in 1972. This program offers nutritional meals to homebound seniors. Another priority for Senator Kennedy was the Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program. This program, popularly known as WIC, offers food, nutrition counseling, and access to health services for low-income women, infants, and children under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.\n\n1973\n\nSenator Kennedy worked to continue and improve legal services and emergency health services for the poor and improved educational opportunities for the handicapped.\n\n1975\n\nAs part of his work on a wide range of domestic programs affecting the poor, Senator Kennedy championed the national Family Planning Initiatives.\n\n1979\n\nSenator Kennedy became Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and was influential in providing access for women and minorities in judicial nominations.\n\n1981\n\nSenator Kennedy garnered Congressional support for Low-Income Energy Assistance Programs (Fuel Assistance) ensuring that low-income and working poor families do not have to choose between eating and heating their homes.\n\n1982\n\nIn the wake of budget restraints under President Reagan, Senator Kennedy sponsored the Job Training Partnership Act with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, which proposed to educate and train the nation's front-line workforce, It strengthened program requirements, provided better targeting of services to reach those most in need, and provided higher quality services. Senator Kennedy also successfully resisted efforts to eliminate the Summer Jobs Program.\n\n1983\n\nOn becoming a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he opposed the untested Star Wars Program and strongly supported Nuclear Arms Control.\n\n1987\n\nSenator Kennedy supported a Minimum Wage Increase and the Welfare-to-Jobs Incentives, increasing the job-readiness skills and disposable income for low-income and working poor individuals.\n\n1992\n\nAs a strong proponent of Early Childhood Education, Senator Kennedy assisted in the Expansion of the Head Start Program which increased the number of low-income children served by 25%. Senator Kennedy also championed the Head Start Improvement Act which maintained quality, extended services and authorized the purchase of buildings to enhance program stability. His work on the Summer Jobs for Youth Program resulted in a $500 million supplemental appropriation that was allocated for fiscal year 1992 and provided an additional 300,000 youth with summer employment.\n\n1994\n\nAs Chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy worked closely with President Clinton to expand opportunities for working families. His leadership brought about the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which provided seed money for local school-to-work programs designed and run by local business, education, community and labor leaders. He also sponsored the Human Services Reauthorization Act which guaranteed the extension of ABCD and all Community Action core funding. It also put Head Start on a path to reach all eligible children by expanding the program to cover pregnant women and children under 3. This Act also reauthorized the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families pay their heating bills.\n\n1997\n\nSenator Kennedy, in his senior role in the Senate and as an acknowledged national spokesperson for the disadvantaged, continued to work on a vast array of domestic programs in the wake of an increasingly conservative Congress. He demonstrated his ongoing commitment at the dedication of the $8 million ABCD-controlled, HUD-funded conversion of the abandoned Michelangelo School in Boston's North End to 71 units of affordable elderly housing.\n\n1999\n\nAfter the passage of the 1996 Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act (welfare \"reform\"), Senator Kennedy acted to assist those most difficult to employ with Welfare-to-Work Initiatives. These initiatives provide individuals with access to job training, adult education, job placement, child care, transportation assistance and case management, and therefore really give families the opportunity to leave welfare and start life anew. ABCD, in partnership with Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries, initiated a successful welfare-to-work program which was strongly supported by Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy championed the cause of the ABCD Urban College of Boston with the US Department of Education.\n\n2000\n\nSenator Kennedy was the lead sponsor of the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act, which addressed the complex factors that have led to pervasive health disparities between minorities and other Americans in the United States. The approach included a commitment to research on minority health, and improved data systems to track the extent and severity of minority health problems. The law also included an authorization for significant resources to help enhance the delivery of health care to minorities. In addition, the Senators Kennedy and Frist sponsored legislation to improve the nation\u2019s ability to respond to outbreaks of infectious disease. The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act included initiatives to control the spread of germs resistant to antibiotics, and to protect the country against bioterrorism. Also that year, Kennedy authored the Pediatric Graduate Medical Education program (GME), which provided essential support for training programs at children\u2019s hospitals across the country.\n\n2001\n\nSenator Kennedy, as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, worked with Democrats and Republicans to pass the landmark No Child Left Behind Act. The law contained substantial reforms to help close the achievement gap in public schools and improve the quality of education for all of the nation\u2019s students. In addition, following the attacks of September 11th, 2001, Senator Kennedy called together various disaster relief and mental health organizations to plan a coordinated response to the mental health needs of families of victims of the tragedy. His leadership provided immediate avenues for collaboration between disaster response agencies and ensured a timely and comprehensive response.\n\n2002\n\nFollowing September 11th and the anthrax attacks in October of that year, Senator Kennedy introduced the bipartisan Bioterrorism Preparedness Act to help the country prevent, prepare for, and respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The law helped upgrade federal capacities to respond to bioterrorism, improved the response at the state and local level, and paved the way for new treatments and diagnostics. Senator Kennedy also sponsored the bipartisan Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, which expanded the country\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to help identify individuals who have violated visas, or have links to terrorist organizations. The law safeguarded the entry of more than 31 million persons who enter the US legally each year as visitors, students, and temporary workers, striking an appropriate balance between isolating criminals and upholding America\u2019s immigrant traditions.\n\n2003\n\nAs a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Kennedy sponsored an amendment to provide funding for the procurement of additional armored Humvees for use in the war in Iraq. Senator Kennedy acted in response to reports that one quarter of all American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan occurred in unarmored Humvees, and that thousands more soldiers have been injured or disabled for life. The additional funding was used to purchase Up-Armored Humvees and armor add-on kits for the vehicles to meet the safety needs of American troops. In addition, Senator Kennedy led the effort to pass legislation that significantly enhanced law enforcement tools related to the exploitation and abduction of children. The PROTECT Act provided funding for AMBER Alert notification systems along U.S. highways, and awarded grants to states for the implementation of improved communication technologies.\n\n2004\n\nSenator Kennedy was a leading cosponsor of legislation to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The legislation included bipartisan improvements to the program that provides special education services to six and a half million students in the U.S. The reauthorization provided for at least 30,000 additional special education teachers, improved education training, and expanded technologies available to disabled children. Senator Kennedy also sponsored and helped pass the Project Bioshield Act, which created a federal funding stream to guide America\u2019s medical and biotechnology researchers in creating stronger defenses to biological threats. The National Institutes for Health, as well as universities and research institutions in Massachusetts and around the country, will benefit from the initiative, and lead the way in developing new bio-defense countermeasures such as vaccines, immunizations, and other treatments.\n\n2005\n\nDuring consideration of the Iraq supplemental spending bill, Senator Kennedy introduced an amendment to ensure armored Humvee production remained at maximum levels. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Kennedy was successful in his efforts to pass Humvee-production legislation in 2003. However, mismanagement at the Pentagon had left production far short of what was needed to provide adequate security for US troops. Senator Kennedy\u2019s amendment boosted funding to put production back on track. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst natural disasters in the country's history, Senator Kennedy joined his Senate colleagues in passing emergency funding to assist in the recovery efforts. In addition, the Senator met face-to-face with relief organizations working to provide support to victims, and discussed with them the best ways to implement relief and support services for those affected by the tragedy. Senator Kennedy also sponsored and helped pass emergency education funding for schools impacted by Katrina, and introduced the bipartisan Gulf Coast Recovery and Preparedness Act.\n\n2006\n\nSenator Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the Family Opportunity Act, which provided states the opportunity to expand Medicaid coverage to children with special needs, allowing low- and middle-income families with disabled children the ability to purchase coverage under the Medicaid program. For many disabled children, Medicaid is the only health insurance program offering sufficient benefits to cover the required care, such as physical therapy and medical equipment. The Family Opportunity Act allows parents of disabled children to go to work and earn above poverty wages without losing coverage for their children.\n\n2007\n\nSenator Kennedy led the successful effort to pass the first increase in the federal minimum wage in more than 10 years. His bill raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour and helped more than 13 million Americans, including the parents of more than 6 million children. Senator Kennedy renewed the Ryan White Care Act with greater focus on prevention, chronic care, quality of life, and new and emerging therapies. Congress also passed legislation proposed by Senator Kennedy to strengthen FDA's regulatory authority over drugs after they are approved. The bill was termed by experts to be the most significant strengthening of drug safety in a century.\n\nSenator Kennedy's College Cost Reduction and Access Act authorized the largest increase in student aid since the GI bill in 1944 and established a loan forgiveness program to allow more college graduates to go into public service. The Senator held the first Congressional hearing on Iraqi refugees, and was the lead sponsor on legislation granting special immigrant visas to Iraqis who worked with US forces. Following an immigration raid on a factory in Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy worked with the Department of Homeland Security to develop guidelines on humanitarian screening for workers arrested in such raids.\n\n2008\n\nSenator Kennedy worked with Senator Enzi, with the help of Senator Milkulski, to pass the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which reauthorized the Higher Education Act for the first time in a decade. This legislation focused on four major areas: expanding grant aid for the neediest students; addressing the ethical scandals in the student loan marketplace; simplifying the application process for Federal financial aid; and holding colleges more accountable for their costs. After more than 10 years of effort, Senator Kennedy and Senator Domenici worked together to enact the Mental Health Parity Act, requiring insurance companies to provide benefits for mental illnesses equal to the benefits for physical illnesses and assuring equity for 113 million Americans. Senator Kennedy also led the enactment of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, prohibiting insurers and employers from discriminating against people due to their genes.\n\n2009\n\nSenator Kennedy championed the health and employment provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included incentives for the adoption of health information technology, provisions to expand access to unemployment insurance and to help those who lose their jobs to keep their health insurance, and investments to improve the quality of health. Senator Kennedy was also a leader in passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to restore workers' ability to fight pay discrimination, the first major legislation signed by President Obama. In addition, Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, led the enactment of the Serve America Act, which expands service opportunities for Americans of every age. Senator Kennedy had long been a leader in seeking to strengthen federal hate crime law. In 2009, the Senate passed the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, and is working to see that this long overdue legislation is finally enacted into law\n\nSenator Kennedy's Health Committee was also the first committee in Congress to pass comprehensive health reform legislation called for by President Obama -- the Affordable Health Choices Act that will reduce health costs, protect individuals' choice in doctors and plans, and assure quality and affordable health care for all Americans."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/political-figure/robert-c-byrd", "page_content": "(1917-2010)\n\nWho Was Robert C. Byrd?\n\nSenator Robert Byrd was the longest-serving senator and the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress. He filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and supported the Vietnam War, but later backed civil rights measures and criticized the Iraq War. He was briefly a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s, but later left the group and denounced racial intolerance.\n\nEarly Life\n\nRobert Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr. on November 20, 1917, in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Barely a year later, Sale's mother died in the influenza epidemic. As per her final wishes, Sale's father sent him to live with aunt and uncle Vlurma and Titus Byrd. They adopted Sale, renaming him Robert Carlyle Byrd, and moved to a farm in the rural coal country of West Virginia.\n\nAs a boy, Byrd slaughtered hogs and became a model Sunday school student at the local Baptist church. He also learned to play the fiddle, an instrument he carried with him everywhere. Music would become an important part of Byrd's early life, leading him to perform throughout the region.\n\nByrd was also an excellent student and graduated in 1937 as valedictorian of his class at Mark Twain High School. Shortly after finishing school, Byrd married his high school sweetheart, Erma Ora James. Byrd couldn't afford college, so during World War II he took on odd jobs as a welder for cargo ships in Baltimore, Maryland, and Tampa, Florida. But Byrd craved the pursuit of higher learning, the responsibilities of leadership and a sense of belonging. In 1942, he believed he'd found just that as a member of the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. He described the organization as a group of \"upstanding people\" \u2014 doctors, lawyers, clergy, judges \u2014 who he thought could \"provide an outlet for [his] talents and ambitions\" and also supported his opposition to communism.\n\nByrd was a member of his klavern for only a year, which he said had basically become a money-making organization, which never physically inflicted violence on anyone while he was a member. After he raised several ranks within the group, Byrd lost interest and stopped paying his dues. He would later refer to his time with the KKK as \"the most egregious mistake I've ever made.\"\n\nEntry Into Politics\n\nHis allegiance to the KKK, however, did help push Byrd into the political arena. Encouraged by the grand dragon of his KKK branch, Byrd ran on the Democratic ticket for West Virginia's House of Delegates in 1946. During his campaign, Byrd carried his fiddle in his briefcase and played at each stop on his speaking tour. His skill with the instrument helped to get people's attention on the stump, and had a hand in helping him win the election. From that point forward, Byrd would never lose an election. After his re-election to the House of Delegates in 1948, Byrd campaigned and won, a spot on the State Senate. Two years later, he would win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSelf-educated and well read, Byrd became known for his encyclopedic knowledge of parliamentary procedure, which allowed him to outmaneuvering Republicans with his mastery of the Senate's arcane rules. But he still didn't have a college degree. After winning his seat in the House of Representatives for a second time in 1952, the politician managed to enroll in night courses for law school, despite lacking a bachelor's degree. He was still attending school in 1958, when he defeated the Republican incumbent, W. Chapman Rivercomb, for a spot in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn 1963, after 10 years of classes, Byrd graduated cum laude with his Juris Doctor from American University. President Kennedy, the school's commencement speaker, handed Byrd his diploma. After receiving his degree, Byrd started the Scholastic Recognition Award in 1969, which awards the valedictorian at each West Virginia public and private high school with a savings bond. His financial generosity didn't stop there; appointed a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1960, Byrd became known for using his coveted position as a way to garner additional funds for poverty-stricken West Virginia. He delivered millions in federal aid to his state to build roads, schools and hospitals. The move made him very popular with his constituency, earning him the title \"West Virginian of the 20th Century.\" Critics decried his favoritism with the title \"King of Pork,\" in reference to what they saw as pork barrel spending.\n\nAnti-Civil Rights Record\n\nByrd's early votes in Congress reflected his roots in Southern anti-Black, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic teachings. Byrd initially denounced civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as a \"self-seeking rabble rouser,\" and he worked in opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a landmark law that removed many barriers for Black Americans. He also voted against the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which protected the voting rights of American minorities, making a 15-hour filibuster speech in an attempt to keep the legislation from passing. He later apologized for both these votes.\n\nAfter beating out incumbent senator Ted Kennedy for the position of Senate majority whip in 1971, the second-highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, Byrd's name was mentioned as a possible Supreme Court candidate. His lack of law experience and his ties to the KKK, however, prevented his nomination. This didn't prevent him from winning re-election as the majority whip, then earning the title of Senate majority leader in 1977. Byrd also stayed busy as a musician, recording his own album of fiddle music, Mountain Fiddler, in 1978. This same year, he appeared on the television program Hee Haw to play fiddle. He gave up playing in the 1980s because of a tremor in his hands.\n\nByrd would go on to become Senate minority leader in 1981, after the Republicans took control in the 1980 elections. He returned to the role of majority leader in 1986, until he stepped down from the post in 1988. He was then given the influential post of Appropriations Committee chairman.\n\nChanging Views\n\nIn 1994, Byrd, who had by then written several award-winning volumes on Senate history, earned an honorary bachelor's degree from Marshall University. Byrd was 77 years old at the time. During this time, Byrd began to change his political views to reflect more traditionally Democratic leanings, eventually became a leading backer of civil rights and a pro-choice supporter. He also became an outspoken detractor of President George W. Bush's policies after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. He opposed creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, and in 2003 criticized Bush's jet-landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to announce \"Mission Accomplished\" in toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein during the Iraq war.\n\nOn June 12, 2006, Byrd made history by became the longest serving U.S. Senator in the history of the United States. That November, he was elected to a ninth full term in the Senate. His wife would not get to share in Byrd's joy; Erma Byrd died March 25, 2006, after a protracted illness. When Byrd became the longest serving member of Congress in history on November 18, 2009, having served more than 20,775 days, Byrd remarked on the sadness of not sharing the moment with Erma. \"My only regret is that my beloved wife, companion and confidant, my dear Erma, is not here with me,\" he said. \"I know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying, 'Congratulations my dear Robert\u2014but don't let it go to your head.'\"\n\nLegacy and Death\n\nByrd died on June 28, 2010, at the age of 92. During his tenure, Byrd was elected to more leadership positions than any other Senator in history. At the time of his death, he was the highest-ranking Senator in the majority party, known as the President pro tempore. He served as the senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and a member of the Senate Budget, Armed Services, and Rules and Administration Committees. He had cast more than 18,689 roll call votes\u2014more votes than any other Senator in U.S. history\u2014and held a 97 percent attendance record in his more than 50 years in the Senate.\n\nByrd is survived by daughters Mona and Marjorie, as well as six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Robert Carlyle Byrd\n\nBirth Year: 1917\n\nBirth date: November 20, 1917\n\nBirth State: North Carolina\n\nBirth City: North Wilkesboro\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Robert C.

Kennedy Presidential Library Cecil Stoughton/White House/John F. Kennedy Presidential Library\n\nSen. Edward Kennedy, who died Tuesday night of complications related to a cancerous brain tumor, was the last of his generation of Kennedy brothers.\n\nAnd with his passing, the Kennedy family power dynasty is all but over.\n\nKennedy's son Patrick remains a member of Congress, and Bobby Kennedy Jr. remains an outspoken advocate of causes. But others in Kennedy Jr.'s generation have shunned politics, and those who did hold office have lost it, retired or died.\n\nThe Baby And Patriarch\n\nAs the baby of the family, Kennedy lived to be its patriarch. Like his brothers before him, Kennedy took on new roles as necessity required.\n\nKennedy's father, Joseph, headed the large and wealthy Boston family of Irish Catholics \u2014 and Democrats \u2014 and dreamed of founding a political dynasty starting with his oldest son and namesake, Joe Jr. But Joe Jr. died in World War II. The next oldest son, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, stepped up to a political career and was elected the first Catholic president.\n\nAfter President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, the next son, Robert \u2014 known as Bobby \u2014 ran for the Senate from New York. Then, in 1968, Bobby ran for the White House. During that campaign, he, too, was murdered.\n\nBasically anointed by his brother JFK, Edward Kennedy \u2014 often known as Ted or Teddy \u2014 successfully ran for the Senate in 1962. But despite an attempt to follow JFK to the White House, Kennedy remained in the Senate until his death.\n\nAs the third-longest serving senator in history, Kennedy will be remembered as one of the most dedicated and successful legislators the Senate has produced.\n\nTaking JFK's Children Under His Wing\n\nOne of the many roles that history handed to Sen. Kennedy was watching over his brother John F. Kennedy's children and fostering their versions of the family ambitions.\n\nIn a speech at the 1988 Democratic convention, the late John F. Kennedy Jr. gave homage to his uncle. Sen. Kennedy brokered opportunities for younger Kennedys to appear before the political world \u2014 and one of the best was the chance to introduce Uncle Teddy at a nominating convention, symbolically claiming a share of the Kennedy tradition.\n\n\"I am not a political leader but I can speak for those of my age who've been inspired by Teddy to give their energy and their ideas to their community and not just to themselves,\" John F. Kennedy Jr. said at the time.\n\nUntil his death in 1999, he, too, was a fixture in Americans' lives and imaginations \u2014 a tiny boy crawling under his dad's desk in the Oval Office, and, of course, on his third birthday in November 1963, stepping forward to salute his father's casket at the president's funeral. John F. Kennedy Jr. and his sister, Caroline, were easily the best known of the next generation of Kennedys \u2014 and the wealthiest. This country watched them grow up \u2014 and collectively grieved the loss of John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nCaroline took a turn at the Democratic convention last summer \u2014 introducing a tribute to her Uncle Teddy, the man who stood in for her father at her wedding.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"In our family, he has never missed a graduation, a first communion, or the chance to walk one of his nieces down the aisle,\" Caroline said. \"He has a special relationship with each of us, and his 60 great nieces and nephews all know that the best cookies and the best laughs are always found at Uncle Teddy's.\"\n\nCaroline Kennedy Schlossberg famously campaigned for Barack Obama with Ted Kennedy, calling Obama the candidate who inspired her as so many people have said her father inspired them.\n\nAnd, for a time, it seemed possible that another Kennedy might step into the role many Americans imagined for her brother \u2014 and begin her own political career. She expressed strong interest in being appointed to Sen. Hillary Clinton's seat in New York but then withdrew her name after stories appeared saying the governor was reluctant to appoint her.\n\nAlthough privacy has never been possible for President Kennedy's family, both Caroline and her mother sometimes sought it. Sen. Kennedy referred to that in his eulogy for his sister-in-law Jackie --- a recurring role for him in the family.\n\n\"I often think of what she said about Jack the December after he died: They made him a legend, when he would have preferred to be a man,\" Sen. Kennedy said at Jackie's funeral. \"Jackie would have preferred to be just herself, but the world insisted that she be a legend, too.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sen. Patrick Leahy/AP Sen. Patrick Leahy/AP\n\nRemaining Kennedys With Political Careers, Public Service\n\nOf the dozens of the Kennedy brothers' descendants, several have begun political careers. Sen. Kennedy's son Patrick represents Rhode Island in the House of Representatives but has had repeated problems with addiction. Robert Kennedy's son Joe, who was in the House for six terms, did not run for re-election after a secret annulment of his first marriage became public. His sister Kathleen was lieutenant governor of Maryland and ran for governor but lost.\n\nMany children of the nine Kennedy siblings have carried on a family tradition of public service. On a smaller scale, several are environmental activists, while others work with poor people and people with disabilities. Among the most successful are the children of the late Eunice Kennedy \u2014 one of the Kennedy sisters \u2014 and her husband Sargent Shriver.\n\nEunice Kennedy is best known for creating the Special Olympics, while her husband was best known for inspiring the creation of the Peace Corps and serving as George McGovern's running mate in 1972. Their daughter Maria is the first lady of California. One of their four sons runs the Special Olympics, and another, Mark Shriver, served in the Maryland Legislature and now runs the stateside programs of the charity Save the Children. He said his parents set a persuasive example.\n\n\"They never said, 'You have to go into politics or elective office, you never have to be a politician with a small p.' There was this strong sense that if you're going to do something, do it very, very well,\" Mark Shriver says. \"My father never missed a day of work, and I don't think my mother did, either. They went to the office every day. They worked very, very hard. I think that did permeate our existence; it permeated our upbringing. I think it's great, and I think, at least in my case, it definitely gets you fired up in the morning. If you really think you're going to help kids do better, that's exciting, that's fun.\"\n\nIt seems unlikely that these younger Kennedys will rise to the level of Sen. Kennedy and his brothers.

Net worth figures are based on recent financial filings and are representative of the time that each House member or senator was beginning his or her term in the 115th Congress. Net worth figures are by no means comprehensive or exact, as members of Congress are not required to report their principal residences or their contents (the largest assets for most Americans), and they report their financial assets and liabilities in broad ranges of value. Data on the year each House member or senator started serving as a member of Congress, district served, and party affiliation came from Congress.gov. The year each House member or senator\u2019s current term ends came from nonprofit political encyclopedia Ballotpedia. Only House members and senators currently serving in the 116th congress were considered.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The populist politician was best known for his \"Cross of Gold\" speech, in which he advocated the coinage of silver as a solution to the economic crises of the 1890s. During the Spanish-American War (1898), he helped organize the Third Nebraska Volunteer Infantry Regiment, despite having no prior military experience. He also served as secretary of state under President Woodrow Wilson, from 1912 to 1915. Late in life, Bryan earned fame for his role in the \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" of July 1925, in which he helped prosecute a Tennessee schoolteacher accused of teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution instead of the Biblical doctrine of divine creation. Bryan died in his sleep six days after the trial concluded. The inscription on his gravestone reads, \"Statesman, yet friend to truth! Of soul sincere, in action faithful, and in honor clear.\" (Section 4, Grave 3121)\n\nEdward M. Kennedy, U.S. Army (1932-2009) \u2014 Senator Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy's youngest sibling, was the third-longest-serving member of the Senate in U.S. history, representing Massachusetts for 43 years. After dying from brain cancer on August 25, 2009, he was interred in Section 45, just to the south of his brother Robert F. Kennedy. His grave is marked by a white wooden cross and a marble footstone. Sen. Kennedy was eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery by virtue of his service in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, as well as his public service. (Section 45, Grave S-45-B)\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, U.S. Navy (1925-1968) \u2014 President John F. Kennedy's younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy, was a World War II U.S. Navy veteran who served as United States attorney general (1961-1964), a senator from New York (1965-1968) and a 1968 Democratic presidential candidate. He was assassinated in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, shortly after winning the California Democratic primary.

After joining the Army Air Corps, he flew as a pilot with the \u201cFlying Tigers\u201d of the 14th Air Force, who transported supplies over the perilous Himalayan \u201chump\u201d in the China-Burma-India theater. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Stevens began working for the Interior Department in 1956 and played a key role in Alaska becoming a state (1959). Appointed to the Senate to fill a vacancy in 1968, he subsequently won election and re-election six times. As a senator, Stevens brought massive corporate and federal funding to Alaska, including for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. To his supporters, Stevens was a fierce champion of Alaskan economic growth; to his critics, his name was synonymous with pork-barrel politics and corruption. On July 29, 2008, a federal grand jury indicted him for failing to properly disclose gifts from an Alaska-based energy company. A judge later dismissed the conviction (due to prosecutorial misconduct), but the highly-publicized trial cost Stevens his re-election bid, effectively ending his political career. On August 9, 2010, Stevens died in the crash of a small airplane in Alaska. The Stevens Joint Mobility Complex at Alaska\u2019s Eielson Air Force Base is named after him, as is the Anchorage International Airport.

Though Weeks initially worked in civil engineering, he made his fortune in banking, as co-founder of the Boston financial firm Hornblower and Weeks. A committed Republican, in 1904 he was elected to the House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts for four terms; he subsequently won election to the Senate, where he served one term (1913-1919).

Born to a prominent Washington, D.C. family, Dulles graduated from Princeton University and the George Washington University Law School, with a focus on international law. During World War I, Dulles' poor eyesight prevented him from joining the Army, but he received an Army commission as a major on the War Industries Board. President Woodrow Wilson then appointed him as legal counsel to the U.S. delegation at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. In various capacities, Dulles continued advising U.S. foreign policy during the 1920s through 1940s, helping to craft the United States' role in the newly created United Nations and its response to the emergence of fascism and communism. Dulles was a staunch anti-communist, due in part to his Presbyterian faith; as President Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of state (1953-1959), he pursued foreign policies that went beyond merely containing Soviet expansion to attempting to \"roll back\" Moscow's global power and influence. (Section 21, Grave 31)\n\nJames V. Forrestal, U.S. Navy (1892-1949) \u2014 The United States' first secretary of defense, Forrestal served in that position from 1947 to 1949 \u2014 following the National Security Act of 1947, which unified the U.S. armed forces under the newly-created Department of Defense. In addition to guiding the military through this bureaucratic reorganization, Forrestal helped to formulate early Cold War defense policy. The former investment banker, and Navy veteran of World War I, had proven himself to be a skilled military administrator during World War II. As undersecretary and then secretary of the Navy, he organized the Navy's massive wartime expansion and procurement programs.

Later, during President Chester A. Arthur\u2019s administration, Gresham served first as postmaster general and then as secretary of the treasury for the remainder of Arthur\u2019s term. Gresham ran as a presidential candidate in the Republican Party primaries in 1884 and 1888, before accepting the secretary of state position in President Cleveland\u2019s administration. His tenure ended upon his unexpected death in 1895. (Section 2, Grave S-11)\n\nAlexander M. Haig Jr., U.S. Army (1924-2010) \u2014 Alexander M. Haig served as President Ronald Reagan's first secretary of state, as chief of staff under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and as President Nixon's deputy national security advisor. One of Nixon's most influential advisors, Haig has been described as a kind of \"acting president\" who held the White House together during the final months of Watergate. He ultimately played a key role in persuading Nixon to resign. In addition to these civilian leadership positions, Haig had a distinguished military career: a decorated veteran of the Korean War and the Vietnam War, he served as supreme allied commander of NATO forces from 1974 to 1979, and retired from active Army service in 1979 as a four-star general. (Section 30, Grave 418-LH)\n\nGeorge C. Marshall, U.S. Army (1880-1959) \u2014 One of the most distinguished military, diplomatic and political leaders of the 20th century, General George C. Marshall served as chief of staff of the U.S. Army during World War II (1939-1945). He directed the largest expansion of the Army in U.S. history, from fewer than 200,000 men before the war to more than eight million, with an unmatched arsenal of modern weapons and equipment. He also played a key role in shaping American military strategy, advocating an invasion of Nazi-occupied France via the English Channel. On December 16, 1944, Marshall was promoted to General of the Army (five stars), the nation's highest rank. After the war, President Harry Truman appointed him secretary of state (1947-1949) and secretary of defense (1950-1951); he is the only person to have held both positions. Marshall's diplomatic career was as historically significant as his military one. Most notably, he conceived an ambitious, highly successful program for the postwar economic recovery of Western Europe \u2014 known as the \"Marshall Plan\" \u2014 for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.

Eisenhower, and as secretary of state from 1969 to 1973, under President Richard M. Nixon. As attorney general, he played a principal role in drafting the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and in establishing the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. As secretary of state, Rogers often clashed with President Nixon and was overshadowed by Henry Kissinger, the national security advisor; however, his distance from Nixon allowed him to survive the Watergate scandal unscathed. In 1986, Rogers returned to public service as the chair of a presidential commission charged with investigating the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. (Section 30, Grave 817)\n\nOther Cabinet Positions\n\nRonald H.

Chapman, U.S. Navy (1896-1978) \u2014 Oscar Chapman's 20 years of service with the U.S. Interior Department culminated with his appointment as secretary of the interior in 1949. Chapman advocated for civil rights throughout his career: in 1939, as assistant secretary of the interior, he arranged for the African American singer Marian Anderson to perform at Constitution Hall, after the Daughters of the American Revolution had prohibited her from doing so, and he strongly supported President Truman's decision to desegregate the armed forces. He served in the Navy during World War I.

During the Civil War, he was commissioned as a U.S. Army captain and served as assistant adjutant to General Ulysses S. Grant. He then returned to civilian life, building a successful Chicago law practice. While he declined suggestions that he should run for the presidency, Lincoln did accept appointments as secretary of war (1881-1885) and as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom (1889-1893). He became president of the Pullman Car Company in 1897, after many years as the railcar manufacturer's general counsel.

He next served as Nixon\u2019s ambassador to NATO and Ford\u2019s chief of staff, prior to becoming secretary of defense. After Ford lost the election of 1978, Rumsfeld forged a successful career in the private sector. When he returned to government as Bush\u2019s secretary of defense, Rumsfeld initially aimed to revamp the U.S. military to become more streamlined and adaptable for the post-Cold War era. Yet the attacks of September 11, 2001\u2014which Rumsfeld experienced at the Pentagon\u2014led him to preside over a new era defined by global terrorism and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although Rumsfeld came under criticism for the United States\u2019 actions in Iraq, he expressed no regrets in his bestselling 2011 memoir, \u201cKnown and Unknown.\u201d (Section 34, Grave 381-A)\n\nOther Government Positions\n\nWilliam J.

Following his honorable discharge as a technical sergeant, he enrolled at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college in Mississippi, and graduated in 1946. Evers' experiences of racial discrimination, both in and out of uniform, motivated him to become a civil rights activist. He organized local affiliates of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and in 1954 the NAACP appointed him as its first Mississippi field secretary. He recruited hundreds of members, organized voter registration drives and economic boycotts, and investigated racially based crimes \u2014 including the 1955 lynching and murder of Emmett Till. In response, white supremacists repeatedly threatened Evers' life. On June 12, 1963, Evers was assassinated in front of his home. Just hours before a Ku Klux Klan member shot Evers in the back, President John F. Kennedy had delivered a nationally televised speech in support of civil rights.

While working as a clerk for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, she met and married U.S. Army Captain Raymond Talefase Bonnin, who was also of Dakota descent. In 1910, Zitk\u00e1la-\u0160a wrote the libretto for the first American Indian opera, \u201cThe Sun Dance Opera,\u201d based on a sacred Sioux ritual. She also frequently wrote about American Indian issues for high-profile national magazines. Her co-authored 1924 article in The Atlantic, \"Oklahoma\u2019s Poor Rich Indians, an Orgy of Graft and Exploitation of the Five Civilized Tribes, Legalized Robbery,\" led to federal investigations and legislative reforms that gave tribal governments greater sovereignty over their lands. In 1925, the Bonnins purchased a home in Arlington\u2019s Lyon Park neighborhood \u2014 where a park was dedicated in her name in 2021.

Byrd, the fiddle-playing expert of Congressional procedure and history, became the longest-serving member of Congress on Wednesday, serving 20,774 days \u2014 56 years and 320 days of time in both the Senate and the House.\n\nSenator after senator, many of whom were not even born when Mr. Byrd took office in 1953, praised him on the floor Wednesday as a great scholar and tireless advocate for his home state of West Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt is an extraordinary record of service, dedication and patriotism to the country,\u201d Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. \u201cNo one knows this body better than Robert Byrd and nobody\u2019s served with the same energy and tenacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobert Byrd once said that what is sometimes considered to be the result of genius is more the result of persistence, perseverance and hard work,\u201d the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said, explaining how Mr. Byrd\u2019s 100 floor speeches on the evolution of the Senate eventually became a four-volume book. \u201cTo be a good senator, he said, one has to work at it. And now, longer than anyone else in our history, he\u2019s lived by those words.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Byrd, the unofficial Senate historian, has himself made history many times, picking off record after record. In June 2006 he become the longest-serving senator, overtaking the South Carolina Republican, Strom Thurmond. He is also the oldest member of Congress and the longest-serving member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which he chaired until stepping aside last year at the height of the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI look forward to serving you for the next 56 years and 320 days,\u201d he said in a statement marking the occasion. His only regret was that his late wife, Erma, was not there with him.\n\n\u201cI know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying congratulations, my dear Robert \u2014 but don\u2019t let it go to your head,\u201d said Mr. Byrd, who was elected to his ninth term in 2006 and is up next for reelection in 2012.\n\nMr. Byrd\u2019s health has limited his time on Capitol Hill this year, but he cast votes as recently as Tuesday and has made several floor speeches since Congress returned from the August recess, said a spokesman for Mr. Byrd. He said that there was no private or public celebration scheduled for today.\n\nMr. Byrd, whose 92nd birthday is on Friday, served in the House from 1953 to 1959 and in the Senate ever since, surpassing Carl Hayden, an Arizona Democrat, who served in the House from 1912 to 1927 and in the Senate from 1927 to 1969, a total of 56 years 319 days.\n\nHe was once a member of the Klu Klux Klan and famously waged a 15 hour 13 minute filibuster of 1964 against the Voting Rights Act, but has remained a loyal, even celebrated Democrat. In 2005 Mr. Byrd explained to C-Span why he would change his vote.\n\nIn 2003 he was a prominent critic of the Iraq invasion, arguing that flaunting the nation\u2019s superpower status and acting preemptively without international sanctions made the world a more dangerous place.\n\nGov. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and state lawmakers will honor him at a ceremony in the State Capitol building in Charleston.\n\nSenator Paul Kirk, who was an aide to the late Edward M. Kennedy and now holds his seat, recalled fondly Wednesday morning the sound of Mr. Byrd\u2019s fiddle emanating from his office in the Russell office building and congratulated him on behalf of Mr. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cSenator Byrd and Senator Kennedy shared a love of the U.S. Senate and shared a loved of poetry,\u201d he said reciting words from a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow that embodied the \u201cforce of Senator Byrd.\u201d\n\n\u201cLives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout his career Senator Byrd has made so many footprints on the sands of time.\u201d\n\n\n\nUpdate: Late this afternoon a tearful Mr. Byrd spoke on the Senate floor after his colleagues unanimously approved a resolution honoring him.\n\n\u201cToday is much more than a commemoration of the length of service of one U.S. senator,\u201d Mr. Byrd said from a wheelchair pulled up to his desk. \u201cToday also celebrates the great people of the great state of West Virginia who have honored me by repeatedly placing their faith in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had the privilege not only to witness, but also to participate in the panorama of history,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the apex of the Cold War to the collapse of the Soviet Union, from my opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act to my part in securing the funds for the building of the memorial to Martin Luther King, from my support for the War in Vietnam to my opposition to President George W. Bush\u2019s War with Iraq, I have served in the Congress and I have loved every minute of it.\u201d\n\nMr. Byrd\u2019s comments were uncharacteristically brief, raising the possibility that another record, a personal one, may have been broken as the sun set on Capitol Hill on Wednesday."}]}
