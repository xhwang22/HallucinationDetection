{"The Vagos Motorcycle Club was formed in San Bernardino, California.": [{"url": "https://www.history.co.uk/shows/outlaw-chronicles-hells-angels/articles/history-of-the-vagos-mc", "page_content": "History of the Vagos MC\n\nThe year is 1965. USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://superbikenewbie.com/26-famous-motorcycle-clubs-of-california-including-1-mcs/", "page_content": "California has a rich history when it comes to motorcycle clubs.

They include riding for breast cancer, AIDS awareness, and violence awareness.\n\n\n\nIt is considered a one-percenter motorcycle club with close ties to the Hells Angels.\n\nContact information for its California chapter:\n\nEmail : patjoetaylor@gmail.com Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/eastbaydragons Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/1821674114727786/oakland-california/east-bay-dragons-mc/ Phone: +1-510-638-9859 Address : 8731 International Blvd., Oakland, CA, United States, 94621\n\n\n\n1% club: The genesis of this phrase dates back to the famous 1947 Hollister riot. Allegedly, the AMA (American Motorcycle Association) had commented that 99% of motorcycle riders were citizens who conformed to the law and that only 1% were outlaws (not to be confused with Outlaws Motorcycle Club).\n\n\n\nMany motorcycle clubs that have been associated with organized crime, and have had run-ins with law enforcement agencies use the 1% diamond patch and are commonly referred to as the one percenter motorcycle club (also called an outlaw biker group); More about this here. Some popular 1% clubs are Outlaws MC (a very dominant club), Hells Angels (the main rival group of the outlaws), Pagan Motorcycle Club and Black Pistons MC.\n\nMC (Motorcycle Club): The term Motorcycle Club (MC) does carry a meaning outside and beyond the usual English definition of it. It is a popular term in the Outlaw and 1% motorcycling subculture, where it is often used by motorcycling clubs that have had a history in organized crime. Such clubs (MCs) often denote these by wearing colors \u2014 essentially a 3-piece patchwork.\n\n\n\nHowever, not all motorcycling clubs that use the term MC are necessarily an Outlaw motorcycle club or a 1% club. But it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that all dangerous biker gangs are one percenters.\n\nHarleys: It goes without saying that most riders in various clubs swear by their Harley Davidson Motorcycle or a custom chopper. Harley-David Motorcycles enjoy a disproportionately high popularity among MC riders who, in mainstream culture, are known to promote cruiser motorcycles."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-mar-10-me-vagos10-story.html", "page_content": "Times Staff Writers\n\nMore than 750 law enforcement officials conducted sweeps in five counties Thursday, aimed at breaking the back of the Vagos Motorcycle Club, an organization founded in the 1960s that authorities say is tied to dealing drugs and weapons.\n\nTwenty-two people were arrested in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange and Ventura counties, culminating a three-year investigation aimed at curtailing the operations of the Vagos organization.\n\nThe bust comes two years after another long-term investigation resulted in the arrests of 57 leaders from the Vagos\u2019 archrivals, the Hells Angels motorcycle gang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the two biker gangs have their roots in California\u2019s counterculture movement, law enforcement officials say both groups are actually sophisticated criminal enterprises with a large hand in the methamphetamine trade.\n\n\u201cToday is just the beginning,\u201d said Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona. \u201cThe Hells Angels, the Vagos -- they are not clubs. The reality is that they\u2019re supporting [street] terrorism.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the Vagos have long denied having any ties to criminal activity. The Vagos website states that the group was formed as a \u201ctight brotherhood to survive the wars between the rival clubs and the constant harassment of the police.\u201d\n\nThe message goes on to say that \u201cVagos comes from the Spanish language meaning \u2018traveling gypsy\u2019 or \u2018a streetwise person that\u2019s always up to something.\u2019 \u201d The club has about 300 members in California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Mexico.\n\nAuthorities said the Vagos investigation was among the largest coordinated law enforcement probes ever conducted in the region. Those arrested include seven chapter presidents, one vice president, one secretary, one treasurer and seven sergeants-at-arms.\n\nOfficers said they seized 95 illegal firearms; various illegal drugs, including methamphetamine; $6,000 in cash; and two stolen motorcycles.\n\nThe crimes may later be incorporated into a federal racketeering case, officials said.\n\nThe law enforcement operation was dubbed \u201c22-Green\u201d because Vagos gang members wear the number 22 on their vests, representing V, the 22nd letter of the alphabet, and green is the gang\u2019s color.\n\nThe Hells Angels wear red.\n\nThe Hells Angels and Vagos motorcycle gangs have been feuding for years. In 2001, a bloody melee broke out at a Costa Mesa swap meet that authorities later said stemmed from bad blood between Hells Angels and Vagos members. A fight between the Hells Angels and another gang, the Mongols, left three people dead at a Laughlin casino in 2003.\n\nThat year, federal officials arrested Angels leaders across several Western states on suspicion of firearms violations, narcotics trafficking, possession of stolen explosives and organized criminal activity.\n\nAuthorities on Thursday alleged that the Vagos gang also has a long history of involvement in the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, as well as other controlled substances. They are believed to be responsible for selling drugs in parks in San Bernardino County, officials said.\n\nBecause the Vagos are classified as a criminal street gang, judges can add enhanced penalties if members are convicted.\n\nAmong those whose homes were searched Thursday was Terry Orendorff of Hesperia, the Vagos\u2019 23-year international president. Although he was not arrested, Orendorff and other gang leaders remain subject to future federal racketeering charges, based on the gang\u2019s alleged involvement in a July 2004 killing in Lucerne Valley and an attempted murder in Hesperia, authorities said.\n\nThose arrested included chapter presidents Scott \u201cPsycho\u201d Sikoff of Apple Valley, Vincent Mariano of Victorville, Nels \u201cSwede\u201d Bloom of Romoland, \u201cBig\u201d Roy Compton III of San Jacinto, Lino \u201cUmpire\u201d Garcia of Oxnard, and sergeant at arms Michael \u201cChainsaw\u201d Izykowski of Huntington Beach.\n\nNone of those arrested could be reached for comment Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe expect some of the gang leadership to cooperate with us,\u201d said Thomas Mangan, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\n\u201cThis is the just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nIn the Lucerne Valley homicide, James Gavin, 44, was fatally shot in the upper torso, and another person was injured during a home-invasion robbery.\n\nTwo alleged Vagos members were arrested Thursday on suspicion of murder: Daniel \u201cTwist\u201d Foreman, 28, of Apple Valley, and Vagos vice president Ryan Matteson, 29, of Victorville. They will be charged with murder, attempted murder, street terrorism, residential robbery and first-degree burglary, authorities said.\n\nForeman had previously been arrested on suspicion of the slaying in early 2005 but was released for lack of evidence. Considerably more evidence was uncovered in the latest investigation, said Britt Imes, the San Bernardino County deputy district attorney who will prosecute the case.\n\n\u201cIt was drug-related and retaliation-related, connected to the gang\u2019s perceived disrespect of another Vagos member\u2019s family member,\u201d Imes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been anxious to resolve that murder, and we are finally able to do that.\u201d\n\nTwo other Vagos members, whom Imes declined to identify, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder for their roles in firing multiple gunshots at a vehicle occupied by several people on a Hesperia street.\n\n\u201cWe believe [the shooting] was a retaliation for a high-ranking member\u2019s relative being disrespected,\u201d Imes said.\n\nThe Vagos organization is considered much smaller and less well-known than the Hells Angels, which rose to national prominence after a deadly altercation involving a member at a 1969 concert at Altamont in Northern California featuring the Rolling Stones and Jefferson Airplane.\n\nIn addition to their green outfits, Vagos wear patches with the image of Loki, the Norse god of mischief.\n\nLast week, 10 people associated with the group -- including the leader of the Northern California Vagos -- pleaded guilty to possessing firearms and conspiracy to sell methamphetamine.\n\n*\n\nTimes staff writer Michelle Keller contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://bikernews.net/2020/06/15/an-in-depth-look-at-the-vagos-motorcycle-club/", "page_content": "The Biker News Network / Outlaw Biker World is neutral ground.

Like many other motorcycle clubs of the time, the Vagos Motorcycle Club was founded by a group of members who had returned from World War II and enjoyed riding their Harley Davidson motorcycles. This particular group were originally members of a different motorcycle club, the Psychos (Redlands) Motorcycle Club. After some infighting a few of the members decided to leave and form their own club, which then became the Vagos Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe original members were Rudy \u201cPuro\u201d Esparza (President), Gil Carrasco (Vice President), Whitey (Secretary/Treasurer), Lucky (Sgt. at Arms), Freddy Ruiz, Harley Hog, Animal, Crazy John Estrada, Tom Tom, Moose, Squirrel, Alex Estrada, and Little John Bocanegra.\n\nThe founders of Vagos Motorcycle Club had a Mexican heritage, which led to the color green being selected for the club. The word \u201cVagos\u201d in Spanish means \u201cvagabond\u201d, \u201cgypsy\u201d or \u201ctravelling person\u201d, someone who is always up to something. Two other names for the club were considered, Coffin Dodgers MC and Satan Saints MC.\n\nThe first chapter to open was in San Bernardino, California, which is nicknamed the \u201cBerdoo\u201d chapter. San Bernardino was a hot spot for founding motorcycle clubs, also founded in the area were the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe second chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Victorville chapter, which involved patching over of Cossacks Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe third chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Los Angeles chapter, made up of members from the Talons Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe fourth chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club San Gorgonio Pass chapter, started by some of the Berdoo chapter members and their friends.\n\nThe fifth chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club SGV (San Gabriel Valley) chapter. This was made up of past members of Dirty Dozen MC, Highwaymen MC, Verdugos MC, Vendettas MC and Ghostmen MC.\n\nThe sixth chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Monterrey chapter, consisting of past members of Sabers MC, Dirty Dozen MC and Highwaymen MC.\n\nThe seventh chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Pomona Valley chapter, with members of Nacoda Breed MC.\n\nThe eighth chapter was the Vagos Motorcycle Club Antelope Valley chapter, where members came from Brothers MC.\n\nChapters in Mexico then opened approximately 15 years later in Mexicali, Mexico.\n\nIn 2013 Vagos Motorcycle Club opened chapters in Australia and Sweden.\n\nThe majority of members of the one percenter motorcycle club are Caucasian or Hispanic.\n\nVagos MC Patch / Motto\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club patch consists of the Norse god of Mischief, Loki. He is depicted riding a motorcycle. The Vagos Motorcycle Club patch was designed by a member of the Berdoo chapter who was in prison at the time.\n\nThe Vagos MC motto is \u201cWe Give What We Get\u201d.\n\nOne of the Vagos Motorcycle Club abbreviations is 22, as the 22nd letter in the alphabet is the letter \u201cV\u201d.\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club colors are green, which links back to the Mexican heritage of the Vagos Motorcycle Club founder.\n\nVagos also use the motto \u201cVFFV\u201d, meaning \u201cVagos Forever, Forever Vagos\u201d.

The club's insignia is Loki, the Norse god of mischief, riding a motorcycle. Members typically wear green.\n\n\n\nThe Vagos have approximately 4,000 members among 200 chapters located in the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Missouri, Several Canadian chapters Peterborough, Ontario, Chapters throughout Europe and ten chapters located in Mexico (Baja California, Jalisco and Mexico City). Two hundred members are in Inland Empire (California), where the club was started in the late 1960s.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the Vagos expanded to Sweden and Australia.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nDuring World War II, many military service men rode motorcycles and grew attached to them. The outlaw motorcycle culture was formed after World War II along Route 66 in Southern California and many clubs were formed during those years, one of which was The Psychos. In 1965, a feud occurred among a few of the Psychos members; they left the group and created their own club, which is now known as Vagos MC. Their colors pay homage to their founders' Mexican heritage. The club expanded to the Riverside, California and the California high desert areas, and later to Mexico and Europe.\n\n\n\nInsignia\n\n\n\nA member from the Berdoo chapter (slang for San Bernardino) created a patch while he was in prison featuring Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Vago is Spanish for vagabond or wanderer. Their denim jackets sport their top rockers with their club name integrated into the middle patch, and bottom rockers with their chapter's region or state, such as \"SO. CAL\", \"California\", or \"Arizona\". The middle patch \"depicts a muscle-bound caricature of the Norse god of mischief, Loki, set against a green field\". Loki is colored red on top of a bike with his hands holding up their club name. Other patches the club wears are the number 22 (the 22nd letter of the alphabet, V, for Vagos), and a Loki head. An MF patch (meaning motorcycle family), is received by a member after a probationary period is over and the member is validated as a member of the Vagos family on the front. Some members have been seen with a green swastika and an \"SS\" symbol on their jackets.\n\n\n\nArticle Index\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://hollywoodvagos.com/vago-history/", "page_content": "Vago History\n\nIn the early sixties thirteen friends started a motorcycle club in Southern California.

Lucky was browsing through LIFE magazine and found a picture of a devil coming out of the ground surrounded by smoke, the caption read \u201creturn from hell.\u201d Animal and Lucky presented the picture to the other members for a vote, the vote passed. The colors were chosen by Whitey and Puro. The color chosen was green on green with the devil in red. After the vote, Moose was chosen to draw the center piece. The patches made for the first original 13 were made from felt by a seamstress from Muscoy named Betty. She made all the patches for the few clubs that were around at the time. She made ours till the early 90s when her sight went bad. The patches after the original 13 were made from canvas.\n\nSoon after we got started, a lot of men started to come in; the first was J.R. Garcia. That was three months after we originated. Three months after that we moved to 11th and \u201cL\u201d streets in Berdoo, the Mother chapter.\n\nSoon other clubs wanted to become Vagos! A brief history:\n\nThe second Vago chapter started was Victorville, the members were from the Cossacks MC.\n\nThe third Vago chapter was Los Angeles, whose members were from the Talons MC.\n\nThe forth Vago chapter was San Gorgonio Pass, made up of a few Vagos from Berdoo and a bunch of men who they knew, who rode hard and partied harder.\n\nThe fifth Vago chapter was S.G.V., these members were from the Dirty Dozen MC, a few Highwaymen MC, Verdugos MC, Vendettas MC and Ghostmen MC.\n\nThe sixth Vago chapter was Monterrey, they were from the Sabers MC, and some Dirty Dozen MC and Highwaymen MC.\n\nThe seventh Vago chapter was Pomona Valley, made up with men from the Nacoda Breed MC.\n\nThe eighth Vago chapter was Antelope Valley, it\u2019s members were from the Brothers MC,\n\nThe Mexico chapters were started by accident, 15 years later. Lucky was in Ensenada on the 4th of July playing in a softball tournament. His wife Irene, stopped the game to show Lucky three guys on bikes going down the street. The name on their cuts was the same as ours, except the colors were different. They were black and gray with orange-yellow, with an eagle center. Lucky found out later where they were partying, so he went over and talked and partied with them. The president\u2019s name was Tati and they were from Mexicali. With them partying was another club, the Solo Angels MC. When he came back home he got a hold of Prophet who was the national President at the time, he also went to the Berdoo chapter to talk to Lenco, Loco and Crazy Johnny. We give the credit to them for starting the Vagos MC across the border. We also credit P.C. Games for the growth of the rest of the chapters in Mexico in the early years."}, {"url": "https://www.sbsun.com/2017/06/16/how-does-vagos-motorcycle-club-operate/", "page_content": "It was founded in San Bernardino in the 1960s, but the Vagos Motorcycle Club has since grown into an international enterprise with at least 87 chapters in seven countries and an estimated 900-plus members, according to a federal grand jury indictment unsealed Friday.\n\nFederal agents arrested 22 people around Southern California on Friday in connection with the indictment, which alleges Vagos members committed more than 100 criminal acts, including murder, kidnapping, assault and narcotics distribution. Authorities said those arrested belong to Vagos.\n\nThe group, which law enforcement calls an outlaw gang but members say is a motorcycle club, operates mostly in the U.S., predominantly in California and Nevada. Members ride mainly Harley Davidson motorcycles and wear denim vests with patches bearing the group\u2019s emblem, the Norse god Loki, on a green background, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment describes a hybrid organization with some characteristics of legitimate clubs: it elects officers, keeps a set of bylaws and charges dues. Chapters have regular meetings. They sell branded merchandise. Members can even earn patches for their work on behalf of Vagos.\n\nBut the group also has an unsavory, sometimes criminal side, according to the indictment, which said members could be ordered to harm or kill someone in a rival gang, a fellow Vagos who ran afoul of the group, or anyone believed to have shown disrespect.\n\nVagos chapters visit the territory of rival gangs to provoke fights and enforce their authority, the indictment stated.\n\nIn the past, an attorney for club members has said the group does not condone violence or illegal activity"}]}
