Featuring the first graphical user interface (GUI) for IBM-compatible PCs, the Windows OS soon dominated the PC market. Approximately 90 percent of PCs run some version of Windows.\n\nThe first version of Windows, released in 1985, was simply a GUI offered as an extension of Microsoft\u2019s existing disk operating system, or MS-DOS. Based in part on licensed concepts that Apple Inc. had used for its Macintosh System Software, Windows for the first time allowed DOS users to visually navigate a virtual desktop, opening graphical \u201cwindows\u201d displaying the contents of electronic folders and files with the click of a mouse button, rather than typing commands and directory paths at a text prompt.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Operating Systems\n\nSubsequent versions introduced greater functionality, including native Windows File Manager, Program Manager, and Print Manager programs, and a more dynamic interface. Microsoft also developed specialized Windows packages, including the networkable Windows for Workgroups and the high-powered Windows NT, aimed at businesses. The 1995 consumer release Windows 95 fully integrated Windows and DOS and offered built-in Internet support, including the World Wide Web browser Internet Explorer.\n\nWith the 2001 release of Windows XP, Microsoft united its various Windows packages under a single banner, offering multiple editions for consumers, businesses, multimedia developers, and others. Windows XP abandoned the long-used Windows 95 kernel (core software code) for a more powerful code base and offered a more practical interface and improved application and memory management. The highly successful XP standard was succeeded in late 2006 by Windows Vista, which experienced a troubled rollout and met with considerable marketplace resistance, quickly acquiring a reputation for being a large, slow, and resource-consuming system. Responding to Vista\u2019s disappointing adoption rate, Microsoft in 2009 released Windows 7, an OS whose interface was similar to that of Vista but was met with enthusiasm for its noticeable speed improvement and its modest system requirements.\n\nWindows 8 in 2012 offered a start screen with applications appearing as tiles on a grid and the ability to synchronize settings so users could log on to another Windows 8 machine and use their preferred settings. In 2015 Microsoft released Windows 10, which came with Cortana, a digital personal assistant like Apple\u2019s Siri, and the Web browser Microsoft Edge, which replaced Internet Explorer. Microsoft also announced that Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows, meaning that users would receive regular updates to the OS but that no more large-scale revisions would be done."}, {"url": "https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/05/the-people-behind-windows-11-listening-solving-problems-and-designing-with-purpose/", "page_content": "As a kid, Charles Taylor was always interested in tech \u2013 though he didn\u2019t know exactly what that meant, beyond translating to a job related to computer science.\n\nGrowing up in Littleton, North Carolina \u2013 an actual little town with less than 700 people \u2013 he went to school with the same group of about 60 kids through high school graduation. He would be one of the first in his family to attend college. Taylor went to Duke University.\n\nHe took classes in computer science, visual and media studies and information science, trying to get a feel for a future career. He questioned whether it was the right fit. Then a work-study program at a Duke University medical center connected him with a mentor, an IT chief who took him under his wing and opened him up to new possibilities, in product management. He introduced Taylor to new design prototyping tools and encouraged him to talk to people and come up with solutions to their problems using those tools \u2013 a mindset he\u2019s adopted into his daily workflow.\n\n\u201cAs all the pieces started to come together, I realized he was starting to show me what it could look like to be in the tech industry through a different lens, exposing me to other paths,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cHe was the first one to put it in my head that I didn\u2019t need to be a software developer or a technical expert to be successful in the industry.\u201d\n\nIt would take a few more years exploring strategy, design and engineering in corporate settings, before he found his way to Microsoft, where he\u2019s now a taskbar product manager working on Windows 11.\n\n\u201cI wanted to pursue product management at a company that had a really great connection with customers; a great mission, in terms of impact; and I wanted to work on experiences that were bigger than just internal facing,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to work on something I\u2019m passionate about, something I can be a great advocate for the people who actually use the product. As a product manager, it\u2019s really important you can empathize with your customers and design for a broader, wider and more diverse group, folks you don\u2019t usually get to hear from. Windows just seemed like a really great place for me to work on something that I use, both in my personal and professional life.\u201d\n\nTaylor has become a steward for customers through his work on Windows 11, driven by the realization that the PC plays such an important role for people in so many ways, whether it\u2019s empowering other businesses to deliver their products to their own customers, inspiring creativity, keeping families connected, or even bringing people together for entertainment purposes.\n\n\u201cThe PC is such a central aspect across so many lenses of lives,\u201d he says. In improving upon a much-used part of the desktop, he put a big emphasis in taking the best of Windows and making it accessible to everyone. \u201cMy goal, with Windows 11 and all the releases thereafter, is to get at the root of what the problems are and determine how we can elegantly solve those problems in a way that\u2019s not only meeting their needs, but also delightful.\u201d\n\nThe biggest change in Windows 11 for the taskbar is where it lives: still at the bottom of the screen, but now in the center. \u201cAs devices continue to evolve, wider screens have become the norm for TV, monitors and other screens. So we\u2019ve put the taskbar at the forefront of device.\u201d\n\nThe taskbar represents the hub from which people switch and launch apps, he says, so it has to work harmoniously. Here, the intersection with Start makes it of upmost importance and daily use for most people.\n\nChristian Valencia, whose team helped reimagine the Start experience for Windows 11, also places a premium on listening to feedback.\n\nResearch showed people wanted a cleaner and simpler Start, and that since so many people have smartphones, design paradigms from those devices could successfully carry over into a new Start \u2013 being able to pan different pages with touch, for instance.\n\nAs shown in the video above, Valencia\u2019s team saw how people arranged what they envisioned for Start in modular pieces, and they found that Search, Apps and Files came up most often as what people used at Start.\n\nValencia, who has been at Microsoft for nearly eight years, says that it seems like he was meant to work on Windows.\n\nHis first job after graduating from college \u2013 where he started as a business major before an advertising class converted him to the more creative field of design \u2013 was at a small-to-medium-sized company, creating Windows apps. While he was there, he entered a workout fitness app in a design contest and won, catching the eye of a contest judge. She asked to see his portfolio, which led to a job offer at Microsoft. In a stroke of serendipity, she would be one of his first managers there.\n\nAnd at Microsoft, he feels like he\u2019s come full circle, having worked on many features related to Windows. The last 18 months have made the PC more relevant and vital in our lives than ever before, bolstered by Chief Product Officer Panos Panay focusing the team on rejuvenating Windows with what would become Windows 11.\n\n\u201cIt was all hands on deck \u2013 and everything is still that way,\u201d Valencia says. \u201cWe were on overdrive during the beginning of Windows 11. We embraced a fail-fast approach, super into prototyping, making on the fly, garnering feedback from the team. With Start, there were so many iterations, and it will get progressively better.\u201d\n\nLike many other people when lockdowns were imposed, he created a PC set-up at home, with constant communication with teammates on Microsoft Teams. They continuously gathered feedback and kept revising and improving.\n\nTo further spur his creativity, he takes inspiration from illustrations unrelated to operating systems or mobile devices: abstract/fun art, such as those that include French bulldogs (he has one).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always making stuff on my own,\u201d Valencia says. \u201cOur design director is always telling us to be making something, be ready to share something. So I live that.\u201d\n\nChristina Koehn grew up drawing and sketching in Bellingham, Washington. But she was also drawn to math, science and problem solving. The creative director for Windows 11 went to the University of Washington thinking she\u2019d be an engineer. Though several people in her life also didn\u2019t think creating art for self-expression would be a viable career, her mother did encourage her to take art class when she had an opening in her schedule.\n\nThat\u2019s where she learned about the discipline of design and how she could use her creativity and problem-solving to improve the lives of others.\n\n\u201cTo solve real human problems, this is for me,\u201d says Koehn, who then switched her courses from engineering to visual communication design. Right after graduating, she worked at a print graphic design firm, working on branding and logos. She then moved onto a digital agency where she designed websites and apps and got more experience on digital design elements.\n\nAfter that, she landed a contract role at Microsoft that turned into a full-time position. This fall, she will celebrate her 12th anniversary with the company.\n\nShe\u2019s worked on Bing, Bing apps for Windows 8 (her introduction to the Windows ecosystem), Windows 10, MSN, the Edge browser and the Microsoft Store. And over the years, she saw how the company\u2019s growth mindset propelled teams to work together, culminating in Windows 11.\n\n\u201cWe are all working for our customers, trying to solve problems, to do what\u2019s right for people using our products,\u201d Koehn says. \u201cMarketing, developers, PMs \u2013 all these different disciplines came together to make this product. We took advantage of the brain trust in the diversity of people throughout the company and focused on the needs of customers. As designers, we have empathy for the people we\u2019re designing for. Not that we haven\u2019t done it in the past, but we really pointed the focus on human needs first.\u201d\n\nKoehn built upon the Fluent design style Windows 10 introduced (after the Metro design style of Windows 8), signatures of which include added depth, light and color in icons, rounded corners, fewer pixels \u2013 overall a softer, more simplified feeling. At the same time, she considers it a visual rejuvenation. Her team focused on fonts, typography and iconography.\n\n\u201cWe want people to feel more comfortable,\u201d Koehn says. \u201cWhat people need is their computing to adapt to them. An operating system like Windows, it\u2019s got over a billion people using it. Computing really can empower people and must adapt to scale for all different needs.\u201d\n\nFind out more about Windows 11 and stay tuned for more stories about the people bringing Windows 11 to you.\n\nTop Photo: Charles Taylor (Photo by Ulysses Curry)"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates", "page_content": "Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), American computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world\u2019s largest personal-computer software company.\n\nGates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school\u2019s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates\u2019s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation\u2014then the world\u2019s biggest computer supplier and industry pacesetter\u2014for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer). After the machine\u2019s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out competing operating systems. While Microsoft\u2019s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry\u2019s ultimate kingmaker.\n\nBritannica Quiz A Brief History of the Computer Told from the 1990s: A Quiz\n\nLargely on the strength of Microsoft\u2019s success, Gates amassed a huge paper fortune as the company\u2019s largest individual shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a decade his net worth had reached into the tens of billions of dollars\u2014making him by some estimates the world\u2019s richest private individual. With few interests beyond software and the potential of information technology, Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye, handling civic and philanthropic affairs indirectly through one of his foundations. Nevertheless, as Microsoft\u2019s power and reputation grew, and especially as it attracted the attention of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Gates, with some reluctance, became a more public figure. Rivals (particularly in competing companies in Silicon Valley) portrayed him as driven, duplicitous, and determined to profit from virtually every electronic transaction in the world. His supporters, on the other hand, celebrated his uncanny business acumen, his flexibility, and his boundless appetite for finding new ways to make computers and electronics more useful through software.\n\nAll of these qualities were evident in Gates\u2019s nimble response to the sudden public interest in the Internet. Beginning in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the development of consumer and enterprise software solutions for the Internet, developed the Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer devices such as home televisions and personal digital assistants, created the Microsoft Network to compete with America Online and other Internet providers, and, through Gates\u2019s company Corbis, acquired the huge Bettmann photo archives and other collections for use in electronic distribution.\n\nIn addition to his work at Microsoft, Gates was also known for his charitable work. With his then wife, Melinda, he launched the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) in 1994 to fund global health programs as well as projects in the Pacific Northwest. During the latter part of the 1990s, the couple also funded North American libraries through the Gates Library Foundation (renamed Gates Learning Foundation in 1999) and raised money for minority study grants through the Gates Millennium Scholars program. In June 2006 Warren Buffett announced an ongoing gift to the foundation, which would allow its assets to total roughly $60 billion in the next 20 years. At the beginning of the 21st century, the foundation continued to focus on global health and global development, as well as community and education causes in the United States. After a short transition period, Gates relinquished day-to-day oversight of Microsoft in June 2008\u2014although he remained chairman of the board\u2014in order to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In February 2014 he stepped down as chairman but continued to serve as a board member until 2020. During this time he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016). The documentary series Inside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates appeared in 2019. Two years later Gates and his wife divorced.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Gates\u2019s extraordinary success will guarantee him a lasting place in the pantheon of great Americans. At the very least, historians seem likely to view him as a business figure as important to computers as John D. Rockefeller was to oil. Gates himself displayed an acute awareness of the perils of prosperity in his 1995 best seller, The Road Ahead, where he observed, \u201cSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can\u2019t lose.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/ted-childs-jr", "page_content": "Diversity strategist J.T.

This software is as important to the running of a computer as its hardware. The operating system directs the input and output of data, keeps track of files, and controls the processing of computer programs, allocating computer resources to various functions. The operating system also serves as an interface between the computer and the user. Most computer programs complete a task and then end. An operating system, on the other hand, runs indefinitely and terminates only when the computer is turned off. Microsoft\u2019s Windows OS and Apple Inc.\u2019s Mac OS are examples of operating systems for personal computers.\n\nThe operating system controls the behind-the-scenes activities of a computer. It manages a computer\u2019s memory, file systems, network connections, and input/output devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers, printer, and modem. Critically, the operating system also controls access to the central processing unit (CPU), which is the heart of the entire computer system.\n\nEarly computers had no operating system. For this reason, they could perform only one task at a time, such as running one program or printing. Modern operating systems allow multitasking, in which many processes can be active at the same time. A major role of the operating system is to allocate system resources to various tasks, scheduling resource use to avoid conflicts and interference between programs. The system maintains prioritized queues, or \u201cwaiting lists,\u201d of jobs that need CPU time. It must decide which job to take from which queue and how much time to allocate to it, so that all jobs are completed in a fair and timely manner. Each process is typically allowed to use the CPU for a limited time, which may be only a fraction of a second. The process must then give up control and become suspended until its next turn. The operating system may also allow one job to read data while another writes to a printer and still another performs computations. A process called time-sharing can allow hundreds of people to interact with a large computer simultaneously while giving each person the perception of being the sole user.\n\nToday most operating systems include a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows the user to communicate with the computer by using a mouse to point to symbols, or icons, and menu choices on the screen.\n\nMost personal computers run on a version of the Miscrosoft Windows operating system. It grew out of and eventually replaced an operating system called MS-DOS. Versions of the Mac OS are provided for use on Apple Macintosh computers. A widely used operating system on larger \u201cmainframe\u201d computers is UNIX. It is also used on the Internet servers of Internet service providers and in universities for scientific and engineering workstations. A UNIX-like operating system known as LINUX has become popular for corporate computer networks, Web servers, and personal computers. LINUX is a free, open-source system, meaning that any user can modify it. In addition to such general-purpose systems, special operating systems run on computers that control cell phones, portable digital music players, factory assembly lines, aircraft, and even home appliances."}, {"url": "http://tedchilds.com/", "page_content": "-- Keith H.

However, there are a number of essential elements that allow a user to make use of the computer hardware. This essay will explore the history of one of these elements\u2014the operating system. An operating system is a program that serves as an interface between the user of a computer and the hardware. It sets up an environment in which a user can run programs conveniently and efficiently. Examples of operating systems include DOS, UNIX, and Windows. There are four main components of a computer system: the hardware, the operating system, programs, and users. The operating system manages the hardware and software resources of the computer to best meet the diverse and sometimes conflicting needs of programs and users.\n\nBackground\n\nThe earliest computers did not have operating systems. Programmers interacted directly with the hardware through switches, tape, or punched cards. Because the computer could operate much more quickly than the programmer could load or unload tape or cards, the computer spent a great deal of time idle. To overcome this expensive idle time, the first rudimentary operating systems (OS) were devised. They were simple programs that were always in the memory of the computer and that ordered user programs by type and then automatically ran them one right after the other. The next step came about with the introduction of disk systems. Because disks are random access devices, the information on them can be accessed in any order. Disks were used to hold user input and output until the central processing unit was ready to use it. As soon as the CPU finished one task it could jump on the disk to another job that was ready to run. Time-sharing was the next logical progression. In time-shared operating systems the CPU handles many jobs at the same time by switching in between them so quickly that it is unnoticeable. Thus, while one user is typing in a command, the CPU is executing another user's program.\n\nMULTICS and UNIX\n\nOne of the earliest formal operating systems was MULTICS, designed between 1965 and 1972 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MULTICS was a time-shared system running continuously on a large complex mainframe computer with a vast file system of shared programs and data. In 1969 Ken Thompson (1943- ) and Dennis Ritchie of the Research Group at Bell Laboratories began to work on UNIX, an operating system for minicomputers. Ritchie had previously worked on the MULTICS project, and UNIX was strongly influenced by MULTICS. (The name UNIX is a pun on MULTICS.) For this new OS, Ritchie and Brian Kernhagan developed the systems-programming language C to replace the assembly language previously used. By 1978 UNIX had become a product sold by AT&T (the parent organization of Bell Labs.) The size, simplicity, and clean design of the UNIX system encouraged programmers at sites other than Bell Labs to experiment with UNIX development. The most influential of these was a group at the University of California at Berkeley. The advances made by this group convinced the defense department to fund further research, leading to the development of 4BSD (Berkeley Software Distributions) UNIX. 4BSD proved to be fundamental to the development of the Internet. UNIX is a simple, highly flexible system designed to let the user build a more complex system if desired. It can run on mainframes, workstations, minicomputers, supercomputers, and even personal computers. Research and development of UNIX continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with special focus being placed on standardizing UNIX applications.\n\nApple and Microsoft\n\nWhile UNIX was spreading beyond Bell Labs, the development of the Intel 4004 microprocessor in 1971 allowed the concept of a personal computer to emerge. The Intel 4004 was an entire CPU on a single microchip. Intel and other companies continued to refine the microchip, and personal computer (PC) kits that users assembled themselves became popular among computer hobbyists. Unlike mainframe computers, personal computers were not intended to have more than one user at a time and therefore were not concerned at first with time-sharing or multitasking. Instead, as the PC market grew, emphasis was placed on convenience and ease of use for the user. In 1976 Steve Jobs (1955- ) and Steve Wozniak (1950- ) designed and built the Apple I, which consisted of little more than a circuit board. However, by 1977 they had incorporated Apple Computer and announced the Apple II, which established a benchmark for personal computers. The Apple II had a simple operating system that came on a disk and accepted basic commands from a command line. In the same year Bill Gates (1955- ) and Paul Allen (1953- ) founded Microsoft Corporation.\n\nIn 1980 a computer programmer named Tim Paterson developed an operating system called 86-DOS (Disk Operating System.) Like the Apple II and the other personal computer operating systems of the time, it was a command-line interface between the user and the PC hardware. Also in 1980 IBM decided to make a personal computer and chose Microsoft Corporation to provide the operating system for the new PC. Paterson joined Microsoft in April 1981, and by July Microsoft had bought all the rights to DOS. In August IBM sold its first PC, complete with MS-DOS 1.0. In less than a year reverse engineering had allowed competitors to produce clones of the IBM personal computer. Microsoft sold MS-DOS 1.25 to these clone makers. Throughout the 1980s MS-DOS continued to develop and advance, gaining more capabilities and meeting the needs of more powerful hardware and more advanced programs.\n\nDuring the Super Bowl in January 1984, Apple introduced America to a completely innovative computer in an Orwellian-themed advertisement. The Macintosh was the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI style of operating system allowed users to interact with the computer through click buttons, pull-down menus, and other image options on the screen rather than through a command line. In addition to the graphical interface, the Macintosh had more advanced hardware than IBM-style PCs. Apple continued to offer both the Apple II and the Macintosh throughout the 1980s. By the end of the decade, the Macintosh offered multifinder properties that allowed it to do more than one task at once. The Macintosh proved extremely popular, especially within educational facilities. Despite the Macintosh's popularity, Apple lost ground in the PC market throughout the 1990s until its introduction of the Powermac G3 in 1997. This was followed in 1998 by the highly successful iMac computers, aimed at a low-end market.\n\nIn order to compete with the Macintosh, Microsoft produced Windows 1.0 in 1985, which brought the GUI interface and Macintosh-style features to DOS-compatible computers. In developing Windows, Microsoft signed an agreement with Apple that Windows 1.0 would not use Macintosh technology. When future versions of Windows did utilize Macintosh ideas, Apple took Microsoft to court for copying the \"look and feel\" of the Macintosh. Microsoft argued that the agreement only applied to Windows 1.0, and the court ruled in favor of Microsoft. In the meantime, between 1985 and 1987 Microsoft and IBM collaborated on creating a new operating system. Microsoft pulled out of the collaboration and released Windows 3.0 based on technology that had been developed jointly. IBM continued working on the new operating system and released OS/2 in 1987. Although it was a technologically advanced system, it was not a great commercial success. In 1993 Microsoft produced Windows NT, an entirely new operating system written from the ground up, designed to compete with the server market that was dominated by UNIX. The GUI on this new operating system had much the same look as Windows but with different programming underneath. Meanwhile, Windows continued to develop, with the next major advance coming with the release of Windows 95 in 1995. It included a major overhaul of the GUI, some changes to the underlying DOS, and was tested by over 50,000 individuals and companies before being released.\n\nMicrosoft was quickly taking over the PC market, and some of its practices were drawing criticism. In 1997 Microsoft was ordered to make Windows 95 available without the applications software Internet Explorer. The argument was that by automatically including Internet Explorer on Windows 95, Microsoft was using its monopoly of the PC operating system market to destroy competition in other markets, such as internet software. Microsoft appealed the order. An appeal court ruled that the 1995 injunction did not apply to Windows 98, released in 1998. However, in May of that same year the U.S. Justice Department and 20 states filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft, charging it with abusing its market powers to destroy competitors. In November 1999 Judge Thomas Jackson issued his Findings of Fact, stating that Microsoft is an illegal monopoly and that it had abused its market power in anti-competitive practices.\n\nThe Emergence of Linux\n\nWhile Apple and Microsoft were battling for space in the PC market, Linus Torvalds (1970- ) at the University of Helsinki in Finland was developing a freely distributed version of UNIX for personal computers called Linux. Linux began as a hobby for Torvalds, inspired by Minix, a small UNIX system developed by Andy Tanenbaum. In October 1991 Torvalds announced the first official version of Linux, 0.02. The system was still very rudimentary, but Torvalds put it out on the Internet for UNIX programmers and wizards to aid in its development. Hackers, programmers, and users of every flavor contributed, and by 1994 it had become a viable operating system, capable of running almost all UNIX programs. By 1996 Linux was a complete UNIX clone, capable of running X-windows\u2014the UNIX version of a GUI. Because Linux was developed completely from scratch, it contains no code from AT&T or any other proprietary source. Much of the software available for Linux is from the GNU project at the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, MA. In 1999 it was still possible to obtain Linux and a sizeable number of programs completely free of charge. Because of its flexibility, its price, and the fact that it is adaptable to most PC hardware, Linux became quite popular in the late 1990s as an Internet server. The growing interest in Linux convinced commercial software manufacturers to make their packages compatible with the Linux system. As this trend continues Linux will become even more viable and popular.\n\nImpact\n\nThe pace of change in the computer industry makes it impossible to predict future developments in operating systems. However, this article has attempted to show that the evolution of operating systems in the second half of the twentieth century depended on a number of factors, including programmer interest, market pressures, hardware advances, and government oversight. Operating systems will continue to develop to meet the growing and changing needs of users and new hardware. It can only be hoped that the competition that gave rise to the PC revolution, the innovation that brought about GUI systems, and the free exchange of ideas that gave rise to Linux will all continue into the twenty-first century.\n\nDANIEL BONGERT AND REBECCA B.

This OS was developed by \u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u201d in 1985 and they take more than 90% of the market share from the global market in the IT sector (Computer Operating System). The reason behind the popularity of this OS is that it comes up with a graphical user interface and with preloaded applications which makes the user easy to use and make their experience good. They can easily use any third-party application in this OS without writing any codes and do many types of things which we\u2019ll discuss in later. Now, let\u2019s see what is Windows Operating system?\n\nWindows Operating system\n\nIt is a GUI-based operating system that is developed and marketed by Microsoft Corporation. The main objective of Microsoft company regarding this operating system is to make it an all-rounder and easy-to-use OS that has everything So that any normal user who doesn\u2019t have knowledge about coding can easily use this operating without any issue.\n\nIt comes up with a clean desktop environment that looks minimal and easy to use. It also comes up with a pre-loaded application like Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Edge browser, Microsoft store, some basic games, and many other applications come. It allows the user to do multitask, play games, watch videos, browse the internet, chats with friends/family, and even you can install any software without any issue.\n\nNow, let see what are the features in the window OS\n\nFeatures in Windows Operating System\n\nAs such there are many features in the windows are :\n\nDesktop\n\nTaskbar\n\nTask Manager\n\nControl Panel\n\nCommand Prompt\n\nRecycle Bin\n\nSetting\n\nRegistry Editor\n\nCortana\n\nSystem Information\n\nStart Menu\n\n1. Desktop\n\nDesktop is a by-default GUI-based Screen provided by the Microsoft in windows OS. It is a place where all the software applications icons are available on a screen, so the users can do their work by clicking on these applications. You can also customize it according to your preferences like you can change the background, you can delete your application\u2019s icons, you can create a folder, and also you can customize your taskbar.\n\nDesktop\n\n2. Taskbar\n\nTasker is an area where you can check which application in your PC/laptop is currently open or which is not. Like in the given image, you can see that the only chrome application is currently open.\n\nTasker\n\n3. Task Manager\n\nTask manager is a \u201csystem monitoring program\u2019 where you can monitor your system what\u2019s currently running on your computer. It shows your system resource information, what amount of resources can be used by each application.\n\nTask Manager\n\n4. Control Panel\n\nIt is a management tool where you can manage all the resources on your system like you can make some changes on Hardware resources(Printer, Mouse, keyboard, etc), networks, programs, personalization, etc.\n\nControl Panel\n\n5. Command Prompt\n\nCommand Prompt is a terminal where you can operate your computer by writing Some commands like cd, cls, dir, exit, find, hostname, shutdown, etc, and many others. It is mostly known for \u201ccmd\u201d.\n\nCommand Prompt\n\n6) Recycle Bin\n\nIt is a place where all the deleted files and applications are stored. It provides a facility of restore point where we can restore any deleted files or applications of our system. If you delete any files or applications from the recycle bin then you will no longer restore them, they will be permanently deleted. In a given image you can see that my Linux command PDF file has been deleted and is now showing in the recycle bin folder.\n\nRecycle Bin\n\n7) Setting\n\nThe word \u201csetting\u201d you better know, this is available in all the devices smartphones, tablets, PC, etc. setting allows us to make some changes like we can customize our window desktop by adding different types of wallpapers, pictures to the background, we can adjust the icon size and also we can change the time and date of your system.\n\nIf we talked about an important thing then we can check the windows updates, update drivers, secure system, etc.\n\nSetting\n\n8) Registry Editor\n\nIt is the place where we can fix any error which will be happening in windows OS and for any applications.\n\nRegistry Editor\n\n9) Cortana\n\nCortana is an assistant which helps us to execute our program by hearing our voice, it saves our time and focuses attention on what matters most.\n\nCortana\n\n10) System Information\n\nSystem information shows our PC information of hardware resources, components, and of the software environment.\n\nSystem Information\n\n11) Start Menu\n\nStart Menu shows all the applications and programs of our system. It also shows the history of what application was currently open.\n\nStart Menu\n\nHistory of Windows Operating System\n\n1983 was the year where the first window operating system was developed which is done by the multi-technology software company \u201cMicrosoft\u201d and it was founded by the two popular electronics magazines friends \u201cBill Gates\u201d and \u201cPaul Allen\u201d in 1975. After some years Paul Allen left the Microsoft company (In 1983) and right now the Bill Gates was the only person who owns Microsoft and there are many shareholders who invest in Microsoft.\n\nVersions of Windows Operating System\n\nThere are too many versions were released by Microsoft are:\n\na) Windows 1\n\nIt is was the first Windows from Microsoft which is released on 20 November 1985. This was the first step from the Microsoft to produce a GUI-based operating system. After that, they sold it in the market at $100.\n\nb) Window 2\n\nAfter two years, Microsoft released the second version of the window which is released on 9 December 1987. It was sold for $100.\n\nc) Window 386\n\nThe release date of window 2, \u201cWindow 386\u201d was released on the same day (on 9 Dec 1987). And, it was also sold at $100.\n\nd) Window 286\n\nIn June 1988 the window 286 were released and also sold for $100.\n\ne) Window 3\n\nIt was released on 22 May 1990 and this was the first version of windows that required an HDD (Hard Drive Disk).

Movies like Blank Panther and Crazy Rich Asians garnered acclaim for showing non-white stories to be complex and marketable in a historically racist industry.\n\nLike the entertainment field, the book industry has been dominated by white stories. The majority of novels read in school were written by white people about white people. In \u201cThe Windows and Mirrors of Your Child\u2019s Bookshelf,\u201d Grace Lin says that people of color lack novels that reflect themselves, or mirrors. Mirrors teach children that they are important. And without these mirrors, people of color are left feeling unvalued. Lost. But books, Lin argues, aren\u2019t only mirrors. They are also windows. Books, like windows, provide views into new, unknown worlds. They teach us not only how to respect but how to appreciate the incredible diversity that exists between us.\n\nI will admit that Lin sounds a bit patronizing at the beginning of her Ted Talk, and I chalk that down to her job as a children\u2019s book writer. But she quickly rebounded, finding herself on stage, and delivered an eloquent, meaningful talk, one that not only calls out a problem but provides an easy, immediate solution.\n\nThroughout the talk, Lin tells the story about grappling with her Taiwanese identity, unable to recognize herself in the books she read nor the mirrors she looked in. And when she mentioned auditioning for Dorothy to her friend for the school play, she was told she couldn\u2019t, because she was Asian. But eventually, when she wrote her own book, Where the Mountain Meets the Moon, children across the country wanted to be the Asian protagonist. Though what sticks with me most from the Ted Talk is words she chooses to use, specifically those used to end her talk: \u201cWhen you go home, please, look at your child\u2019s bookshelf. Are all the books mirrors, or are all of them windows? Make sure that you have both, because if you do, you\u2019re setting the path for self-worth and empathy, and that is a brick road worth following.\u201d\n\nFrom the Ted Talk, my main takeaways are the following:"}]}
