On July 2, 1961, he took his life with a shotgun at his house in Ketchum.\n\nErnest Hemingway was born in a suburb of Chicago . He was educated in the public schools and began to write in high school, where he was active and outstanding. The parts of his boyhood that mattered most to him were summers spent with his family on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey , Michigan .\n\nErnest Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, had a great impact on other writers through his deceptively simple, stripped-down prose, full of unspoken implication, and his tough but vulnerable masculinity, which created a myth that imprisoned the author and haunted the World War II generation.\n\nErnest Hemingway, in full Ernest Miller Hemingway, (born July 21, 1899, Cicero [now in Oak Park], Illinois, U.S.\u2014died July 2, 1961, Ketchum, Idaho), American novelist and short-story writer, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He was noted both for the intense masculinity of his writing and for his adventurous and widely publicized life. His succinct and lucid prose style exerted a powerful influence on American and British fiction in the 20th century.\n\nThe first son of Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a doctor, and Grace Hall Hemingway, Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in a suburb of Chicago. He was educated in the public schools and began to write in high school, where he was active and outstanding, but the parts of his boyhood that mattered most were summers spent with his family on Walloon Lake in upper Michigan. On graduation from high school in 1917, impatient for a less-sheltered environment, he did not enter college but went to Kansas City, where he was employed as a reporter for the Star. He was repeatedly rejected for military service because of a defective eye, but he managed to enter World War I as an ambulance driver for the American Red Cross. On July 8, 1918, not yet 19 years old, he was injured on the Austro-Italian front at Fossalta di Piave. Decorated for heroism and hospitalized in Milan, he fell in love with a Red Cross nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky, who declined to marry him. These were experiences he was never to forget.\n\nBritannica Quiz Writer\u2019s Block\n\nAfter recuperating at home, Hemingway renewed his efforts at writing, for a while worked at odd jobs in Chicago, and sailed for France as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. Advised and encouraged by other American writers in Paris\u2014F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound\u2014he began to see his nonjournalistic work appear in print there, and in 1925 his first important book, a collection of stories called In Our Time, was published in New York City; it was originally released in Paris in 1924.\n\nIn 1926 he published The Sun Also Rises, a novel with which he scored his first solid success. A pessimistic but sparkling book, it deals with a group of aimless expatriates in France and Spain\u2014members of the postwar Lost Generation, a phrase that Hemingway scorned while making it famous. This work also introduced him to the limelight, which he both craved and resented for the rest of his life. Hemingway\u2019s The Torrents of Spring, a parody of the American writer Sherwood Anderson\u2019s book Dark Laughter, also appeared in 1926.\n\nThe writing of books occupied Hemingway for most of the postwar years. He remained based in Paris, but he traveled widely for the skiing, bullfighting, fishing, and hunting that by then had become part of his life and formed the background for much of his writing. His position as a master of short fiction had been advanced by Men Without Women in 1927 and thoroughly established with the stories in Winner Take Nothing in 1933. Among his finest stories are \u201cThe Killers,\u201d \u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\u201d and \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro.\u201d At least in the public view, however, the novel A Farewell to Arms (1929) overshadowed such works. Reaching back to his experience as a young soldier in Italy, Hemingway developed a grim but lyrical novel of great power, fusing love story with war story. While serving with the Italian ambulance service during World War I, the American lieutenant Frederic Henry falls in love with the English nurse Catherine Barkley, who tends him during his recuperation after being wounded. She becomes pregnant by him, but he must return to his post. Henry deserts during the Italians\u2019 disastrous retreat after the Battle of Caporetto, and the reunited couple flee Italy by crossing the border into Switzerland. There, however, Catherine and her baby die during childbirth, and Henry is left desolate at the loss of the great love of his life.\n\nHemingway\u2019s love of Spain and his passion for bullfighting resulted in Death in the Afternoon (1932), a learned study of a spectacle he saw more as tragic ceremony than as sport. Similarly, a safari he took in 1933\u201334 in the big-game region of Tanganyika resulted in Green Hills of Africa (1935), an account of big-game hunting. Mostly for the fishing, he purchased a house in Key West, Florida, and bought his own fishing boat. A minor novel of 1937 called To Have and Have Not is about a Caribbean desperado and is set against a background of lower-class violence and upper-class decadence in Key West during the Great Depression.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco, and he wrote a play called The Fifth Column (1938), which is set in besieged Madrid. As in many of his books, the protagonist of the play is based on the author. Following his last visit to the Spanish war, he purchased Finca Vig\u00eda (\u201cLookout Farm\u201d), an unpretentious estate outside Havana, Cuba, and went to cover another war\u2014the Japanese invasion of China.\n\nThe harvest of Hemingway\u2019s considerable experience of Spain in war and peace was the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), a substantial and impressive work that some critics consider his finest novel, in preference to A Farewell to Arms. It was also the most successful of all his books as measured in sales. Set during the Spanish Civil War, it tells of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer who is sent to join a guerrilla band behind the Nationalist lines in the Guadarrama Mountains. Most of the novel concerns Jordan\u2019s relations with the varied personalities of the band, including the girl Maria, with whom he falls in love. Through dialogue, flashbacks, and stories, Hemingway offers telling and vivid profiles of the Spanish character and unsparingly depicts the cruelty and inhumanity stirred up by the civil war. Jordan\u2019s mission is to blow up a strategic bridge near Segovia in order to aid a coming Republican attack, which he realizes is doomed to fail. In an atmosphere of impending disaster, he blows up the bridge but is wounded and makes his retreating comrades leave him behind, where he prepares a last-minute resistance to his Nationalist pursuers.\n\nAll of his life Hemingway was fascinated by war\u2014in A Farewell to Arms he focused on its pointlessness, in For Whom the Bell Tolls on the comradeship it creates\u2014and, as World War II progressed, he made his way to London as a journalist. He flew several missions with the Royal Air Force and crossed the English Channel with American troops on D-Day (June 6, 1944). Attaching himself to the 22nd Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division, he saw a good deal of action in Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge. He also participated in the liberation of Paris, and, although ostensibly a journalist, he impressed professional soldiers not only as a man of courage in battle but also as a real expert in military matters, guerrilla activities, and intelligence collection.\n\nFollowing the war in Europe, Hemingway returned to his home in Cuba and began to work seriously again. He also traveled widely, and, on a trip to Africa, he was injured in a plane crash. Soon after (in 1953), he received the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for The Old Man and the Sea (1952), a short heroic novel about an old Cuban fisherman who, after an extended struggle, hooks and boats a giant marlin only to have it eaten by voracious sharks during the long voyage home. This book, which played a role in gaining for Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, was as enthusiastically praised as his previous novel, Across the River and into the Trees (1950), the story of a professional army officer who dies while on leave in Venice, had been damned.\n\nBy 1960 Hemingway had left Cuba and settled in Ketchum, Idaho. (He expressed his belief in what he called the \u201chistorical necessity\u201d of the Cuban Revolution; his attitude toward its leader, Fidel Castro, who had taken power in 1959, varied.) He tried to lead his life and do his work as before. For a while he succeeded, but, anxiety-ridden and depressed, he was twice hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he received electroshock treatments. Two days after his return to the house in Ketchum, he took his life with a shotgun. Hemingway had been married four times: to Hadley Richardson in 1921 (divorced 1927), Pauline Pfeiffer in 1927 (divorced 1940), Martha Gellhorn in 1940 (divorced 1945), and Mary Welsh in 1946. He had fathered three sons: John Hadley Nicanor (\u201cBumby\u201d), with Hadley, born in 1923; Patrick, with Pauline, in 1928; and Gregory, also with Pauline, in 1931.\n\nHemingway left behind a substantial amount of manuscript, some of which has been published. A Moveable Feast, an entertaining memoir of his years in Paris (1921\u201326) before he was famous, was issued in 1964. Islands in the Stream, three closely related novellas growing directly out of his peacetime memories of the Caribbean island of Bimini, of Havana during World War II, and of searching for U-boats off Cuba, appeared in 1970.\n\nHemingway\u2019s characters plainly embody his own values and view of life. The main characters of The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls are young men whose strength and self-confidence nevertheless coexist with a sensitivity that leaves them deeply scarred by their wartime experiences. War was for Hemingway a potent symbol of the world, which he viewed as complex, filled with moral ambiguities, and offering almost unavoidable pain, hurt, and destruction. To survive in such a world, and perhaps emerge victorious, one must conduct oneself with honour, courage, endurance, and dignity, a set of principles known as \u201cthe Hemingway code.\u201d To behave well in the lonely, losing battle with life is to show \u201cgrace under pressure\u201d and constitutes in itself a kind of victory, a theme clearly established in The Old Man and the Sea.\n\nHemingway\u2019s prose style was probably the most widely imitated of any in the 20th century. He wished to strip his own use of language of inessentials, ridding it of all traces of verbosity, embellishment, and sentimentality. In striving to be as objective and honest as possible, Hemingway hit upon the device of describing a series of actions by using short, simple sentences from which all comment or emotional rhetoric has been eliminated. These sentences are composed largely of nouns and verbs, have few adjectives and adverbs, and rely on repetition and rhythm for much of their effect. The resulting terse, concentrated prose is concrete and unemotional yet is often resonant and capable of conveying great irony through understatement. Hemingway\u2019s use of dialogue was similarly fresh, simple, and natural-sounding. The influence of this style was felt worldwide wherever novels were written, particularly from the 1930s through the \u201950s.\n\nA consummately contradictory man, Hemingway achieved a fame surpassed by few, if any, American authors of the 20th century. The virile nature of his writing, which attempted to re-create the exact physical sensations he experienced in wartime, big-game hunting, and bullfighting, in fact masked an aesthetic sensibility of great delicacy. He was a celebrity long before he reached middle age, but his popularity continues to be validated by serious critical opinion."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/ernest-miller-birth-1919-death-1974/41399083", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during Ernest's lifetime.\n\nIn 1919, in the year that Ernest Miller was born, Indian lawyer Mahatma Gandhi initiated the Satyagraha campaigns, beginning the nonviolent resistance movement against British rule of India.

Ed was a general medical practitioner and Grace a would-be opera singer turned music teacher.\n\nHemingway's parents reportedly had an unconventional arrangement, in which Grace, an ardent feminist, would agree to marry Ed only if he could assure her she would not be responsible for the housework or cooking. Ed acquiesced; in addition to his busy medical practice, he ran the household, managed the servants, and even cooked meals when the need arose.\n\nErnest Hemingway grew up with four sisters; his much-longed-for brother did not arrive until Ernest was 15 years old. Young Ernest enjoyed family vacations at a cottage in northern Michigan where he developed a love of the outdoors and learned hunting and fishing from his father. His mother, who insisted that all of her children learn to play an instrument, instilled in him an appreciation of the arts.\n\nIn high school, Hemingway co-edited the school newspaper and competed on the football and swim teams. Fond of impromptu boxing matches with his friends, Hemingway also played cello in the school orchestra. He graduated from Oak Park High School in 1917.\n\nWorld War I\n\nHired by the Kansas City Star in 1917 as a reporter covering the police beat, Hemingway\u2014obligated to adhere to the newspaper's style guidelines\u2014began to develop the succinct, simple style of writing that would become his trademark. That style was a dramatic departure from the ornate prose that dominated literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAfter six months in Kansas City, Hemingway longed for adventure. Ineligible for military service due to poor eyesight, he volunteered in 1918 as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross in Europe. In July of that year, while on duty in Italy, Hemingway was severely injured by an exploding mortar shell. His legs were peppered by more than 200 shell fragments, a painful and debilitating injury that required several surgeries.\n\nAs the first American to have survived being wounded in Italy in World War I, Hemingway was awarded a medal from the Italian government.\n\nWhile recovering from his wounds at a hospital in Milan, Hemingway met and fell in love with Agnes von Kurowsky, a nurse with the American Red Cross. He and Agnes made plans to marry once he had earned enough money.\n\nAfter the war ended in November 1918, Hemingway returned to the United States to look for a job, but the wedding was not to be. Hemingway received a letter from Agnes in March 1919, breaking off the relationship. Devastated, he became depressed and rarely left the house.\n\nBecoming a Writer\n\nHemingway spent a year at his parents' home, recovering from wounds both physical and emotional. In early 1920, mostly recovered and eager to be employed, Hemingway got a job in Toronto helping a woman care for her disabled son. There he met the features editor of the Toronto Star Weekly, which hired him as a feature writer.\n\nIn fall of that year, he moved to Chicago and became a writer for The Cooperative Commonwealth, a monthly magazine, while still working for the Star.\n\nHemingway, however, longed to write fiction. He began submitting short stories to magazines, but they were repeatedly rejected. Soon, however, Hemingway had reason for hope. Through mutual friends, Hemingway met novelist Sherwood Anderson, who was impressed by Hemingway's short stories and encouraged him to pursue a career in writing.\n\nHemingway also met the woman who would become his first wife: Hadley Richardson. A native of St. Louis, Richardson had come to Chicago to visit friends after the death of her mother. She managed to support herself with a small trust fund left to her by her mother. The pair married in September 1921.\n\nSherwood Anderson, just back from a trip to Europe, urged the newly married couple to move to Paris, where he believed a writer's talent could flourish. He furnished the Hemingways with letters of introduction to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound and modernist writer Gertrude Stein. They set sail from New York in December 1921.\n\nLife in Paris\n\nThe Hemingways found an inexpensive apartment in a working-class district in Paris. They lived on Hadley's inheritance and Hemingway's income from the Toronto Star Weekly, which employed him as a foreign correspondent. Hemingway also rented out a small hotel room to use as his workplace.\n\nThere, in a burst of productivity, Hemingway filled one notebook after another with stories, poems, and accounts of his childhood trips to Michigan.\n\nHemingway finally garnered an invitation to the salon of Gertrude Stein, with whom he later developed a deep friendship. Stein's home in Paris had become a meeting place for various artists and writers of the era, with Stein acting as a mentor to several prominent writers.\n\nStein promoted the simplification of both prose and poetry as a backlash to the elaborate style of writing seen in past decades. Hemingway took her suggestions to heart and later credited Stein for having taught him valuable lessons that influenced his writing style.\n\nHemingway and Stein belonged to the group of American expatriate writers in 1920s Paris who came to be known as the \"Lost Generation.\" These writers had become disillusioned with traditional American values following World War I; their work often reflected their sense of futility and despair. Other writers in this group included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and John Dos Passos.\n\nIn December 1922, Hemingway endured what might be considered a writer's worst nightmare. His wife, traveling by train to meet him for a holiday, lost a valise filled with a large portion of his recent work, including carbon copies. The papers were never found.\n\nGetting Published\n\nIn 1923, several of Hemingway's poems and stories were accepted for publication in two American literary magazines, Poetry and The Little Review. In the summer of that year, Hemingway's first book, \"Three Stories and Ten Poems,\" was published by an American-owned Paris publishing house.\n\nOn a trip to Spain in the summer of 1923, Hemingway witnessed his first bullfight. He wrote of bullfighting in the Star, seeming to condemn the sport and romanticize it at the same time. On another excursion to Spain, Hemingway covered the traditional \"running of the bulls\" at Pamplona, during which young men\u2014courting death or, at the very least, injury\u2014ran through town pursued by a throng of angry bulls.\n\nThe Hemingways returned to Toronto for the birth of their son. John Hadley Hemingway (nicknamed \"Bumby\") was born October 10, 1923. They returned to Paris in January 1924, where Hemingway continued to work on a new collection of short stories, later published in the book \"In Our Time.\"\n\nHemingway returned to Spain to work on his upcoming novel set in Spain: \"The Sun Also Rises.\" The book was published in 1926, to mostly good reviews.\n\nYet Hemingway's marriage was in turmoil. He had begun an affair in 1925 with American journalist Pauline Pfeiffer, who worked for the Paris Vogue. The Hemingways divorced in January 1927; Pfeiffer and Hemingway married in May of that year. Hadley later remarried and returned to Chicago with Bumby in 1934.\n\nBack to the U.S.\n\nIn 1928, Hemingway and his second wife returned to the United States to live. In June 1928, Pauline gave birth to son Patrick in Kansas City. A second son, Gregory, would be born in 1931. The Hemingways rented a house in Key West, Florida, where Hemingway worked on his latest book, \"A Farewell to Arms,\" based upon his World War I experiences.\n\nIn December 1928, Hemingway received shocking news\u2014his father, despondent over mounting health and financial problems, had shot himself to death. Hemingway, who'd had a strained relationship with his parents, reconciled with his mother after his father's suicide and helped support her financially.\n\nIn May 1928, Scribner's Magazine published its first installment of \"A Farewell to Arms.\" It was well-received; however, the second and third installments, deemed profane and sexually explicit, were banned from newsstands in Boston. Such criticism only served to boost sales when the entire book was published in September 1929.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War\n\nThe early 1930s proved to be a productive (if not always successful) time for Hemingway. Fascinated by bullfighting, he traveled to Spain to do research for the non-fiction book, \"Death in the Afternoon.\" It was published in 1932 to generally poor reviews and was followed by several less-than-successful short story collections.\n\nEver the adventurer, Hemingway traveled to Africa on a shooting safari in November 1933. Although the trip was somewhat disastrous\u2014Hemingway clashed with his companions and later became ill with dysentery\u2014it provided him with ample material for a short story, \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" as well as a non-fiction book, \"Green Hills of Africa.\"\n\nWhile Hemingway was on a hunting and fishing trip in the United States in the summer of 1936, the Spanish Civil War began. A supporter of the loyalist (anti-Fascist) forces, Hemingway donated money for ambulances. He also signed on as a journalist to cover the conflict for a group of American newspapers and became involved in making a documentary. While in Spain, Hemingway began an affair with Martha Gellhorn, an American journalist and documentarian.\n\nWeary of her husband's adulterous ways, Pauline took her sons and left Key West in December 1939. Only months after she divorced Hemingway, he married Martha Gellhorn in November 1940.\n\nWorld War II\n\nHemingway and Gellhorn rented a farmhouse in Cuba just outside of Havana, where both could work on their writing. Traveling between Cuba and Key West, Hemingway wrote one of his most popular novels: \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\"\n\nA fictionalized account of the Spanish Civil War, the book was published in October 1940 and became a bestseller. Despite being named the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1941, the book did not win because the president of Columbia University (which bestowed the award) vetoed the decision.\n\nAs Martha's reputation as a journalist grew, she earned assignments around the globe, leaving Hemingway resentful of her long absences. But soon, they would both be globetrotting. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, both Hemingway and Gellhorn signed on as war correspondents.\n\nHemingway was allowed on board a troop transport ship, from which he was able to watch the D-day invasion of Normandy in June 1944.\n\nThe Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes\n\nWhile in London during the war, Hemingway began an affair with the woman who would become his fourth wife\u2014journalist Mary Welsh. Gellhorn learned of the affair and divorced Hemingway in 1945. He and Welsh married in 1946. They alternated between homes in Cuba and Idaho.\n\nIn January 1951, Hemingway began writing a book that would become one of his most celebrated works: \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" A bestseller, the novella also won Hemingway his long-awaited Pulitzer Prize in 1953.\n\nThe Hemingways traveled extensively but were often the victims of bad luck. They were involved in two plane crashes in Africa during one trip in 1953. Hemingway was severely injured, sustaining internal and head injuries as well as burns. Some newspapers erroneously reported that he had died in the second crash.\n\nIn 1954, Hemingway was awarded the career-topping Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nDecline and Death\n\nIn January 1959, the Hemingways moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho. Hemingway, now nearly 60 years old, had suffered for several years with high blood pressure and the effects of years of heavy drinking. He had also become moody and depressed and appeared to be deteriorating mentally.\n\nIn November 1960, Hemingway was admitted to the Mayo Clinic for treatment of his physical and mental symptoms. He received electroshock therapy for his depression and was sent home after a two-month stay. Hemingway became further depressed when he realized he was unable to write after the treatments.\n\nAfter three suicide attempts, Hemingway was readmitted to the Mayo Clinic and given more shock treatments. Although his wife protested, he convinced his doctors he was well enough to go home. Only days after being discharged from the hospital, Hemingway shot himself in the head in his Ketchum home early on the morning of July 2, 1961. He died instantly.\n\nLegacy\n\nA larger-than-life figure, Hemingway thrived on high adventure, from safaris and bullfights to wartime journalism and adulterous affairs, communicating that to his readers in an immediately recognizable spare, staccato format. Hemingway is among the most prominent and influential of the \"Lost Generation\" of expatriate writers who lived in Paris in the 1920s.\n\nKnown affectionately as \"Papa Hemingway,\" he was awarded both the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in literature, and several of his books were made into movies.\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ernest-hemingway", "page_content": "(1899-1961)\n\nWho Was Ernest Hemingway?\n\nErnest Hemingway served in World War I and worked in journalism before publishing his story collection In Our Time. He was renowned for novels like The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. In 1954, Hemingway won the Nobel Prize. He committed suicide on July 2, 1961, in Ketchum, Idaho.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Cicero (now in Oak Park), Illinois. Clarence and Grace Hemingway raised their son in this conservative suburb of Chicago, but the family also spent a great deal of time in northern Michigan, where they had a cabin. It was there that the future sportsman learned to hunt, fish and appreciate the outdoors.\n\nIn high school, Hemingway worked on his school newspaper, Trapeze and Tabula, writing primarily about sports. Immediately after graduation, the budding journalist went to work for the Kansas City Star, gaining experience that would later influence his distinctively stripped-down prose style.\n\nHe once said, \"On the Star you were forced to learn to write a simple declarative sentence. This is useful to anyone. Newspaper work will not harm a young writer and could help him if he gets out of it in time.\"\n\nMilitary Experience\n\nIn 1918, Hemingway went overseas to serve in World War I as an ambulance driver in the Italian Army. For his service, he was awarded the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery, but soon sustained injuries that landed him in a hospital in Milan.\n\nThere he met a nurse named Agnes von Kurowsky, who soon accepted his proposal of marriage, but later left him for another man. This devastated the young writer but provided fodder for his works \"A Very Short Story\" and, more famously, A Farewell to Arms.\n\nStill nursing his injury and recovering from the brutalities of war at the young age of 20, he returned to the United States and spent time in northern Michigan before taking a job at the Toronto Star.\n\nIt was in Chicago that Hemingway met Hadley Richardson, the woman who would become his first wife. The couple married and quickly moved to Paris, where Hemingway worked as a foreign correspondent for the Star.\n\nLife in Europe\n\nIn Paris, Hemingway soon became a key part of what Gertrude Stein would famously call \"The Lost Generation.\" With Stein as his mentor, Hemingway made the acquaintance of many of the great writers and artists of his generation, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Pablo Picasso and James Joyce. In 1923, Hemingway and Hadley had a son, John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway. By this time, the writer had also begun frequenting the famous Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nIn 1925, the couple, joining a group of British and American expatriates, took a trip to the festival that would later provide the basis of Hemingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises. The novel is widely considered Hemingway's greatest work, artfully examining the postwar disillusionment of his generation.\n\nSoon after the publication of The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway and Hadley divorced, due in part to his affair with a woman named Pauline Pfeiffer, who would become Hemingway's second wife shortly after his divorce from Hadley was finalized. The author continued to work on his book of short stories, Men Without Women.\n\nCritical Acclaim\n\nSoon, Pauline became pregnant and the couple decided to move back to America. After the birth of their son Patrick Hemingway in 1928, they settled in Key West, Florida, but summered in Wyoming. During this time, Hemingway finished his celebrated World War I novel A Farewell to Arms, securing his lasting place in the literary canon.\n\nWhen he wasn't writing, Hemingway spent much of the 1930s chasing adventure: big-game hunting in Africa, bullfighting in Spain and deep-sea fishing in Florida. While reporting on the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Hemingway met a fellow war correspondent named Martha Gellhorn (soon to become wife number three) and gathered material for his next novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, which would eventually be nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nAlmost predictably, his marriage to Pfeiffer deteriorated and the couple divorced. Gellhorn and Hemingway married soon after and purchased a farm near Havana, Cuba, which would serve as their winter residence.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, Hemingway served as a correspondent and was present at several of the war's key moments, including the D-Day landing. Toward the end of the war, Hemingway met another war correspondent, Mary Welsh, whom he would later marry after divorcing Gellhorn.\n\nIn 1951, Hemingway wrote The Old Man and the Sea, which would become perhaps his most famous book, finally winning him the Pulitzer Prize he had long been denied.\n\nPersonal Struggles and Suicide\n\nThe author continued his forays into Africa and sustained several injuries during his adventures, even surviving multiple plane crashes.\n\nIn 1954, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Even at this peak of his literary career, though, the burly Hemingway's body and mind were beginning to betray him. Recovering from various old injuries in Cuba, Hemingway suffered from depression and was treated for numerous conditions such as high blood pressure and liver disease.\n\nHe wrote A Moveable Feast, a memoir of his years in Paris, and retired permanently to Idaho. There he continued to battle with deteriorating mental and physical health.\n\nEarly on the morning of July 2, 1961, Hemingway committed suicide in his Ketchum home.\n\nLegacy\n\nHemingway left behind an impressive body of work and an iconic style that still influences writers today. His personality and constant pursuit of adventure loomed almost as large as his creative talent.\n\nWhen asked by George Plimpton about the function of his art, Hemingway proved once again to be a master of the \"one true sentence\": \"From things that have happened and from things as they exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, you make something through your invention that is not a representation but a whole new thing truer than anything true and alive, and you make it alive, and if you make it well enough, you give it immortality.\"\n\nIn August 2018, a 62-year-old short story by Hemingway, \"A Room on the Garden Side,\" was published for the first time in The Strand Magazine. Set in Paris shortly after the liberation of the city from Nazi forces in 1944, the story was one of five composed by the writer in 1956 about his World War II experiences. It became the second story from the series to earn posthumous publication, following \"Black Ass at the Crossroads.\"\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Ernest Hemingway\n\nBirth Year: 1899\n\nBirth date: July 21, 1899\n\nBirth State: Illinois\n\nBirth City: Cicero (now in Oak Park)\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway is seen as one of the great American 20th century novelists, and is known for works like 'A Farewell to Arms' and 'The Old Man and the Sea.'\n\nIndustries\n\nWriting and Publishing\n\nAstrological Sign: Cancer\n\nSchools\n\nOak Park and River Forest High School\n\nDeath Year: 1961\n\nDeath date: July 2, 1961\n\nDeath State: Idaho\n\nDeath City: Ketchum\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Ernest Hemingway Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/writer/ernest-hemingway\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: May 7, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 3, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}], "Ernest Miller began his career in the film industry in 1912.": [{"url": "https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/8-2-the-history-of-movies/", "page_content": "8.2 The History of Movies\n\nLearning Objectives Identify key points in the development of the motion picture industry. Identify key developments of the motion picture industry and technology. Identify influential films in movie history.\n\nThe movie industry as we know it today originated in the early 19th century through a series of technological developments: the creation of photography, the discovery of the illusion of motion by combining individual still images, and the study of human and animal locomotion. The history presented here begins at the culmination of these technological developments, where the idea of the motion picture as an entertainment industry first emerged. Since then, the industry has seen extraordinary transformations, some driven by the artistic visions of individual participants, some by commercial necessity, and still others by accident. The history of the cinema is complex, and for every important innovator and movement listed here, others have been left out. Nonetheless, after reading this section you will understand the broad arc of the development of a medium that has captured the imaginations of audiences worldwide for over a century.\n\nThe Beginnings: Motion Picture Technology of the Late 19th Century While the experience of watching movies on smartphones may seem like a drastic departure from the communal nature of film viewing as we think of it today, in some ways the small-format, single-viewer display is a return to film\u2019s early roots. In 1891, the inventor Thomas Edison, together with William Dickson, a young laboratory assistant, came out with what they called the kinetoscope, a device that would become the predecessor to the motion picture projector. The kinetoscope was a cabinet with a window through which individual viewers could experience the illusion of a moving image (Gale Virtual Reference Library) (British Movie Classics). A perforated celluloid film strip with a sequence of images on it was rapidly spooled between a light bulb and a lens, creating the illusion of motion (Britannica). The images viewers could see in the kinetoscope captured events and performances that had been staged at Edison\u2019s film studio in East Orange, New Jersey, especially for the Edison kinetograph (the camera that produced kinetoscope film sequences): circus performances, dancing women, cockfights, boxing matches, and even a tooth extraction by a dentist (Robinson, 1994). As the kinetoscope gained popularity, the Edison Company began installing machines in hotel lobbies, amusement parks, and penny arcades, and soon kinetoscope parlors\u2014where customers could pay around 25 cents for admission to a bank of machines\u2014had opened around the country. However, when friends and collaborators suggested that Edison find a way to project his kinetoscope images for audience viewing, he apparently refused, claiming that such an invention would be a less profitable venture (Britannica). Because Edison hadn\u2019t secured an international patent for his invention, variations of the kinetoscope were soon being copied and distributed throughout Europe. This new form of entertainment was an instant success, and a number of mechanics and inventors, seeing an opportunity, began toying with methods of projecting the moving images onto a larger screen. However, it was the invention of two brothers, Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re\u2014photographic goods manufacturers in Lyon, France\u2014that saw the most commercial success. In 1895, the brothers patented the cin\u00e9matographe (from which we get the term cinema), a lightweight film projector that also functioned as a camera and printer. Unlike the Edison kinetograph, the cin\u00e9matographe was lightweight enough for easy outdoor filming, and over the years the brothers used the camera to take well over 1,000 short films, most of which depicted scenes from everyday life. In December 1895, in the basement lounge of the Grand Caf\u00e9, Rue des Capucines in Paris, the Lumi\u00e8res held the world\u2019s first ever commercial film screening, a sequence of about 10 short scenes, including the brother\u2019s first film, Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory, a segment lasting less than a minute and depicting workers leaving the family\u2019s photographic instrument factory at the end of the day, as shown in the still frame here in Figure 8.3 (Encyclopedia of the Age of Industry and Empire). Believing that audiences would get bored watching scenes that they could just as easily observe on a casual walk around the city, Louis Lumi\u00e8re claimed that the cinema was \u201can invention without a future (Menand, 2005),\u201d but a demand for motion pictures grew at such a rapid rate that soon representatives of the Lumi\u00e8re company were traveling throughout Europe and the world, showing half-hour screenings of the company\u2019s films. While cinema initially competed with other popular forms of entertainment\u2014circuses, vaudeville acts, theater troupes, magic shows, and many others\u2014eventually it would supplant these various entertainments as the main commercial attraction (Menand, 2005). Within a year of the Lumi\u00e8res\u2019 first commercial screening, competing film companies were offering moving-picture acts in music halls and vaudeville theaters across Great Britain. In the United States, the Edison Company, having purchased the rights to an improved projector that they called the Vitascope, held their first film screening in April 1896 at Koster and Bial\u2019s Music Hall in Herald Square, New York City. Film\u2019s profound impact on its earliest viewers is difficult to imagine today, inundated as many are by video images. However, the sheer volume of reports about the early audience\u2019s disbelief, delight, and even fear at what they were seeing suggests that viewing a film was an overwhelming experience for many. Spectators gasped at the realistic details in films such as Robert Paul\u2019s Rough Sea at Dover, and at times people panicked and tried to flee the theater during films in which trains or moving carriages sped toward the audience (Robinson). Even the public\u2019s perception of film as a medium was considerably different from the contemporary understanding; the moving image was an improvement upon the photograph\u2014a medium with which viewers were already familiar\u2014and this is perhaps why the earliest films documented events in brief segments but didn\u2019t tell stories. During this \u201cnovelty period\u201d of cinema, audiences were more interested by the phenomenon of the film projector itself, so vaudeville halls advertised the kind of projector they were using (for example \u201cThe Vitascope\u2014Edison\u2019s Latest Marvel\u201d) (Balcanasu, et. al.), rather than the names of the films (Britannica Online). By the close of the 19th century, as public excitement over the moving picture\u2019s novelty gradually wore off, filmmakers were also beginning to experiment with film\u2019s possibilities as a medium in itself (not simply, as it had been regarded up until then, as a tool for documentation, analogous to the camera or the phonograph). Technical innovations allowed filmmakers like Parisian cinema owner Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s to experiment with special effects that produced seemingly magical transformations on screen: flowers turned into women, people disappeared with puffs of smoke, a man appeared where a woman had just been standing, and other similar tricks (Robinson). Not only did M\u00e9li\u00e8s, a former magician, invent the \u201ctrick film,\u201d which producers in England and the United States began to imitate, but he was also the one to transform cinema into the narrative medium it is today. Whereas before, filmmakers had only ever created single-shot films that lasted a minute or less, M\u00e9li\u00e8s began joining these short films together to create stories. His 30-scene Trip to the Moon (1902), a film based on a Jules Verne novel, may have been the most widely seen production in cinema\u2019s first decade (Robinson). However, M\u00e9li\u00e8s never developed his technique beyond treating the narrative film as a staged theatrical performance; his camera, representing the vantage point of an audience facing a stage, never moved during the filming of a scene. In 1912, M\u00e9li\u00e8s released his last commercially successful production, The Conquest of the Pole, and from then on, he lost audiences to filmmakers who were experimenting with more sophisticated techniques (Encyclopedia of Communication and Information).\n\nThe Nickelodeon Craze (1904\u20131908) One of these innovative filmmakers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist and engineer for the Edison Company. Porter\u2019s 12-minute film, The Great Train Robbery (1903), broke with the stagelike compositions of M\u00e9li\u00e8s-style films through its use of editing, camera pans, rear projections, and diagonally composed shots that produced a continuity of action. Not only did The Great Train Robbery establish the realistic narrative as a standard in cinema, it was also the first major box-office hit. Its success paved the way for the growth of the film industry, as investors, recognizing the motion picture\u2019s great moneymaking potential, began opening the first permanent film theaters around the country. Known as nickelodeons because of their 5 cent admission charge, these early motion picture theaters, often housed in converted storefronts, were especially popular among the working class of the time, who couldn\u2019t afford live theater. Between 1904 and 1908, around 9,000 nickelodeons appeared in the United States. It was the nickelodeon\u2019s popularity that established film as a mass entertainment medium (Dictionary of American History).\n\nThe \u201cBiz\u201d: The Motion Picture Industry Emerges As the demand for motion pictures grew, production companies were created to meet it. At the peak of nickelodeon popularity in 1910 (Britannica Online), there were 20 or so major motion picture companies in the United States. However, heated disputes often broke out among these companies over patent rights and industry control, leading even the most powerful among them to fear fragmentation that would loosen their hold on the market (Fielding, 1967). Because of these concerns, the 10 leading companies\u2014including Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, and others\u2014formed the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC) in 1908. The MPPC was a trade group that pooled the most significant motion picture patents and established an exclusive contract between these companies and the Eastman Kodak Company as a supplier of film stock. Also known as the Trust, the MPPC\u2019s goal was to standardize the industry and shut out competition through monopolistic control. Under the Trust\u2019s licensing system, only certain licensed companies could participate in the exchange, distribution, and production of film at different levels of the industry\u2014a shut-out tactic that eventually backfired, leading the excluded, independent distributors to organize in opposition to the Trust (Britannica Online). The Rise of the Feature In these early years, theaters were still running single-reel films, which came at a standard length of 1,000 feet, allowing for about 16 minutes of playing time. However, companies began to import multiple-reel films from European producers around 1907, and the format gained popular acceptance in the United States in 1912 with Louis Mercanton\u2019s highly successful Queen Elizabeth, a three-and-a-half reel \u201cfeature,\u201d starring the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. As exhibitors began to show more features\u2014as the multiple-reel film came to be called\u2014they discovered a number of advantages over the single-reel short. For one thing, audiences saw these longer films as special events and were willing to pay more for admission, and because of the popularity of the feature narratives, features generally experienced longer runs in theaters than their single-reel predecessors (Motion Pictures). Additionally, the feature film gained popularity among the middle classes, who saw its length as analogous to the more \u201crespectable\u201d entertainment of live theater (Motion Pictures). Following the example of the French film d\u2019art, U.S. feature producers often took their material from sources that would appeal to a wealthier and better educated audience, such as histories, literature, and stage productions (Robinson). As it turns out, the feature film was one factor that brought about the eventual downfall of the MPPC. The inflexible structuring of the Trust\u2019s exhibition and distribution system made the organization resistant to change. When movie studio, and Trust member, Vitagraph began to release features like A Tale of Two Cities (1911) and Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1910), the Trust forced it to exhibit the films serially in single-reel showings to keep with industry standards. The MPPC also underestimated the appeal of the star system, a trend that began when producers chose famous stage actors like Mary Pickford and James O\u2019Neill to play the leading roles in their productions and to grace their advertising posters (Robinson). Because of the MPPC\u2019s inflexibility, independent companies were the only ones able to capitalize on two important trends that were to become film\u2019s future: single-reel features and star power. Today, few people would recognize names like Vitagraph or Biograph, but the independents that outlasted them\u2014Universal, Goldwyn (which would later merge with Metro and Mayer), Fox (later 20th Century Fox), and Paramount (the later version of the Lasky Corporation)\u2014have become household names. Hollywood As moviegoing increased in popularity among the middle class, and as the feature films began keeping audiences in their seats for longer periods of time, exhibitors found a need to create more comfortable and richly decorated theater spaces to attract their audiences. These \u201cdream palaces,\u201d so called because of their often lavish embellishments of marble, brass, guilding, and cut glass, not only came to replace the nickelodeon theater, but also created the demand that would lead to the Hollywood studio system. Some producers realized that the growing demand for new work could only be met if the films were produced on a regular, year-round system. However, this was impractical with the current system that often relied on outdoor filming and was predominately based in Chicago and New York\u2014two cities whose weather conditions prevented outdoor filming for a significant portion of the year. Different companies attempted filming in warmer locations such as Florida, Texas, and Cuba, but the place where producers eventually found the most success was a small, industrial suburb of Los Angeles called Hollywood. Hollywood proved to be an ideal location for a number of reasons. Not only was the climate temperate and sunny year-round, but land was plentiful and cheap, and the location allowed close access to a number of diverse topographies: mountains, lakes, desert, coasts, and forests. By 1915, more than 60 percent of U.S. film production was centered in Hollywood (Britannica Online). The Art of Silent Film While the development of narrative film was largely driven by commercial factors, it is also important to acknowledge the role of individual artists who turned it into a medium of personal expression. The motion picture of the silent era was generally simplistic in nature; acted in overly animated movements to engage the eye; and accompanied by live music, played by musicians in the theater, and written titles to create a mood and to narrate a story. Within the confines of this medium, one filmmaker in particular emerged to transform the silent film into an art and to unlock its potential as a medium of serious expression and persuasion. D. W. Griffith, who entered the film industry as an actor in 1907, quickly moved to a directing role in which he worked closely with his camera crew to experiment with shots, angles, and editing techniques that could heighten the emotional intensity of his scenes. He found that by practicing parallel editing, in which a film alternates between two or more scenes of action, he could create an illusion of simultaneity. He could then heighten the tension of the film\u2019s drama by alternating between cuts more and more rapidly until the scenes of action converged. Griffith used this technique to great effect in his controversial film The Birth of a Nation, which will be discussed in greater detail later on in this chapter. Other techniques that Griffith employed to new effect included panning shots, through which he was able to establish a sense of scene and to engage his audience more fully in the experience of the film, and tracking shots, or shots that traveled with the movement of a scene (Motion Pictures), which allowed the audience\u2014through the eye of the camera\u2014to participate in the film\u2019s action. MPAA: Combating Censorship As film became an increasingly lucrative U.S. industry, prominent industry figures like D. W. Griffith, slapstick comedian/director Charlie Chaplin, and actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks grew extremely wealthy and influential. Public attitudes toward stars and toward some stars\u2019 extravagant lifestyles were divided, much as they are today: On the one hand, these celebrities were idolized and imitated in popular culture, yet at the same time, they were criticized for representing a threat, on and off screen, to traditional morals and social order. And much as it does today, the news media liked to sensationalize the lives of celebrities to sell stories. Comedian Roscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle, who worked alongside future icons Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, was at the center of one of the biggest scandals of the silent era. When Arbuckle hosted a marathon party over Labor Day weekend in 1921, one of his guests, model Virginia Rapp, was rushed to the hospital, where she later died. Reports of a drunken orgy, rape, and murder surfaced. Following World War I, the United States was in the middle of significant social reforms, such as Prohibition. Many feared that movies and their stars could threaten the moral order of the country. Because of the nature of the crime and the celebrity involved, these fears became inexplicably tied to the Artbuckle case (Motion Pictures). Even though autopsy reports ruled that Rapp had died from causes for which Arbuckle could not be blamed, the comedian was tried (and acquitted) for manslaughter, and his career was ruined. The Arbuckle affair and a series of other scandals only increased public fears about Hollywood\u2019s impact. In response to this perceived threat, state and local governments increasingly tried to censor the content of films that depicted crime, violence, and sexually explicit material. Deciding that they needed to protect themselves from government censorship and to foster a more favorable public image, the major Hollywood studios organized in 1922 to form an association they called the Motion Picture Producers and Distributers of America (later renamed the Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA). Among other things, the MPAA instituted a code of self-censorship for the motion picture industry. Today, the MPAA operates by a voluntary rating system, which means producers can voluntarily submit a film for review, which is designed to alert viewers to the age-appropriateness of a film, while still protecting the filmmakers\u2019 artistic freedom (Motion Picture Association of America).\n\nSilent Film\u2019s Demise In 1925, Warner Bros. was just a small Hollywood studio looking for opportunities to expand. When representatives from Western Electric offered to sell the studio the rights to a new technology they called Vitaphone, a sound-on-disc system that had failed to capture the interest of any of the industry giants, Warner Bros. executives took a chance, predicting that the novelty of talking films might be a way to make a quick, short-term profit. Little did they anticipate that their gamble would not only establish them as a major Hollywood presence but also change the industry forever. The pairing of sound with motion pictures was nothing new in itself. Edison, after all, had commissioned the kinetoscope to create a visual accompaniment to the phonograph, and many early theaters had orchestra pits to provide musical accompaniment to their films. Even the smaller picture houses with lower budgets almost always had an organ or piano. When Warner Bros. purchased Vitaphone technology, it planned to use it to provide prerecorded orchestral accompaniment for its films, thereby increasing their marketability to the smaller theaters that didn\u2019t have their own orchestra pits (Gochenour, 2000). In 1926, Warner debuted the system with the release of Don Juan, a costume drama accompanied by a recording of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra; the public responded enthusiastically (Motion Pictures). By 1927, after a $3 million campaign, Warner Bros. had wired more than 150 theaters in the United States, and it released its second sound film, The Jazz Singer, in which the actor Al Jolson improvised a few lines of synchronized dialogue and sang six songs. The film was a major breakthrough. Audiences, hearing an actor speak on screen for the first time, were enchanted (Gochenour). While radio, a new and popular entertainment, had been drawing audiences away from the picture houses for some time, with the birth of the \u201ctalkie,\u201d or talking film, audiences once again returned to the cinema in large numbers, lured by the promise of seeing and hearing their idols perform (Higham, 1973). By 1929, three-fourths of Hollywood films had some form of sound accompaniment, and by 1930, the silent film was a thing of the past (Gochenour).\n\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Think We\u2019re in Kansas Anymore\u201d: Film Goes Technicolor Although the techniques of tinting and hand painting had been available methods for adding color to films for some time (Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, for instance, employed a crew to hand-paint many of his films), neither method ever caught on. The hand-painting technique became impractical with the advent of mass-produced film, and the tinting process, which filmmakers discovered would create an interference with the transmission of sound in films, was abandoned with the rise of the talkie. However, in 1922, Herbert Kalmus\u2019s Technicolor company introduced a dye-transfer technique that allowed it to produce a full-length film, The Toll of the Sea, in two primary colors (Gale Virtual Reference Library). However, because only two colors were used, the appearance of The Toll of the Sea (1922), The Ten Commandments (1923), and other early Technicolor films was not very lifelike. By 1932, Technicolor had designed a three-color system with more realistic results, and for the next 25 years, all color films were produced with this improved system. Disney\u2019s Three Little Pigs (1933) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1936) and films with live actors, like MGM\u2019s The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Gone With the Wind (1939), experienced early success using Technicolor\u2019s three-color method. Despite the success of certain color films in the 1930s, Hollywood, like the rest of the United States, was feeling the impact of the Great Depression, and the expenses of special cameras, crews, and Technicolor lab processing made color films impractical for studios trying to cut costs. Therefore, it wasn\u2019t until the end of the 1940s that Technicolor would largely displace the black-and-white film (Motion Pictures in Color).\n\nRise and Fall of the Hollywood Studio The spike in theater attendance that followed the introduction of talking films changed the economic structure of the motion picture industry, bringing about some of the largest mergers in industry history. By 1930, eight studios produced 95 percent of all American films, and they continued to experience growth even during the Depression. The five most influential of these studios\u2014Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, RKO, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount\u2014were vertically integrated; that is, they controlled every part of the system as it related to their films, from the production to release, distribution, and even viewing. Because they owned theater chains worldwide, these studios controlled which movies exhibitors ran, and because they \u201cowned\u201d a stock of directors, actors, writers, and technical assistants by contract, each studio produced films of a particular character. The late 1930s and early 1940s are sometimes known as the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of cinema, a time of unparalleled success for the movie industry; by 1939, film was the 11th-largest industry in the United States, and during World War II, when the U.S. economy was once again flourishing, two-thirds of Americans were attending the theater at least once a week (Britannica Online). Some of the most acclaimed movies in history were released during this period, including Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath. However, postwar inflation, a temporary loss of key foreign markets, the advent of the television, and other factors combined to bring that rapid growth to an end. In 1948, the case of the United States v. Paramount Pictures\u2014mandating competition and forcing the studios to relinquish control over theater chains\u2014dealt the final devastating blow from which the studio system would never recover. Control of the major studios reverted to Wall Street, where the studios were eventually absorbed by multinational corporations, and the powerful studio heads lost the influence they had held for nearly 30 years (Baers, 2000).\n\nPost\u2013World War II: Television Presents a Threat While economic factors and antitrust legislation played key roles in the decline of the studio system, perhaps the most important factor in that decline was the advent of the television. Given the opportunity to watch \u201cmovies\u201d from the comfort of their own homes, the millions of Americans who owned a television by the early 1950s were attending the cinema far less regularly than they had only several years earlier (Motion Pictures). In an attempt to win back diminishing audiences, studios did their best to exploit the greatest advantages film held over television. For one thing, television broadcasting in the 1950s was all in black and white, whereas the film industry had the advantage of color. While producing a color film was still an expensive undertaking in the late 1940s, a couple of changes occurred in the industry in the early 1950s to make color not only more affordable, but more realistic in its appearance. In 1950, as the result of antitrust legislation, Technicolor lost its monopoly on the color film industry, allowing other providers to offer more competitive pricing on filming and processing services. At the same time, Kodak came out with a multilayer film stock that made it possible to use more affordable cameras and to produce a higher quality image. Kodak\u2019s Eastmancolor option was an integral component in converting the industry to color. In the late 1940s, only 12 percent of features were in color; however, by 1954 (after the release of Kodak Eastmancolor) more than 50 percent of movies were in color (Britannica Online). Another clear advantage on which filmmakers tried to capitalize was the sheer size of the cinema experience. With the release of the epic biblical film The Robe in 1953, 20th Century Fox introduced the method that would soon be adopted by nearly every studio in Hollywood: a technology that allowed filmmakers to squeeze a wide-angle image onto conventional 35-mm film stock, thereby increasing the aspect ratio (the ratio of a screen\u2019s width to its height) of their images. This wide-screen format increased the immersive quality of the theater experience. Nonetheless, even with these advancements, movie attendance never again reached the record numbers it experienced in 1946, at the peak of the Golden Age of Hollywood (Britannica Online). Mass Entertainment, Mass Paranoia: HUAC and the Hollywood Blacklist The Cold War with the Soviet Union began in 1947, and with it came the widespread fear of communism, not only from the outside, but equally from within. To undermine this perceived threat, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) commenced investigations to locate communist sympathizers in America who were suspected of conducting espionage for the Soviet Union. In the highly conservative and paranoid atmosphere of the time, Hollywood, the source of a mass-cultural medium, came under fire in response to fears that subversive, communist messages were being embedded in films. In November 1947, more than 100 people in the movie business were called to testify before the HUAC about their and their colleagues\u2019 involvement with communist affairs. Of those investigated, 10 in particular refused to cooperate with the committee\u2019s questions. These 10, later known as the Hollywood Ten, were fired from their jobs and sentenced to serve up to a year in prison. The studios, already slipping in influence and profit, were eager to cooperate in order to save themselves, and a number of producers signed an agreement stating that no communists would work in Hollywood. The hearings, which recommenced in 1951 with the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s influence, turned into a kind of witch hunt as witnesses were asked to testify against their associates, and a blacklist of suspected communists evolved. Over 324 individuals lost their jobs in the film industry as a result of blacklisting (the denial of work in a certain field or industry) and HUAC investigations (Georgakas, 2004; Mills, 2007; Dressler, et. al., 2005).\n\nDown With the Establishment: Youth Culture of the 1960s and 1970s Movies of the late 1960s began attracting a younger demographic, as a growing number of young people were drawn in by films like Sam Peckinpah\u2019s The Wild Bunch (1969), Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Arthur Penn\u2019s Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and Dennis Hopper\u2019s Easy Rider (1969)\u2014all revolutionary in their genres\u2014that displayed a sentiment of unrest toward conventional social orders and included some of the earliest instances of realistic and brutal violence in film. These four films in particular grossed so much money at the box offices that producers began churning out low-budget copycats to draw in a new, profitable market (Motion Pictures). While this led to a rise in youth-culture films, few of them saw great success. However, the new liberal attitudes toward depictions of sex and violence in these films represented a sea of change in the movie industry that manifested in many movies of the 1970s, including Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Godfather (1972), William Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist (1973), and Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws (1975), all three of which saw great financial success (Britannica Online; Belton, 1994).\n\nBlockbusters, Knockoffs, and Sequels In the 1970s, with the rise of work by Coppola, Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, and others, a new breed of director emerged. These directors were young and film-school educated, and they contributed a sense of professionalism, sophistication, and technical mastery to their work, leading to a wave of blockbuster productions, including Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Star Wars (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982). The computer-generated special effects that were available at this time also contributed to the success of a number of large-budget productions. In response to these and several earlier blockbusters, movie production and marketing techniques also began to shift, with studios investing more money in fewer films in the hopes of producing more big successes. For the first time, the hefty sums producers and distributers invested didn\u2019t go to production costs alone; distributers were discovering the benefits of TV and radio advertising and finding that doubling their advertising costs could increase profits as much as three or four times over. With the opening of Jaws, one of the five top-grossing films of the decade (and the highest grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars in 1977), Hollywood embraced the wide-release method of movie distribution, abandoning the release methods of earlier decades, in which a film would debut in only a handful of select theaters in major cities before it became gradually available to mass audiences. Jaws was released in 600 theaters simultaneously, and the big-budget films that followed came out in anywhere from 800 to 2,000 theaters nationwide on their opening weekends (Belton; Hanson & Garcia-Myers, 2000). The major Hollywood studios of the late 1970s and early 1980s, now run by international corporations, tended to favor the conservative gamble of the tried and true, and as a result, the period saw an unprecedented number of high-budget sequels\u2014as in the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Godfather films\u2014as well as imitations and adaptations of earlier successful material, such as the plethora of \u201cslasher\u201d films that followed the success of the 1979 thriller Halloween. Additionally, corporations sought revenue sources beyond the movie theater, looking to the video and cable releases of their films. Introduced in 1975, the VCR became nearly ubiquitous in American homes by 1998 with 88.9 million households owning the appliance (Rosen & Meier, 2000). Cable television\u2019s growth was slower, but ownership of VCRs gave people a new reason to subscribe, and cable subsequently expanded as well (Rogers). And the newly introduced concept of film-based merchandise (toys, games, books, etc.) allowed companies to increase profits even more.\n\nThe 1990s and Beyond The 1990s saw the rise of two divergent strands of cinema: the technically spectacular blockbuster with special, computer-generated effects and the independent, low-budget film. The capabilities of special effects were enhanced when studios began manipulating film digitally. Early examples of this technology can be seen in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and Jurassic Park (1993). Films with an epic scope\u2014Independence Day (1996), Titanic (1997), and The Matrix (1999)\u2014also employed a range of computer-animation techniques and special effects to wow audiences and to draw more viewers to the big screen. Toy Story (1995), the first fully computer-animated film, and those that came after it, such as Antz (1998), A Bug\u2019s Life (1998), and Toy Story 2 (1999), displayed the improved capabilities of computer-generated animation (Sedman, 2000). At the same time, independent directors and producers, such as the Coen brothers and Spike Jonze, experienced an increased popularity, often for lower-budget films that audiences were more likely to watch on video at home (Britannica Online). A prime example of this is the 1996 Academy Awards program, when independent films dominated the Best Picture category. Only one movie from a big film studio was nominated\u2014Jerry Maguire\u2014while the rest were independent films. The growth of both independent movies and special-effects-laden blockbusters continues to the present day. You will read more about current issues and trends and the future of the movie industry later on in this chapter. Key Takeaways The concept of the motion picture was first introduced to a mass audience through Thomas Edison\u2019s kinetoscope in 1891. However, it wasn\u2019t until the Lumi\u00e8re brothers released the cin\u00e9matographe in 1895 that motion pictures were projected for audience viewing. In the United States, film established itself as a popular form of entertainment with the nickelodeon theater in the 1910s.\n\nThe release of The Jazz Singer in 1927 marked the birth of the talking film, and by 1930 silent film was a thing of the past. Technicolor emerged for film around the same time and found early success with movies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. However, people would continue to make films in black and white until the late 1950s.\n\nBy 1915 most of the major film studios had moved to Hollywood. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, these major studios controlled every aspect of the movie industry, and the films they produced drew crowds to theaters in numbers that have still not been surpassed. After World War II, the studio system declined as a result of antitrust legislation that took power away from studios and of the invention of the television.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, there was a rise in films\u2014including Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Easy Rider\u2014that celebrated the emerging youth culture and a rejection of the conservatism of the previous decades. This also led to looser attitudes toward depictions of sexuality and violence in film. The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of the blockbuster, with films like Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The Godfather.\n\nThe adoption of the VCR by most households in the 1980s reduced audiences at movie theaters but opened a new mass market of home movie viewers. Improvements in computer animation led to more special effects in film during the 1990s with movies like The Matrix, Jurassic Park, and the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story.

By the early 1920's, over a dozen such magazines crowded the news-stands with names like Cinema Art, Film Fun, Motion Picture Journal, Movie Weekly, Picture Play, and Screenland.\n\n1912 Carl Laemmle merged his IMP (the Independent Moving Pictures Company) with other independent production studios to found the Universal Motion Picture (or Film) Manufacturing Company, which was to become the first major, long-lasting Hollywood studio. Significantly, the independents made longer 'feature' films than the short one-reelers produced by the MPPC.\n\n1912 Jesse Lasky formed the Jesse L.

It was the first full-length drama shown in the United States, and the third film to be shown in its entirety, in its US premiere in July. New York society elites attended the premiere of the film, helping to extend the film's reach (and the entire medium of film) to the upper classes and bring respectability to the new medium of film.\n\n1912 By 1912, fifteen film companies were operating in Hollywood.\n\n1912 It has been claimed that London Evening News correspondent W. G. Faulkner, who began a regular 'kinema' weekly column on January 17, 1912, was the UK's first film critic.\n\n1912 The first American serial film was the Edison Company's melodrama What Happened to Mary? (1912) (12 episodes, each consisting of one-reel), starring actress Mary Fuller. A print version of the storyline was concurrently published in McClure's Ladies' World magazine.\n\n1912 H. A. Spanuth's five-reel production of Oliver Twist (1912) was released - it was the first US-produced film to last over an hour (the definition of a feature film), and to be shown in its entirety. Only four of its five reels have survived. In the same year, director Thomas Bentley's Oliver Twist (1912, UK) was the first British feature-length photoplay.\n\n1912 A feature-length Kinemacolor silent British documentary With Our King and Queen through India (1912, UK) (aka The Delhi Durbar or The Durbar at Delhi), originally 126 minutes in length (it was composed of a set of films) and the longest film-show to date, was the world's first color blockbuster. Only about 10 minutes of the original film survived. The film recorded the 1911 Delhi Durbar - a spectacular ceremony held in Delhi, India to recognize the newly-crowned King George V as Emperor of India.\n\n1912 The dramatic romance Lorna Doone (1912, UK) was the first British five-reel feature.\n\n1912 The five-reel Richard III (1912), starring Frederick Warde, was thought to be the earliest surviving complete feature film made in the US.\n\n1912 The process of panchromatic film was first made or devised in 1912 by French producer Leon Gaumont. [Kodak Eastman, the leading supplier of film stock, introduced panchromatic film in September 1913 for the US market.] Panchromatic film was a type of black and white film sensitive to light of all colors (including red), thereby making the picture more realistic. The first feature film made entirely with the new emulsion (panchromatic negative film stock) was The Headless Horseman (1922).\n\n1912 Female director Alice Guy-Blache's short film A Fool and His Money (1912), made by her Solax Studios in Fort Lee, NJ, was notable as the first film ever made with a cast comprised only of African-American performers.\n\n1912 D irector \u00c9tienne Arnaud's Saved From the Titanic (1912), a one reel, 10 minute film (a \"lost film\" destroyed in an Eclair American studio fire in 1914), was released (it premiered on May 14, 1912, a month to the day after the ship collided with the iceberg) - it was the first film adaptation about the disaster. The film was based upon actress, star and co-screenwriter Dorothy Gibson's true story of her own survival. Gibson, who starred in the film as Miss Dorothy, was one of the survivors who was rescued from the ship, and reportedly wore the same clothes from the rescue in the film. It was notable that Kinemacolor (the first attempt by the film industry to colorize film) was used in two scenes. The rare and restored German film Night and Ice (aka In Nacht und Eis) by actor/writer/director Mime Misu was one of the earliest disaster films. This film was the second of many feature films about the doomed ship that sank in 1912 on its maiden voyage, after striking an iceberg. This film was made and released a few months after the RMS Titanic's actual sinking! It was of epic length (35 minutes) in comparison to other films of the time.\n\n1912 D. W. Griffith's The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912) was released - possibly the first gangster or organized crime film.\n\n1912 Thomas Ince pioneered the role of film producer by devising standard production budgeting formulas and introducing a detailed shooting script.\n\n1912 Kalmus formed the Technicolor Company to market early versions of the color process.\n\n1912 Director Enrico Guazzoni's overblown but successful two-hour spectacle Quo Vadis? (1912) was released - one of the first films with over two hours running time. It is often considered the first successful feature-length motion picture. Italian epics would briefly dominate the international film market.\n\n1912 The first Indian feature film opened in Bombay, India -- the 12-minute silent Pundalik (1912), a B/W short about the Hindu saint Pundalik.\n\n1912 One of the screen's earliest romantic pairs was Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bane, who first co-starred in Jack Conway's short crime drama House of Pride (1912). They were to appear in dozens of films together (for Essanay and Metro), and were considered as the first popular romantic team in US films. [Future romantic pairings included Greta Garbo with leading man John Gilbert, and Ronald Colman with Vilma Banky.] In 1918, Bushman's scandalous extra-marital affair with his long-time co-star Bayne became public, and after divorcing his older wife, Bushman secretly married Bayne (the studio feared they would lose popularity).\n\n1912 Canadian writer and actor Mack Sennett (the \"King of Comedy\") left Biograph and formed the Keystone Film Company (and Studio) in Edendale (Echo Park/Glendale), a suburb of Los Angeles. The first Mack Sennett Keystone production was Cohen Collects a Debt (1912). The first Keystone Kop film from the studio, Hoffmeyer's Legacy (1912), was released in late 1912. Nearly every major comic performer in America worked at Keystone during this time, including Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand and Charlie Chaplin, in mostly slapstick comedy films. The studio was noted for many film milestones or landmarks: Chaplin's first film, the first feature-length comedy, etc.\n\n1912 The first Keystone Kops comedy released by Keystone Studios, featuring a group to be known as the Keystone Kops, was director Mack Sennett's Hoffmeyer's Legacy (1912), a lost film. It was the first of twelve Keystone Kops films. The first real (or seminal) Keystone Kops film was released a year later, The Bangville Police (1913)."}, {"url": "https://fampeople.com/cat-ernest-miller", "page_content": "Ernest Miller : biography\n\nErnest Clifford Miller (born January 14, 1964) is an American actor and former professional wrestler who worked for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) better known by his ring name, Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career\n\nMiller graduated from Gordon High School in Decatur, Georgia, playing on the football team as a linebacker. He then went to Savannah State University in Savannah, Georgia studying electrical engineering and playing football as an All-American linebacker.\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1997-2001)\n\nAfter a career as a karate tournament competitor, Miller was brought into WCW by Eric Bischoff. Miller was a karate instructor and was teaching Bischoff\u2019s son Garett, when Bischoff asked him to become a wrestler.\n\nMiller made his WCW debut when he saved Glacier from a two-on-one attack by Wrath and Mortis at the WCW Slamboree 1997 PPV. Initially thought as just a fan who had jumped the railing, the WCW commentators then realized that this was no ordinary man and he was in fact the three-time karate champion Ernest Miller. Glacier and Ernest Miller quickly became tag team partners in their feud with Mortis and Wrath. He soon left Glacier and became a villain with Sonny Onoo as his manager (although Glacier actually turned on Miller first). It was during this time that Miller\u2019s popularity heightened.\n\nAs a villain, he often gloated that he could beat anybody within two minutes and managed to do so on several occasions using his signature springboard kick, The Feliner. It was also around this time that Ernest Miller began wearing ruby slippers in the ring and dancing in a James Brown-esque fashion to celebrate his victories. This led to a pay-per-view \"dance-off\" between Miller and James Brown, who had been brought in specially. Miller even went as far promoting his own instructional, karate home video with a pseudo infomercial. This served as a comedic parody to Billy Blanks\u2019 Tae Bo exercise videos which were quite popular at the time.\n\nWhile Miller was most often a villain, he eventually turned into a fan favorite and became WCW Commissioner in 2000. He began the angle as a villain but eventually turned into a fan favorite due to the high fan reaction he was getting whenever he entered an arena. He was feuding with Ric Flair\u2019s Magnificent Seven stable during the purchase of WCW by Vince McMahon in March 2001.\n\nMiller appeared at some World Wrestling All-Stars shows before going to the WWE where he would have a somewhat brief career.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2002-2004)\n\nUnder his Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller ring name and gimmick, he made his dark match debut for World Wrestling Entertainment on October 28, 2002. He then served as an announcer for Velocity. After his run on Velocity, he became an active wrestler on the main roster, competing for the SmackDown brand.\n\nMiller appeared in the 2004 Royal Rumble match, making his entrance (along with manager Lamont) while the other two people in the ring, Chris Benoit and Randy Orton, were knocked down. Miller and Lamont proceeded to dance to his theme music, not bothering to capitalize on the advantage he\u2019d been given. When Benoit and Orton got back up, both men quickly tossed him from the ring. During his time, his catchphrase, \"somebody call my momma\" (which was also used in WCW), started to be used in WWE. This phrase also appeared in the lyrics to his theme song, which he would dance to. Miller then competed in a 15-man battle royal on SmackDown! to earn a shot at the WWE Championship against then Champion Brock Lesnar at No Way Out, but was once again thrown out during his theme song. Following this, he started a short-lived feud with Tajiri after Tajiri attacked Lamont with his trademark Buzzsaw Kick. After the feud ended, Miller was released from WWE on February 10, 2004.\n\nIn 2012 his old theme song was then recycled for the entrance of Brodus Clay\u2019s new \"Funkasaurus\" gimmick. Brodus Clay also started to use his phrase, \u2018Somebody better call my momma\u2019. Miller had this to say about the WWE and Brodus Clay recycling his music and phrase to \u201cI haven\u2019t watched it. I\u2019ve nothing against him, he\u2019s working for a company. I feel like someone told him to do it. He\u2019s trying to make it work. Many fans have said he\u2019s not as good as me and it made me popular without being on the TV show. It\u2019s a little more than dancing. I was an athlete, I could wrestle. WWE had so many people afraid of their jobs, they never let me develop into what it could be. People like this guy out there dancing and saying call my momma, but he\u2019s not the original. I could\u2019ve made it work so in other words, I\u2019m a little pissed off about it.\u201d\n\nOutside pro wrestling\n\nMiller had a significant role in the Academy Award nominated film The Wrestler as The Ayatollah, in-ring nemesis of Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson played by Mickey Rourke. He also played Earnie Shavers opposite Michael Jai White in the 2008 Chinese television series The Legend of Bruce Lee. Miller was also in the 2009 film Blood and Bone. In a January 2009 interview, Miller mentioned that he has been cast as George Foreman in an upcoming HBO biopic.\n\nIn wrestling\n\nFinishing moves Feliner (Jumping corkscrew roundhouse kick) Superkick\n\n\n\nSignature moves Cat\u2019s Cradle (Outside cradle) Knife-edged chop High knee strike Multiple kick variations Bicycle Drop Enzuigiri Roundhouse, sometimes from the top rope Shoot Spinning sole Scoop slam Springboard stomp onto a standing opponent\u2019s shoulder\n\n\n\nManagers Sonny Onoo Mr. Jones Miss Jones Lamont\n\n\n\nEntrance themes World Wrestling Entertainment \"Somebody Call My Momma\" by Jim Johnston (January 25, 2004 \u2013 February 10, 2004)\n\n\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\nMartial arts\n\nKarate World Karate Champion (3 times)\n\n\n\nProfessional wrestling"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/852854", "page_content": "cite web |url= http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosM/miller_ernest_01jan10-can.html|title=The early days of WCW star Ernest Miller|publisher=SLAM!

On July 2, 1961, he took his life with a shotgun at his house in Ketchum.\n\nErnest Hemingway was born in a suburb of Chicago . He was educated in the public schools and began to write in high school, where he was active and outstanding. The parts of his boyhood that mattered most to him were summers spent with his family on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey , Michigan .\n\nErnest Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, had a great impact on other writers through his deceptively simple, stripped-down prose, full of unspoken implication, and his tough but vulnerable masculinity, which created a myth that imprisoned the author and haunted the World War II generation.\n\nErnest Hemingway, in full Ernest Miller Hemingway, (born July 21, 1899, Cicero [now in Oak Park], Illinois, U.S.\u2014died July 2, 1961, Ketchum, Idaho), American novelist and short-story writer, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He was noted both for the intense masculinity of his writing and for his adventurous and widely publicized life. His succinct and lucid prose style exerted a powerful influence on American and British fiction in the 20th century.\n\nThe first son of Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a doctor, and Grace Hall Hemingway, Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in a suburb of Chicago. He was educated in the public schools and began to write in high school, where he was active and outstanding, but the parts of his boyhood that mattered most were summers spent with his family on Walloon Lake in upper Michigan. On graduation from high school in 1917, impatient for a less-sheltered environment, he did not enter college but went to Kansas City, where he was employed as a reporter for the Star. He was repeatedly rejected for military service because of a defective eye, but he managed to enter World War I as an ambulance driver for the American Red Cross. On July 8, 1918, not yet 19 years old, he was injured on the Austro-Italian front at Fossalta di Piave. Decorated for heroism and hospitalized in Milan, he fell in love with a Red Cross nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky, who declined to marry him. These were experiences he was never to forget.\n\nBritannica Quiz Profiles of Famous Writers\n\nAfter recuperating at home, Hemingway renewed his efforts at writing, for a while worked at odd jobs in Chicago, and sailed for France as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. Advised and encouraged by other American writers in Paris\u2014F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound\u2014he began to see his nonjournalistic work appear in print there, and in 1925 his first important book, a collection of stories called In Our Time, was published in New York City; it was originally released in Paris in 1924.\n\nIn 1926 he published The Sun Also Rises, a novel with which he scored his first solid success. A pessimistic but sparkling book, it deals with a group of aimless expatriates in France and Spain\u2014members of the postwar Lost Generation, a phrase that Hemingway scorned while making it famous. This work also introduced him to the limelight, which he both craved and resented for the rest of his life. Hemingway\u2019s The Torrents of Spring, a parody of the American writer Sherwood Anderson\u2019s book Dark Laughter, also appeared in 1926.\n\nThe writing of books occupied Hemingway for most of the postwar years. He remained based in Paris, but he traveled widely for the skiing, bullfighting, fishing, and hunting that by then had become part of his life and formed the background for much of his writing. His position as a master of short fiction had been advanced by Men Without Women in 1927 and thoroughly established with the stories in Winner Take Nothing in 1933. Among his finest stories are \u201cThe Killers,\u201d \u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\u201d and \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro.\u201d At least in the public view, however, the novel A Farewell to Arms (1929) overshadowed such works. Reaching back to his experience as a young soldier in Italy, Hemingway developed a grim but lyrical novel of great power, fusing love story with war story. While serving with the Italian ambulance service during World War I, the American lieutenant Frederic Henry falls in love with the English nurse Catherine Barkley, who tends him during his recuperation after being wounded. She becomes pregnant by him, but he must return to his post. Henry deserts during the Italians\u2019 disastrous retreat after the Battle of Caporetto, and the reunited couple flee Italy by crossing the border into Switzerland. There, however, Catherine and her baby die during childbirth, and Henry is left desolate at the loss of the great love of his life.\n\nHemingway\u2019s love of Spain and his passion for bullfighting resulted in Death in the Afternoon (1932), a learned study of a spectacle he saw more as tragic ceremony than as sport. Similarly, a safari he took in 1933\u201334 in the big-game region of Tanganyika resulted in Green Hills of Africa (1935), an account of big-game hunting. Mostly for the fishing, he purchased a house in Key West, Florida, and bought his own fishing boat. A minor novel of 1937 called To Have and Have Not is about a Caribbean desperado and is set against a background of lower-class violence and upper-class decadence in Key West during the Great Depression.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco, and he wrote a play called The Fifth Column (1938), which is set in besieged Madrid. As in many of his books, the protagonist of the play is based on the author. Following his last visit to the Spanish war, he purchased Finca Vig\u00eda (\u201cLookout Farm\u201d), an unpretentious estate outside Havana, Cuba, and went to cover another war\u2014the Japanese invasion of China.\n\nThe harvest of Hemingway\u2019s considerable experience of Spain in war and peace was the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), a substantial and impressive work that some critics consider his finest novel, in preference to A Farewell to Arms. It was also the most successful of all his books as measured in sales. Set during the Spanish Civil War, it tells of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer who is sent to join a guerrilla band behind the Nationalist lines in the Guadarrama Mountains. Most of the novel concerns Jordan\u2019s relations with the varied personalities of the band, including the girl Maria, with whom he falls in love. Through dialogue, flashbacks, and stories, Hemingway offers telling and vivid profiles of the Spanish character and unsparingly depicts the cruelty and inhumanity stirred up by the civil war. Jordan\u2019s mission is to blow up a strategic bridge near Segovia in order to aid a coming Republican attack, which he realizes is doomed to fail. In an atmosphere of impending disaster, he blows up the bridge but is wounded and makes his retreating comrades leave him behind, where he prepares a last-minute resistance to his Nationalist pursuers.\n\nAll of his life Hemingway was fascinated by war\u2014in A Farewell to Arms he focused on its pointlessness, in For Whom the Bell Tolls on the comradeship it creates\u2014and, as World War II progressed, he made his way to London as a journalist. He flew several missions with the Royal Air Force and crossed the English Channel with American troops on D-Day (June 6, 1944). Attaching himself to the 22nd Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division, he saw a good deal of action in Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge. He also participated in the liberation of Paris, and, although ostensibly a journalist, he impressed professional soldiers not only as a man of courage in battle but also as a real expert in military matters, guerrilla activities, and intelligence collection.\n\nFollowing the war in Europe, Hemingway returned to his home in Cuba and began to work seriously again. He also traveled widely, and, on a trip to Africa, he was injured in a plane crash. Soon after (in 1953), he received the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for The Old Man and the Sea (1952), a short heroic novel about an old Cuban fisherman who, after an extended struggle, hooks and boats a giant marlin only to have it eaten by voracious sharks during the long voyage home. This book, which played a role in gaining for Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, was as enthusiastically praised as his previous novel, Across the River and into the Trees (1950), the story of a professional army officer who dies while on leave in Venice, had been damned.\n\nBy 1960 Hemingway had left Cuba and settled in Ketchum, Idaho. (He expressed his belief in what he called the \u201chistorical necessity\u201d of the Cuban Revolution; his attitude toward its leader, Fidel Castro, who had taken power in 1959, varied.) He tried to lead his life and do his work as before. For a while he succeeded, but, anxiety-ridden and depressed, he was twice hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he received electroshock treatments. Two days after his return to the house in Ketchum, he took his life with a shotgun. Hemingway had been married four times: to Hadley Richardson in 1921 (divorced 1927), Pauline Pfeiffer in 1927 (divorced 1940), Martha Gellhorn in 1940 (divorced 1945), and Mary Welsh in 1946. He had fathered three sons: John Hadley Nicanor (\u201cBumby\u201d), with Hadley, born in 1923; Patrick, with Pauline, in 1928; and Gregory, also with Pauline, in 1931.\n\nHemingway left behind a substantial amount of manuscript, some of which has been published. A Moveable Feast, an entertaining memoir of his years in Paris (1921\u201326) before he was famous, was issued in 1964. Islands in the Stream, three closely related novellas growing directly out of his peacetime memories of the Caribbean island of Bimini, of Havana during World War II, and of searching for U-boats off Cuba, appeared in 1970.\n\nHemingway\u2019s characters plainly embody his own values and view of life. The main characters of The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls are young men whose strength and self-confidence nevertheless coexist with a sensitivity that leaves them deeply scarred by their wartime experiences. War was for Hemingway a potent symbol of the world, which he viewed as complex, filled with moral ambiguities, and offering almost unavoidable pain, hurt, and destruction. To survive in such a world, and perhaps emerge victorious, one must conduct oneself with honour, courage, endurance, and dignity, a set of principles known as \u201cthe Hemingway code.\u201d To behave well in the lonely, losing battle with life is to show \u201cgrace under pressure\u201d and constitutes in itself a kind of victory, a theme clearly established in The Old Man and the Sea.\n\nHemingway\u2019s prose style was probably the most widely imitated of any in the 20th century. He wished to strip his own use of language of inessentials, ridding it of all traces of verbosity, embellishment, and sentimentality. In striving to be as objective and honest as possible, Hemingway hit upon the device of describing a series of actions by using short, simple sentences from which all comment or emotional rhetoric has been eliminated. These sentences are composed largely of nouns and verbs, have few adjectives and adverbs, and rely on repetition and rhythm for much of their effect. The resulting terse, concentrated prose is concrete and unemotional yet is often resonant and capable of conveying great irony through understatement. Hemingway\u2019s use of dialogue was similarly fresh, simple, and natural-sounding.

The virile nature of his writing, which attempted to re-create the exact physical sensations he experienced in wartime, big-game hunting, and bullfighting, in fact masked an aesthetic sensibility of great delicacy.

Miller was by then a karate instructor and was teaching Bischoff's son Garett, when Bischoff asked him to become a professional wrestler.[1]\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1997-2001)\n\nEarly years (1997\u20131999)\n\nMiller made his World Championship Wrestling (WCW) debut on February 12, 1997, where he worked 3 matches that night for TV tapings. The first two matches were victories over Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker and Johnny Swinger. The last match was a lost to Glacier on WCW Worldwide which aired on April 13. He saved Glacier from a two-on-one attack by Wrath and Mortis at the 1997 Slamboree pay-per-view. Initially thought as just a fan who had jumped the railing, the WCW commentators then realized that this was no ordinary man and he was in fact the three-time karate champion Ernest Miller. Glacier and Ernest Miller quickly became tag team partners in their feud with Mortis and Wrath. After Glacier turned on Miller, Ernest left him and became a villain with Sonny Onoo as his manager. It was during this time that Miller's popularity heightened.\n\nAs a villain, Miller adopted an arrogant, Muhammad Ali-like trash-talking personality, calling himself \"The Greatest\" and gloating that he could beat anybody within two minutes, which he often did using his signature kicks. It was also around this time that Ernest began wearing ruby slippers in the ring and dancing in a James Brown-esque fashion to celebrate his victories. He would claim on Nitro that he knew the actual James Brown, leading to a pay-per-view \"dance-off\" between Miller and Brown, who had been brought in specially. Miller even went as far promoting his own instructional, karate home video with a pseudo infomercial. This served as a comedic parody to Billy Blanks' Tae Bo exercise videos which were quite popular at the time. Miller and Onoo also did comedy duo routines similar to Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan's characters from the film Rush Hour.[4]\n\nMiller then began a minor feud with Kaz Hayashi, as Onoo has been previously Hayashi's manager and had left him to manage Miller. Ernest won several matches over Hayashi with Onoo's help, and also enlisted Perry Saturn as his ally. However, Saturn suffered many losses against inferior opponents due to Miller's botched interference, so the two faced off at Starrcade, where Saturn won. Miller continued coming out and challenging the fans, the wrestlers, and anyone else to try and take him out, feuding with Scott Norton. For a time, he started coming out with the snow machine and music of Glacier, which Onoo had \"purchased\", but it was short-lived, and he soon returned to his James Brown music. In March 1999, Miller and Onoo attacked fellow martial artist Jerry Flynn, with Ernest cutting off Flynn's ponytail as a sign of disrespect. They all faced off in Uncensored in a handicap match, but Flyinn defeated them both. Miller bounced back after some time, getting a win over Scott Norton after hitting him with a crowbar. He and Norton were scheduled to wrestle in The Great American Bash, but Norton was pulled out for health problems and replaced with Horace Hogan, who Miller defeated after kicking him with a steel-tipped red dancing shoe.[3]\n\nIn June 1999, Miller had a dancing contest with Disco Inferno, who he attacked in jealously over the fans's attention. They fought in Bash at the Beach in a \"dance match\" with the stipulation that the loser could not dance anymore (though this stipulation was removed at Bash at the Beach), with Miller winning thanks to Onoo. The Cat's next opponent would be Buff Bagwell, who became famous by doing an impersonation of Miller with a bald cap and black face paint. The two met at Road Wild, but this time Onoo's help backfired when he accidentally hit the wrong man with a briefcase, making Miller lose the match. After that, the two broke up and Onoo left WCW.[3]\n\nCommissioner (2000\u20132001)\n\nMiller became a jobber for a long time, until he was chosen as Eric Bischoff's assistant. His role initially was composed of following Bischoff wherever he went and repeating whatever Bischoff said for comedic effect, but he was eventually appointed WCW Commissioner in 2000. As a commissioner, his motivations were the ratings and impressing the people in charge, and he often booked super matches for the main events. During this time, he got in a storyline where the Jung Dragons stalked him and tried to attack him, but Miller usually fended them off. In July 2000, Miller outlawed WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner's finisher, the Steiner Recliner, with the pretext of being too dangerous. Miller continued interfering in Steiner's reign, helping Mike Awesome during their fight in Bash at the Beach by disqualifying Steiner and stripping him of the title. Miller then feuded with yet another Japanese wrestler, The Great Muta, leading to a match at New Blood Rising. Although Muta used his Asian mist to blind Miller at one point, Ernest's ally Tygress interfered to hit Muta with a chair, which allowed Miller to land his finishing move for the victory.\n\nAfter this match, he started to slowly turn into a fan favorite due to the high fan reaction he was getting whenever he entered an arena, coming to a rivalry with Mike Sanders from the Natural Born Thrillers stable, who sought to be the new commissioner. Miller offered Sanders a kickboxing match for the role, something which naturally had Mike afraid, but he agreed. During the match, Miller dominated three rounds, but at the last one he was attacked by Sanders's partner Shane Douglas, who pulled him out of the ring and made him being counted out. Angry at losing the commissionership, Miller kept chasing Douglas for the next months, enlisting Miss Jones as his valet to counter Douglas' Torrie Wilson. Ernest and Douglas fought at Mayhem, where Miller won after Jones overpowered Wilson and gave Miller his old loaded red shoe, which he used to knock Shane out.\n\nMiller then became an enemy of Lance Storm, the leader of Team Canada, wrestling at Starrcade. The former karate champion had to endure many interferences from Major Gunns and Elix Skipper, but although he and Miss Jones kept them at bay, she accidentally knocked the referee out with a misguided kick, which allowed a reluctant Hacksaw Jim Duggan to attack Miller, making him lose. Right after, Team Canada turned on Duggan and beat him down, until Miller saved him. Ernest turned again to get the commissioner's spot and challenged Sanders for it, but Mike wanted none of it, bringing KroniK as mercenaries to take him down and putting the role on the line only if Miller accepted to give him Miss Jones's services. Miller and Sanders fought at Sin, where Sanders tried to hit The Cat with a chair, but Miss Jones impeded it. KroniK and Natural Born Thrillers came to finally put Ernest away, but then it was revealed that KroniK had been secretly hired by Miller, which turned them against Sanders and made Miller win the match, regaining his place as the WCW commissioner.\n\nMiller's victory was short-lived, as Lance Storm came to reclaim the commissioner role with Ric Flair and his Magnificent Seven's help. Storm managed to defeat Ernest for the job and used the commissionership to aid his Team Canada, but Miller chased him and got a match for the role at SuperBrawl Revenge, where he won with Miss Jones's aid, gaining it back. The karate champion then started a feud with Chris Kanyon, who attacked Miss Jonnes to the point to put her in the hospital. Miller even gave up his role as commissioner in order to get a shot at Kanyon, chasing him for months and even having a street fight in Jones's hospital room. Kanyon then attacked Miller's limo driver, M.I. Smooth. At Greed, Miller and Kanyon faced, with The Cat having to protect Miss Jones during the match, but he was victorious with Jones and Smooth's help. Miller and his drive feuded with Kanyon and his ally, Road Warrior Animal, but the feud never had a conclusion due to the purchase of WCW by Vince McMahon in March 2001.\n\nMiller had two years on his WCW contract; as a result, he decided to stay at home for the two years to take care of his children.[5] Miller also appeared at some World Wrestling All-Stars shows in early 2002 and independent shows before going to the WWE where he would have a somewhat brief career.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2002\u20132004)\n\nAfter WCW, he kept his Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller ring name and gimmick, he made his dark match debut for World Wrestling Entertainment on October 28, 2002. He then served as an announcer for Velocity from December 2002 until August 2003. After his run on Velocity, he became an active wrestler on the main roster, competing for the SmackDown brand.\n\nMiller appeared in the 2004 Royal Rumble match, making his entrance (along with manager Lamont) while the other two people in the ring, Chris Benoit and Randy Orton, were knocked down. Miller and Lamont proceeded to dance to his theme music, not bothering to capitalize on the advantage he'd been given. When Benoit and Orton got back up, both men quickly tossed him from the ring. During his time, his catchphrase, \"somebody call my momma\" (which was also used in WCW), started to be used in WWE. This phrase also appeared in the lyrics to his theme song, which he would dance to. Miller then competed in a 15-man Royal Rumble on SmackDown! to earn a shot at the WWE Championship against then Champion Brock Lesnar at No Way Out, but was once again thrown out during his theme song, this time by Kurt Angle. Following this, he started a short-lived feud with Tajiri after Tajiri attacked Lamont with his trademark Buzzsaw Kick. After the feud ended, Miller was released from WWE on February 10, 2004.\n\nIn 2012 his old theme song was then recycled for the entrance of Brodus Clay's new \"Funkasaurus\" gimmick. Brodus Clay also started to use his phrase, 'Somebody better call my momma'. Miller had this to say about the WWE and Brodus Clay recycling his music and phrase to Inside the Ropes Radio \u201cI haven't watched it. I\u2019ve nothing against him, he's working for a company. I feel like someone told him to do it. He's trying to make it work. Many fans have said he's not as good as me and it made me popular without being on the TV show. It's a little more than dancing. I was an athlete, I could wrestle. WWE had so many people afraid of their jobs, they never let me develop into what it could be. People like this guy out there dancing and saying call my momma, but he's not the original. I could\u2019ve made it work so in other words, I'm a little pissed off about it.\u201d[6]\n\nYears later in 2019, Miller further reflected his reasons for his WWE departure stating \"I left WWE because they said they couldn't write for me. Which I thought was a little strange because how could you not write for somebody like me? I could do so many things and Vince McMahon used to tell me that every day. Every time he'd see me he'd say that you are talented and I'm a fan and you've got so many things you can do that all we have to do is give you a mic and go. But when I got there I saw that things were a little different and they were doing some different things and they did give me an opportunity up there and I was happy and I still appreciate them giving me the opportunity to work with them at WWE\"[7] and \"it just wasn't my time. They wanted me to wrestle and I didn't understand at the time but I understand now what they were talking about. They wanted me to go and develop myself and come right back. That is what they told me. If you go and develop yourself as a wrestler go develop yourself on the Indy circuit and we will come back and get you. But I didn't know the business\".[8]\n\nLater Career (2006, 2015-2019)\n\nTwo years after his release from WWE, Miller worked a tag match on March 17, 2006, with his team losing. The event was held at Pro Wrestling Evolution in Canton, Georgia.\n\nMiller came out of retirement on November 28, 2015, at WrestleCade competing in a battle royal won by Ethan Carter III in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He continued working in the independent circuit. On October 13, 2018, Miller teamed with fellow WCW alumnus Glaicer and 79 year old Bob Armstrong in a 6 tag match in which they won for Georgia Premier Wrestling in Rome, Georgia. On December 13, 2019, Miller teamed with former WCW wrestlers; Glacier, Haku and Luther Biggs as they won an 8 tag match for Sunray Pro Wrestling in Orlando, Florida. Afterwards Miller stopped wrestling due to COVID-19.\n\nReturn to Wrestling (2022-present)\n\nMiller returned to wrestling at 58 years old. He lost to Joey Janela at Game Charger Wrestling/Black Pro Label 4 Cups Stuffed in Hoffman Estates, Illinois on September 2, 2022.\n\nImpact Wrestling (2023)\n\nMiller made an appearance on the January 19, 2023 episode of Impact! to help the new Director of Authority Santino Marella make a six-person tag match to open that show.[9]\n\nOutside professional wrestling\n\nMiller had a significant role in the Academy Award-nominated film The Wrestler[10][11] as The Ayatollah, in-ring nemesis of Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke). He played Earnie Shavers opposite Michael Jai White in the 2008 Chinese television series The Legend of Bruce Lee and appeared in the 2009 film Blood and Bone. In a January 2009 interview, Miller announced he was cast as George Foreman in an HBO biopic[11] that has yet to be produced.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Ernest-Miller", "page_content": "Ernest Clifford Miller (born January 14, 1964) is an American actor and former professional wrestler who worked for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) better known by his ring name, Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller.

By the early 1920's, over a dozen such magazines crowded the news-stands with names like Cinema Art, Film Fun, Motion Picture Journal, Movie Weekly, Picture Play, and Screenland.\n\n1912 Carl Laemmle merged his IMP (the Independent Moving Pictures Company) with other independent production studios to found the Universal Motion Picture (or Film) Manufacturing Company, which was to become the first major, long-lasting Hollywood studio. Significantly, the independents made longer 'feature' films than the short one-reelers produced by the MPPC.\n\n1912 Jesse Lasky formed the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company in partnership with his brother-in-law Samuel Goldfish (later renamed Samuel Goldwyn) and Cecil B.

It was the first full-length drama shown in the United States, and the third film to be shown in its entirety, in its US premiere in July. New York society elites attended the premiere of the film, helping to extend the film's reach (and the entire medium of film) to the upper classes and bring respectability to the new medium of film.\n\n1912 By 1912, fifteen film companies were operating in Hollywood.\n\n1912 It has been claimed that London Evening News correspondent W. G. Faulkner, who began a regular 'kinema' weekly column on January 17, 1912, was the UK's first film critic.\n\n1912 The first American serial film was the Edison Company's melodrama What Happened to Mary? (1912) (12 episodes, each consisting of one-reel), starring actress Mary Fuller. A print version of the storyline was concurrently published in McClure's Ladies' World magazine.\n\n1912 H. A. Spanuth's five-reel production of Oliver Twist (1912) was released - it was the first US-produced film to last over an hour (the definition of a feature film), and to be shown in its entirety. Only four of its five reels have survived. In the same year, director Thomas Bentley's Oliver Twist (1912, UK) was the first British feature-length photoplay.\n\n1912 A feature-length Kinemacolor silent British documentary With Our King and Queen through India (1912, UK) (aka The Delhi Durbar or The Durbar at Delhi), originally 126 minutes in length (it was composed of a set of films) and the longest film-show to date, was the world's first color blockbuster.

The film recorded the 1911 Delhi Durbar - a spectacular ceremony held in Delhi, India to recognize the newly-crowned King George V as Emperor of India.\n\n1912 The dramatic romance Lorna Doone (1912, UK) was the first British five-reel feature.\n\n1912 The five-reel Richard III (1912), starring Frederick Warde, was thought to be the earliest surviving complete feature film made in the US.\n\n1912 The process of panchromatic film was first made or devised in 1912 by French producer Leon Gaumont. [Kodak Eastman, the leading supplier of film stock, introduced panchromatic film in September 1913 for the US market.] Panchromatic film was a type of black and white film sensitive to light of all colors (including red), thereby making the picture more realistic. The first feature film made entirely with the new emulsion (panchromatic negative film stock) was The Headless Horseman (1922).\n\n1912 Female director Alice Guy-Blache's short film A Fool and His Money (1912), made by her Solax Studios in Fort Lee, NJ, was notable as the first film ever made with a cast comprised only of African-American performers.\n\n1912 D irector \u00c9tienne Arnaud's Saved From the Titanic (1912), a one reel, 10 minute film (a \"lost film\" destroyed in an Eclair American studio fire in 1914), was released (it premiered on May 14, 1912, a month to the day after the ship collided with the iceberg) - it was the first film adaptation about the disaster. The film was based upon actress, star and co-screenwriter Dorothy Gibson's true story of her own survival. Gibson, who starred in the film as Miss Dorothy, was one of the survivors who was rescued from the ship, and reportedly wore the same clothes from the rescue in the film. It was notable that Kinemacolor (the first attempt by the film industry to colorize film) was used in two scenes. The rare and restored German film Night and Ice (aka In Nacht und Eis) by actor/writer/director Mime Misu was one of the earliest disaster films. This film was the second of many feature films about the doomed ship that sank in 1912 on its maiden voyage, after striking an iceberg. This film was made and released a few months after the RMS Titanic's actual sinking! It was of epic length (35 minutes) in comparison to other films of the time.\n\n1912 D. W. Griffith's The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912) was released - possibly the first gangster or organized crime film.\n\n1912 Thomas Ince pioneered the role of film producer by devising standard production budgeting formulas and introducing a detailed shooting script.\n\n1912 Kalmus formed the Technicolor Company to market early versions of the color process.\n\n1912 Director Enrico Guazzoni's overblown but successful two-hour spectacle Quo Vadis? (1912) was released - one of the first films with over two hours running time. It is often considered the first successful feature-length motion picture. Italian epics would briefly dominate the international film market.\n\n1912 The first Indian feature film opened in Bombay, India -- the 12-minute silent Pundalik (1912), a B/W short about the Hindu saint Pundalik.\n\n1912 One of the screen's earliest romantic pairs was Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bane, who first co-starred in Jack Conway's short crime drama House of Pride (1912). They were to appear in dozens of films together (for Essanay and Metro), and were considered as the first popular romantic team in US films. [Future romantic pairings included Greta Garbo with leading man John Gilbert, and Ronald Colman with Vilma Banky.] In 1918, Bushman's scandalous extra-marital affair with his long-time co-star Bayne became public, and after divorcing his older wife, Bushman secretly married Bayne (the studio feared they would lose popularity).\n\n1912 Canadian writer and actor Mack Sennett (the \"King of Comedy\") left Biograph and formed the Keystone Film Company (and Studio) in Edendale (Echo Park/Glendale), a suburb of Los Angeles. The first Mack Sennett Keystone production was Cohen Collects a Debt (1912). The first Keystone Kop film from the studio, Hoffmeyer's Legacy (1912), was released in late 1912. Nearly every major comic performer in America worked at Keystone during this time, including Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand and Charlie Chaplin, in mostly slapstick comedy films. The studio was noted for many film milestones or landmarks: Chaplin's first film, the first feature-length comedy, etc.\n\n1912 The first Keystone Kops comedy released by Keystone Studios, featuring a group to be known as the Keystone Kops, was director Mack Sennett's Hoffmeyer's Legacy (1912), a lost film. It was the first of twelve Keystone Kops films. The first real (or seminal) Keystone Kops film was released a year later, The Bangville Police (1913)."}, {"url": "https://historycooperative.org/the-history-of-the-hollywood-movie-industry/", "page_content": "Hollywood: Perhaps no other place on earth evokes the same air of show-business magic and glamour. The legend of Hollywood began in the early 20th century and is an earmark of modern American society rich in history and innovation.\n\nThe Origin of Movies\n\nA zeotrope, by \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey\n\nThe origin of movies and motion pictures began in the late 1800\u2019s, with the invention of \u201cmotion toys\u201d designed to trick the eye into seeing an illusion of motion from a display of still frames in quick succession, such as the thaumatrope and the zoetrope.\n\nThe First Movie\n\nThe first movie ever made\n\nIn 1872, Edward Muybridge created the first movie ever made by placing twelve cameras on a racetrack and rigging the cameras to capture shots in quick sequence as a horse crossed in front of their lenses.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe first film for motion photography was invented in 1885 by George Eastman and William H. Walker, which contributed to the advance of motion photography. Shortly thereafter, the brothers Auguste and Louis Lumiere created a hand-cranked machine called the cinematographe, which could both capture pictures and project still frames in quick succession.\n\n1900s Movies\n\nThe 1900\u2019s were a time of great advancement for film and motion picture technology. Exploration into editing, backdrops, and visual flow motivated aspiring filmmakers to push into new creative territory. One of the earliest and most famous movies created during this time was The Great Train Robbery, created in 1903 by Edwin S. Porter.\n\nAround 1905, \u201cNickelodeons\u201d, or 5-cent movie theaters, began to offer an easy and inexpensive way for the public to watch movies. Nickelodeons helped the movie industry move into the 1920\u2019s by increasing the public appeal of film and generate more money for filmmakers, alongside the widespread use of theaters to screen World War I propaganda.\n\nThe end of World War I ushered the United States into a cultural boom, a new industry center was on the rise: Hollywood, the home of motion pictures in America.\n\n1910s Hollywood\n\nThe Squaw Man 1914\n\nAccording to industry myth, the first movie made in Hollywood was Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s The Squaw Man in 1914 when its director decided last-minute to shoot in Los Angeles, but In Old California, an earlier film by DW Griffith had been filmed entirely in the village of Hollywood in 1910.\n\nNotable actors of this period include Charlie Chaplin.\n\nBy 1919, \u201cHollywood\u201d had transformed into the face of American cinema and all the glamour it would come to embody.\n\n1920s Hollywood\n\nThe 1920\u2019s were when the movie industry began to truly flourish, along with the birth of the \u201cmovie star\u201d. With hundreds of movies being made each year, Hollywood was the rise of an American force.\n\nHollywood alone was considered a cultural icon set apart from the rest of Los Angeles, emphasizing leisure, luxury, and a growing \u201cparty scene\u201d.\n\nThis age also saw the rise of two coveted roles in the movie industry: the director and the star.\n\nDirectors began to receive greater recognition for using and trademarking personal styles in the creation of their films, which previously in history had not been possible due to limitations in filmmaking technology.\n\nAdditionally, movie stars began to receive greater fame and notoriety due to increases in publicity and shifts in American trends to value faces from the big screen.\n\nThe United States First Film Studio\n\nWarner Brothers Productions co-founders Sam Warner (left) and Jack Warner (right) with Joe Marks, Florence Gilbert, Art Klein, & Monty Banks\n\nThe 1920s also saw the founding of the first movie studio in the United States.\n\nOn April 4, 1923, four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner used money loaned by Harry\u2019s banker to officially incorporated their company Warner Brothers Pictures.\n\n1930s Hollywood\n\nThe Jazz Singer \u2013 The first-ever movie with sound\n\nThe 1930\u2019s was considered the Golden Age of Hollywood, with 65% of the US population attending the cinema on a weekly basis.\n\nA new era in film history began in this decade with the industry-wide movement towards sound into film, creating new genres such as action, musicals, documentaries, social statement films, comedies, westerns, and horror movies, with stars such as Laurence Olivier, Shirley Temple, and director John Ford rising to rapid fame.\n\nThe use of audio tracks in motion pictures created a new viewer dynamic and also initiated Hollywood\u2019s leverage in the upcoming World War II.\n\n1940s Hollywood\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer was the first feature-length color film produced by a Hollywood studio.\n\nThe early 1940\u2019s were a tough time for the American film industry, especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. However, production saw a rebound due to advances in technology such as special effects, better sound recording quality, and the beginning of color film use, all of which made movies more modern and appealing.\n\nLike all other American industries, the film industry responded to World War II with increased productivity, creating a new wave of wartime pictures. During the war, Hollywood was a major source of American patriotism by generating propaganda, documentaries, educational pictures, and general awareness of wartime need. The year 1946 saw an all-time high in theater attendance and total profits.\n\n1950s Hollywood\n\nMarlon Brando\u2019s role in The Wild One exemplified Hollywood\u2019s shift to edgier roles during the 1950s\n\nThe 1950\u2019s were a time of immense change in American culture and around the world. In the post-war United States, the average family grew in affluence, which created new societal trends, advances in music, and the rise of pop culture \u2013 particularly the introduction of television sets. By 1950, an estimated 10 million homes owned a television set.\n\nA shift in demographics created a change in the film industry\u2019s target market, which began creating material aimed at American youth. Instead of traditional, idealized portrayals of characters, filmmakers started creating tales of rebellion and rock n\u2019 roll.\n\nThis era saw the rise of films featuring darker plot lines and characters played by \u201cedgier\u201d stars like James Dean, Marlon Brando, Ava Gardner, and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThe appeal and convenience of television caused a major decline in movie theater attendance, which resulted in many Hollywood studios losing money. To adapt to the times, Hollywood began producing film for TV in order to make the money it was losing in movie theaters. This marked the entrance of Hollywood into the television industry.\n\n1960s Hollywood\n\nThe Sound of Music was the top-grossing film of the 1960s, pulling in over $163 million in revenue\n\nThe 1960\u2019s saw a great push for social change. Movies during this time focused on fun, fashion, rock n\u2019 roll, societal shifts like the civil rights movements, and transitions in cultural values.\n\nIt was also a time of change in the world\u2019s perception of America and its culture, largely influenced by the Vietnam War and continuous shifts in governmental power.\n\n1963 was the slowest year in film production; approximately 120 movies were released, which was fewer than any year to date since the 1920\u2019s. This decline in production was caused by lower profits due to the pull of television. Film companies instead began to make money in other areas: music records, movies made for TV, and the invention of the TV series. Additionally, the average film ticket price was lowered to only a dollar, in an attempt to draw more patrons to the cinema.\n\nBy 1970, this caused a depression in the film industry that had been developing over the past 25 years. A few studios still struggled to survive and made money in new ways, such as theme parks like Florida\u2019s Disney World. Because of financial struggles, national companies bought out many studios. The Golden Age of Hollywood was over.\n\n1970s Hollywood\n\nIn 1975, Jaws became the highest-grossing movie of all time, raking in a staggering $260 million\n\nWith the Vietnam War in full swing, the 1970\u2019s began with an essence of disenchantment and frustration within American culture. Although Hollywood had seen its lowest times, during the late 1960\u2019s, the 1970\u2019s saw a rush of creativity due to changes in restrictions on language, sex, violence, and other strong thematic content. American counterculture inspired Hollywood to take greater risks with new alternative filmmakers.\n\nLatest Entertainment Articles\n\nThe rebirth of Hollywood during the 1970\u2019s was based on making high-action and youth-oriented pictures, usually featuring new and dazzling special effects technology.\n\nHollywood\u2019s financial trouble was somewhat alleviated with the then-shocking success of movies like Jaws and Star Wars, which became the highest-grossing movies in film history (at that time).\n\nThis era also saw the advent of VHS video players, laser disc players, and films on video cassette tapes and discs, which greatly increased profits and revenue for studios. However, this new option to view movies at home once again caused a decrease in theater attendance.\n\n1980s Hollywood\n\nThe highest-grossing film of the 1980s was ET\n\nIn the 1980\u2019s, the past creativity of the film industry became homogenized and overly marketable. Designed only for audience appeal, most 1980\u2019s feature films were considered generic and few became classics. This decade is recognized as the introduction of high concept films that could be easily described in 25 words or less, which made the movies of this time more marketable, understandable, and culturally accessible.\n\nBy the end of the 1980\u2019s, it was generally recognized that films of that time were intended for audiences who sought simple entertainment, as most pictures were unoriginal and formulaic.\n\nMany studios sought to capitalize on advancements in special effects technology, instead of taking risks on experimental or thought-provoking concepts.\n\nThe future of film looked precarious as production costs increased and ticket prices continued to drop. But although the outlook was bleak, films such as Return of the Jedi, Terminator, and Batman were met with unexpected success.\n\nDue to the use of special effects, the budget of film production increased and consequently launched the names of many actors into overblown stardom. International big business eventually took financial control over many movies, which allowed foreign interests to own properties in Hollywood. To save money, more and more films started to launch production in overseas locations. Multi-national industry conglomerates bought out many studios, including Columbia and 20th Century Fox.\n\n1990s Hollywood\n\nThe highest-grossing film of the 90s was Titanic\n\nThe economic decline of the early 1990\u2019s caused a major decrease in box office revenue. Overall theater attendance was up due to new multiscreen Cineplex complexes throughout the United States. Use of special effects for violent scenes such as battlefield scenes, car chases, and gunfights in high-budget films (such as Braveheart) was a primary appeal for many moviegoers.\n\nMeanwhile, pressure on studio executives to make ends meet while creating hit movies was on the rise. In Hollywood, movies were becoming exorbitantly expensive to make due to higher costs for movie stars, agency fees, rising production costs, advertising campaigns, and crew threats to strike.\n\nVCR\u2019s were still popular at this time, and profits from video rentals were higher than the sales of movie tickets. In 1992, CD-ROM\u2019s were created. These paved the way for movies on DVD, which hit stores by 1997. DVD\u2019s featured a much better image quality as well as the capacity for interactive content, and videotapes became obsolete a few years later.\n\n2000s Hollywood\n\nThe turn of the millennium brought a new age in film history with rapid and remarkable advances in technology. The movie industry has already seen achievements and inventions in the 2000\u2019s, such as the Blu-ray disc and IMAX theaters.\n\nAdditionally, movies and TV shows can now be watched on smartphones, tablets, computers, and other personal devices with the advent of streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nExplore More Entertainment Articles\n\nThe 2000\u2019s have been an era of immense change in the movie and technology industries, and more change is sure to come quickly.

Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He had published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. From the beginning of his writing career, Hemingway\u2019s distinctive style occasioned a great deal of comment and controversy.Basically, his style is simple, direct, and unadorned, probably as a result of his early newspaper training.\n\nHemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school he reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home.\n\nHis wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms.According to A Farewell to Arms, although the book ends with a death and a stillbirth, the main character Frederic himself is nevertheless in a sense reborn, becoming a better, deeper person through his months-long involvement with his pregnant lover. In 1921, Hemingway married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s \u201cLost Generation\u201d expatriate community.\n\nThe Sun Also Rises, Hemingway\u2019s first novel, was published in 1926. After his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer; they divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War where he had been a journalist, and after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls. For Whom the Bell Tolls is a far cry from the kind of fiction with which Hemingway began. It is an ambitious work on a grand and epic scale, and it deals with war and politics directly in a way that is true of none of the other great Hemingway novels.Some readers found it a more conventional, less pathbreaking book than the best of Hemingway\u2019s earlier efforts, but others welcomed the undeniable improvement it represented over the work that had disappointed so many readers and critics in the 1930s. Finally, it seemed, Hemingway was back on track, and some early critics considered it his best book so far. He had become a conspicuous public figure, and his life seemed almost more interesting than his recent prose.\n\nIn 1952, The Old Man and the Sea helped win Hemingway the Nobel Prize, which served to confirm his status as one of the most significant writers in the world.The Old Man and the Sea depicts the epic battle between an elderly deep-sea fisherman, Santiago, and a huge and vigorous marlin. His novel seemed to imply an inspiring lesson that a man might be defeated in practical or worldly terms while still triumphing spiritually and as a person. However, some critics felt that both the story and the prose were too sentimental, and some felt that the work was an exercise in\n\nSee Entire Document Join FreeBookSummary to continue reading"}]}
