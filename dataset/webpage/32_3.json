The term art encompasses diverse media such as painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, decorative arts, photography, and installation.\n\n(Read Sister Wendy\u2019s Britannica essay on art appreciation.)\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nThe various visual arts exist within a continuum that ranges from purely aesthetic purposes at one end to purely utilitarian purposes at the other. Such a polarity of purpose is reflected in the commonly used terms artist and artisan, the latter understood as one who gives considerable attention to the utilitarian. This should by no means be taken as a rigid scheme, however. Even within one form of art, motives may vary widely; thus a potter or a weaver may create a highly functional work that is at the same time beautiful\u2014a salad bowl, for example, or a blanket\u2014or may create works that have no purpose beyond being admired. In cultures such as those of Africa and Oceania, a definition of art that encompasses this continuum has existed for centuries. In the West, however, by the mid-18th century the development of academies for painting and sculpture established a sense that these media were \u201cart\u201d and therefore separate from more utilitarian media. This separation of art forms continued among art institutions until the late 20th century, when such rigid distinctions began to be questioned.\n\nParticularly in the 20th century, a different sort of debate arose over the definition of art. A seminal moment in this discussion occurred in 1917, when Dada artist Marcel Duchamp submitted a porcelain urinal entitled Fountain to a public exhibition in New York City. Through this act, Duchamp put forth a new definition of what constitutes a work of art: he implied that it is enough for an artist to deem something \u201cart\u201d and put it in a publicly accepted venue. Implicit within this gesture was a challenge to the established art institutions\u2014such as museums, exhibiting groups, and galleries\u2014that have the power to determine what is and is not considered art. Such intellectual experimentation continued throughout the 20th century in movements such as conceptual art and minimalism. By the turn of the 21st century, a variety of new media (e.g., video art) further challenged traditional definitions of art.\n\nArt is treated in a number of articles.

The most famous artists of the Renaissance were Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael, the first two of which feature on our list. Romanticism was a movement that began in late 18th century and dominated the Western art world in the first half of the 19th century. Romanticism laid emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of the past and of nature. The best known Romantic artist today is Francisco Goya. Modern Art is a term used to describe the artworks produced in the period from around the 1860s to the 1970s. Primarily, modern artists broke away from the traditions of the past to create artworks which kept challenging the existing notion of art. Prominent Modern Art movements include Realism, Impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Pop Art. As Modern Art is the most recent major movement in Western art, there are a number of Modern artists on our list including Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Frida Kahlo. Here are the 10 best known artists today from the history of Western Art.\n\n#10 Francisco Goya\n\nLifespan: March 30, 1746 \u2013 April 16, 1828 Movement: Romanticism Nationality: Spanish\n\nFrancisco Goya\n\nFrancisco Goya rose to prominence in the artistic scene through his series of tapestry cartoons and became the court painter to the Spanish Crown. He later developed a penchant for portrayals of a dark nature for which he is most known today. Dubbed as his Black Paintings, they portray intense, haunting themes, reflective of both his fear of insanity and his bleak outlook on humanity. Goya is also renowned for highly imaginative elements in his art and bold use of paint. It was he who, more than anyone else, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist\u2019s feelings and his personal imaginative world. His art embodies Romanticism\u2019s emphasis on subjectivity, imagination and emotion. Goya has been termed as both the last of the Old Masters and the first of the Moderns. He has also been called \u201cthe last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity\u201d. Francisco Goya is the most famous Romantic artist; and among other things, one of the great portraitists of modern times.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nThe Third of May 1808 (1814) \u2013 Francisco Goya\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR The Nude Maja 1800 Saturn Devouring His Son 1823\n\n#9 Rembrandt\n\nLifespan: July 15, 1606 \u2013 October 4, 1669 Movement: Dutch Golden Age Nationality: Dutch\n\nRembrandt van Rijn\n\nThe Dutch Golden Age was a period in the history of the Netherlands in which, among other things, Dutch art was among the most acclaimed in the world. Rembrandt dominated the Dutch Golden Age and since then he remains the most famous Dutch artist. Rembrandt is known as the master of light and shadow. His paintings are of exceptional realism, which he was able to achieve through his trademark light and shadow effects. Through his prolific career, Rembrandt worked in a number of genres but he is most famous for portraits and for depictions of biblical and mythological scenes. As a portrait artist, he is renowned for capturing the moods of his subjects. Group portraiture flourished in the Netherlands at the time and Rembrandt has created some of the most famous group portraits. He is also considered one of the greatest self-portrait artist, known for not showing any mercy to himself. Rembrandt is ranked by many as the best ever portrait painter and one of the greatest artists of all time.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nThe Nightwatch (1642) \u2013 Rembrandt\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR The Abduction of Europa 1623 Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar 1659\n\n#8 Andy Warhol\n\nLifespan: August 6, 1928 \u2013 February 22, 1987 Movement: Pop Art Nationality: American\n\nAndy Warhol\n\nPop Art was the last prominent modern art movement. Its artists used recognizable imagery from popular culture like advertisements, celebrities and comic book characters. Born Andrew Warhola, Andy Warhol was the best known and most influential artist of the Pop Art movement to the extent that he is known as the \u201cPope of Pop\u201d. The non-painterly style and the commercial aspects of his paintings initially caused offense as it affronted the technique and philosophy of Abstract Expressionism, the then dominant style in the United States. His works created an uproar in the American art world and the resulting controversy made Warhol a household name. Warhol was a prolific artist and he explored a wide variety of media including painting, silk screening, photography, film and sculpture. His paintings are among the most expensive ever sold. Though many still doubt the merit of his work, Andy Warhol is without doubt the most famous American artist and a leading figure of 20th century modern art.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nMarilyn Diptych (1962) \u2013 Andy Warhol\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans 1962 Eight Elvises 1963\n\n#7 Claude Monet\n\nLifespan: November 14, 1840 \u2013 December 5, 1926 Movement: Impressionism Nationality: French\n\nClaude Monet\n\nClaude Monet was a founder of the art movement Impressionism; which laid emphasis on vivid colors, candid poses and, most importantly, on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities. Monet was the driving force behind this revolutionary art movement; and its most consistent and prolific practitioner. The name of the movement also comes from his painting Impression, Sunrise; the term being coined in a satirical review. Monet was dedicated to finding improved methods of painterly expression. He broke tradition and thought in terms of colors, light and shapes. Some of his series explored how smoke, steam, mist, rain etc. affected color and visibility. Nympheas (Water Lilies), the most renowned series of Monet which contains around 250 paintings, has been described as \u201cThe Sistine Chapel of Impressionism\u201d. Claude Monet is the most famous French artist and he is considered among the greatest painters ever.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nWater Lilies, Harmony in Blue (1917) \u2013 Claude Monet\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Impression, Sunrise 1872 Haystacks Series 1890 \u2013 1891\n\n#6 Salvador Dal\u00ed\n\nLifespan: May 11, 1904 \u2013 January 23, 1989 Movement: Surrealism Nationality: Spanish\n\nSalvador Dali\n\nSurrealism was one of the most influential modern art movement of the 20th century. Its artists rejected rationalism and literary realism; and instead focused on channeling the unconscious mind to unveil the power of the imagination. Known for his eccentric manners, Salvador Dali created the most famous masterpieces of Surrealist art. His contribution to Surrealist painting include the paranoiac-critical method; in which the artist attempts to tap into his subconscious through systematic irrational thought and a self-induced paranoid state. Best known for his striking and bizarre images, Dali used extensive symbolism in his work. Recurring images in his paintings include elephants with brittle legs which evoke weightlessness; ants, thought to be his symbol for decay and death; and melting watches, perhaps symbolic of non-linear human perception of time. Salvador Dali was the most renowned Surrealist painter and he is regarded as one of the most influential figures in modern art.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nThe Persistence of Memory (1931) \u2013 Salvador Dali\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Lobster Telephone 1936 Swans Reflecting Elephants 1937\n\n#5 Frida Kahlo\n\nLifespan: July 6, 1907 \u2013 July 13, 1954 Movement: Surrealism Nationality: Mexican\n\nFrida Kahlo\n\nOn 17th September 1925, Frida Kahlo and her friend Alex were riding in a bus when it crashed into a street trolley car. Due to the grave injuries she suffered in the accident, Frida had to undergo 35 operations in her life, bear with relapses of extreme pain and could not have children. While in hospital, Kahlo began painting and she ultimately abandoned her career in medicine to become an artist. Frida Kahlo is most famous for her self-portraits which often incorporate symbolic portrayals of physical and psychological wounds. She said, \u201cI paint myself because I am so often alone and because I am the subject I know best.\u201d Frida Kahlo is ranked among the greatest artists in the genre of self portraiture. Though her influence on art might not be as great as some of the artists in this list, Frida Kahlo is undoubtedly one of the most famous artists and perhaps the most renowned female painter of all time. She also remains a feminist icon for the way she led her life.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nThe Two Fridas (1939) \u2013 Frida Kahlo\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird 1940 The Broken Column 1944\n\n#4 Michelangelo\n\nLifespan: March 6, 1475 \u2013 February 18, 1564 Movement: Renaissance Nationality: Italian\n\nMichelangelo\n\nMichelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was a \u201cRenaissance man\u201d or \u201cUniversal Genius\u201d who excelled in various fields including painting, architecture, poetry and engineering. However, above all, he is widely regarded as the greatest sculptor of all time. In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino (\u201cthe divine one\u201d). After his death, subsequent artists tried to imitate his impassioned, highly personal style resulting in Mannerism, the next major movement in Western art. Michelangelo is perhaps the most influential figure in the history of western art whose works in painting, sculpture and architecture have exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of art in the west. His statue of David is one of the most famous sculpture in the west; his frescos on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and The Last Judgement on its altar wall guarantee him a place among the greatest painters; and his St. Peter\u2019s Basilica is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nDavid (1504) \u2013 Michelangelo\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR The Creation of Adam 1512 St. Peter\u2019s Basilica 1626\n\n#3 Vincent van Gogh\n\nLifespan: March 30, 1853 \u2013 July 29, 1890 Movement: Post-Impressionism Nationality: Dutch\n\nVincent van Gogh\n\nVincent Van Gogh was a Post-Impressionist artist who had a difficult life marred by mental instability. He ultimately shot himself in the chest with a revolver and died two days later. Van Gogh rose to fame in the early 20th century, a decade after his death, Ultimately he was credited with being a key figure in the development of modern art. He is now widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of Western art. Van Gogh created about 2,100 artworks in just over a decade which include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits. He is considered one of the most skilled artists in all these genres. The art of Van Gogh is notable for its bold color; rough beauty; emotional honesty; and impulsive and expressive brushwork. He created some of the best known masterpieces of modern art including The Starry Night; the Sunflower series; and the Irises series.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nThe Starry Night (1889) \u2013 Vincent Van Gogh\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Sunflowers series 1888-1889 Irises series 1889\n\n#2 Leonardo da Vinci\n\nLifespan: April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519 Movement: Renaissance Nationality: Italian\n\nLeonardo da Vinci\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was the ideal Renaissance man, the greatest Universal Genius, who, among other things, was a painter, mathematician, engineer, architect, botanist, sculptor and anatomist. However for four centuries after his death his fame rested primarily on his laurels as a painter. His detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology helped him in creating some of the most renowned masterpieces in history. Da Vinci is known for capturing subtle expressions due to which his paintings look more alive than others. He made numerous contributions to the field of art including his pioneering of the techniques known as sfumato, the smooth transition from light to shadow; and chiaroscuro, use of strong contrasts between light and dark to achieve a three dimensional effect. Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, world\u2019s most famous painting. Other famous works in art by him include The Last Supper, the most reproduced religious painting; and Vitruvian Man, one of the most reproduced artistic images.

He broke the practices of the past and co-pioneered the art movement Cubism. Cubist artists depicted the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to give it greater context and this made the artwork partially abstract. The movement revolutionized European painting and sculpture. Picasso\u2019s style changed over the course of his career as he experimented with different theories, techniques and ideas. He was a prolific artist and, apart from creating a large volume of work in other media, he made around 1900 paintings in his long career. No artist has been as famous as him during his lifetime. Several of his paintings are among the most expensive ever sold but his most famous works are generally held by museums. Pablo Picasso is undoubtedly the most famous artist and many also regard him as the greatest painter of all time.\n\nMasterpiece:-\n\nGuernica (1937) \u2013 Pablo Picasso\n\nOther Famous Works:-"}, {"url": "https://www.pixpa.com/blog/mixed-media-art", "page_content": "Art is a highly multifarious range of visual or performed works that express the creator's ideas or skills and appeal to the viewer's senses or emotions. Art can be created with anything, and not necessarily any one thing.\n\nThe use of mixed media began around 1912 when Cubists, like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, started adding collages to their canvases. Gradually the art form became widespread as artists developed increasingly open attitudes to the media of art. Surrealists, Abstract Expressionists, Pop Artists, and Brit Artists jumped onto the mixed media bandwagon and expanded the art vocabulary.\n\nWhat is Mixed Media Art?\n\nWhen different media or materials are used to create unique visual art, it is called mixed media art.\n\n\n\nMixed media art is an art form that doesn't place restrictions on people who don't know how to draw or don't have good fine art skills. It is a creative field in which anyone who is keenly interested in creating something can participate. Once you select an area of mixed media art, it requires mastery of a particular skillset and ingenious use of specific materials. Here is an example of top art website templates you can check.\n\nVaried materials like cloth, wood, paper, etc., can be used to create mixed media art forms like assemblages, recycling, journaling, and collages. The main difference between multimedia art and mixed media art is that multimedia art has non-visual elements like video, sound, literature, etc., while mixed media has only visual elements.\n\nRelated: Best Photo Collage apps for creating mixed media art\n\nTypes of Mixed Media Art\n\nArtists are constantly innovating and experimenting, to create original, bold works of art. Let us look at the common ways used to create Mixed Media art, combining different methods and mediums.\n\nSculpture: Many times, a sculpture is created by using different materials; hence, it can be categorized under mixed media art. The materials used in making a mixed media sculpture can be wood, wire, glass, metal, found objects, etc. A creative artist chooses a base material and then add additional materials like paint to the sculpture to make it interesting and create elements of pattern, shape or color.\n\n\n\nCollage: When a base like wood, paper, stone, or any object is attached to any other medium like paper or fabric, it can be termed a collage. A Collage gives the impression that is not a planned or controlled work of art. The base can be a blank canvas, pieces of flat wood, paper, cardboard or found objects; so you can make your own mixed media collages with just about anything you can think of. There are endless possibilities and an artist can create a two-dimensional piece by gluing varied materials such as magazines and newspaper clippings, ribbons, paints, ink, paper, fabric, other artworks like photographs, etc. to the base, and then drawing or adding paint. The origins of Collage goes back hundreds of years but it came into prominence only in the early 20th century.\n\n\n\nAssemblage: An Assemblage is similar to collage, but it has three-dimensional elements, that are combined to create a piece of art that tells a story. Found objects, both man-made and natural are typically used in assemblages. Metal pieces, hardware, wooden blocks, cardboard boxes make for sturdy bases for assemblage art. Lightweight objects, to name a few are beads, buttons, wires, plastic bottles, game pieces, toys, and everyday objects.\n\nSome assemblages are hung on the wall like a painting, while others are created as sculptures.\n\n\n\nAltered Books: A book in this mixed media art is taken as a base to create art. It can be transformed into a collage, painting, tearing, etc. so that the book has a new function or to make it more attractive. If the literature of the book is used, it can also be referred to, as part of multimedia art.\n\n\n\nWet and Dry Media: Mixing drawing with painting is a common technique used in mixed media art. An artist should be aware of the effect the art produces. Charcoal drawing mixed with oil-based paints is an inventive way to make it stand out. Another technique, termed Resist, creates a unique look, combining oil and water-based paints.\n\n\n\nCharcoal Drawing Mixed With Oil-Based Paints\n\nHow to make Mixed Media Art?\n\nMixed Media Artists work with a variety of media in a single artwork. To get started with mixed media art, begin by looking at things around you. You would need a sturdy material that can act as a base like a paper, sketchbook, a box, or any such object you have access to. Begin working with media that you are already familiar with. If you work with watercolours, you can add highlights with coloured pencils or markers. You can create collages by rearranging elements in your work using paper, catalogues, stamps, wrapping paper etc and glue them on the surface which could be paper, canvas or woodblocks.\n\nExperiment with new, inventive techniques in mixed media. Adopt a spontaneous playful approach to creating your work and remember to have fun along the way! Artists who work in the field of mixed media and get recognized can come from a variety of backgrounds. They can have formal training in Fine art, or have experience in the craft. As with many art genres, many artists are self-taught.\n\n\n\nIf you are a Mixed media artist, you can showcase your creations on your design portfolio website in a clean, minimalist way.

Originality is generally associated with uniqueness, but a print is considered original because the artist from the outset intended to create an etching, woodcut, or other graphic work and thus conceived an image within the possibilities and limitations of that technique. Without doubt, early printmaking was strongly influenced by a desire for multiple prints. Artists quickly discovered, however, that when a drawing is translated into a woodcut or engraving, it takes on totally new characteristics. Each technique has its own distinctive style, imposed by the tools, materials, and printing methods. The metamorphosis that takes place between drawing and print became the strongest attraction for the creative artist. It is important to understand that artists do not select printing methods arbitrarily but choose the ones in which they can best express themselves. Thus, any of the proofs printed from an original plate is considered an original work of art, and, although most fine prints are pulled in limited quantities, the number has no bearing on originality, only on commercial value.\n\nWhat is the difference between a reproduction and an original print? In the very early days of printmaking, this was not a serious problem, because the print was not looked upon as a precious art object and prices were low. The question of originality became an issue only in the 18th century, and in the 19th century artists started to hand sign their prints. Since then, the signed print has been accepted by most people as the proof of its originality.\n\nBritannica Quiz Artistic Styles and Techniques Quiz\n\nWith regard to the names with which they signed their works, Japanese artists followed a bewildering custom: adopting and discarding names at will. Artists simply adopted names of other artists they admired. Thus, in the art history of Japan, it is common to find several unrelated artists bearing the same name and one artist bearing many names; during his long life, Hokusai, for example, used about 50 different names. In fact, a signature by itself means little or nothing. For instance, Pablo Picasso issued many signed reproductions of his paintings; on the other hand, many of his original etchings have been published in split editions, some signed and some not. These unsigned etchings are original, while the signed reproductions are not. The crucial difference is that Picasso made the plate for the original print, while the signed reproduction was photomechanically produced.\n\nIn 1960 the International Congress of Plastic Arts drafted a resolution intended to regulate contemporary prints. The crucial paragraph reads:\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Works that do not fulfill these conditions must be considered \u201creproductions.\u201d\n\nAlthough this is a straightforward statement, later developments have proved it to be highly controversial. Since the rise of the Pop and Op movements, a great number of photographically produced prints have been published and sold as signed originals. Because museum curators, art critics, and artists have not taken a firm stand on the question, any print that the artist declares to be original is now accepted as such, regardless of how it was made. Although the art world is divided on the solution, nearly everybody agrees that something should be done to clarify the situation. The state of New York, for example, has passed a law requiring complete disclosure by the dealer of how, and by whom, the print was made.\n\nMany artists believe that the answer lies in the giving of honest information. In the 17th and 18th centuries in the West, most prints carried all the relevant information on their margins. The names of individuals were followed by Latin abbreviations indicating their role in the work. Common examples are del. (delineavit): \u201che drew it\u201d; imp. (impressit): \u201che printed it\u201d; and sculp. (sculpsit): \u201che engraved it.\u201d This type of information, together with the total edition number, should be furnished by the artist or the dealer to the buyer. Clearly, it is impossible to make completely rigid rules to define originality. Probably the most realistic solution is to establish degrees of originality, based on the degree of the artist\u2019s participation in the various steps in the creation of the finished print.\n\nThere may also be confusion about edition numbering. In contemporary printmaking, an original print in limited edition should carry information about the size of the total edition and the number of the print. A problem can arise because, in addition to the regular edition, there are \u201cartist\u2019s proofs\u201d or the French \u201cH.C.\u201d (hors de commerce) proofs. These are intended for the artist\u2019s personal use and should be no more than 10 percent of the edition, but, unfortunately, this practice is often abused. All of the prints pulled between working stages are called \u201ctrial proofs.\u201d These can be of great interest because they reveal the artist\u2019s working process and of great value because the number of proofs is small.\n\nWith prints of old masters in the West, originality is a very complex and difficult issue. These artists did not publish their prints in limited editions but printed as many as they could sell and without signing or numbering their works. There are arguments even between experts about the authenticity of many old prints. Important works of the masters are documented in catalogs and, although these must be revised from time to time, they furnish the only firm information available. After the edition is printed, the modern artist usually either destroys the plate or marks (\u201cstrikes\u201d) it in a distinctive manner to guarantee that any reprint from the plate is identifiable.\n\nThe 19th-century U.S. painter and etcher James McNeill Whistler was one of the first Western artists to hand sign his prints. Signing is now regulated by a convention. Upon completing the edition, the artist signs and numbers each print. Usually the signature is in the lower right corner; the edition number is on the left. Some artists put the title in the centre."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/sculpture", "page_content": "sculpture, an artistic form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. The designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, or in environments ranging from tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator. An enormous variety of media may be used, including clay, wax, stone, metal, fabric, glass, wood, plaster, rubber, and random \u201cfound\u201d objects. Materials may be carved, modeled, molded, cast, wrought, welded, sewn, assembled, or otherwise shaped and combined.\n\nSculpture is not a fixed term that applies to a permanently circumscribed category of objects or sets of activities. It is, rather, the name of an art that grows and changes and is continually extending the range of its activities and evolving new kinds of objects. The scope of the term was much wider in the second half of the 20th century than it had been only two or three decades before, and in the fluid state of the visual arts in the 21st century nobody can predict what its future extensions are likely to be.\n\nCertain features which in previous centuries were considered essential to the art of sculpture are not present in a great deal of modern sculpture and can no longer form part of its definition. One of the most important of these is representation. Before the 20th century, sculpture was considered a representational art, one that imitated forms in life, most often human figures but also inanimate objects, such as game, utensils, and books. Since the turn of the 20th century, however, sculpture has also included nonrepresentational forms. It has long been accepted that the forms of such functional three-dimensional objects as furniture, pots, and buildings may be expressive and beautiful without being in any way representational; but it was only in the 20th century that nonfunctional, nonrepresentational, three-dimensional works of art began to be produced.\n\nBefore the 20th century, sculpture was considered primarily an art of solid form, or mass. It is true that the negative elements of sculpture\u2014the voids and hollows within and between its solid forms\u2014have always been to some extent an integral part of its design, but their role was a secondary one. In a great deal of modern sculpture, however, the focus of attention has shifted, and the spatial aspects have become dominant. Spatial sculpture is now a generally accepted branch of the art of sculpture.\n\nBritannica Quiz Everything in Art and Design (Part Four) Quiz\n\nIt was also taken for granted in the sculpture of the past that its components were of a constant shape and size and, with the exception of items such as Augustus Saint-Gaudens\u2019s Diana (a monumental weather vane), did not move. With the recent development of kinetic sculpture, neither the immobility nor immutability of its form can any longer be considered essential to the art of sculpture.\n\nFinally, sculpture since the 20th century has not been confined to the two traditional forming processes of carving and modeling or to such traditional natural materials as stone, metal, wood, ivory, bone, and clay. Because present-day sculptors use any materials and methods of manufacture that will serve their purposes, the art of sculpture can no longer be identified with any special materials or techniques.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThrough all these changes, there is probably only one thing that has remained constant in the art of sculpture, and it is this that emerges as the central and abiding concern of sculptors: the art of sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that is especially concerned with the creation of form in three dimensions.\n\nSculpture may be either in the round or in relief. A sculpture in the round is a separate, detached object in its own right, leading the same kind of independent existence in space as a human body or a chair. A relief does not have this kind of independence. It projects from and is attached to or is an integral part of something else that serves either as a background against which it is set or a matrix from which it emerges.\n\nThe actual three-dimensionality of sculpture in the round limits its scope in certain respects in comparison with the scope of painting. Sculpture cannot conjure the illusion of space by purely optical means or invest its forms with atmosphere and light as painting can. It does have a kind of reality, a vivid physical presence that is denied to the pictorial arts. The forms of sculpture are tangible as well as visible, and they can appeal strongly and directly to both tactile and visual sensibilities. Even the visually impaired, including those who are congenitally blind, can produce and appreciate certain kinds of sculpture. It was, in fact, argued by the 20th-century art critic Sir Herbert Read that sculpture should be regarded as primarily an art of touch and that the roots of sculptural sensibility can be traced to the pleasure one experiences in fondling things.\n\nAll three-dimensional forms are perceived as having an expressive character as well as purely geometric properties. They strike the observer as delicate, aggressive, flowing, taut, relaxed, dynamic, soft, and so on. By exploiting the expressive qualities of form, a sculptor is able to create images in which subject matter and expressiveness of form are mutually reinforcing. Such images go beyond the mere presentation of fact and communicate a wide range of subtle and powerful feelings.\n\nThe aesthetic raw material of sculpture is, so to speak, the whole realm of expressive three-dimensional form. A sculpture may draw upon what already exists in the endless variety of natural and man-made form, or it may be an art of pure invention. It has been used to express a vast range of human emotions and feelings from the most tender and delicate to the most violent and ecstatic.\n\nAll human beings, intimately involved from birth with the world of three-dimensional form, learn something of its structural and expressive properties and develop emotional responses to them. This combination of understanding and sensitive response, often called a sense of form, can be cultivated and refined. It is to this sense of form that the art of sculpture primarily appeals.\n\nThis article deals with the elements and principles of design; the materials, methods, techniques, and forms of sculpture; and its subject matter, imagery, symbolism, and uses.

Salvador Dali once had a pet anteater that he would take on walks around Paris\n\nSalvador Dali was known for his eccentric behavior, and one of his most unusual habits was walking his pet anteater around the streets of Paris on a leash.\n\nThe anteater\u2019s name was reportedly \u201cBabo,\u201d and it would often accompany Dali to cafes and other public places. Some people even claim that Dali would take the anteater to the theater or to fancy restaurants, although it\u2019s unclear how much of this is true and how much is just a colorful legend.\n\nNevertheless, the image of Dali and his pet anteater has become a part of his myth and legacy as one of the most eccentric and imaginative artists of the 20th century.\n\n2. Leonardo da Vinci was not only a great artist but also an inventor, scientist, and engineer\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was not only a great artist but also an inventor, scientist, and engineer.

The Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh cut off his own ear\n\nVincent van Gogh, a Dutch post-impressionist painter, did indeed cut off a part of his left ear after a quarrel with his friend and fellow artist Paul Gauguin in December 1888.\n\nVan Gogh was known to have suffered from mental health issues throughout his life, and this incident is thought to have been related to his deteriorating mental state. After cutting off his ear, Van Gogh reportedly wrapped it in cloth and gave it to a woman at a local brothel.\n\nHe was then admitted to a hospital in Arles, France, where he received treatment for his injuries and his mental health. Despite this incident, Van Gogh continued to create art and produce some of his most famous works, including \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d and \u201cSunflowers.\u201d\n\n14. Wassily Kandinsky is considered one of the pioneers of abstract art\n\nWassily Kandinsky was a Russian artist who is often credited with being one of the pioneers of abstract art. In the early 20th century, Kandinsky began experimenting with non-representational forms of art, creating works that emphasized color, shape, and composition over traditional representational elements.\n\nHe believed that art should be able to convey spiritual and emotional truths, and that abstract art was a more direct and powerful means of achieving this than representational art.\n\nSome of Kandinsky\u2019s most famous works include \u201cComposition VII,\u201d \u201cYellow-Red-Blue,\u201d and \u201cBlack and White.\u201d\n\n15.

The Mexican artist Diego Rivera was known for his murals\n\nDiego Rivera was a Mexican artist who lived in the early 20th century and is known for his large-scale murals that depicted Mexican history, politics, and culture. He was a prominent member of the Mexican muralism movement, which sought to use art as a means of communicating social and political messages to the public.\n\nRivera\u2019s murals, such as those at the National Palace and the Ministry of Public Education in Mexico City, are characterized by their bold, bright colors, and powerful imagery. He often incorporated elements of Mexican folk art and mythology into his work, and his murals were seen as a celebration of Mexican culture and identity.\n\nRivera\u2019s legacy continues to inspire and influence artists and activists around the world, and his works are celebrated for their beauty, craftsmanship, and social significance."}, {"url": "https://www.moma.org/artists/6246", "page_content": "\u201cThe more you look at the same exact thing, the more the meaning goes away.\u201d Andy Warhol\n\nTwo exhibitions in 1962 announced Andy Warhol\u2019s dramatic entry into the art world. In July, at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, he exhibited his now-iconic Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans. The work\u2019s 32 canvases, each one featuring a different variety of the company\u2019s 32 soups, were lined up in a single row on a ledge that wrapped around the gallery. \u201cCans sit on shelves,\u201d the gallery director, Irving Blum, later said of the installation. \u201cWhy not?\u201d The paintings marked a breakthrough for Warhol, who had previously worked as a commercial illustrator: they were among his first works based on consumer goods, and among the first to embrace serial repetition. Although he hand-painted each canvas, they were made to seem mechanically produced.\n\nLater that year, Warhol mounted an exhibition at New York\u2019s Stable Gallery, displaying silkscreen prints with a flat uniformity that would become his signature style. The silkscreen, at the time primarily a commercial technique, allowed a theoretically endless number of repetitions and variations of his chosen subject. The exhibition included numerous portraits of legendary actress Marilyn Monroe, whose recent suicide sent shockwaves through American popular culture. In Gold Marilyn Monroe, Warhol memorialized Monroe by screening her face onto a gold-painted canvas, recalling the look of a Byzantine icon.\n\nStrategies drawn from printmaking, including multiplicity, mirroring, transfer, and replication, would prove central and enduring tenets in Warhol\u2019s work. Throughout the 1960s, he continued to mine the world of celebrity for his art, creating images of stars and public figures so familiar that they were often known by only their first name: Elvis, Jackie, and, again, Marilyn. Likewise, his engagement with the subject of commodity culture signaled in Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans would find a sculptural analogue in his boxes silkscreened with the labels of Campbell\u2019s tomato juice, Brillo soap pads, and Heinz ketchup. \u201cThe more you look at the same exact thing, the more the meaning goes away, and the better and emptier you feel,\u201d Warhol would remark. His Death and Disaster series, begun in 1963, tests that statement. In works like Orange Car Crash Fourteen Times and Electric Chairs, the force of repetition rendered the scenes at once banal and more emphatically traumatic.\n\nWarhol was also a pioneering and prolific filmmaker. His famous Screen Tests, made between 1964 and 1966, consist of 472 individual filmed portraits of visitors to his legendary studio, known as the Factory. A testament to his perennial interest in portraiture, the Screen Tests also advanced a new definition of film performance, starring non-professionals whose only task was to remain silent and still for the duration of a roll of film. Other works challenged the limits of audience attention, such as Empire, an eight-hour stationary shot of the Empire State Building. Drawing from a range of genres, Warhol also made scripted, feature-length films that delved into New York\u2019s underground subcultures and turned the Factory\u2019s collection of artists and misfits into \u201csuperstars.\u201d\n\nBy 1971, New York magazine had dubbed Warhol \u201cThe Zeitgeist incarnate,\u201d declaring, \u201cThe images he leaves will be the permanent record of America in the sixties.\u201d He had launched his own magazine, Interview, in 1969, and in the years that followed he circulated in the world of celebrity he had long represented in his art. In the 1980s, he returned to painting in works like the giant Rorschach. As suggested by Leonardo da Vinci, The Annunciation 1473, he also turned his creative attentions to art history itself.\n\nTwo years after his death in 1987, MoMA mounted its first retrospective of his work. Since then, Warhol\u2019s stature has only grown, as the influence of his work\u2014in its merging of pop culture and fine art, its exploitation of the serial logic of the print, and his own canny media manipulation and self-fashioning\u2014continues to reverberate."}, {"url": "https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/21-facts-about-edgar-degas", "page_content": "1. Degas rejected the \u201cImpressionist\u201d label and preferred to be known as a \u201crealist\u201d.\n\nEven though he took a leading role in organizing the Impressionist Exhibitions and is considered one of the movement\u2019s founders, Degas had a contentious relationship with his contemporaries. He mocked the practice of painting en plein air, once saying: \u201cIf I were the government I would have a special brigade of gendarmes to keep an eye on artists who paint landscapes from nature. Oh, I don\u2019t mean to kill anyone; just a little dose of bird-shot now and then as a warning.\u201d While Degas rejected spontaneity in his work, his unconventional compositions and scenes of quotidian life place Degas, however uncomfortably, within the Impressionist tradition.\n\n2. He initially aspired to be a history painter, but changed course in his early thirties.\n\nDegas received his formal training at the prestigious \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, where he closely studied classical painting under Louis Lamothe. Following in the footsteps of his idol, the French Neoclassicist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Degas produced several history paintings through the mid 1860s. In 1865, however, he turned his eye to scenes of modern life. While he would never again paint historical subjects, the influence of his academic training can be clearly discerned in his fascination with the human figure, exquisite draftsmanship and facility for line.\n\n3. Degas was a well-heeled member of the haute bourgeoisie.\n\nPerpetually outfitted in a frock coat and stovepipe hat, Degas was an obsessive collector of lace handkerchiefs and walking sticks.\n\n4. Like many Impressionists, he was influenced by Japanese art and collected ukiyo-e prints.\n\nIn 1853, with the opening of trade between Japan and the west, an influx of new art into France ignited a craze for all things Japanese. Unlike many of his contemporaries, however, Degas\u2019 fascination extended beyond staged japoneries. Instead, he abstracted from the Japanese aesthetic those elements which he found most compelling, particularly its asymmetrical compositions, inventive perspectives and delineation of space with line and color. Degas\u2019 favored subject matter\u2014 candid moments of modern life, intimate scenes of women bathing, and of course, dancers\u2014 are also central to the ukiyo-e genre.\n\nJapanese ukiyo-e prints such as the above were the types of scenes that had a profound impression on Degas' choices of subject matter and cropping. Image Courtesy of Bridgeman Images.\n\n5. At the age of 36, Degas began experiencing visual problems, which worsened throughout his life.\n\nShortly after enlisting in the National Guard at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war, Degas developed a form of retinal disease that would lead to difficulty distinguishing colors, light sensitivity and scotoma. Because his retinopathy made it difficult for him to see in bright light, Degas preferred to work indoors, and found that he was particularly well-suited to the low light of the ballet and opera. By his forties, Degas had lost his central vision, and by the age of 57, he could no longer read. His deteriorating eyesight undoubtedly impacted his work, leading to broader strokes, bolder colors and experimentation in a wide variety of media including pastels, photography, printmaking and sculpture.\n\nEdgar Degas, Woman Combing her Hair, 1887\u201390. Collection of the Musee d'Orsay\n\n6. Financial hardship sparked his creativity.\n\nThe scion of a wealthy family, Degas suddenly found himself facing financial troubles in 1874 with the death of his father and the discovery of his brother\u2019s significant business debts. To make ends meet, Degas sold his house and inherited art collection, and for the first time in his life became dependent on the sale of his artworks. Under mounting financial pressure, Degas embarked upon a decade of great productivity, joining forces with the budding Impressionist movement to mount a series of paradigm-shifting exhibitions.\n\nEdgar Degas, The Cotton Exchange, New Orleans, 1873. Collection of the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Pau, France. Image Courtesy of Bridgeman Images.\n\n7. His painting A Cotton Office in New Orleans (1873) was the first piece by an Impressionist to be acquired by a museum.\n\nDegas, whose mother hailed from New Orleans, came to the city in 1872 to visit his brother Ren\u00e9 and a number of other relatives. The painting, depicting his uncle Michel Musson\u2019s cotton brokerage business, was exhibited at the Second Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1876 and was sold to the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Pau in 1878.\n\n8. Best known for his depictions of dancers, Degas produced approximately 1,500 works\u2014over half of his oeuvre\u2014on the subject\u2026\n\nDegas\u2019 dancers explore the tension between the natural unguarded gestures of performers at rest and the stylized movements of classical ballet. From his earliest treatments of the theme, Degas showed an interest in not only the public spectacle of ballet performances, but also in the more informal situations around them: the behind-the-scenes world of the rehearsal room or the dance class, the dancers\u2019 preparation and tension prior to a performance and the more relaxed, casual moments that followed afterwards. In the 1870s and 1880s, Degas was a fixture at the Garnier Op\u00e9ra, attending both performances and rehearsals.\n\nEdgar Degas, Danseuse Au Repos . Sold at Sotheby\u2019s $37 million in 3 November 2008.\n\n9. \u2026But it was not the ballet, per se, that Degas was interested in.\n\nIn the late 1800s, the golden age of Romantic ballet had decayed into unseemly cabaret, rife with thorny sexual politics and imbalances of power. The female dancers, often from impoverished backgrounds, entered the academy as children to support their families. There, they were at the mercy of the Op\u00e9ra\u2019s unforgiving brothel culture, where wealthy male subscribers had the power to make or break their fortunes. Degas\u2019 fascination with these backstage dynamics is apparent in L\u2019\u00c9toile (1879), where a partially obscured figure in a black tuxedo lurks behind the young ballerina on stage. Viewed in this context, his unsentimental portrayals of young dancers acquire yet another layer of psychological depth.\n\nEdgar Degas, L'Etoile ou la danseuse sur la scene, circa 1876\u201377. Collection of the Musee d'Orsay\n\n10. And while dancers may have been his favorite, they were not his only subject.\n\nDegas\u2019 early scenes of modern life were concerned with other favorite themes, especially horse racing and milliners and laundresses at work. Later in life, Degas produced extensive series of women bathing, which were notable for their lack of self-consciousness and candid studies of the human form, unique use of perspective, and almost sculptural solidity.\n\n11. Degas\u2019 brothel monotypes found an eager collector in Pablo Picasso.\n\nPicasso found the pieces fascinating, describing them as \u201cfar and away the best thing he ever did.\u201d He collected 12, and, inspired by Degas, created his own series of voyeuristic prints in his later years.\n\n12. He was fascinated by physiognomy, the dubious practice of deducing personality and moral character from physical appearance.\n\nBiological determinism was in vogue in the 19th century, particularly in the realm of criminology. Proponents believed that a \u201cborn criminal\u201d might be distinguished by certain physical characteristics, including a protruding jawline and low forehead. Such ideas are on vivid display in Degas\u2019 pair of 1881 pastels, Criminal Physiognomies, depicting two young gang members convicted of murdering a grocer\u2019s boy. Degas\u2019 interest in physiognomy went beyond criminal behavior; some historians argue that the exaggerated features of his Jewish banker subjects in Portraits at the Stock Exchange (1879) recall right-wing anti-Semitic cartoons of the time. Even his dancers receive the physiognomic treatment\u2014he refers to his lower-class subjects as \u201clittle monkey girls\u201d, \u201cin the state of animals cleaning themselves.\u201d\n\nEdgar Degas, Nude Photographic Study, silver print photograph, 1895. Image Courtesy of Bridgeman Images.\n\n13. In the mid 1880s and 1890s, Degas developed a passion for photography.\n\nWith subjects ranging from dancers and nudes to portraits of friends and family (including a double portrait of Renoir and Mallarm\u00e9) and even self-portraits, Degas\u2019 photographs evince similar aesthetic preoccupations to his work in other media. Often using only a single light source, the figures in Degas\u2019 photographs appear to emerge from darkness and convey the startling intimacy for which his paintings and pastels are also known. Degas found photography particularly conducive to his interest in off-kilter compositions, and would continue to draw and paint from photographs throughout his career.\n\n14. He had a long friendship and collaboration with the American Impressionist painter Mary Cassatt.\n\nDegas and Cassatt met in 1877, when Cassatt was studying in Paris. Degas introduced her to pastels and engraving, and was instrumental in the evolution of Cassatt\u2019s style; she, in turn, played a key role in introducing Degas to American audiences. What followed was an intense artistic friendship that lasted nearly 40 years. While the lack of surviving correspondence between the two makes it difficult to guess at the depth of their collaboration, the artwork provides a clue. In 2014, historians discovered Degas\u2019 hand at work in Cassatt\u2019s 1878 painting Little Girl in a Blue Armchair\u2014 infrared images taken by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC reveal his subtle brushstrokes.\n\nMary Cassatt, Little Girl in a Blue Armchair, 1878. Collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n\n15. The Dreyfus Affair, which divided France from 1894 to 1906, foregrounded Degas\u2019 anti-Semitism and caused him to cut ties with all of his Jewish friends.\n\nThe scandal touched off with the wrongful treason conviction of Alfred Dreyfus, a French artillery officer of Jewish descent. The resulting political crisis divided French society between the anticlerical, pro-Republican Dreyfusards and the pro-Army, predominantly Catholic anti-Dreyfusards. Degas fell emphatically into the latter camp, along with fellow conservatives like Renoir; others, like Monet and Pissarro, were convinced of Dreyfus\u2019 innocence. Degas was perhaps the most openly hostile member of the artistic avant-garde, described by Pissarro as a \u201cferocious anti-Semite\u201d. Following the Dreyfus Affair, Degas broke with all of his Jewish associates, including his longtime friend Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, and refused to use models whom he suspected of being Jewish or having Dreyfusard sympathies.\n\n16. He created over 150 sculptures from wax, clay, and plastiline; his heirs authorized the casting of his works in bronze so that they could be sold.\n\nUpon his death in 1917, over 150 sculptures were discovered in his studio. Most were made of impermanent materials and in various states of disrepair. Keen to sell what they could, Degas\u2019 heirs contracted with the H\u00e9brard foundry in Paris to cast 74 of the sculptures in bronze. While it was initially believed that Degas\u2019 original sculptures had been sacrificed to the casting process, in 1955, 69 of the \u201clost\u201d originals were rediscovered. 52 of these original sculptures are now housed in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.\n\nEdgar Degas, Petite Danseuse De Quatorze Ans . Sold at Sotheby\u2019s London for \u00a315.9 million in 2015.\n\n17. The only sculpture Degas exhibited during his lifetime, Little Dancer Aged Fourteen (1878-1881), received a controversial reception, with some critics denouncing it as \u201cugly\u201d.\n\nExhibited wearing a real dancer\u2019s costume and a wig of human hair, the wax sculpture depicts 14-year-old Marie van Goethem, a \u201cpetit rat\" who joined the Paris Ballet as an escape from poverty. Debuted at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition in 1881, the sculpture provoked a mixture of admiration for its realism and opprobrium for the unidealized portrayal of its lower-class subject. One critic expressed revulsion at a face \u201cmarked by the hateful promise of every vice\u2026bearing the signs of a profoundly heinous character.\u201d Today, of course, the sculpture is recognized as an icon of modern art.\n\n18. Degas\u2019 Monsieur and Madame \u00c9douard Manet (1868-69) was mutilated, presumably by Manet himself.\n\nDegas gifted the painting, which depicts Manet reclining on the sofa as his wife plays the piano, to the couple. As the story goes, the next time he saw the picture, it had been slashed right through Mme Manet\u2019s face. Degas was furious, and took the painting back. While it is unclear what provoked such a reaction in Manet, historians have speculated that he objected to the depiction of marital disharmony.\n\n19. As he grew older, Degas became increasingly reclusive and given to bouts of depression.\n\nThe famously misanthropic, cantankerous and misogynistic Degas believed that \u201cthe artist must live alone, and his private life must remain unknown.\u201d Morose and withdrawn in part due to his deteriorating eyesight, he grew ever more isolated, with Renoir observing: \u201cAll his friends had to leave him; I was one of the last to go, but even I couldn\u2019t stay til the end.\u201d He remained a bachelor throughout his life and was not known to have any romantic entanglements; Manet noted that Degas was \u201cnot capable of loving a woman.\u201d Degas died in 1917, childless and alone.\n\nEdgar Degas, Monsieur and Madame Edouard Manet, 1868\u201369. Collection of the Municipal Museum of Art, Kitakyushu, Japan. www.bridgemanimages.com\n\n20. A prolific art collector, Degas acquired thousands of paintings, drawings and prints.\n\nDegas\u2019 vast private collection was discovered after his death in 1917, and included works by the 19th century masters Ingres, Delacroix and Daumier, as well as contemporaries including Manet, Cezanne, Gauguin, Cassatt, Pissarro, and Van Gogh. The collection was dispersed and sold at auction in 1918 during the bombardment of Paris.\n\n21.

Considered the last prominent modern art movement, Pop Art appreciates popular culture as opposed to elitist culture. It is characterized by bright colors and use of recognizable imagery from popular culture like advertisements, celebrities, mundane cultural objects and comic book characters. Pop Art may be seen as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism, the then dominant movement which emphasized on conveying strong emotional or expressive content through abstraction. The non-painterly style and the commercial aspect of Pop Art was a stark contrast to the technique and philosophy of Abstract Expressionism. Pop Art emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1950s with the works of artists like Richard Hamilton and Jasper Johns. It gained widespread attention with the emergence of Andy Warhol and it continues to remain relevant through the works of Yayoi Kusama, Romero Britto and Claes Oldenburg. Here are the 10 most famous Pop Art artists and their best known masterpieces.\n\n#10 Claes Oldenburg\n\nLifespan: January 28, 1929 \u2013 July 18, 2022 Nationality: American\n\nClaes Oldenburg\n\nSon of a Swedish diplomat, Claes Oldenburg became a citizen of the United States in 1953. At this time, the American art scene was dominated by the non-representational forms of Abstract Expressionism. Oldenburg, however, went the other way creating sculptures of everyday items. He created giant objects made of cloth stuffed with paper or rags, which became known as \u201csoft-sculptures\u201d. In 1962, he first exhibited his huge soft sculptures. Oldenburg\u2019s work includes food items like ice cream cones, hamburgers and cakes; and mass manufactured items like lipsticks, needles, bicycles and fans. His giant sculptures presented these common objects in such a way that it reversed the traditional relationship between the viewer and these items. Claes Oldenburg was a pioneer in the field of Pop Art sculptures and he is the reigning king of Pop sculpture since the early 1960s.\n\nMasterpiece: Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969)\n\nLipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969) \u2013 Claes Oldenburg\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Clothespin 1976 Floor Cake 1962\n\n#9 Peter Blake\n\nBorn: June 25, 1932 Nationality: British\n\nPeter Blake\n\nPeter Blake is a versatile artist who has produced sculpture, engraving and printmaking, as well as commercial art in the form of graphics. However, he is most renowned for his collages, which combine images from pop culture with fine art. In his vibrant artworks, one may see images of wrestlers, music-hall entertainers, film stars, advertisements etc. along with traditional fine art. Painted between 1955 and 1957, On His Balcony is one of the most famous works of Peter Blake and an iconic piece of pop art. Among other things, it shows a boy holding Edouard Manet\u2019s painting The Balcony. Peter Blake was one of the first Pop Art artists from Britain. He played a key role in the development of the movement in his nation and he is often called the Godfather of British Pop Art. In 2002, Blake was knighted at Buckingham Palace for his services to art.\n\nMasterpiece: Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band Album Cover (1967)\n\nSgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band Album Cover (1967) \u2013 Peter Blake\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR On The Balcony 1957 Self-Portrait with Badges 1961\n\n#8 Jasper Johns\n\nBorn: May 15, 1930 Nationality: American\n\nJasper Johns\n\nJasper Johns is one of the most renowned living artists in the world. His work in painting, sculpture and printmaking has affected nearly every artistic movement since the 1950s to the present including Abstract Expressionism, Neo Dada and the Pop Art movement. Johns was among the artists who laid the foundations of Pop Art movement\u2019s embrace of commodity culture. The main focus of his Pop Art works is signs, like flags, targets and maps. In fact, his best known work is the painting Flag, which is one of the most recognizable artworks of the Pop Art movement. It is said that he created it after having a dream of the American flag. Jasper Johns has received many honors during his lifetime including the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2011. His works constantly receive millions of dollars at sale and auction; and they have held the record for the highest price paid for a work by a living artist multiple times.\n\nMasterpiece: Flag (1955)\n\nFlag (1955) \u2013 Jasper Johns\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Target with Four Faces 1955 Three Flags 1958\n\n#7 Richard Hamilton\n\nLifespan: February 24, 1922 \u2013 September 13, 2011 Nationality: British\n\nRichard Hamilton\n\nAlong with the Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton is considered the pioneer of the Pop Art movement. His 1955 exhibition Man, Machine and Motion; and his 1956 collage Just what is it that makes today\u2019s homes so different, so appealing? are considered by art historians to be among the earliest works of pop art. Just What Is It, a parody of American advertising, in fact gave the name to the Pop Art movement. The name comes from an enormous lollipop in the hands of the central figure in the collage with the brand name \u201cTootsie POP\u201d. Throughout his career, Hamilton explored the relationship between fine art, product design and popular culture. He continued to break down hierarchies of artistic value, making silkscreens of Mick Jagger\u2019s drug arrest, producing studies of industrial design objects and designing the cover of the Beatles\u2019 1968 White Album. Richard Hamilton, more than anyone else, laid the groundwork for the Pop Art movement defining its aims and ideals.\n\nMasterpiece: Just what is it that makes today\u2019s homes so different, so appealing?

He didn\u2019t even have enough money to buy brushes and he thus used his hands and fingers to create his unique style. Britto credits his 1983 trip to Paris for arousing his interest in Modern masters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse; and this had a major impact on his work. He went on to develop his unique style which blended Pop Art with Cubist-like abstraction. Romero Britto is famous for using bright colors and joyful subject matter including Disney characters and animals. His Pop Art has been described by the New York Times as exuding \u201cwarmth, optimism and love\u201d. Romero Britto is one of the best known and most successful living artists in the world.\n\nMasterpiece: Mona Cat (2010)\n\nMona Cat (2010) \u2013 Romero Britto\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Britto Garden 2000 Martini Sunrise 2005\n\n#5 Yayoi Kusama\n\nBorn: March 22, 1929 Nationality: Japanese\n\nYayoi Kusama\n\nYayoi Kusama tasted some early success in Japan and, while there, she developed her signature style of covering things; walls, floors, canvases, household objects and naked assistants; with polka dots. In 1957, at the age of 27, she moved to the United States and became involved in the Pop Art movement. She has said that she faced racism and sexism in America; and that her artworks were copied by her male peers; including Warhol, Oldenburg and Samaras; who then took credit for them by exhibiting them in major galleries. Whatever might be the case, with time, Kusama\u2019s contribution to the Pop Art Movement as well as to the art world was recognized and now she is perhaps the most successful female artist in the world. Kusuma is most renowned for her complex Infinity Mirror installations, rooms in which an observer can experience an illusion of a never-ending space.\n\nMasterpiece: Narcissus Garden (1966)\n\nNarcissus Garden (1966) \u2013 Yayoi Kusama\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Dots Obsession 2003 Repetitive Vision 1996\n\n#4 David Hockney\n\nBorn: June 7, 1965 Nationality: British\n\nDavid Hockney\n\nDavid Hockney is regarded as one of most prominent figures of the Pop Art movement and his 1967 painting A Bigger Splash is an iconic work of Pop Art. Hockney focuses on personal subject matter; and depicts scenes from his own life and that of friends. His famous works include swimming pools, split-level homes and suburban Californian landscapes. Hockney is openly gay and several paintings by him; including Domestic Scene, Los Angeles; explore homosexuality. In 1990, Hockney was offered a knighthood but he declined. However, in January 2012, he accepted the Order of Merit from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2011, in a poll of more than 1,000 British artists, David Hockney was voted the most influential British artist of all time.\n\nMasterpiece: A Bigger Splash (1967)\n\nA Bigger Splash (1967) \u2013 David Hockney\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy 1971 A Bigger Grand Canyon 1998\n\n#3 Keith Haring\n\nLifespan: May 4, 1958 \u2013 February 16, 1990 Nationality: American\n\nKeith Haring\n\nKeith Haring was introduced to art at an early age by his father, who did cartooning as a hobby. In 1978, Haring arrived in New York and became aware of the thriving underground graffiti art scene there. He produced thousands of public drawings and became one of the most renowned graffiti artists. As public interest in his art grew, Haring had his first solo exhibition in 1981. In April 1986, Haring opened his Pop Shop, which made his work accessible at reasonable prices. He created several influential Pop Art pieces on social issues as well as on products like Absolut Vodka, Lucky Strike cigarettes and Coca-Cola. Keith Haring brought the elements of what was termed as \u201clow art\u201d into the formerly exclusive \u201chigh art\u201d spaces of museums and galleries. His art is known for being deceptively simple while containing deeper themes of birth, death, love, sexuality, war and social harmony.\n\nMasterpiece: Crack is Wack (1986)\n\nCrack is Wack (1986) \u2013 Keith Haring\n\nOther Famous Works:-\n\nARTWORK YEAR Tuttomondo 1989 Free South Africa 1985\n\n#2 Roy Lichtenstein\n\nLifespan: October 27, 1923 \u2013 September 29, 1997 Nationality: American\n\nRoy Lichtenstein\n\nRoy Lichtenstein initially worked in Cubism and Abstract Expressionism before moving to Pop Art, the genre in which he made his mark. The first time his work was exhibited, he was called a copycat by many art critics as his works closely resembled the originals. The Life magazine went to the extent of publishing an article whose title asked \u201cIs He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?\u201d Lichtenstein responded by saying, \u201cThe closer my work is to the original, the more threatening and critical the content\u201d. With time, Roy Lichtenstein became one of the leading artists of the Pop Art movement, which dominated the American art world. His best known works, usually inspired by popular advertising and comic strips, have become iconic images of the movement.\n\nMasterpiece: Whaam! (1963)\n\nWhaam!

The non-painterly style and commercial aspects of his paintings initially caused offense as it affronted the technique and philosophy of abstract expressionism, the then dominant style in the United States. His works created an uproar in the American art world and the resulting controversy made Warhol a household name. Warhol was a prolific artist and he explored a wide variety of media including painting, silk-screening, photography, film and sculpture. His paintings are among the most expensive ever sold. The highest price paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 canvas titled Silver Car Crash while, if one adjusts for inflation, his most expensive painting is Eight Elvises at US$111.2. Andy Warhol is without doubt the most famous Pop Artist.\n\nMasterpiece: Marilyn Diptych (1962)\n\nMarilyn Diptych (1962) \u2013 Andy Warhol\n\nOther Famous Works:-"}]}
