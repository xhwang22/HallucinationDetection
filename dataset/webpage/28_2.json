{"Gordon David Strachan played for Dundee.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52951616", "page_content": "Gordon Strachan's career began at Dundee in the mid-1970s and after successful spells with Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United, he was still playing English top-flight football for Coventry at 40.\n\nHe put his longevity down to a diet of porridge, bananas and seaweed tablets, and relied on fitness, acupressure and afternoon naps to extend his playing days.\n\nHere Strachan has chosen his \"basically unbeatable\" XI of former club team-mates.\n\nGoalkeeper: Jim Leighton\n\nThanks to Sportscene, I've been watching some Aberdeen and Scotland games recently. When you look back you think: \"What a good goalkeeper Jim was, making big saves at the right times.\" He was making good hits by good players look simple, when they were bouncing in front of him. The only time he embarrassed himself was when he started running.\n\nCentre-backs: Paul McGrath, Willie Miller & Alex McLeish\n\nStrachan describes his former Manchester United team-mate Paul McGrath, plus Brian Robson and Norman Whiteside, as \"first-class people\"\n\nI couldn't leave Paul McGrath out. He is probably one of the best players I ever played with, considering he was injured and all the problems he had throughout his career. He was a truly magnificent football player. On top of that he was a great lad, always good fun, never a bad word about anybody.\n\nWith those three, the rest of the team could just go out and attack. Any one of them coming forward with the ball to make it eight attacking players with two left behind, I'd have no problems whatsoever. Miller and McLeish could have played for any team in Britain at the time. They just enjoyed defending.\n\nSix of Strachan's greatest XI are in this Aberdeen squad photo from 1983-84\n\nCentre-midfielders: Norman Whiteside, Gary McAllister, Bryan Robson\n\nBryan Robson is the best player I ever played with. He had everything. You could put him in any position. He could score goals and defend. Like Willie Miller, he was a fantastic captain who would put the players first. The only negative was if he asked you if you wanted to go for a night out - it would be three days on the go never leaving a pub!\n\nGary McAllister and I played together at Leeds. He was a wonderful footballer but Leeds made him into a player. A footballer can play sometimes in the conditions that suit them. Gary turned into a player - he could play anywhere, any time, any game, any condition.\n\nRemi Moses, Arnold Muhren, David Batty, Neil Simpson, Neale Cooper, it's unbelievable the players I played with. Dougie Bell was a fantastic player. But Norman Whiteside could score wonder goals, tackle, header. He wasn't the fastest but he was a powerful runner.\n\nStrachan appointed Mark McGhee and Gary McAllister to his coaching team when he was Scotland manager\n\nWide midfielders: Stuart Kennedy & Peter Weir\n\nIf it wasn't for Stuart, I wouldn't be where I was later in my career. Stuart gave us the width and pace and I did the intricate things. We worked well together. Stuart would be at right wing-back.\n\nStrikers: Mark Hughes & Mark McGhee\n\nMark Hughes used to drive you crazy when he was a kid because you'd hit the ball up to him and he'd keep touching it. If you went to support him, you'd run by him because he'd have so many touches. But then he got older and got better and better and he could do anything.\n\nMark McGhee did something every game that was outrageous. He played in every game, he took knocks, he made runs, he held the ball up, he could jump, he was never unfit. Sir Alex [Ferguson, former Aberdeen and Manchester United manager] described him as one of the most important people in that [Aberdeen] team. He and Steve Archibald were absolutely magnificent."}, {"url": "https://deearchive.co.uk/player.php?id=767", "page_content": "Biography\n\nWhen Gordon Strachan returned to Dundee Football Club as Technical Director in 2019, it was great to welcome Gordon home to the club with whom he started his playing career. Gordon came through the youth ranks at Dens and made his first team debut in 1973 before becoming the youngest captain in the club\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nThe more things change in Scottish football, the more they stay the same and for Dundee Football Club, this certainly rings true. Over the years the Dundee fans have had to watch a conveyor belt of nurtured talent leave Dens for a fraction of their worth and new Technical Director Gordon Strachan was one of those, when the Dark Blues let their young captain leave, simply to allow the club to survive.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was nothing remotely glamorous about Dundee Football Club behind the scenes, especially when it ran into serious financial difficulty following relegation\u201d, Strachan wrote in his biography Mt Life in Football.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were fears we would have to go part-time. It was like the footballing equivalent of \u2018I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here\u2019. The players\u2019 training kit \u2013 including our pants \u2013 was only washed once a week on a Friday. After we had trained in it on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, often in terrible conditions, you can imagine what sort of state it was in by the end of the week\u201d\n\n\n\nThe financial situation for Dundee was dire following relegation from the inaugural Premier Division in 1976 and after failing to achieve promotion at the first attempt, Dundee were forced to sell their undoubted star Gordon Strachan to simply stop the bank closing the doors at Dens.\n\n\n\nThe then chairman Ian Gellatly went to manager Tommy Gemmell on Halloween 1977 and told him that the Club had to raise \u00a350,000 by the end of the week or the bank would foreclose and in Gemmell\u2019s autobiography Lionheart he recounts the events.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Monday morning the chairman said to me \u2018We need \u00a350,000 by Friday\u2019. The bank had told him that unless that unless they received that sum of money, they would close the doors of Dens Park. Billy McNeil, who was manager of Aberdeen, had been doing a wee bit of sniffing after Gordon Strachan but I told him Strachan was not available because I knew that if we won promotion to the Premier Division, he would be able to shine at that level. So I phoned Billy up, told him the situation at Dundee, said I would sell Strachan to raise the necessary funds but made it clear he would not be getting him for \u00a350,000; he would need a lot more to purchase the player. After some negotiations we received \u00a385,000 plus Jim Shirra. The money went straight into the bank and Dundee survived to fight another day.\u201d\n\n\n\nGordon David Strachan was born in Edinburgh on February 9th 1957 and raised between a rock and a hard place, Strachan\u2019s Edinburgh was not the craggy outcrop-cum-tourist trap where the castle stands but more something out of the movie Trainspotting on the tough Muirhouse estate. By the age of five he was Hibernian-mad and playing in mass street games and in 1971, when he was a coveted schoolboy international, he was still starring in one such epic at 10.30pm when a Manchester United official arrived at his home. The promise that George Best would be waiting to greet him was meant to be the clincher but showing the principled, stubborn streak that would surface in later years, Strachan sent him away as he had given his word to Dundee.\n\n\n\nWhen Gordon arrived at Dundee from Edinburgh Thistle, there was little doubt about his ability as the wee-ginger haired midfielder was a \u2018tanner ba\u2019 player from the old school and was admired by all for his ball skills.\n\n\n\nDespite some question marks over his slight frame, Gordon made his debut for Dundee as a substitute in the first game of the 1973/74 season in a Drybrough Cup tie at Dens against Raith Rovers but the teenager found it tough to break into the side that would win the League Cup that campaign and made just one further appearance from the bench a fortnight later.\n\n\n\nBut the fiery midfielder was fast earning a reputation as a brilliant player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award and being at Dens was not just a football education fro the flame-haired youngster but it was also an education in life.\n\n\n\nProgress was made the following season with a couple of first team starts and as one paper roared \u201cDundee find new Billy Bremner\u201d, maturity off the pitch was slower in arriving. Caught in the act of quaffing Carlsberg after a Scotland youth match in Copenhagen, he was banned from international duty and another boozy binge with Jimmy Johnstone, the former Celtic winger, ended when they literally ran into their incandescent Dundee manager in his hotel in Errol!\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to look after myself at Dundee\u201d, said Strachan in a Celtic online interview in 2009. \u201cI had moved into digs there when I was fifteen so I had to grow up there quickly. I had to learn to handle the mistakes I made myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill staying in Edinburgh when he first signed, wee Gordon caught the train to Dens on a daily basis and his travelling companions George Stewart and Bobby Ford were known to make the na\u00efve youngster go and get the teas from the buffet car and regularly relieve him of his wages at cards.\n\n\n\nBut he was thriving from the coaching at Dens and told the Celtic Mad website on the eve of his Celtic side\u2019s Scottish Cup tie with Dundee in January 2009 that, \u201cI picked up a lot of good habits there from a coach called Hugh Robertson \u2013 he had been a left-winger for Dundee\u2019s championship side and was fantastic. So I got good coaching there too. I watched a lot of good players there \u2013 Jocky Scott, Gordon Wallace, John Duncan, Dougie Houston \u2013 it was a fantastic place and I picked up a lot of good habits.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn August 1975, Strachan outshone Alan Ball in midfield in a pre-season friendly against Arsenal at Dens and the England World Cup winner made a point of shaking the hand of the eighteen year old when Gordon was substituted in the 2-1 win. He had now more than staked his claim for a regular berth in the new ten-team Premier Division.\n\n\n\nDespite his contribution of six goals in thirty-one starts, Dundee were relegated along with St Johnstone at the end of the season and he made an even greater contribution the following year featuring in forty-two of Dundee\u2019s forty-eight matches, scoring eight goals. It wasn\u2019t enough to help take Dundee back up however as they finished third in the First Division behind St Mirren and surprise packets Clydebank.\n\n\n\nTo everyone it was obvious that the 5ft 6in midfielder was Dundee\u2019s key man and at the start of the 1977/78 season, the Dens starlet was appointed club captain, becoming the youngest player in The Dee\u2019s history to holds that honour. His sparkling form earned him a place on the bench for Scotland Under-21s against Switzerland but the skilful Strachan was becoming a target for some rough treatment, forcing manager Tommy Gemmell to complain that his youngster was \u201cbeing kicked out of the First Division.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn October 29th, Strachan starred in the 1-1 draw with Hearts at Dens but within days he was away to Aberdeen after the bank\u2019s demands and his departure for a relatively small fee would later be cause for bitter regret.\n\n\n\nIt was no surprise to anyone who saw him playing at Dens that he would go on to play in two World Cups, win fifty international caps, the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and Super Cup, two Premier Division titles, three Scottish Cups, one English League title and an F.A. Cup. He would be named Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Player of the Year in 1980 and the English P.F.A. Player of the Year twelve years later in a playing career that would last until he was forty.\n\n\n\nStrachan was linked with the vacant Dundee managerial job in the summer of 1988 as player/manager but he later took that role at Coventry eight years later, which kicked off a successful managerial career. Strachan led Southampton to the F.A. Cup Final in the same year Dundee played Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish equivalent and led Celtic to three S.P.L. titles, two League Cups and one Scottish Cup as well as winning the S.P.F.A. Manager of the Year, three out of his four years at Parkhead.\n\n\n\nAn unsuccessful short stint at Middlesbrough followed his spell in Glasgow\u2019s East End and after a break from the game, where he shared his famous \u2018Strachanisms\u2019 as a TV pundit, he was appointed as manager of the Scotland national team in January 2013, replacing Craig Levein.\n\n\n\nStrachan remained as Scotland manager for the next four years and despite bringing pride and passion back to the national side, failure to qualify for a major tournament saw him leave the post in October 2017, much to the disappointment of the Tartan Army.\n\n\n\n\u201cI loved my time at Dundee. I spent about five years laughing. Maybe I enjoyed myself too much there but it was fantastic\u201d, Gordon recalls and the Dundee fans loved watching him turning out in the famous dark blue shirt. They knew they were watching a prodigious talent who was going to make it big in the game and like so many others in Dundee\u2019s history, it is a regret that he didn\u2019t do it with Dundee through no fault of his own.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/11/gordon-strachans-dual-roles-at-celtic-and-dundee-may-break-sfa-rules", "page_content": "A bizarre arrangement between Gordon Strachan, Celtic and Dundee is to be discussed at the Scottish Football Association\u2019s professional game board as it may breach the governing body\u2019s articles of association.\n\nArticle 13 of the Scottish FA\u2019s rulebook deals with dual interests in clubs; in this case, both play in the same division.

Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982\u201383 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup Final in five seasons with Manchester United. He spent the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989\u201390 Second Division and 1991\u201392 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of Middlesbrough in the English Championship, but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.\n\nStrachan was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the 1990\u201391 season while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan, also footballers.\n\nClub career\n\nBorn and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy. His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery. At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within \"a thousandth of an inch\" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye. He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.\n\nDundee\n\nStrachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14. In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United, reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park. His natural talent was immediately apparent and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award. He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975; The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner. Strachan became a regular player in the 1975\u201376 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches. However David White's \"Dee\" were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.\n\nNew boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976\u201377 First Division campaign, and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee. However, the club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first team place early in the 1977\u201378 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was \"getting kicked a lot\" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker. Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that \"we need \u00a350,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate\". His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6\u20130 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as \"embarrassing\".\n\nAberdeen\n\nStrachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of \u00a350,000 plus Jim Shirra. Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977\u201378 a poor season for Strachan, though the \"Dons\" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers.\n\nMcNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager. Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game's opening goal. Though the 1978\u201379 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979\u201380 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park. They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides en route, where they lost 3\u20130 to Dundee United at Dens Park. At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year. After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.\n\nThe \"Reds\" could only manage a second-place finish in 1980\u201381, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become \"Britain's first \u00a32 million player\", in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games. He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach. With fit-again Strachan on the right flank \u2013 supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy \u2013 and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981\u201382, but had to settle for second place to Celtic. They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4\u20131 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.\n\nThe 1982\u201383 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5\u20131 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup. Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's European success came with a 2\u20131 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1\u20130 win over Rangers. The \"Dons\" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983\u201384, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic. This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.\n\nManchester United\n\nIn August 1984, Manchester United spent \u00a3500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford. However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC K\u00f6ln, United paid \u00a375,000 compensation to resolve the row \u2013 teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany. Strachan opened the 1984\u201385 campaign with four goals in seven matches, though the \"Red Devils\" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1\u20130 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.\n\nAfter winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985\u201386 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury. They proved unable to cope with their injuries \u2013 another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson \u2013 and limped to another fourth-place finish. Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, \"I never thought he'd follow me this far south!\" After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form. United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986\u201387, before rising to second place in 1987\u201388. Strachan's form was again patchy in 1988\u201389, as United slipped back down to 11th.\n\nLeeds United\n\nIn March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of \u00a3200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history. However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division. He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles. Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband. He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989\u201390.\n\nWith the \"Whites\" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed. They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990\u201391, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup. Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.\n\nStrachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991\u201392. In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' hated rivals Manchester United the title. However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back. Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.\n\nHowever, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992\u201393 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League. Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award. He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993. This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4\u20130 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.\n\nStrachan managed 37 starts in 1993\u201394, and Leeds rose to fifth. He was rarely selected in the 1994\u201395 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.\n\nCoventry City\n\nIn March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997. Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson. He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation. However, Isa\u00edas left the club after falling-out with Strachan. Coventry signed Gary McAllister for \u00a33 million on wages of \u00a320,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal. The club struggled at the start of the 1996\u201397 campaign, and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.\n\nInternational career\n\nStrachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Stockholm. He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain. The Scots cruised to a 5\u20132 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, M\u00e1laga; Strachan was named Man of the Match. Scotland then lost 4\u20131 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn, Seville. In the third match, a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union back in M\u00e1laga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.\n\nScotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign. To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg. The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1\u20130 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualc\u00f3yotl to the unseeded \u2013 but highly fancied \u2013 Denmark. Strachan then scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates. In the third and final group match back in Nezahualc\u00f3yotl, Scotland drew 0\u20130 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when Jos\u00e9 Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.\n\nStrachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992. However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles. He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.\n\nManagerial career\n\nCoventry City\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to the manager's seat. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant. After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December. However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the \"Sky Blues\" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.\n\nStrachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan \u2013 all of whom would win international caps. Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997\u201398, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997\u201398 FA Cup. After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs. Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.\n\nThe club finished 15th in 1998\u201399 and 14th in 1999\u20132000, as Strachan spent \u00a36 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and \u00a35 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans. New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool. Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001\u201302 First Division campaign. His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.\n\nSouthampton\n\nStrachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary's Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002\u201303 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press. He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.\n\nCeltic\n\nAfter a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005\u201306, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5\u20130 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4\u20134 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4\u20130. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8\u20131, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association eight days later.\n\nStrachan ahead of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Spartak Moscow , August 2007\n\nThe following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's Derek Riordan; Chelsea's Ji\u0159\u00ed Jaro\u0161\u00edk; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost their round of 16 tie against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2\u20131 victory against Kilmarnock left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. By April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1\u20130 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1\u20130 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, after winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, but failing to lead Celtic to another league title, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nStrachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate. He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager's job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player. His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty. On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5\u20131 away to Queens Park Rangers. After a poor run of results, including a 3\u20130 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1\u20130 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3\u20130.\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season meant Middlesbrough were in 20th place, Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October. He voluntarily ended his contract and left without compensation.\n\nScotland\n\nStrachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein. His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1\u20130 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan's first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots' slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup. After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.\n\nIn Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland. After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland. In their following match, Scotland produced an \"insipid\" performance, as they lost 1\u20130 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play. In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany. Scotland came from behind to lead 2\u20131 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive. A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention. Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association. After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.\n\nManagement style\n\nTypically playing a traditional 4\u20134\u20132 formation, and very occasionally 4\u20135\u20131, Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style, and states that he watches video replays of his club's matches two or sometimes three times. He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed. Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.\n\nRenowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.\n\nEnmity with Alex Ferguson\n\nDespite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, \"I decided this man could not be trusted an inch \u2013 I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.\" In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was \"surprised and disappointed\". The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United. In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.\n\nOther work\n\nStrachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport's Match of the Day 2. He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV's coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV. In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during The Debate on Sky Sports. .....\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children's Villages, the official charity of the tournament.\n\nStrachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.\n\nIn July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.\n\nPersonal life\n\nStrachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man. Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers, and Gemma Strachan.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season

last night\u2019s relegation.\n\nSunSport understands the ex-Celtic and Scotland boss will now assume a Director of Football role at Dens Park.\n\n1 Ex-Celtic boss Gordon Strachan has a new role at Dundee\n\nAnd his first task will be selecting a permanent manager to lead their bid to emerge from the Championship in one season.\n\nDundee were dumped out of the top-flight on Wednesday after St Johnstone secured a 1-0 win over Aberdeen to restore their six-point gap going into the final weekend.\n\nAnd that will spark a major overhaul of how things are run at Dens Park - with Strachan at the centre of it.\n\nHe returned to his first club in 2019 as a technical adviser, with a special remit to overhaul the youth development side.\n\nHowever he has been increasingly influential in recent months and was a key factor behind the arrival of caretaker Mark McGhee to replace James McPake in February.\n\nStrachan\u2019s first-team role will now be formalised as Director of Football, with control of all playing department matters falling at his feet.\n\nIn addition to appointing the long-term gaffer, Strachan will also have control of the playing budget and oversight over recruitment.\n\nThe 65-year-old will sit down with old Aberdeen team-mate McGhee after Sunday\u2019s end of season clash with Livingston to discuss his plans for the future.\n\nBut it looks increasingly likely the one-time Motherwell manager and assistant Simon Rusk will move on.\n\nJack Ross, out of work following his sacking by Hibs late last year, has been strongly linked with a move to the club he played for as a youth, but it\u2019s understood he\u2019s unlikely to end up back on Tayside.\n\nWith club chief John Nelms working on an ambitious new stadium project - and planning permission for that development yet to be submitted - appointing Strachan frees him up to focus on the commercial side.\n\nThe ex-Hoops, Coventry, Middlesbrough, Southampton and Scotland gaffer has a wealth of experience from a half-century in football, so Nelms hopes by passing over responsibility the Dark Blues will finally get things right on the pitch long-term.\n\nMeanwhile, ANGE POSTECOGLOU was visibly emotional as he tried to sum up his feelings at seeing Celtic crowned champions.\n\nAs the manager reflected on his first year in Scotland, he revealed he felt SPEECHLESS at full-time as he came to terms with the achievement.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page"}], "Gordon David Strachan played for Aberdeen.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52951616", "page_content": "Gordon Strachan's career began at Dundee in the mid-1970s and after successful spells with Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United, he was still playing English top-flight football for Coventry at 40.\n\nHe put his longevity down to a diet of porridge, bananas and seaweed tablets, and relied on fitness, acupressure and afternoon naps to extend his playing days.\n\nHere Strachan has chosen his \"basically unbeatable\" XI of former club team-mates.\n\nGoalkeeper: Jim Leighton\n\nThanks to Sportscene, I've been watching some Aberdeen and Scotland games recently. When you look back you think: \"What a good goalkeeper Jim was, making big saves at the right times.\" He was making good hits by good players look simple, when they were bouncing in front of him. The only time he embarrassed himself was when he started running.\n\nCentre-backs: Paul McGrath, Willie Miller & Alex McLeish\n\nStrachan describes his former Manchester United team-mate Paul McGrath, plus Brian Robson and Norman Whiteside, as \"first-class people\"\n\nI couldn't leave Paul McGrath out. He is probably one of the best players I ever played with, considering he was injured and all the problems he had throughout his career. He was a truly magnificent football player. On top of that he was a great lad, always good fun, never a bad word about anybody.\n\nWith those three, the rest of the team could just go out and attack. Any one of them coming forward with the ball to make it eight attacking players with two left behind, I'd have no problems whatsoever. Miller and McLeish could have played for any team in Britain at the time. They just enjoyed defending.\n\nSix of Strachan's greatest XI are in this Aberdeen squad photo from 1983-84\n\nCentre-midfielders: Norman Whiteside, Gary McAllister, Bryan Robson\n\nBryan Robson is the best player I ever played with. He had everything. You could put him in any position. He could score goals and defend. Like Willie Miller, he was a fantastic captain who would put the players first. The only negative was if he asked you if you wanted to go for a night out - it would be three days on the go never leaving a pub!\n\nGary McAllister and I played together at Leeds. He was a wonderful footballer but Leeds made him into a player. A footballer can play sometimes in the conditions that suit them. Gary turned into a player - he could play anywhere, any time, any game, any condition.\n\nRemi Moses, Arnold Muhren, David Batty, Neil Simpson, Neale Cooper, it's unbelievable the players I played with. Dougie Bell was a fantastic player. But Norman Whiteside could score wonder goals, tackle, header. He wasn't the fastest but he was a powerful runner.\n\nStrachan appointed Mark McGhee and Gary McAllister to his coaching team when he was Scotland manager\n\nWide midfielders: Stuart Kennedy & Peter Weir\n\nIf it wasn't for Stuart, I wouldn't be where I was later in my career. Stuart gave us the width and pace and I did the intricate things. We worked well together. Stuart would be at right wing-back.\n\nStrikers: Mark Hughes & Mark McGhee\n\nMark Hughes used to drive you crazy when he was a kid because you'd hit the ball up to him and he'd keep touching it. If you went to support him, you'd run by him because he'd have so many touches. But then he got older and got better and better and he could do anything.\n\nMark McGhee did something every game that was outrageous. He played in every game, he took knocks, he made runs, he held the ball up, he could jump, he was never unfit. Sir Alex [Ferguson, former Aberdeen and Manchester United manager] described him as one of the most important people in that [Aberdeen] team. He and Steve Archibald were absolutely magnificent."}, {"url": "https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=19&lang=en", "page_content": "Gordon Strachan OBE played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City.\n\n\n\nIn club football, he played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals.\n\nHe was part of the Aberdeen side that defeated Real Madrid 2\u20131 to lift the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup in Gothenburg\n\nStrachan earned 50 caps for Scotland, securing his place in the International Roll of Honour.\n\nHe played in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain '82 and Mexico '86, scoring in a 2-1 defeat to West Germany in June 1986.\n\nHe was named as the Football Writers Association Footballer of the Year in 1990/91 season while at Leeds.

The addition of the four Gothenburg Greats to the Hall of Fame completes the XI who started for Aberdeen against Real Madrid in the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final in 1983.\n\nRedTV | to watch the video with Gordon please click here\n\nArguably one of the Dons\u2019 greatest and most important signings, Strachan joined Aberdeen from Dundee in November 1977 when manager Billy McNeill sanctioned a fee of \u00a350,000 plus Jim Shirra to secure his services.\n\nHe struggled at first, before Alex Ferguson was appointed as manager in the summer of 1978. Though the 1978/79 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979/80 after closing a ten-point deficit to Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park, inspired by Gordon. At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year and signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.\n\nGordon went on to become a crucial player in the greatest ever Aberdeen side. With Strachan on the right flank \u2013 supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy \u2013 and record signing Peter Weir on the left, Aberdeen would go on and dominate Scottish football after lifting the Scottish Cup in 1982 with a 4\u20131 extra-time victory over Rangers, Strachan contributing an assist and a goal.\n\n1982/83 saw Aberdeen win the Scottish Cup again as well as the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup following victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. Aberdeen and Strachan continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983/84, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic, the final act of an outstanding Aberdeen career. That win completed a unique treble, as they had defeated SV Hamburg in the 1983 European Super Cup the previous December.\n\nAt the end of that season, Gordon moved to Manchester United after scoring 89 times in 292 outings for the Pittodrie club. He would go on and enjoy success south of the border, the highlight being when he helped Leeds United to a English Championship and then a managerial career followed that included a spell in charge of the Scottish national team. As a player, he was capped 50 times for Scotland, and appeared in two World Cup Finals.\n\nReflecting on his move to Pittodrie, Gordon said, \u201cWhen the offer came to move to Aberdeen, it was a no brainer. It was \u00a325 a week difference! I could not turn that down. I had a house in Dundee, but unfortunately a similar house in Aberdeen was \u00a35,000 more to buy. In Dundee it was \u00a39,000 and in Aberdeen it was \u00a314,500. My \u00a325 did not stretch to central heating, as that was \u00a3500 extra! A garage was another \u00a3500 but I did not have a car!\n\n\u201cI was delighted that Tommy Gemmill did not want me to play for Dundee. It is incredible how life can change, that sliding door thing. I think Dundee got beat by Queen of the South in my last game but fortunately there was a guy there called Mike Jackson who was Billy McNeill\u2019s best friend and he put in a good report to Billy about the way I preformed that night. Because of that I had the opportunity to go to Aberdeen and the rest is a funny, manic story.\n\n\u201cAt the time Aberdeen was known as the main club outside the Old Firm. But what happened next, it snowballed into this thing where we became the best team in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt was not planned as such, it just happened when Sir Alex came along. He changed us from guys who thought we were decent, thought we were competitive into people who were really competitive and did get better.\n\n\u201cBut the laugher was what I remember most. We were all about the same age. Willie was a bit older, two years older that most of the boys. The team that won in Gothenburg, the oldest player was 27. 27! The rest of us were 24 or 25 and in Scotland, at that age you are still looked upon as a young player. We had to grow up and be men very quickly.\n\n\u201cThe whole situation was a one off. There were big characters. There was Willie, big Alex, Doug Rougvie; everyone seemed to be a character and we could all stand up for ourselves. But when the manager walked into the dressing room, we all knew who the boss was.\n\n\u201cHe was a young manager so he had to try and impose himself on us but the drive and energy was incredible. When he got older, his experience and reputation meant that he did not have to have that in your face kind of energy, but I spoke to Darren Fletcher who said he could still be like that when he needed to be. He seemed to be like that every weekend at Aberdeen!\n\n\u201cThey talk about losing a dressing room, well he lost most of us every Saturday night because we all hated him, but by the time Tuesday came around again, we all loved him and knew what we had to do.\n\n\u201cIt was a phenomenal experience to be with Sir Alex and all these guys, most of whom went on to be managers \u2013 different levels of success obviously but to be there when Sir Alex was starting on this road to immortality, we were so lucky to be in his company.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Ally MacLeod and then Billy McNeill laid good foundations for what followed, but could the side have achieved what they did without the influence of Sir Alex?\n\n\u201cThere is no chance we could have won what we did without him. No chance. He was a one off and I would argue with anyone that he is the best manager in British football. I have mentioned a couple of times to him that he helped us get to where we did in our careers but we also helped him!\n\n\u201cEverything just gelled at the right time. This group of players came together but none of it would have happened without him. At the time we thought, \u201cThis is awful being treated like this\u201d, but when you look back you think you would not have missed it. It was a magical experience.\n\n\u201cWhen we meet up, you go into this mode of going back 40 years, into the humour of 40 years ago. You go back to when anything goes and any abuse can get thrown about, whether it be hairstyles, weight you have put on, it does not matter. It is a band of lads who can say anything to each other as long as you get a laugh out of it. It\u2019s great fun meeting them all.\n\n\u201cI especially enjoy meeting Stuart Kennedy again. You need to beef up all your concentration levels because Stuart has an unbelievable memory of things that went on at that time and things I had forgotten all about. He has got them off to a tee. There is about a 50% exaggeration with Stuart now that he sticks on everything, but it\u2019s funny!\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about success, you cannot be successful on your own, you need team mates, specifically people who play in your area and if it was not for Stuart Kennedy, I would not have done half as much as I did in my career. Most right-backs I played with finished when they were around 30 or before. I played until I was 40, so I thank every right back that I played with.\n\n\u201cI am sorry about your careers, but I thank you for mine!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.besoccer.com/player/biography/strachan-266097", "page_content": "No microphone has been detected in the system x\n\nYou need to give permission for the microphone to be used to be able to use it x\n\nError while trying to use the microphone, the browser may not be compatible x"}, {"url": "https://www.thesportsdb.com/player/34171859-Gordon-Strachan", "page_content": "Gordon David Strachan OBE (born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish football coach and former player.

Gordon came through the youth ranks at Dens and made his first team debut in 1973 before becoming the youngest captain in the club\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nThe more things change in Scottish football, the more they stay the same and for Dundee Football Club, this certainly rings true. Over the years the Dundee fans have had to watch a conveyor belt of nurtured talent leave Dens for a fraction of their worth and new Technical Director Gordon Strachan was one of those, when the Dark Blues let their young captain leave, simply to allow the club to survive.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was nothing remotely glamorous about Dundee Football Club behind the scenes, especially when it ran into serious financial difficulty following relegation\u201d, Strachan wrote in his biography Mt Life in Football.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were fears we would have to go part-time. It was like the footballing equivalent of \u2018I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here\u2019. The players\u2019 training kit \u2013 including our pants \u2013 was only washed once a week on a Friday. After we had trained in it on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, often in terrible conditions, you can imagine what sort of state it was in by the end of the week\u201d\n\n\n\nThe financial situation for Dundee was dire following relegation from the inaugural Premier Division in 1976 and after failing to achieve promotion at the first attempt, Dundee were forced to sell their undoubted star Gordon Strachan to simply stop the bank closing the doors at Dens.\n\n\n\nThe then chairman Ian Gellatly went to manager Tommy Gemmell on Halloween 1977 and told him that the Club had to raise \u00a350,000 by the end of the week or the bank would foreclose and in Gemmell\u2019s autobiography Lionheart he recounts the events.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Monday morning the chairman said to me \u2018We need \u00a350,000 by Friday\u2019. The bank had told him that unless that unless they received that sum of money, they would close the doors of Dens Park. Billy McNeil, who was manager of Aberdeen, had been doing a wee bit of sniffing after Gordon Strachan but I told him Strachan was not available because I knew that if we won promotion to the Premier Division, he would be able to shine at that level. So I phoned Billy up, told him the situation at Dundee, said I would sell Strachan to raise the necessary funds but made it clear he would not be getting him for \u00a350,000; he would need a lot more to purchase the player. After some negotiations we received \u00a385,000 plus Jim Shirra. The money went straight into the bank and Dundee survived to fight another day.\u201d\n\n\n\nGordon David Strachan was born in Edinburgh on February 9th 1957 and raised between a rock and a hard place, Strachan\u2019s Edinburgh was not the craggy outcrop-cum-tourist trap where the castle stands but more something out of the movie Trainspotting on the tough Muirhouse estate. By the age of five he was Hibernian-mad and playing in mass street games and in 1971, when he was a coveted schoolboy international, he was still starring in one such epic at 10.30pm when a Manchester United official arrived at his home. The promise that George Best would be waiting to greet him was meant to be the clincher but showing the principled, stubborn streak that would surface in later years, Strachan sent him away as he had given his word to Dundee.\n\n\n\nWhen Gordon arrived at Dundee from Edinburgh Thistle, there was little doubt about his ability as the wee-ginger haired midfielder was a \u2018tanner ba\u2019 player from the old school and was admired by all for his ball skills.\n\n\n\nDespite some question marks over his slight frame, Gordon made his debut for Dundee as a substitute in the first game of the 1973/74 season in a Drybrough Cup tie at Dens against Raith Rovers but the teenager found it tough to break into the side that would win the League Cup that campaign and made just one further appearance from the bench a fortnight later.\n\n\n\nBut the fiery midfielder was fast earning a reputation as a brilliant player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award and being at Dens was not just a football education fro the flame-haired youngster but it was also an education in life.\n\n\n\nProgress was made the following season with a couple of first team starts and as one paper roared \u201cDundee find new Billy Bremner\u201d, maturity off the pitch was slower in arriving. Caught in the act of quaffing Carlsberg after a Scotland youth match in Copenhagen, he was banned from international duty and another boozy binge with Jimmy Johnstone, the former Celtic winger, ended when they literally ran into their incandescent Dundee manager in his hotel in Errol!\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to look after myself at Dundee\u201d, said Strachan in a Celtic online interview in 2009. \u201cI had moved into digs there when I was fifteen so I had to grow up there quickly. I had to learn to handle the mistakes I made myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill staying in Edinburgh when he first signed, wee Gordon caught the train to Dens on a daily basis and his travelling companions George Stewart and Bobby Ford were known to make the na\u00efve youngster go and get the teas from the buffet car and regularly relieve him of his wages at cards.\n\n\n\nBut he was thriving from the coaching at Dens and told the Celtic Mad website on the eve of his Celtic side\u2019s Scottish Cup tie with Dundee in January 2009 that, \u201cI picked up a lot of good habits there from a coach called Hugh Robertson \u2013 he had been a left-winger for Dundee\u2019s championship side and was fantastic. So I got good coaching there too. I watched a lot of good players there \u2013 Jocky Scott, Gordon Wallace, John Duncan, Dougie Houston \u2013 it was a fantastic place and I picked up a lot of good habits.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn August 1975, Strachan outshone Alan Ball in midfield in a pre-season friendly against Arsenal at Dens and the England World Cup winner made a point of shaking the hand of the eighteen year old when Gordon was substituted in the 2-1 win. He had now more than staked his claim for a regular berth in the new ten-team Premier Division.\n\n\n\nDespite his contribution of six goals in thirty-one starts, Dundee were relegated along with St Johnstone at the end of the season and he made an even greater contribution the following year featuring in forty-two of Dundee\u2019s forty-eight matches, scoring eight goals. It wasn\u2019t enough to help take Dundee back up however as they finished third in the First Division behind St Mirren and surprise packets Clydebank.\n\n\n\nTo everyone it was obvious that the 5ft 6in midfielder was Dundee\u2019s key man and at the start of the 1977/78 season, the Dens starlet was appointed club captain, becoming the youngest player in The Dee\u2019s history to holds that honour. His sparkling form earned him a place on the bench for Scotland Under-21s against Switzerland but the skilful Strachan was becoming a target for some rough treatment, forcing manager Tommy Gemmell to complain that his youngster was \u201cbeing kicked out of the First Division.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn October 29th, Strachan starred in the 1-1 draw with Hearts at Dens but within days he was away to Aberdeen after the bank\u2019s demands and his departure for a relatively small fee would later be cause for bitter regret.\n\n\n\nIt was no surprise to anyone who saw him playing at Dens that he would go on to play in two World Cups, win fifty international caps, the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and Super Cup, two Premier Division titles, three Scottish Cups, one English League title and an F.A. Cup. He would be named Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Player of the Year in 1980 and the English P.F.A. Player of the Year twelve years later in a playing career that would last until he was forty.\n\n\n\nStrachan was linked with the vacant Dundee managerial job in the summer of 1988 as player/manager but he later took that role at Coventry eight years later, which kicked off a successful managerial career. Strachan led Southampton to the F.A. Cup Final in the same year Dundee played Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish equivalent and led Celtic to three S.P.L. titles, two League Cups and one Scottish Cup as well as winning the S.P.F.A. Manager of the Year, three out of his four years at Parkhead.\n\n\n\nAn unsuccessful short stint at Middlesbrough followed his spell in Glasgow\u2019s East End and after a break from the game, where he shared his famous \u2018Strachanisms\u2019 as a TV pundit, he was appointed as manager of the Scotland national team in January 2013, replacing Craig Levein.\n\n\n\nStrachan remained as Scotland manager for the next four years and despite bringing pride and passion back to the national side, failure to qualify for a major tournament saw him leave the post in October 2017, much to the disappointment of the Tartan Army.\n\n\n\n\u201cI loved my time at Dundee. I spent about five years laughing. Maybe I enjoyed myself too much there but it was fantastic\u201d, Gordon recalls and the Dundee fans loved watching him turning out in the famous dark blue shirt. They knew they were watching a prodigious talent who was going to make it big in the game and like so many others in Dundee\u2019s history, it is a regret that he didn\u2019t do it with Dundee through no fault of his own.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.aberdeenlive.news/sport/football/football-news/gothenburg-great-gordon-strachans-reveals-8406874", "page_content": "There's a twinkle in Gordon Strachan\u2019s eye as he casts his mind back 40 years this month to the Scottish Cup Final of 1983, writes the Daily Record.\n\nThe day that Aberdeen backed up their incredible European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup triumph over Real Madrid by beating Rangers at Hampden thanks to Eric Black\u2019s extra-time winner \u2013 only to earn the rollicking of all time from gaffer Alex Ferguson. \u201cWe\u2019re the luckiest team in the world,\u201d Fergie ranted in an interview on the Hampden turf minutes after Willie Miller had held the cup aloft. \u201cWe were a disgrace of a performance.\n\n\u201cMiller and (Alex) McLeish won the Cup for Aberdeen.

No way can we take any glory from it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Barry Robson admits Aberdeen are preparing for busy transfer window beyond end of the season\n\nStrachan is speaking on the Off The Record podcast and there\u2019s a gleefulness as the memories roll in. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him (Ferguson) about this and told him it\u2019s made me laugh for the last 40 years. Not at the time, but it\u2019s wonderful.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it was like: \u2018What happened there? Did we not just win that?\u2019 We had our winners\u2019 medals on the bus and everybody\u2019s crying, not speaking to each other. He kept saying: \u2018McLeish and Miller won it, McLeish and Miller won it\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo every time I see big Alex, he asks me: \u2018Have you still got that medal I won for you?\u2019\n\n\u201cUsually you get an open top bus when you win the cup, but we really just needed a tandem. Willie and Alex waving from their tandem. The whole day was hilarious and it was really strange behaviour but when you look back on it now, it\u2019s absolute gold and I wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world.\u201d\n\nStrachan had his fall-outs with Fergie but time has mellowed both firebrands and they now have a warm relationship. And the former Dons midfielder admits that learning from arguably Britain\u2019s greatest manager of all time was a privilege.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were competitive before he arrived, but we weren\u2019t really,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe were bad tempered, girny, moany wee kids. He changed it from that to: \u2018Do you really want to win? Well, your whole life has to be about being ready to win.\n\nJoin our Aberdeen FC Facebook group for all the latest Dons news\n\n\"You have to give up everything to win. You have to be disliked to win and you have to change your mentality if you really want to win.\u2019 He taught us what winning meant. And we were just scared of getting beat - absolutely petrified!\u201d\n\nStrachan smiles at memories of the player he was initially, to the player he became under the gruff Glaswegian. I was useless for a year when I went to Aberdeen,\u201d he says. Absolutely minging.\n\n\u201cWhen they named the team over the tannoy, No.6 Willie Miller would get a big cheer. No.7 Gordon Strachan... mumbling. But what would you pay to be in a dressing room with Sir Alex at his best? We had it for 300-400 games.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cAt times you thought it was a bit much, but it was wonderful. Looking back now, how lucky were we to be at that point when Sir Alex was at his rawest? Forget wind and sea and waves, he could have created energy from that dressing room. The standards were everywhere. Everything we did, the way we dressed. He\u2019d know where we were.\n\n\u201cThe discipline was there even for the youth team players. My babysitters were Bryan Gunn and Eric Black. Sir Alex would ask them where they were going on a Saturday night and they\u2019d tell him and he\u2019d say: \u2018No you\u2019re not, you\u2019re babysitting for McGhee or Strachan.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt worked both ways \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t go out and have a drink AND on the Monday morning he\u2019d have them in and ask them: \u2018What time did Strachan get in on Saturday night.? Was he with McGhee? Were they eating curries?\u2019\n\n\u201cI remember getting sent off against Tottenham in a friendly on a Tuesday night, so he sent me up to Elgin with the B team the following night! The discipline was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nStrachan and Ferguson were front and centre of a golden era for Scottish football in the early 80s. People think Aberdeen dominated the 80s. Well, you had Dundee United and Celtic. Celtic were a right good side. They won the league twice, Dundee United won it once.\n\n\u201cIn the UEFA rankings, Aberdeen were first at one point, Celtic got to 11th and Dundee United got to between 11th and 15th at times. So to win that league at that time, not only did you have to beat Rangers \u2013 you had to beat two of the top teams in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt was phenomenal. Dundee United were getting to finals, beating Barcelona. That was a wonderful period for Scottish football. The competitiveness was unbelievable. The Dundee United team was magnificent and the Rangers team was always going to give you problems. We played them in a couple of finals and they were always there, so you had to beat some of the best teams in Europe to win the league.\u201d\n\nStrachan had moved to Manchester United by the time the pair were reunited with Scotland. \u201cI always knew he\u2019d end up going somewhere,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the 1986 World Cup he was in the room next to me and I asked him one morning if he was thinking of moving on. \u2018I\u2019m only going to leave Aberdeen for Barcelona or Man United,\u2019 he said, and I\u2019m hoping to Christ it\u2019s Barcelona!\n\n(Image: Popperfoto/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI should have known because people at Manchester United like Martin Edwards always kept asking me questions about him.\n\n\u201cThey were picking my brains. When Sir Alex came down it took him a wee while to get it going because he had huge characters there.\n\nSign up to our Aberdeen F.C newsletter Get all the latest Aberdeen F.C news sent straight to your Inbox by signing up to our newsletter.

Alex Ferguson hoists a bottle of bubbly into the air. There are smiles all round, and the 1980s-style facial hair is prominent.\n\n\u201cThat was taken when we won the league for the first time,\u201d Strachan says in an interview for Pundit Arena with Boylesports, as he is shown the photograph on the back of Michael Grant\u2019s excellent 2014 book Fergie Rises.\n\nIt tells the story of how Ferguson made his name at Aberdeen, not only by putting the dominance of Celtic and Rangers on hold, but by taking on the best that Europe had to offer.\n\nIn all, the future Manchester United icon won three Scottish Premier Division titles with the Dons, along with four Scottish Cups, a League Cup, and, most notably of all, the 1983 European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, when they defeated the mighty Real Madrid in the final in Gothenburg.\n\nHowever, it was that 1979/80 league title win, clinched with a 5-0 win away at Hibernian on May 3rd, that kicked it all off.\n\nGordon Strachan and the Aberdeen glory years.\n\n\u201cIt was at Easter Road, where I\u2019m from in Edinburgh,\u201d Strachan explains, his face alight with nostalgia as he examines the photograph through the computer screen. \u201cGeorge the bus driver is there as well. I could tell you some stories about George.\n\n\u201cIt was a great day for me because my dad\u2019s local social club is about half a mile down the road and I ended up there on the Saturday night, after we won that\u2026 and I won the bingo as as well!\u201d\n\nAberdeen achieve success at home and abroad.\n\nAberdeen would become Scottish champions again in 1984 and 1985, adding to their only pre-Ferguson league title, which was won in 1955.\n\nSince that golden era, no other club outside of the \u2018Old Firm\u2019 of Celtic and Rangers has been crowned champions.\n\nAberdeen\u2019s was a team that Scotland won\u2019t see the like of again any time soon, and Strachan is clear on what he feels are the reasons for that.\n\n\u201cAberdeen, Celtic, Hibs, Rangers, we were all getting the same wages,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe only difference was if you won something, your wages would go up. That was the only way you would get a decent three-piece suite or a holiday.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s not going to happen again. It\u2019s 37 years since somebody won the league outside of the Old Firm, and it could be another 37 years.\u201d\n\nAlex Ferguson influence.\n\nLeaving Scotland\u2019s icy north-east for Manchester United in the summer of 1984 meant that Strachan missed out on Aberdeen\u2019s final league title success a year later, as well as their domestic cup double in 1986.\n\nBy then, that legendary team had started to split up, and even Ferguson was on the lookout for pastures new. Following the sudden death of Jock Stein at a World Cup qualifying game in Cardiff in September 1985, Ferguson took temporary charge of the Scotland national team, leading them at the tournament in Mexico the following summer.\n\nIt was here that Ferguson first pitched to Strachan that he was interested in following him to Manchester, an idea that the former midfielder wasn\u2019t initially on board with.\n\n\u201cWhen we were at the World Cup in 1986, he was in the room next to me,\u201d Strachan explains. \u201cHe came in one morning and said \u2018I\u2019m only going to leave Aberdeen for two teams \u2013 Barcelona or Man United.\n\n\u201cI went \u2018I hope to f*** it\u2019s Barcelona'\u201d.\n\nStrachan lets out a hearty laugh as he delivers that punchline, before adding: \u201cbut no, he\u2019s the best thing to ever happen to Man United.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018hairdryer\u2019.\n\nWhile his relationship with Ferguson has been tetchy in the past, he speaks of his former boss with the greatest of respect, even if he was on the receiving end of the infamous \u2018hairdryer\u2019 on more than a few occasions.\n\n\u201cSome of the things that were said to me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI speak to Mark McGhee and we used to say it would happen to other people. You\u2019d sit and watch it yourself and go \u2018oooh \u2013 that\u2019s horrific,\u2019 and you just feel sorry for the guys.\n\n\u201cThe good thing was, if you were on the receiving end of it, we used to have a therapy group. We all used to get together and go \u2018ah, never mind, we\u2019ve all had it\u2019. It was like therapy.\n\n\u201cBut it worked. Whatever he did, it worked. It never affected me. I never became a mass killer, I never turned to drugs. I spoke to him recently and he said \u2018did I actually say that?\u2019 and I went \u2018ya did\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell ya though\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world. Because I\u2019m the lucky one, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s been in the dressing room with him.\n\n\u201cAny football people would like to be sitting in that chair listening to him. It\u2019s just priceless. For any of us that have been in there, we\u2019re so lucky to have been on the receiving end of it.\n\n\u201cSome people got it more than others. One in particular sitting right in front of you. It was probably my fault.\u201d\n\nMaking his own way.\n\nSuch was the influence of Ferguson, that Strachan tried to copy his style when he entered the management game himself.\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson moved upstairs at Coventry City in 1996, it was Strachan who took over, and he soon found out that the best way forward was to be himself.\n\n\u201cI tried to be Alex Ferguson in my first team-talk at Coventry,\u201d he says. \u201cHalfway through it, I thought to myself \u2018I\u2019m trying to be Alex Ferguson here\u2019. I stopped and I went outside the door, I just shut the door.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself \u2018I can never do this. There\u2019s only one of him. And maybe I don\u2019t even want to be him. I have to be myself\u2019. There\u2019s only one, I think people have tried, but he was a one-off. Also remember, it\u2019s a different world now, of discipline.\u201d\n\nDealing with the media.\n\nAnother way in which football has changed is that today\u2019s managers have to deal with the intense scrutiny of social media.\n\nDuring Strachan\u2019s early days in management, and the same is true of Ferguson before him, that criticism predominantly came from those writing in newspapers.\n\nStrachan expressed views on the pitfalls of both eras, and recalled how Ferguson leaned on another legendary United boss, Matt Busby, during his early struggles at Old Trafford.\n\n\u201cYoung players today have got other pressures, social media and all the rest,\u201d says the 65-year-old.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go on social media, go on social media, if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t. That\u2019s my advice. Some of the advice that Matt Busby gave Alex Ferguson when he first got there\u2026\n\n\u201cAlex said to him after about a year: \u2018I\u2019m getting slaughtered in the press,\u2019 and Matt went \u2018Well, don\u2019t read it\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived by that throughout my career, especially at Celtic. I never read a thing. I know what\u2019s going on but you have to win games, so you don\u2019t get affected by this fantasy stress. I think that\u2019s what players do today.\n\n\u201cI can only deal with reality and that\u2019s what Sir Alex did. Just dealt with reality. Then you can focus on what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan on the two Keanes.\n\nOut of four jobs in club management, that Celtic gig was the one which brought trophies, as he led the club to three Scottish Premiership titles in-a-row, while winning a Scottish Cup and two League Cups for good measure.\n\nSuch was the talent in that team that even one of Ireland\u2019s greatest-ever players struggled to force his way into it, as Strachan explains of the time he took Roy Keane on board, after the Corkman\u2019s acrimonious 2005 departure from Manchester United.\n\n\u201cIt was put in front of me, we can get Roy Keane,\u201d he recalls. \u201cFantastic, he\u2019s magnificent, I\u2019m still a reasonably young manager at the time.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve got to be honest with him. I had Neil Lennon and Stiliyan Petrov as the two central midfield players who were doing very well.\n\n\u201cSo I had the meeting with Roy and said \u2018at the moment, these two will be my starting ones\u2019. I think he wrote in his book that I didn\u2019t really want him there. I did want him there, but I needed a way to fit him in. What are the consequences of Roy Keane coming and not getting a game?\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed his company as a player. He sets standards, he played through injuries. I remember one game at Ibrox against Rangers, they break and we\u2019re winning 1-0 and he just wipes the guy out, took the yellow card. Most of my players wouldn\u2019t have done that, and we could have drawn the game.\n\n\u201cI tried my best to convince him to play longer. I remember the phone call, he was away somewhere and he said \u2018my body\u2019s had enough\u2019 and I said \u2018we\u2019re going to be in the Champions League next year. I\u2019d like you to stay\u2019. Because he just had this presence but he\u2019d made his mind up. You know what he\u2019s like when he makes his mind up.\n\n\u201cBut I really enjoyed the six months I worked with him and actually, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on TV together and I think his company is fantastic.\u201d\n\nRobbie Keane.\n\nWhile Strachan managed one of the famous Irish Keanes at the tail-end of his career, it was another, Robbie, who he came across as an enthusiastic youngster.\n\nStrachan was manager of Coventry in the summer of 1999, when the opportunity to sign the hugely-talented teenager came up, after Keane had scored 29 goals in just over two seasons for Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nHe would work with the Dubliner for just one year, before Keane made the move to Italy to play for a star-studded Inter Milan side.\n\nOne word to sum up the striker? Strachan doesn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cGenius,\u201d he says. \u201cWonderful lad. When he was at Wolves, I saw him in pre-season playing against Barcelona. He was playing against top centre-halves, I think Carles Puyol was one of them at the time.\n\n\u201cHe had him all over the place with his movement. About 18 months later, the chairman says we can spend X amount of money, I said \u2018get Robbie Keane\u2019.\n\n\u201cMan United were after him at the same time. I fell unwell. I was in my bed for a couple of days. I really wasn\u2019t well at all, I think it was a viral thing.\n\n\u201cThe chairman got on with it and signed him, but I was never involved in it, as such. I woke up after about two days and the chairman said \u2018I\u2019ve signed Robbie Keane,\u2019 I went \u2018really? When did that happen?\u2019\n\n\u201cI thought it was a dream. Anyway, he was there for a year. Magnificent. His first day at training, he left Paul Williams on his backside after a pass from Gary McAllister.\n\n\u201cHe went to the ball and spun in behind, and I remember trying to teach other kids how to do this in training\u2026 I\u2019m still doing it to this day.\n\n\u201cI said to him \u2018where did you learn that? Who coached you that?\u2019 and he went \u2018learn what?\u2019 I said \u2018that\u2026 when you went on the ball and you spun and went in behind and the centre-half fell on their backside\u2019\u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Had you not been taught that?\u2019 and he went \u2018no\u2019. There\u2019s this self-learning thing in his head.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand it when you\u2019re signing players. Everybody forgets this\u2026 does he have an intellect to learn things? If he can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have the same player all the time when you sign him. So he was a genius.\n\n\u201cWhen he got there, we said once you sign for us and you do well here, you\u2019ll move.\n\nInter Milan come calling.\n\n\u201cWithin a couple of months, Inter Milan wanted to sign him. He didn\u2019t have a clue. These days, you\u2019d always have a clue. I knew what his wages were going to be. I knew what his wages were at Coventry.\n\n\u201cI said to him \u2018Inter Milan want to sign you, they want you to play up front with Ronaldo and they\u2019ll triple your wages. Go away and think about it and give me a call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for that call! Every time I see him I tell him. My wife Lesley and myself, we met him as a young lad and we\u2019re so happy that his career went so well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lucky boy that I\u2019ve been able to manage both the Keanes, how good is that?\u201d\n\nScotland job.\n\nIn January 2013, over two years after leaving Middlesbrough, Strachan answered the call to become the manager of the Scottish national team.\n\nWhile qualification for Euro 2016 proved a stretch too far, there were some good results along the way, including a famous 1-0 win over Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s Ireland side at Celtic Park in November 2014.\n\nWhen asked if he misses management, Strachan reveals that it\u2019s that Scotland job that gave him the fondest memories.\n\n\u201cI miss the Scotland gig,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was perfect for me at that time of my career. I could go and watch football during the week. It was always on my mind, whether I was in a tracksuit or not.\n\n\u201cI only had to deal with the media maybe three times or twice \u2013 wonderful. I could go and coach and watch football and enjoy the game itself, the love of the game and do very little media work. Not that that put me off or anything, I did enjoy a lot of it, but dealing with that is probably the hardest part of my job.\n\n\u201cThe only time I was really happy was coaching and working with players. Then I could go away and do other things that I was involved with, family, so many things I could do.\n\n\u201cThere were other things I had in my mind, working with youth football, how can we make youth football better. I worked with a great bunch of people who I speak to quite regularly now.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan\u2019s career.\n\nStrachan has fit a lot into his career from those early days at Aberdeen, both as a player and a manager, and his enthusiasm for the game is evident in how he speaks about it.\n\nWhile he is now over five years out of management, he keeps busy by coaching young players and speaking on the after-dinner circuit.\n\nBoth pursuits would appear to suit him down to the ground, with his undoubted passion for coaching and his ability to tell a great story.\n\nThere are plenty more photos like the one on the back of Michael Grant\u2019s book, and perhaps one day Strachan will sit down with another well-earned Coke and take it all in.\n\nGordon Strachan was speaking as a Boylesports ambassador.

When you look back you think: \"What a good goalkeeper Jim was, making big saves at the right times.\" He was making good hits by good players look simple, when they were bouncing in front of him. The only time he embarrassed himself was when he started running.\n\nCentre-backs: Paul McGrath, Willie Miller & Alex McLeish\n\nStrachan describes his former Manchester United team-mate Paul McGrath, plus Brian Robson and Norman Whiteside, as \"first-class people\"\n\nI couldn't leave Paul McGrath out. He is probably one of the best players I ever played with, considering he was injured and all the problems he had throughout his career. He was a truly magnificent football player. On top of that he was a great lad, always good fun, never a bad word about anybody.\n\nWith those three, the rest of the team could just go out and attack. Any one of them coming forward with the ball to make it eight attacking players with two left behind, I'd have no problems whatsoever. Miller and McLeish could have played for any team in Britain at the time. They just enjoyed defending.\n\nSix of Strachan's greatest XI are in this Aberdeen squad photo from 1983-84\n\nCentre-midfielders: Norman Whiteside, Gary McAllister, Bryan Robson\n\nBryan Robson is the best player I ever played with. He had everything. You could put him in any position. He could score goals and defend. Like Willie Miller, he was a fantastic captain who would put the players first. The only negative was if he asked you if you wanted to go for a night out - it would be three days on the go never leaving a pub!\n\nGary McAllister and I played together at Leeds. He was a wonderful footballer but Leeds made him into a player. A footballer can play sometimes in the conditions that suit them. Gary turned into a player - he could play anywhere, any time, any game, any condition.\n\nRemi Moses, Arnold Muhren, David Batty, Neil Simpson, Neale Cooper, it's unbelievable the players I played with. Dougie Bell was a fantastic player. But Norman Whiteside could score wonder goals, tackle, header. He wasn't the fastest but he was a powerful runner.\n\nStrachan appointed Mark McGhee and Gary McAllister to his coaching team when he was Scotland manager\n\nWide midfielders: Stuart Kennedy & Peter Weir\n\nIf it wasn't for Stuart, I wouldn't be where I was later in my career. Stuart gave us the width and pace and I did the intricate things. We worked well together. Stuart would be at right wing-back.\n\nStrikers: Mark Hughes & Mark McGhee\n\nMark Hughes used to drive you crazy when he was a kid because you'd hit the ball up to him and he'd keep touching it. If you went to support him, you'd run by him because he'd have so many touches. But then he got older and got better and better and he could do anything.\n\nMark McGhee did something every game that was outrageous. He played in every game, he took knocks, he made runs, he held the ball up, he could jump, he was never unfit. Sir Alex [Ferguson, former Aberdeen and Manchester United manager] described him as one of the most important people in that [Aberdeen] team. He and Steve Archibald were absolutely magnificent."}, {"url": "https://www.besoccer.com/player/biography/strachan-266097", "page_content": "No microphone has been detected in the system x\n\nYou need to give permission for the microphone to be used to be able to use it x\n\nError while trying to use the microphone, the browser may not be compatible x"}, {"url": "https://mufcinfo.com/manupag/a-z_player_archive/a-z_player_archive_pages/strachan_gordon.html", "page_content": "\n\nA-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-V-W-X-Y-Z Click on above letter for surname of player Gordon David Strachan\n\nYour browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.

In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and playing in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\n\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982\u201383 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup.

He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\n\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title.

For people to give you that pressure and stress, to achieve it is wonderful.\n\n\"I then became an influence again, which I wasn't at Manchester United.

Strachan wasn\u2019t the only new face in the Leeds side that day, with fellow new recruit Chris Fairclough also included in the side for the first time as Ian Baird\u2019s goal secured the Whites all three points. Strachan\u2019s appearance against Portsmouth was the first of 245 outings he would make for Leeds.\n\nManager Howard Wilkinson who had arrived in the previous October from Sheffield Wednesday had at this point steered the side away from the threat of relegation and was now intent on building a side to challenge for promotion in the following 1989/90 season. The arrival of Strachan from arch rivals Manchester United was seen as a major coup for the club. Like Wilkinson, Strachan dropped down from the First Division to join Second Division Leeds and arrived with a glorious playing career, having won the Scottish Football League twice, the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and European Super Cup with Aberdeen, along with the FA Cup at Manchester United. Wilkinson, managing director Bill Fotherby and chairman Leslier Silver all played key roles in persuading Strachan to move to Elland Road and it went on to be one of the most successful periods in the club\u2019s history.\n\n\ufeff\n\nWilkinson named Strachan as his captain for the 1989/90 season. The Whites manager made more additions throughout the summer and five players made their debuts in the opening day defeat away at Newcastle United. Strachan scored his first goal of the campaign in a 1-1 draw away at Stoke City in September. He scored his only hat-trick for the club against Swindon Town as the Robins were defeated 4-0 at Elland Road as Leeds made it six unbeaten in the league following the opening loss, moving up to fourth spot.\n\nIn November, Strachan netted in back to back home games as Plymouth were beaten 2-1 and AFC Bournemouth defeated 3-0 as Leeds\u2019 unbeaten league run reached 15 games, with the club now sitting in second spot. He then netted for his third straight league match, but Leeds\u2019 good run came to an end with a narrow 4-3 defeat against Leicester City at Filbert Street. Throughout January and February, Strachan once more scored in three straight league matches against Stoke City, Swindon Town and Hull City.\n\nIn our final home match of the season, Strachan scored a vital goal in the 84th minute with a fabulous strike from the edge of the area. Leicester City were defeated 2-1 at Elland Road and it meant Leeds went into the final day of the season away at Bournemouth top of the league, knowing victory would secure both promotion and the Second Division Championship. Strachan led Leeds out at Dean Court and Lee Chapman\u2019s goal secured the Whites a 1-0 victory and promotion to the top flight. Strachan followed in the footsteps of Jim Baker and Bobby Collins in captaining Leeds to glory in the second tier, playing in all 46 league games and scoring a total of 16 goals.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \"Have you ever seen a better goal, and seen one better timed?\" https://t.co/IYP90JQ6Ee pic.twitter.com/5m9ADWnWpm \u2014 Leeds United (@LUFC) March 25, 2020\n\nGary McAllister was brought in from Leicester City ahead of the 1990/91 First Division campaign and he formed the final piece of an iconic midfield, including Strachan and young duo David Batty and Gary Speed who had come through the ranks at the club. The Whites began life back in the top flight with a 3-2 victory over Everton at Goodison Park and Strachan scored his first goal of the season in a 2-0 victory over fellow newly promoted side Sheffield United at Elland Road. He netted against Arsenal in September before again netting three in a row against Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Derby County in November. He was on the score-sheet against Everton and Luton Town and also helped the club reach the semi-final of the League Cup, but the Whites were defeated by Manchester United over two legs. Strachan ended the season having played in 34 of Leeds\u2019 38 league matches, scoring seven goals. Leeds finished fourth place in the first season back in the top flight, picking up 64 points.\n\nWilkinson strengthened the side again for the 1991/92 campaign, in what was the last ever First Division, prior to the formation of the Premier League. Leeds made a great start to the campaign going 10 games unbeaten, with Strachan netting a brace in a 4-0 away win at Southampton, along with efforts in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal and 3-0 victory over Manchester City at Elland Road. Strachan missed Leeds\u2019 first league defeat of the season against Crystal Palace and the Whites went 22 First Division matches undefeated with Strachan in the side, before falling to defeat away at Oldham Athletic in February 1992.\n\n\ufeffLeeds and Strachan\u2019s former club Manchester United had been neck and neck in the race for the title throughout the campaign, but Leeds\u2019 hopes suffered a major blow after a 4-0 defeat at Maine Road against Manchester City left Manchester United a point ahead of Leeds with two games in hand and a total of seven left to play. After both sides drew on Saturday 18th April, Manchester United had gained a two point advantage and had four games left to Leeds\u2019 three. However with the title looking like it was heading over the Pennines, there was a final twist. Strachan captained Leeds to victory over Coventry City, whilst Manchester United were defeated at home to Nottingham Forest, which saw Leeds go top. The Red Devils then lost their game in hand away at West Ham and on Sunday 26th April, Leeds went to Bramall Lane and defeated Sheffield United 3-2. In the late kick-off, Manchester United lost a third game in a row at Liverpool, ensuring Leeds had won the First Division title for the third time in the club\u2019s history. In the final game of the campaign against Norwich City at Elland Road, Strachan became the second Leeds captain to lift the First Division, just as Billy Bremner had done in 1969 and 1974.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\nStrachan came on as a substitute in the 1992 Charity Shield victory over Liverpool and made 44 appearances in all competitions in the following season, scoring six goals and was named the club\u2019s Player of the Year. He was also awarded an OBE for his services to football.\n\nThe 1993/94 season was Strachan\u2019s last full season at Leeds and he made 38 appearances. His final Leeds match came in the 1994/95 campaign, on New Year\u2019s Eve as Liverpool defeated the Whites 2-0 at Elland Road. Strachan announced his retirement from football, before eventually being tempted to move to Coventry City in March 1994 to become a player coach, ahead of going on to manage the club. He also went on to have managerial stints at Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and the Scotland national side.\n\nStrachan remains a club icon at Leeds United and remains the only captain to have lifted both the Second Division and First Division titles."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52951616", "page_content": "Gordon Strachan's career began at Dundee in the mid-1970s and after successful spells with Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United, he was still playing English top-flight football for Coventry at 40.\n\nHe put his longevity down to a diet of porridge, bananas and seaweed tablets, and relied on fitness, acupressure and afternoon naps to extend his playing days.\n\nHere Strachan has chosen his \"basically unbeatable\" XI of former club team-mates.\n\nGoalkeeper: Jim Leighton\n\nThanks to Sportscene, I've been watching some Aberdeen and Scotland games recently. When you look back you think: \"What a good goalkeeper Jim was, making big saves at the right times.\" He was making good hits by good players look simple, when they were bouncing in front of him. The only time he embarrassed himself was when he started running.\n\nCentre-backs: Paul McGrath, Willie Miller & Alex McLeish\n\nStrachan describes his former Manchester United team-mate Paul McGrath, plus Brian Robson and Norman Whiteside, as \"first-class people\"\n\nI couldn't leave Paul McGrath out. He is probably one of the best players I ever played with, considering he was injured and all the problems he had throughout his career. He was a truly magnificent football player. On top of that he was a great lad, always good fun, never a bad word about anybody.\n\nWith those three, the rest of the team could just go out and attack. Any one of them coming forward with the ball to make it eight attacking players with two left behind, I'd have no problems whatsoever. Miller and McLeish could have played for any team in Britain at the time. They just enjoyed defending.\n\nSix of Strachan's greatest XI are in this Aberdeen squad photo from 1983-84\n\nCentre-midfielders: Norman Whiteside, Gary McAllister, Bryan Robson\n\nBryan Robson is the best player I ever played with. He had everything. You could put him in any position. He could score goals and defend. Like Willie Miller, he was a fantastic captain who would put the players first. The only negative was if he asked you if you wanted to go for a night out - it would be three days on the go never leaving a pub!\n\nGary McAllister and I played together at Leeds. He was a wonderful footballer but Leeds made him into a player. A footballer can play sometimes in the conditions that suit them. Gary turned into a player - he could play anywhere, any time, any game, any condition.\n\nRemi Moses, Arnold Muhren, David Batty, Neil Simpson, Neale Cooper, it's unbelievable the players I played with. Dougie Bell was a fantastic player. But Norman Whiteside could score wonder goals, tackle, header. He wasn't the fastest but he was a powerful runner.\n\nStrachan appointed Mark McGhee and Gary McAllister to his coaching team when he was Scotland manager\n\nWide midfielders: Stuart Kennedy & Peter Weir\n\nIf it wasn't for Stuart, I wouldn't be where I was later in my career. Stuart gave us the width and pace and I did the intricate things. We worked well together. Stuart would be at right wing-back.\n\nStrikers: Mark Hughes & Mark McGhee\n\nMark Hughes used to drive you crazy when he was a kid because you'd hit the ball up to him and he'd keep touching it. If you went to support him, you'd run by him because he'd have so many touches. But then he got older and got better and better and he could do anything.\n\nMark McGhee did something every game that was outrageous. He played in every game, he took knocks, he made runs, he held the ball up, he could jump, he was never unfit. Sir Alex [Ferguson, former Aberdeen and Manchester United manager] described him as one of the most important people in that [Aberdeen] team. He and Steve Archibald were absolutely magnificent."}, {"url": "https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/29512/gordon-strachan-played-for-both", "page_content": "One of Leeds United\u2019s greatest ever players, the Scotland international midfielder was signed from Manchester United by Howard Wilkinson. Here, Gordon Strachan reflects on his time at both clubs...\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nGordon, thanks so much for joining us! Can we start by asking how are you are and what you\u2019re up to at the minute?\n\n\u201cI am great, thank you. I am semi-retired \u2013 my wife thinks \u2013 but I am working now more than ever. The good thing is, I work when I want to work. At this very moment I am up at Dundee with lovely blue skies, but I tell you what, it\u2019s freezing! I had an opportunity to come here to Dundee which is where I started my career to help develop the youth players and bring them on. I work with the coaches and the younger players \u2013 Covid has restricted things obviously \u2013 and I help the manager at times as well, you can maybe think of it as a sports psychologist. My wife is also here so there is plenty for her to do as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also been doing some work for Celtic. I\u2019ve done a report for the owners and the board there. And I\u2019ve got The Strachan Football Foundation in the Midlands. What we do there is help kids who leave school at 16 and haven\u2019t made their mind up about where they want to go or what they want to do. So, they come to us and train like footballers, work hard and be disciplined, then in the afternoon they do their education. We\u2019ve got about 80 students at the minute, so a group of 40 will train in the morning while the other 40 are in the classroom, then in the afternoon we will reverse that. We have three games a week \u2013 but you will not play if you are not keeping up with your education as well. It\u2019s a not-for-profit organisation which we started out thinking we could make footballers, but then we realised that most of the kids there just wanted to be involved in football, so we found other routes. We\u2019ve now got students around the world doing coaching, sports science, data analysts, sports journalism, plus we also have about eight playing full-time football, so it\u2019s been great! It\u2019s been great for education more than it has for full-time players. I think we\u2019ve helped over 500 kids into full-time employment now.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\n\nNow it\u2019s time to begin our trip down memory lane. What are your memories of how you joined Manchester United?\n\n\u201cMy contract was up at Aberdeen, so it was time to move on. I had been there seven years. We\u2019d done everything, we\u2019d won the league, the cup, the European Cup \u2013 so we couldn\u2019t do anymore, and it was time to move on. I went to Manchester United and was lucky enough to win another cup in my first year there! Winning the FA Cup in 1985, at the end of my first year, was definitely my highlight at Manchester United. We went down to 10 men against Everton \u2013 who were the league champions at the time \u2013 and we had to summon up whatever we had left in our locker that day. Literally anything that the players that were left on that pitch had to offer, it had to come to the fore \u2013 and it did. I summoned up every bit of strength I had left and, to the untrained eye you wouldn\u2019t notice, but to the trained one, I went on this wonderful overlap to give Norman Whiteside (who is one of the best players I have ever played with) a bit more space so he could curl this stunning goal into the back of the net. I kept shouting at him, \u2018Give me it! Give me it! Give me it! He went inside and I shouted \u2018Oh no you\u2026. great goal!\u2019 It was a wonderful time and in an era where the cup final was the be all and end all.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realise how important a cup final was back then. It was the pinnacle of every young person to play in an English cup final. It was the big one, you had the full week of build-up, the morning of the game there were cameras everywhere... Now, there can be that level of coverage just for a normal game!\u201d\n\nIt was then on to pastures new, so how did it come about that you\u2019d leave Manchester United and join Leeds United?\n\n\u201cEventually my old Aberdeen manager Sir Alex came back down the road and we crossed paths again \u2013 but that magic that we had before was kind of gone. When Alex decided he had to make sweeping changes at Manchester United \u2013 and it was the right decision to do so \u2013 I was one of the first that had to go. I have no problem with that happening because from there, I ended up having the best time of my career! It was about two years after he joined that I left, it wasn\u2019t immediate. It was quite simple, I was told that I was surplus to requirements at Manchester United. They are a great club, I had a smashing time there and really enjoyed and I thought that would be the pinnacle of my career. Little did I know what was just around the corner\u2026\u201d\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\n\nLet\u2019s just say you made the right choice! But what made you choose Leeds over your other options?\n\n\u201cI had a choice to go to Middlesbrough or Sheffield Wednesday, as well, who were both in the Premier League at the time. When I spoke to Leeds, Bill Fotherby, and Howard Wilkinson in particular, told me something I had never really heard before. They said I was signing, but I needed to do this for us, we had to get promoted. They said, \u2018We\u2019re paying you, and we\u2019re paying you well, but this is the responsibility that you have.\u2019 So having that thrown on me, I just thought this is different! I had never had a challenge like this, so that was the reason I joined Leeds United, really. It just shows you that after the disappointment at being shown the door at Manchester United, you can still pick up things and come back from adversity. I was helped by Howard, Bill, plenty of others who were there when I got there \u2013 then others who arrived like Vinnie Jones, Chris Kamara.... And then, of course, being able to meet people like Gary Speed and David Batty gave me a real impetus and I felt influential at Leeds after I hadn\u2019t felt like that at Man United anymore. Leeds gave me a new lease of life, a sense of responsibility. Having that gave me another six or seven years of playing football.\u201d\n\nYou accepted that challenge and succeeded, just what was it like to win promotion here?\n\n\u201cThe year we got promoted was phenomenal. It was mind-blowing. The crowd... Wow! It was just every game they were buzzing! The football was more agricultural back then. We had good players but the pitches are not the same now, that\u2019s for sure. Every game was a real battle, everyone wanted to beat us and we wanted to beat them. The crowd were just amazing though, which strengthened even further how important it was and delivering that was the highlight of my career, delivering that challenge.\n\n\u201cMy thing was always that if I can help to get Leeds promoted to the Premier League then I can set off in the sunset on my horse back to St Andrew\u2019s and open up a fish and chip shop! It was never my view that I would end up playing in the Champions League, winning the league and all the rest of it. We\u2019re then playing in the Community Shield when Eric Cantona scored a hat-trick and I then scored the most wonderful own-goal you will ever see! But that was never our goal. All we ever wanted was promotion. Every day in training, every moment, it was always just about getting Leeds United promoted.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\n\nYou\u2019ve touched on it there, but you went on to get even more success as we won the league in 1991/92. Just how did that season feel?\n\n\u201cWe knew we were a hard team to beat, that\u2019s for sure. I think we thought we had lost it when we got beaten by Manchester City, it was a heavy one at Maine Road. I got asked the other day about when I thought we had a chance of winning it and it got me thinking\u2026 I was driving through Harehills and it was at night, I had West Ham versus Manchester United on the radio and heard the goal going in for West Ham. It was then that I thought, \u2018We could win this...\u2019. I never slept that night because of it. I never thought that would happen, but it did. So it all changed with a night-time drive through Harehills with my wife.\n\n\u201cWhen we did win it, it was incredible and some achievement, but I would still put winning the league below above that. Doing it with Speedo, Batts, Vinnie, Kamara... We had such a wonderful group of players. We weren\u2019t the most talented, but we were incredibly dedicated and that was our challenge and my remit. Anything after that was great and we loved it, but it can\u2019t beat the promotion season.\u201d\n\nOn to the match this weekend! How do you see it going between two teams of which you have such fond memories?\n\n\u201cI see a Leeds United team who know exactly what they need to be doing. There is one main voice they listen to and the players understand who is the boss. They believe in him, they believe in the system. They are not all the best players in the world but the club gets the best out of them and they get it out of each other. You can\u2019t ask for any more than that. Marcelo Bielsa is mind-blowing. I sit and watch the television and it feels like it\u2019s 3D, the ball comes out and hits you with the pace they play at. I could never be brave enough to play like that as a manager so I sit there in admiration. I do fear it, sometimes, because it could be any score\u2026 but I love it! To take Leeds United to being everyone\u2019s second favourite team is unheard of, but it\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cMan United are still finding their way. They\u2019ve had so many changes, different people, different groups... They need to find an identity and focus on exactly what they are wanting to do. Even if you go through Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s team, it was a team first and personality second. Most of the players knew that in Sir Alex the team comes first and that was it. If it didn\u2019t, the door was shown. It\u2019s been a good few years since their last title so someone has to go... Bang! This is what we\u2019re doing and let\u2019s play like this. It\u2019s two magnificent clubs. One is in the top half, one is on the bottom. But there is only one who, right now, knows what they are all about and one that is finding their way. Let\u2019s see what the match brings. It\u2019ll be exciting, I know that for sure. I can\u2019t wait to watch it.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\ufeff"}, {"url": "https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/gordon-strachan-leeds-united-centurion-16849763", "page_content": "With all the energy he could muster in the 84th minute of the 45th game of a tension-soaked season, Gordon Strachan launched his left foot at the bouncing ball and sent a speculative punt careering into the Leicester City net. At the time, it knocked the world off its axis, such was the seismic propulsion of emotion all around Elland Road, but pretty soon the world was back on its axis, everything was normal and as it should be; Leeds United were a First Division club again.\n\nThat will forever be remembered as Gordon Strachan\u2019s defining moment in a Leeds United shirt, but his impact was far more than just one snapshot in time. Few can claim what Strachan can claim; the only player other than Billy Bremner to lift a major trophy for the club, and the final component \u2013 along with Bobby Collins and Bremner himself - of the holy trinity of pint-sized, fiery Scotsmen who dragged Leeds United out of the doldrums and along the road to greatness.\n\nIn the chaotic aftermath of the Leicester goal that sealed a critical 2-1 win on the way to promotion, Strachan wore a ghostly visage; either sick with nerves, haunted by the prospect of failure or quite simply exhausted, Strachan was an empty vessel. For the first time that season his natural effervescence was gone, but by that time it didn\u2019t matter, because Strachan had run himself dry, and yet had achieved everything he needed to. And it could all have been so different had he come with the mind-set most people expected.\n\nStrachan arrived at Leeds United in March 1989, in something of a surprise move for a player who appeared comfortable seeing out his career at First Division Manchester United. The 33-year-old dropped down a division after being sold a vision by Bill Fotherby and Howard Wilkinson. Nobody expected a miracle, nobody expected the impact he very quickly made. He could have played out his final years at Leeds on an easy ride and still be remembered fondly. He could have coasted it. But he chose to do much more than that.\n\nThe impact Strachan had at Leeds United raised many an eyebrow mainly because his career appeared to be on the wane. After seven trophy-laden years breaking up the stranglehold of the Auld Firm on Scottish football under Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen, Strachan signed for Ron Atkinson\u2019s Manchester United in 1984, but after five seasons had failed to restore the club to greatness. And he was again under the management of Ferguson, with whom a dysfunctional unease had developed.\n\nStrachan needed a change and he needed a challenge. He got both via Howard Wilkinson, who made the forgotten Scotsman his most inspired signing, and one which triggered and shaped a whirlwind era of devastating success. Strachan was the talismanic captain and the stimulus that drew new standards from everyone around him. He brought experience, energy, ability and goals as Wilkinson\u2019s on-field general and in a scheming partnership that brought success beyond anyone\u2019s wildest dreams.\n\nWilkinson identified in Strachan something few others had; a temperament and personality that could spearhead an assignment requiring a unique character and spirit. Where Collins and then Bremner were able to inspire teammates to new levels of effort and performance, so Strachan thrived on a responsibility to be the role model others looked up to. The more he got out of himself, the more he got out of others.\n\nThe 1989/90 season is remembered by many fans even more fondly than the subsequent First Division title win, mainly for the throbbing and unrelenting momentum with which Leeds steamrollered over the division. Strachan was absolutely central to this; fighting, coordinating and cajoling for every minute of every game. His intensity never wavered and his animated engagement portrayed him as a man possessed, almost maniacally focussed on maintaining the pace until the task was done.\n\nExhausted both physically and mentally, Strachan achieved his goal, also finishing top scorer with 18 of his own. It was an achievement that would leave an indelible mark on anyone, but particularly on the man specifically tasked with it, and in retrospect, the overwhelming sense of satisfaction is almost at odds with the fact that this was only the start.\n\nLeeds United nostalgia Remember the good old days? Whether it's the Revie Era, Sgt Wilko's last champions or O'Leary's young guns, we've created a Facebook Group to share you memories of all things Leeds United. Join the group here and take a trip down memory lane.\n\nStrachan\u2019s was an epic career renaissance, a sporting comeback of Ali-proportions. Perhaps the quest was to prove people wrong, and in that sense, he made the ultimate swipe in pipping Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United to the league title two years later in 1992. In a classic role reversal, Strachan\u2019s mentor had become the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice and had instigated a situation he could no longer control.\n\nBut even prior to that, Strachan had not simply coasted on the many plaudits that came his way via promotion. Leeds finished fourth in their maiden season back in the top flight, Strachan found himself back in the Scotland international squad after a two-year absence and ended the season as the Football Writers\u2019 Player of the Year. His hunger to make the most of the autumn of his career meant that Leeds United were swept along with it, and canny signings from Messrs Wilkinson, Fotherby and Silver meant the ultimate domestic accolade arrived also, to realise a dream that felt too far-fetched to even contemplate three years earlier, when Strachan incongruously lined up as an audacious late-season signing in a dead rubber versus Portsmouth.\n\n(Image: Howard Walker)\n\nIt had been quite the ride, and while Strachan\u2019s influence dimmed amid back trouble, advancing years and the mis-management of Leeds\u2019 post-title exploits, his character and spirit had become engrained in the club, his influence was everywhere and his personality had come to personify everything the club represented. Gordon Strachan and Leeds United were perfect for each other, and nothing will ever change that.\n\nAs a model professional, Strachan was the example that others aspired to. Gary Speed amongst others spoke of how Strachan\u2019s professionalism and preparation would elongate his own career and help him inspire others, and how he learnt to approach training as something that was just as important as matchday itself. That all came from Strachan, and footballers with such infectious radiance only come along so often.\n\nIt might not seem like it most days, but as Leeds United fans we do have a lot to be thankful for. And in this case, yes, we should be thankful that Gordon Strachan chose to come to Leeds at all, but we should also be thankful that he brought with him an attitude, a hunger and a professionalism that would bring so much out of him and others too. Because he could have just coasted it.

He played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City, as well as the Scotland national team. He has since managed Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and Scotland.\n\nIn club football, Strachan played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and played in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982\u201383 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup Final in five seasons with Manchester United. He spent the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989\u201390 Second Division and 1991\u201392 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of Middlesbrough in the English Championship, but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.\n\nStrachan was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the 1990\u201391 season while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan and the grandfather of Luke Strachan, all of whom were also footballers.\n\nStrachan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1993 New Year Honours for services to association football.[4]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 39 157 5 475 39 004 1 702 25 135\n\nGordon Strachan Tribute\n\nVTS 01 1 GORDON STRACHAN INTERVIEW\n\nGordon Strachan Football Morals\n\nGreat goals from Gordon Strachan\n\n\u2b55 EXCLUSIVE One to One With GORDON STRACHAN Transcription\n\nClub career\n\nBorn and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy.[5][6] His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery.[7] At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within \"a thousandth of an inch\" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye.[8] He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.[9]\n\nDundee\n\nStrachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14.[9] In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United,[6] reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park.[9] His natural talent was immediately apparent and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award.[6] He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975;[6] The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner.[10] Strachan became a regular player in the 1975\u201376 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches.[11] However David White's \"Dee\" were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.[12]\n\nNew boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976\u201377 First Division campaign,[13] and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee.[6] However, the club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first team place early in the 1977\u201378 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was \"getting kicked a lot\" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker.[14] Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that \"we need \u00a350,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate\".[6][15] His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6\u20130 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as \"embarrassing\".\n\nAberdeen\n\nStrachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of \u00a350,000 plus Jim Shirra.[15] Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977\u201378 a poor season for Strachan, though the \"Dons\" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers.[16]\n\nMcNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager.[17] Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game's opening goal.[18] Though the 1978\u201379 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979\u201380 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park.[19] They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides en route, where they lost 3\u20130 to Dundee United at Dens Park.[20] At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year.[6][21] After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.[22]\n\nThe \"Reds\" could only manage a second-place finish in 1980\u201381, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become \"Britain's first \u00a32 million player\", in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games.[23] He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach.[24] With fit-again Strachan on the right flank \u2013 supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy \u2013 and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981\u201382, but had to settle for second place to Celtic.[25] They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4\u20131 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.[26]\n\nThe 1982\u201383 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5\u20131 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup.[27] Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's European success came with a 2\u20131 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1\u20130 win over Rangers.[28] The \"Dons\" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983\u201384, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic.[29] This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.\n\nManchester United\n\nIn August 1984, Manchester United spent \u00a3500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford.[30] However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC K\u00f6ln, United paid \u00a375,000 compensation to resolve the row \u2013 teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany.[31] Strachan opened the 1984\u201385 campaign with four goals in seven matches,[32] though the \"Red Devils\" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1\u20130 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.[33]\n\nAfter winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985\u201386 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury.[34] They proved unable to cope with their injuries \u2013 another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson \u2013 and limped to another fourth-place finish.[34] Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, \"I never thought he'd follow me this far south!\"[35] After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form.[36] United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986\u201387, before rising to second place in 1987\u201388. Strachan's form was again patchy in 1988\u201389, as United slipped back down to 11th.[37]\n\nLeeds United\n\nIn March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of \u00a3200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history.[38] However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division.[39] He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles.[40] Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband.[41] He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989\u201390.[42]\n\nWith the \"Whites\" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed.[43] They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990\u201391, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup.[43] Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.[43]\n\nStrachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991\u201392.[44] In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' hated rivals Manchester United the title.[45] However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back.[46] Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.[47]\n\nHowever, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992\u201393 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League.[48] Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award.[48] He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993.[49] This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4\u20130 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.[50]\n\nStrachan managed 37 starts in 1993\u201394, and Leeds rose to fifth.[48] He was rarely selected in the 1994\u201395 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.[51]\n\nCoventry City\n\nIn March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997.[52] Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson.[53] He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation.[54] However, Isa\u00edas left the club after falling-out with Strachan.[55] Coventry signed Gary McAllister for \u00a33 million on wages of \u00a320,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal.[56] The club struggled at the start of the 1996\u201397 campaign, and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.[57]\n\nInternational career\n\nStrachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park.[58] Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Stockholm.[59] He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain.[60] The Scots cruised to a 5\u20132 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, M\u00e1laga; Strachan was named Man of the Match.[61] Scotland then lost 4\u20131 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn, Seville.[62] In the third match, a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union back in M\u00e1laga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.[62]\n\nScotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign.[63] To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg.[64] The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1\u20130 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualc\u00f3yotl to the unseeded \u2013 but highly fancied \u2013 Denmark.[65] Strachan then scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates.[66] In the third and final group match back in Nezahualc\u00f3yotl, Scotland drew 0\u20130 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when Jos\u00e9 Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.[66]\n\nStrachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup.[67] Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992.[68] However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles.[69] He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.\n\nManagerial career\n\nCoventry City\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to the manager's seat. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant.[70] After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December.[71] However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the \"Sky Blues\" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.[citation needed]\n\nStrachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan \u2013 all of whom would win international caps.[72] Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997\u201398, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997\u201398 FA Cup.[72] After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs.[73] Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.[citation needed]\n\nThe club finished 15th in 1998\u201399 and 14th in 1999\u20132000, as Strachan spent \u00a36 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and \u00a35 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa.[74] Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans.[75] New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool.[76] Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001\u201302 First Division campaign.[77] His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.[citation needed]\n\nSouthampton\n\nStrachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary's Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002\u201303 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.[citation needed]\n\nIn February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press.[78] He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.[79]\n\nCeltic\n\nAfter a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005\u201306, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5\u20130 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4\u20134 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4\u20130. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8\u20131, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association eight days later.[80]\n\nStrachan ahead of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Spartak Moscow , August 2007\n\nThe following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's Derek Riordan; Chelsea's Ji\u0159\u00ed Jaro\u0161\u00edk; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost their round of 16 tie against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2\u20131 victory against Kilmarnock[81] left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. By April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1\u20130 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1\u20130 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, after winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, but failing to lead Celtic to another league title, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.[82][83]\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nStrachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate.[84][85] He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager's job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player.[86] His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty.[87] On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5\u20131 away to Queens Park Rangers.[88] After a poor run of results, including a 3\u20130 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1\u20130 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3\u20130.[89]\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season meant Middlesbrough were in 20th place,[90] Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October.[91] He voluntarily ended his contract and left without compensation.[90]\n\nScotland\n\nStrachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein.[92] His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1\u20130 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan's first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots' slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup.[93] After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia[93] and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.\n\nIn Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland.[93] After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland.[93] In their following match, Scotland produced an \"insipid\" performance, as they lost 1\u20130 in Georgia.[93] A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play.[93] In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany.[93] Scotland came from behind to lead 2\u20131 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive.[93] A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention.[93] Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck.[93] After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association.[94] After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.[95]\n\nManagement style\n\nTypically playing a traditional 4\u20134\u20132 formation,[96][97][98] and very occasionally 4\u20135\u20131,[96][99] Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style,[100][better source needed] and states that he watches video replays of his club's matches two or sometimes three times.[101] He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed.[102][103] Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.[104]\n\nRenowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.[105][106]\n\nEnmity with Alex Ferguson\n\nDespite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, \"I decided this man could not be trusted an inch \u2013 I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.\" In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was \"surprised and disappointed\".[107] The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United.[108] In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.[109]\n\nOther work\n\nStrachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport's Match of the Day 2.[110] He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV's coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV.[111] In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during The Debate on Sky Sports.[112] Following the release of convicted sex offender Adam Johnson from prison, Strachan had appeared to suggest that abusing Johnson for that offence was comparable with racial abuse.[112]\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children's Villages, the official charity of the tournament.[113]\n\nStrachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.[114]\n\nIn July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.[115]\n\nPersonal life\n\nStrachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man.[116] Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers,[114] and Gemma Strachan.[117] Strachan's grandson, Luke, is also a footballer and came through the youth setup with Dundee whilst Gordon was technical director at the club.[118]\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nInternational\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[121] National team Year Apps Goals Scotland 1980 7 1 1981 2 0 1982 8 0 1983 9 1 1984 2 0 1985 5 0 1986 6 2 1987 2 0 1989 2 0 1991 5 1 1992 2 0 Total 50 5\n\nInternational goals\n\nScores and results list Scotland's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Strachan goal.\n\nManagerial record\n\nAs of 8 October 2017 (competitive club matches and all international matches)\n\nTeam From To Record G W D L Win % Coventry City 5 November 1996 10 September 2001 215 70 56 89 0 32.56 Southampton 22 October 2001 13 February 2004 110 39 32 39 0 35.45 Celtic 1 June 2005 25 May 2009 182 122 28 32 0 67.03 Middlesbrough 26 October 2009 18 October 2010 46 13 13 20 0 28.26 Scotland 15 January 2013 12 October 2017 40 19 9 12 0 47.50 Total 593 263 138 192 0 44.35\n\nHonours\n\nPlayer\n\nAberdeen\n\nManchester United\n\nLeeds United\n\nScotland\n\nIndividual\n\nManager\n\nCeltic\n\nIndividual\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n\nMoynihan, Leo (2004), Gordon Strachan: A Biography, ISBN 1852272058"}], "Gordon David Strachan played for Coventry City.": [{"url": "https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/gordon-strachan-coventry-warwick-university-20296909", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nOur free Warwickshire email updates are the best way to get headlines direct to your inbox\n\nSky Blues and Scotland footballing legend Gordon Strachan is returning to Coventry.\n\nThe Strachan Football Foundation, one of the UK\u2019s most successful football education programmes, has announced it is to move its growing programme of sporting and educational support for young people to the sports facilities at the University of Warwick.\n\nThe foundation was founded in Rugby in 2011 by former Sky Blues and Scotland player Gordon Strachan.\n\nAs well as playing for and managing Coventry City Gordon played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United.\n\nHe also represented Scotland 50 times - appearing in two World Cups.\n\nGordon also managed Southampton in the Premier League, Celtic in the Champions League, and Middlesbrough.\n\nGordon described his five years managing Scotland\u2019s national team as his \u201cdream job\u201d and \u201can absolute honour\u201d.\n\nDespite his continuing commitments to professional football Gordon is a regular face at the Strachan Football Foundation\u2019s training sessions.\n\nCraig Strachan, the Strachan Football Foundation\u2019s assistant director of football, said: \u201cWe are incredibly proud of the opportunities we provide young people to reach their potential in the classroom and on the football pitch.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly looking at ways to further enhance the programme and we are so excited what the move to the University of Warwick will mean for our students.\u201d\n\nThe Strachan Football Foundation (SFF) offers:\n\n* A bespoke programme of full time education suited to each learner\u2019s needs, ability and desired career path\n\n* A football programme, with an extensive training and games programme based at a state-of-the-art training facility.\n\n* Full time education from Level 1 to Level 3 in variety of football/sport/coaching related qualifications.\n\n* Degree courses (working with Nottingham University and Loughborough College).\n\n* Opportunities to work towards of a scholarship at one of eleven colleges and universities in the United States.\n\nSince SFF\u2019s creation it has quadrupled in size and now works with more than 80 young people, many of whom come from the Coventry and North Warwickshire area.\n\nSFF\u2019s development in size and shape has now led to its move from Rugby to the University of Warwick campus.\n\nGeorge Mackie, director of football at the Strachan Football Foundation said: \u201cI want to thank Rugby Borough Football club and their junior team for hosting us and enabling us to provide this support for a great many young people over the last decade.\n\n\u201cHowever, the continuing success of the foundation means that we have now outgrown our Rugby home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur new base at the University of Warwick will give us access to more facilities and pitches on site, which will enable further growth, and will allow our program to be more accessible to a greater number of students.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan said:\u201cPandemic restrictions permitting, our young students will begin training and studying in our new University of Warwick base in September.\n\n\u201cI look forward to being there myself to see the first ball kicked by one our fantastic young people in this fabulous new home right on the edge of Coventry, a city I know so well.\u201d\n\nLisa Dodd-Mayne, director of sport and active communities at the University of Warwick, said: \u201cWe are delighted that the Strachan Football Foundation have chosen to bring their academy to the world class sports facilities here at the University of Warwick.\n\n\u201cOur facilities have helped train, support and host many Olympic, Commonwealth, and UK professional athletes; and professional football players.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe young people who will access the foundation\u2019s programmes on our campus will benefit from support, training, and access to qualifications that will bring huge benefits to them and their future careers.\n\n\u201cIt is a fantastic opportunity for the university, our region and our local community in Coventry and Warwickshire to host this foundation, led by an international football figure with such close connections to Coventry, which will benefit many of our local young people.\u201d\n\nKeep up with all of the latest local news with our daily newsletter"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/managers/strachan-gordon/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Gordon David Strachan\n\naka: Gordon Strachan, WGS (Wee Gordon Strachan)\n\nHeight: 5.06\n\nWeight: 10.06\n\nBorn: 9 Feb 1957\n\nBirthplace: Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nPosition (as a player): RHS Midfielder (attacking)\n\nInternationals (as a player): Scotland\n\nInternational Caps (as a player): 50 caps\n\nInternational Goals (as a player): 5 goals\n\nManager: 1 June 2005 \u2013 25 May 2009\n\nSucceeding: Martin O\u2019Neill\n\nSuccessor: Tony Mowbray\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is another big club where the supporters have a love like the supporters have a love for this club.\u201d\n\nWGS on the Celtic fans (quote taken from \u201cCeltic Minded 2\u201d (book), 2006)\n\nPlayer\n\nDuring his playing career he played for\n\nDundee (1974-1977),\n\nAberdeen (1977-1984),\n\nManchester United (1984-1989),\n\nLeeds United (1989-1995) and\n\nCoventry City (1995-1997).\n\nHe won 50 international caps for Scotland and is in the Scotland Football Hall of Fame.\n\nGordon Strachan was an aggressive, skilful right-sided midfield player. He never played for Celtic as a player, and generally was not the most popular opposition player. Nippy and aggressive, he irked some of the Celtic support but mostly it was due to his ability as being just a great player for Aberdeen during a golden period for them.\n\nOverall, he was a great entertaining Scottish player and the Celtic support appreciated that at least.\n\nManagement\n\nWGS became Coventry City\u2019s Director of Football in November 1996.\n\nHe finally retired as a player at the end of the season after making his last appearance at the age of 40, a record in the English Premiership.\n\nStrachan kept Coventry in the Premiership until 2001, when they finally went down after 34 years of top division football. He was sacked shortly after the start of the 2001-02 Division One campaign.\n\nGordon Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager\u2019s job at Southampton \u2013 after Strachan\u2019s appointment in October 2001, they finished 11th in the Premiership.\n\nIn 2002-03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Arsenal, but since Arsenal had qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Southampton qualified for the 2003-04 UEFA Cup.\n\nIn March 2004, Gordon Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager, earlier than intended because he wanted to spend time with his family.\n\nWhen Berti Vogts stepped down as Scottish national coach, Strachan was widely tipped to take over until Walter \u201cWattie\u201d Smith got the job, and he was even linked with the manager\u2019s job at Portsmouth, but turned down the offer to take over. He later took on the Scotland role from January 2013 as the popular choice amongst the Scotland support, resigning in October 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to Euro 2016.\n\nGordon Strachan has also been an analyst of football matches for the media, most notably on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day 2 show. Renowned for his deadpan humour as much as his shrewd tactical awareness, quotes attributed to Strachan have become legendary among football supporters.\n\nAs Celtic Manager\n\nGordon Strachan finally returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O\u2019Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL).\n\nHe resigned on 25 May 2009, after 4 years in charge having won the league three times in a row, with a lot to look on to be proud on, both domestically and in European competition.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE CIS LEAGUE CUP SCOTTISH CUP EUROPE TOTALS SEASON P W D L F A PTS P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A 2005-06 38 28 7 3 93 37 91 4 4 0 0 9 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 4 5 45 33 7 5 107 46 2006-07 38 26 6 6 65 34 84 2 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 0 0 13 3 8 3 1 4 9 10 53 35 8 10 90 48 2007-08 38 28 5 5 84 26 89 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 2 1 1 9 3 8 3 0 5 7 10 52 34 6 12 102 42 2009-09 38 24 10 4 80 33 82 4 4 0 0 9 1 3 2 0 1 4 3 6 1 2 3 4 7 51 31 12 8 97 44 TOTALS 152 106 28 18 322 130 346 12 10 1 1 23 7 13 9 1 3 27 11 24 8 3 13 24 32 201 133 33 35 396 180\n\nFirst season (2005-06)\n\nFor 2005/06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title off current holders (Rangers).\n\nThings didn\u2019t exactly get off swimmingly, and an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager losing 5-0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and 3 days later only managing to draw 4-4 away to Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. A few days later he recorded his first win in charge as Celtic won 4-0 in the return leg of the Champions League qualifier.\n\nHowever, that was not enough to avoid being put out of Europe before the season had got started in earnest. For many Celtic fans, these set of matches set the tone (for both WGS and the supporters) on how the mentality on governing the side\u2019s tactics was to be for future matches. It was a huge psychological blow, and some fans never seemed to forgive him. It was too regularly brought up in seasons to come.\n\nNevertheless, Celtic improved under Strachan, leading the SPL by as much as 20 points at one point despite playing with a defence that came under regular criticism from the media and fans. Rangers were in turmoil as Alex McLeish lurched from one disaster to another. Two notable victories over Rangers in November (scoring 5 goals and conceding none) was a gem of a time, and saw the emergence of Shaun Maloney as a front runner for the team.\n\nNot all went Celtic\u2019s way, and another low-point was the shock defeat in the third-round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they beat Dunfermline Athletic 8-1, a record victory margin for the SPL. Over the period after beating Rangers twice in November, the First Team went through a poor spell for two months where the First Team went behind in too many games, but thankfully fought back in to recover.\n\nWorse was that the First Team kept on conceding goals in all the games. It was not until Celtic played against Rangers in mid-February that the first team had a game that they didn\u2019t concede a goal in.Celtic were winning games but the weaknesses of the side were beginning to be seen, and in many ways they were the weaknesses that were to begin to haunt Celtic for over the next couple of seasons.\n\nAn important point that has to be made is that this was a season of transition, and anyone taking over from Martin O\u2019Neill as manager was going to have a hard task in front of them (a lot to live up to). Spats with Sutton and Agathe, saw both leave prematurely yet both could have contributed more. On the other hand, the players have to take in that the old regime was over and you have to understand and work with the new regime. With the less than stellar playing achievements of both after leaving Celtic, maybe WGS was right. Sutton in particular can be a prickly character and not predictable, so maybe it was best to move him on.\n\nOverall, Strachan\u2019s first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the Scottish League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time with six matches remaining. A difficult year of transition, but he\u2019d won most over to his side at this point.\n\nReflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted \u2018Manager of the Year\u2018 by the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Association eight days after the title was clinched.\n\nThis was just the beginning, and much better was expected of both him and the team in the next season in terms of entertainment and results (goals conceded, scored etc).\n\nSecond season (2006-07)\n\nHis second season was even more of a roller coaster compared to his first, with excuses out the window for many, and the arrival of Paul le Guen (PLG) seen by the press as leading \u201cLe Revolution\u201d at Rangers to challenge Celtic. To the surprise of practically everyone, there was no actual domestic challenge. Rangers went comedic from failure to tragic farce, and Celtic simply took advantage going over 20 points ahead of them at one point in the season. In games v Rangers, the best PLG did was one draw. The \u2018Hearts Revolution\u2019 was also a joke with their challenge petering out before it had even began.\n\nKnocked out early in the league cup was no issue, and WGS easily made it up with winning the Scottish Cup to wrap up a cup and league double. Overall, WGS was having a respite domestically from any strong challenge, but nobody should understate the level of his achievement. Whilst others floundered, he ensured that Celtic did not, and the players were building up a fair reputation as a unit.\n\nThe Champions League was where it\u2019s at, and there he excelled. Despite a tough group, Celtic won all three home games, with a special victory against Man Utd which led Celtic to qualify from the Group stages for the first time. You can\u2019t understate the work done by Gordon Strachan in this. He galvanised the players and had set them out correctly to push further than they expected. Not a unit of players as highly rated together as the best under Martin O\u2019Neill yet they achieved what they did not. The players were fit and able, and were pushing to the last minute of matches. It made a whole difference. Strachan was able to utilise players like Nakamura to his best and it was paying out.\n\nOn the other hand,Celtic were poor away from home and lost all 3 games, with WGS stating that he knew the problem and would have it resolved. The next round v AC Milan was very special for the Support, and WGS held to what he said and the first team didn\u2019t concede in 180mins of football, but sadly didn\u2019t score either. Ultimately,Celtic were outdone by a classic goal by Kaka in extra time. A sad way to go out, but a great achievement by WGS and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nRegardless of the European achievements, some criticism must also be put at WGS for his second season domestically. The quality of football in the last third of the season in particular was appalling, and the player effort by too many of the squad was deemed non-existent. Rangers\u2019 new manager (Walter Smith) had the better of WGS with a very comfortable win in the last game v Rangers in the season, and Celtic lost in some very drab games. People pay to enjoy the product on the pitch, it really was not good at Celtic. It wasn\u2019t \u2018The Celtic Way\u2019.\n\nA number of the signings were disappointing that season, Gravesen, Miller and Jarosik in particular, whilst Jan Venegoor of Hasselink was injured too often. A spat with Maloney over new contracts saw the club lose a great new wee player (transferred to Aston Villa) and the defence was as bad at the end of the season as at the start. The manager appeared to bamboozle and patronise fans on many occasions with his team selections, and what appeared to be a continuing spat with Derek Riordan saw the player play few games and being overshadowed by the far less productive Kenny Miller. A round of boos as Riordan was taken off in one match late in the season was evidence of this. It was a sorry situation.\n\nMany fans were simply disillusioned by WGS at the end despite the successes, and simply couldn\u2019t see where he was taking the team. The fear was that the club was moving backwards despite what had been accomplished in the last year. This should have put an end to the rubbish that the fans didn\u2019t like him as he wasn\u2019t a \u201cCeltic man\u201d (lazy journalism), it was all because of the criticisms as said above. A real roller coaster of a season, and after all the achievements in the season it\u2019s sad to have to have to summarise it all in a negative tone.\n\nThird season (2007-08)\n\nFor WGS, this season had seen him lose the support of most of the fans. However the death of Tommy Burns and his near breakdown after his loss (a close friend and work colleague) showed a side of WGS which many had not seen before in his time here.\n\nThe Support all felt for him and just how much the job and the club really did mean to him. Winning the league against the odds (big odds at that) appeared to have moved the fans and split the fans opinion on him whether to stay or go at the end of it all.\n\nThis season for WGS can be termed a success on paper. To quote him, the team achieved what he set out at the start of the year to do. On paper, Celtic won the league (three in a row) and got through the Champs League group stages again (two in a row) which cemented the club as being more than just a flash in the pan side as others in the past have been cynically referred as being.\n\nCeltic sold hapless Kenny Miller to Derby County for \u00a33m (amazing!), brought in a few quality players like Barry Robson, beat Rangers twice at home in very entertaining games and so on. Adding in that Celtic were seven points (plus a game played more) behind Rangers going into the end of the season, WGS must be given his due, even by his harshest critic, for leading the team to somehow comeback and win the league. The first team won the last seven games (which included 2 wins v Rangers) and got much pride back. That can\u2019t be smirked at by anyone, and the last win came just a week after Tommy Burns death (not an easy time).\n\nAt the end of the day, his style of football was uninspiring and unentertaining, and he seemed to stick with some players in his squad way beyond what he should have and then moved them on (e.g. Caldwell, Donati, JVoH), demonstrating an inability to accept criticism and that he had been wrong. A public rift with Derek Riordan depicted an unsettled atmosphere in the changing room although other comments by players, like Mark Wilson, Pressley and Venegoor, said otherwise praising WGS for his man management skills.\n\nBringing in Barry Robson into the Celtic team seemed to show admission that he needed steel in a lightweight side (and what a change he made to the team), whilst Hartley was a revelation this season and deserved all the praise in the world. Boruc as ever was great, but a kick up the back side was needed as it took him a year to manage a game where he didn\u2019t lose a goal away from home.\n\nAllegations were thrown at the Celtic support that they were spoilt (see this story) and that the support didn\u2019t like WGS as he wasn\u2019t a \u2018Celtic man\u2018. Complete balderdash and it was simply sloppy & cheapshot journalism. The fans pay up good money to watch Celtic, and many a time the performances were dreadful to watch with the manager unwilling to admit change was needed and seemed to anger many, especially when he criticised the fans for not understanding what he was trying to do. The zonal defensive play was not working, the formations weren\u2019t working and certain players needed a kick up the backside.\n\nThe First Team lost v Inv Caley when they were two ahead, lost against Hibs, Motherwell and even struggled in games v Gretna. The First Team lost the first two games v Rangers, with poor tactics amongst other points to blame for it. Transfers weren\u2019t working out, especially the enigma that was Donati. Taking in the club had spent more money than Rangers, it was embarrassing to go behind in the league and watching Rangers going to the end for a very undeserved potential quadruple (which thankfully they didn\u2019t achieve).\n\nAdding all this up, WGS has to take flak. However, as said, his emotions after Tommy Burns showed his real self to everyone and all felt for him. This season may probably have shown him to be more of a coach than a great manager, but unlike the other pundits on television at least he puts his money where his mouth is and takes up the challenge of football management. Moving on to next season he should have learnt from what had happened to become a more complete rounded manager.\n\nMust be said, any manager who wins three league titles in a row must be doing something right, so maybe the critics amongst the fans are wrong. A late find in Barry Robson was a revelation, whilst bringing Lennon into the coaching staff seemed to freshen things up.\n\nWGS can be quite an enigma but moving into the next season, more entertaining football really was a requirement.\n\nFourth Season (2008-2009)\n\nSo, was WGS to cement his name as a legend at Celtic by achieving the coveted \u201c4-in-a-row\u201d of league titles? But more importantly, it was questioned on how was his relationship with the fans going to develop this year? It was a (near) clean sheet for many on WGS after the emotional end to the last season.\n\nBefore the season had even begun, rumblings (as usual) had restarted about WGS and his transfers. Few buys to excite the fans made many apprehensive about the hope for greater entertainment, but in general the mood was that, despite all else, Celtic were going to win the league (confidence was high).\n\nThe season started off rather easily until the first game v Rangers where basically Celtic were turned over (at home) 4-2 and lucky not to have lost by more. The first team were hopeless, and the daggers were out for the manager. The pent up frustration from sections of the crowd was released in one big explosion, and the tone was decidedly frosty for the rest of the season with respect to the manager\u2019s relationship with the fans. Not a good start.\n\nNevertheless following on from there was a cracking set of games which saw Celtic take advantage and overhaul Rangers to go top of the league. There was some great football in the first third of the season, and this was the best to watch Celtic for a few seasons at least.\n\nAnyhow, the big headaches of the season began with injuries besetting the manager in his aim to overhaul Rangers. Credit to WGS as his policy of squad numbers above single big signings did pay off which enabled Celtic to be able to squad rotate players to cover for gaps in the side and keep their nose in front. Amazingly Celtic went 7pts ahead at the end of November, and December became the brightest time of the season and it was capped off with a Scott McDonald inspired 1-0 victory at Ibrox against Rangers. Great! Everyone thought Celtic were set up for the rest of the campaign. How the support were to be disappointed.\n\nDuring all this was the Champions league escapade. A poor final set of results saw Celtic finish bottom of their group and again fail to win any of the away games (see link for full write-up). After 4 years, WGS still hadn\u2019t managed an away win in Europe, something that can\u2019t be put down to bad luck alone, and something that was noticeable to all. Celtic got the breaks last season in Europe, this time they didn\u2019t.\n\nBack to the league, when did it all begin to go wrong? Basically from the turn of the new year, yet WGS seemed to do little.\n\nWhat was going on? To everyone\u2019s surprise, WGS himself summarised the situation well in a post-match interview:\n\n\u201cYou have to determine your own destiny. The eyes of the football world are upon us all. The question being asked is, \u2018Are you a team that plays just when everything is right for you?\u2019 That can\u2019t happen. The best way for us to recover is to get back on form as quickly as possible.\u201d (Mar 09)\n\nHowever, he quickly turned back to old irritating ways by stating in an interview a few weeks later: \u201cIf anyone can find a negative \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they will \u2013 then they are warped!\u201d after a Dundee Utd game in April where Celtic drew 2-2. Clearly and sadly showed a dividing line between the management and the fans. An unnecessary dig and it was an unworkable relationship. This post-match comment was very insulting and patronising to the support (and uncalled for). Difficult to see how things were going to be mended easily for many. Why exactly did WGS have to patronise and insult the support? Only he could answer this question, but best left to the end of the season.\n\nAdd to that, complaints about the lack of entertaining football were being swatted away with abandonment: \u201cIn terms of entertainment, yes, we do have responsibilities at Celtic and Rangers, because we have greater resources than most clubs up here to entertain, But most of the songs that the supporters sing are all about winning trophies \u2014 they don\u2019t sing nice wee ditties about the beautiful game. No one remembers the beautiful football, but they do remember the defeats.\u201d This line again seemed to show his distance from the Celtic ideal.\n\nOne nice break was the league cup final, beating Rangers 2-0 after extra-time, with both goals scored by two Irish internationals (O\u2019Dea & McGeady).\n\nFrom then on in, little went right for Celtic again, and after dropping points, Celtic were up against Rangers to see who was to win the league. The final league game v Rangers was a failure, losing one-nil and from then on the writing was on the wall.\n\nCeltic had lost the league to a poor Rangers side. The Celtic players did not perform, and the apathy around the club was heart-breaking. It was overall a poor season with under-performing players.\n\nThe football was generally poor to watch and it had been a continual complaint over the past few years. For many who were tired of the turgid football on display this was a bit much, and swathes of empty seats at Celtic matches became the norm rather than exception. With the global credit crunch beginning and hitting one and all, it was not a time to alienate the support. Yet WGS did, so why? Who knows? It doesn\u2019t require much to get on the side of the fans.\n\nThere are many reasons for the loss, but the manager has to take the flak and he was not one to ever take criticism lightly, being self-admittedly easily irritated. In fairness there were mitigating points, e.g. the loss of Barry Robson to injury was probably more costly to the First Team than anyone realised, as he was a strong driving force to the title run-in last season.\n\nWGS handed in his resignation with little surprise the day after the league defeat, and he left rightly with his head held high for his achievements over the past four seasons with uncharacteristically no smart remarks from him (thankfully). There was actually some sadness to see him go as there had been many good memories over his time. He had been the creator of his own downfall this last season, and in his own reflection on this last season will have to admit, to himself at least, where he went wrong.\n\nReview\n\nSo after all that, how should anyone take and look back on WGS? His predecessor is still lauded to this day, and in reflection Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements were hanging over WGS during his whole tenure at the club. Regardless, he had to deal with them, and if truth be said, then WGS can argue that on paper at least he has exceeded on par with what Martin O\u2019Neill achieved. Not that WGS would but the argument of who was the better manager (WGS or MoN) was a never ending debate which is all academic now. Martin O\u2019Neill was blessed to have had Henrik Larsson at hand so comparisons for WGS aren\u2019t easy or likely entirely fair.\n\nForgetting his predecessor, WGS had a few tasks to fulfill. Firstly, was to regenerate the squad and lower the cost base after the more spendthrift MoN years, win the league back and get Celtic further in Europe. On that score, he more than achieved what was set out. Wage costs were reduced, Celtic won the league back and in time achieved getting past the group stages in the Champions League twice in a row. Brilliant stuff.\n\nWinning the league three times in a row, as well as outliving two Rangers managers is surely a sign of success, especially after the hoo-haa over Paul Le Guen\u2019s management signing. Add in some incredible achievements in Europe (e.g. in beating European Cup holders AC Milan, the Naka winner v Manchester Utd, qualifying twice out of the Champions League group stages etc), and he can easily hold his head up high. The support were spoilt with success at many points.\n\nWhen Celtic won the league for the third time with him as manager, there is no denying that he had silenced all the doomsayers who were worrying that Celtic were out of the league title race. That last seven game winning run to win the league title against the odds will be spoken about for many a year. It was a phenomenal achievement to pick the players up and get them motivated. No matter what else can be said of his managerial ability, that was exceptional. The First Team came so close to reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup in one season and what a mark that would have been. This was all done without the sublime talents of Larsson, Petrov and Sutton.\n\nEurope had been a sore bugbear for predecessor Martin O\u2019Neill, and Gordon Strachan achieved what Martin O\u2019Neill failed to achieve by qualifying past the group stages (and did it twice). It put Celtic on the pedestal with the premier clubs in Europe, and it was a great place to be.\n\nGordon Strachan was the architect for the high points, and when they came off they were exceptional, and WGS deserves all the credit in the world. Post-match interviews could also be enlivened by some of his emotive witticisms, which on a number of occasions lightened the mood and made everyone smile.\n\nThe most exciting game? Well there were many. WGS himself said that the Spartak Moscow win in 2007 was the most exciting and many would agree but defeating Manchester Utd 1-0 to reach the KO stages of the Champions League was also very special.\n\nHe also helped to foster the careers of some of the younger players, such as Maloney, McManus, McGeady & Wilson, and in reflection they will be thankful for the role that WGS has played in their careers. Some will succeed (at Celtic or elsewhere) whilst others inevitably won\u2019t but at least he gave them the opportunity. WGS likely was the best developer of youngsters we\u2019d had for the past twenty years or so. Billy McNeil was the last to have done well with youngsters in the squad.\n\nSo why in reflection, is the mood relatively more sombre over WGS than an outsider would expect? Much of it has been reflected above in the season reviews. The fans can be said to have been very patient with him, but the truth is that the football in general was too often poor to watch and after four years of that, what are the fans to say? He failed with a number of big transfers, and many players seemed to have declined under him rather than improved.\n\nMany fans take the belief that he couldn\u2019t coach well; confusing squad rotations and team selections baffled players as much as fans, and the last season was woeful in so many ways, throwing away major leads. Tackling Rangers in his last two seasons shouldn\u2019t have been as difficult as it was as Celtic were far better resourced, yet tripped up in both seasons and only got out of jail the first time.\n\nHe never helped himself with a number of his post-match remarks either, the \u201cwarped\u201d comment in his last season in particular was particularly poor judgement. He readily admits that he is easily irritated, but he\u2019d been in football for over twenty years and worked in the media for some time, so he should have been able to know how to deal with it. Yet he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t!\n\nMany would agree that \u201cned-culture\u201d had been on the rise, and WGS in particular had been very vocal on this issue, taking journalists to task on occasion as well. However, when you give a flippant remark to a question or a thinly veil snide remarks to others, then how really is anyone to see him in a different light to those he criticised? Bit extreme but the point stands and he could end up making things worse for himself. All are irked by neds but he made too much of a crusade of it at times, and at Celtic it was the wrong place for his campaign.\n\nCeltic is a social community club, and thefore reflects a cross-section of society. So admittedly the support can have a small share of nefarious characters, but the support does push and emphasise the roots of the club in terms of charity and community, and this in turn is reflected by the good nature and reputation of the support. Winning is not the only aim, it\u2019s also about the ineffable \u201cto play the Celtic Way\u201d. WGS did not seem to comprehend this, and dismissed any criticism of his tactics stating that others didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to do. That was simply nonsense.\n\nHis \u201cwin at the cost of entertainment\u201d style may find favour in the cut-throat English championship but not at Celtic. That in itself had been what has been the crux of the friction between the support and WGS, and that was what created his downfall. He did things by the training manual but that is never sufficient, and he could be quite robotic with his decisions (such as always subbing on players in matches at an exact certain time) so leaving little room for flexibility or showing that he was able to be experimental in matches.\n\nFrom the outside, everything appeared to be rosy as Celtic won trophies but it\u2019s about more than that with the Celtic support. The supporters weren\u2019t most often enjoying the play on the pitch, reflected in the falling attendances.\n\nWGS is actually a very decent man. The players all spoke very highly of him, and there was little if any dissent at the time (McGeady and Riordan apart) even from those who left prematurely, although one or two (e.g. Sutton & Gravesen) have been quite critical of Strachan since leaving but much later on. All Celtic fans who have met him have generally commented well on him. Away from it all, a long one-on-one interview in December 2008 with Radio Scotland brought out his good side and there was a general amount of respect for him from this.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the full qualification to be a successful football manager, and WGS\u2019 natural managerial ability was below that level which all wish he was at. Maybe if he had spent some time with some great managers learning their skill, he could have been a far better manager. He was a player with Manchester Utd and Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson but his coaching began at Leeds (under the dour Howard Wilkinson) and then Coventry, and sadly it\u2019s those latter clubs that his coaching philosophy stems from. Ex-Celt Gravesen in an interview in 2018 commented on Strachan\u2019s extreme fear of losing games, noting criticisms made to Gravesen on defending the lead when he had scored a hat-trick after the game in question.\n\nAn important point must be noted that WGS is the first Celtic manager to have to grapple with the new media. Martin O\u2019Neill was manager when the internet got going, but it was in its infancy throughout most of MoN\u2019s reign, and the scale and importance in which the internet had taken in WGS\u2019 time had meant that he had another task to take on.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy anymore. Replays and events are dissected more thoroughly and for longer than ever before. There are cameras to capture everything, statisticians to tally up the most mundane of figures and heated wipe-spread discussions begin on the matches before they\u2019re even over (on the forums & social media) and not hours later in the pub as it all used to be. Sky Sports & its peers are everywhere, and unconscious comparisons with richer foreign leagues had been rising, which doesn\u2019t help with the club\u2019s limited resources. Sadly, that was the future, and WGS was the first Celtic manager to deal with it and few seemed to sit back and notice. Maybe if they did then he\u2019d have been cut more slack.\n\nHis biggest mistake? Should have left at the end of 2007/08 season as many fans were calling for. He stayed 12 months longer than he should have, and that set in the rot which accelerated over time. At the end of it all, most fans wanted him gone, and it\u2019s sad to see him have to leave in that kind of atmosphere. Much of it had been of his own creation, and his successor had the unenviable task to rebuild the squad in much the same way that WGS himself had to when he himself began.\n\nFor those who still believe that the Celtic support were irrational, they should take the following comment from Middlesborough legend & ex-player Bernie Slaven on Gordon Strachan\u2019s brief reign at Middlesborough after leaving Celtic, as there are parallels from his comment to the Celtic supporters\u2019 criticisms of Strachan\u2019s time at Celtic:\n\n\u201cAfter a year in charge, we [Middlesborough] had not improved one iota \u2013 the football was average, away results were abysmal, the worst league position in 20 years and he still doesn\u2019t know his best team. It wasn\u2019t just on the field that Strachan let himself down, off the field during post-match interviews he became an embarrassment to himself, the club and the fans. He was arrogant, obnoxious, sarcastic, cutting and rude. He came across to me like a man who was on the borderline of insanity.\u201d\n\nWe hoped WGS all the very best in the future, in whatever direction he was to take. Everyone knows from his honest comments that he grew to love the club, just at times his daft side too often got in the way. He is a good man, and for the great memories all will forever be thankful for them and there were a number of them along the way. In time, all at least missed his sense of humour from his interviews [see Quotes by and on Gordon Strachan].\n\nHe signed off from Celtic with a wonderful speech which contained the following great quote (from the Tommy Burn\u2019s tribute match, full wording below):\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pretend I came here as a Celtic supporter. I don\u2019t believe in kissing badges to get your support. I didn\u2019t know the words of \u2018Fields of Athenry\u2019\u2026. [but] From today, I\u2019ve become a Celtic supporter.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan (May 2009)\n\nPost-Celtic & Scotland management\n\nSince leaving Celtic, he had a relatively unsuccessful time as manager at Middlesborough. He took over a set of former Celtic (& Rangers) players to his new club making it dubbed by some as some kind of Glasgow old boys team. It didn\u2019t work out at all, and his time as a club side manager was over.\n\nHe returned to football analysis on TV & Radio, and to the joy of every Celtic fan, he has been incredible towards Celtic. Never hides his sympathy, and talks up the club at every opportunity. Really puts to shame some former players who have taken pot-shots. Without the pressure of management, Strachan has shown his knowledge of the game on TV and applied it in an easy accessible manner for the viewer and is very popular. A very different character to the fish-bowl like environment that a Celtic manager has to endure in Glasgow.\n\nThe support was very much warming to him, and possibly it\u2019s an indication that he may have regretted not having shown this more amiable side during his time at Celtic. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone, and maybe only once he was at a distance that he was able to admire what Celtic had offered and given him. The affection that Strachan now has with the support was increasingly mutual as was shown on his frequent trips back to Celtic Park.\n\nMust add that he had acted as a mentor in part for Neil Lennon. At one point there were stories of bringing Strachan back as a paid mentor for Neil Lennon but this didn\u2019t materialise. However, he has still acted as such and Neil Lennon publicly paid his respect to Strachan once after advise given by him which helped Celtic win a vital game against Rangers (and helped keep Neil Lennon in his job).\n\nCuriously, Strachan has claimed that there was no bias against Celtic in his time as manager of the club, but then again Rangers were so bad during much of the spell, bias wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (as it was to do so during Lennon\u2019s reign).\n\nScotland Managerial Tenure\n\nOver his entire time as a manager, his name was continually brought up as a possible future Scotland manager, and with the lack of candidates putting themselves forward for the role, Strachan in January 2013 was announced the new manager. Interestingly, one of the first questions he was posed at his initial press conferences was: \u201cIs this the biggest job in your career so far?\u201d, to which Strachan retorted: \u201cI was manager of Celtic, there\u2019s no bigger job than that!\u201d. Bless him, the support loved him more now than ever.\n\nThere was to be added spice for the Celtic fans. In 2013, Martin O\u2019Neill was announced as the Republic of Ireland manager with ex-Celtic player Roy Keane as his assistant. If you ever read back to the old match threads, reports and reviews by Celtic fans from the 2000\u2019s, a common argument was \u201cMoN v WGS\u201c, as who was the better manager: Martin O\u2019Neill or Gordon Strachan?\n\nThe comparisons were difficult, and the arguments at times nauseating, but in 2014 both Martin O\u2019Neill and Gordon Strachan were drawn to face each other in competitive matches for the Euro Championships. The first match was ironically played at Celtic Park as Hampden was being renovated, and Scotland triumphed 1-0, and the return leg ended 1-1 with ex-Celt Maloney (who had played under both at Celtic) the scorer for Scotland in both games. Nobody was going to truly believe this would settle any old arguments. Time has now passed by for the old debaters, and both managers should be respected for their time at Celtic.\n\nStrachan\u2019s second run at qualification had certain parallels to his time at Celtic, as in the roller-coaster aspect. A grim start to the qualification for the 2018 World Cup was compounded by his stubbornness where he opted to remain loyal to old stalwarts rather than new players or those regarded as currently on form in the Scottish league. Many also argued he had a bias against those based in the Scottish leagues in preference to the English leagues.\n\nThe qualifying campaign for Strachan to the 2018 World Cup was a roller coaster mirroring that of his time at Celtic. Having begun the campaign very poorly, his head was on the block, only to incredibly recover but then fell at the final hurdle. Part of the problem was his initial intransigence to play Celtic players who were then by far the best in the country, publicly rebuking calls for more Celtic players, most notably Griffiths.\n\nA 3-0 loss to Lithuania at the start of the campaign featured no Celtic players, but the turnaround featured a number. His fall at the final hurdle was in part due to the loss of two key Celtic central midfielders (Brown & Armstrong) to injury. The biggest issue was to be his patter, and a post-match comment about Scot\u2019s lacking height & genetics made him lampooned across the footballing circuits and infuriated everyone. He was still rubbing everyone up the wrong way.\n\nOn the other hand, Scotland were again a fighting side under his management. As at Celtic, last minute goals were notable event, e.g. crucial winner v Slovakia in Oct 2017, it was a great attribute. The amount of times his Celtic and Scotland teams have done it is remarkable. There comes a point where you can no longer say it\u2019s luck or fortune, and he genuinely does instil a belief and winning mentality into his teams. Fair enough the football wasn\u2019t always free-flowing and the mentality didn\u2019t necessarily always turn into victories, but the winning belief was a great trait to have.\n\nHe resigned in Oct 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to the 2016 Euros.\n\nFew were bemoaning the decision, but he had made a rod for his own back. His positives and negatives again came very much to the forefront in this role as it did at his time at Celtic. Sadly he would leave with little to write home about with Scotland (despite some progress) whilst his Celtic tenure had many wonderful highs. If anything, it vindicated the often ambivalent opinion the Celtic fans had of Gordon Strachan over his time at the club.\n\nPost-Football Management\n\nIn a curious twist of fate, his son Gavin Strachan was on the Celtic coaching staff in 2020/21 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and after a trip to Dubai due to Covid-19 isolation of 13 players and the manager & assistant manager, Gavin Strachan was the de facto acting manager for a couple of games. This meant the first father & their son to have managed Celtic.\n\nThere were reports he would join his son at Celtic, with Gordon Strachan given a role as director of football following Neil Lennon\u2019s departure. This was though was shot down by a number in the support, and the board likely backed away from it as at that point there was a lot of friction between the board & the support. Gordon Strachan did eventually return to Celtic for a short consultancy role in 2021.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWe wished Gordon Strachan the best.\n\nHonours as Celtic Manager\n\nScottish Premier League winner:\n\nScottish Cup winner:\n\nScottish League Cup winner:\n\nSPFA Manager of the Year:\n\n2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008-09\n\nSPL Manager of the Year:\n\nPictures\n\nQuotes\n\nForums\n\nArticles"}, {"url": "https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/city-premier-league-tottenham-hotspur-18235094", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet Sky Blues transfer latest, team news, match updates and analysis delivered straight to your inbox\n\nToday marks 23 years since Coventry City pulled off one of their greatest ever escapes.\n\nOn May 11, 1997, the Sky Blues beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at White Hart Lane against all the odds to preserve their Premier League status.\n\nIt was the tenth time in the club\u2019s stint in the top flight that CCFC avoided relegation on the last day of the season - and it was arguably the best of them all.\n\nAnd they were faced with a mountain to climb from the get-go, needing other teams to lose and to secure a win themselves to make the seemingly impossible dream a reality.\n\nTraffic problems on the M25 and M1 caused the Tottenham game to kick off late, meaning supporters faced an agonising 15 minutes knowing their team had to avoid conceding.\n\nThen player-manager Gordon Strachan has since revealed that he was too nervous to take to the field that day.\n\nStrachan said : \u201cThat game Dion and big Willo scored, and it was the longest 15 minutes of my life at the end.\n\n\u201cWe were 15 minutes behind the other games and I was a sub that day.

Tell you what, put Hadji in midfield and Froggy can go on the bench.\"\n\nClearly having not lost his sense of humour, he added: \u201cCan I get Robert Jarni in there? Stick him on the bench!\"\n\nJarni, of course, a Croatian left wing-back and World Cup star, joined the club for \u00a32.4 million from Real Betis but, infamously, never pulled on the shirt after being swiftly sold to Real Madrid for \u00a33.4m.\n\nSome believed this was a joint Coventry City and Real Madrid tactic, as Betis refused to sell him to the Madrid giants, while the official line at the time was that the player changed his mind after he and his wife saw Coventry.\n\nIn conclusion, Strachan said: \u201cI had some amazing players over my time there and they were a good bunch to work with as well.

He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982\u201383 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup.

He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\n\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title.

He never played for Celtic as a player, and generally was not the most popular opposition player. Nippy and aggressive, he irked some of the Celtic support but mostly it was due to his ability as being just a great player for Aberdeen during a golden period for them.\n\nOverall, he was a great entertaining Scottish player and the Celtic support appreciated that at least.\n\nManagement\n\nWGS became Coventry City\u2019s Director of Football in November 1996.\n\nHe finally retired as a player at the end of the season after making his last appearance at the age of 40, a record in the English Premiership.\n\nStrachan kept Coventry in the Premiership until 2001, when they finally went down after 34 years of top division football. He was sacked shortly after the start of the 2001-02 Division One campaign.\n\nGordon Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager\u2019s job at Southampton \u2013 after Strachan\u2019s appointment in October 2001, they finished 11th in the Premiership.\n\nIn 2002-03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Arsenal, but since Arsenal had qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Southampton qualified for the 2003-04 UEFA Cup.\n\nIn March 2004, Gordon Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager, earlier than intended because he wanted to spend time with his family.\n\nWhen Berti Vogts stepped down as Scottish national coach, Strachan was widely tipped to take over until Walter \u201cWattie\u201d Smith got the job, and he was even linked with the manager\u2019s job at Portsmouth, but turned down the offer to take over. He later took on the Scotland role from January 2013 as the popular choice amongst the Scotland support, resigning in October 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to Euro 2016.\n\nGordon Strachan has also been an analyst of football matches for the media, most notably on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day 2 show. Renowned for his deadpan humour as much as his shrewd tactical awareness, quotes attributed to Strachan have become legendary among football supporters.\n\nAs Celtic Manager\n\nGordon Strachan finally returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O\u2019Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL).\n\nHe resigned on 25 May 2009, after 4 years in charge having won the league three times in a row, with a lot to look on to be proud on, both domestically and in European competition.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE CIS LEAGUE CUP SCOTTISH CUP EUROPE TOTALS SEASON P W D L F A PTS P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A 2005-06 38 28 7 3 93 37 91 4 4 0 0 9 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 4 5 45 33 7 5 107 46 2006-07 38 26 6 6 65 34 84 2 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 0 0 13 3 8 3 1 4 9 10 53 35 8 10 90 48 2007-08 38 28 5 5 84 26 89 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 2 1 1 9 3 8 3 0 5 7 10 52 34 6 12 102 42 2009-09 38 24 10 4 80 33 82 4 4 0 0 9 1 3 2 0 1 4 3 6 1 2 3 4 7 51 31 12 8 97 44 TOTALS 152 106 28 18 322 130 346 12 10 1 1 23 7 13 9 1 3 27 11 24 8 3 13 24 32 201 133 33 35 396 180\n\nFirst season (2005-06)\n\nFor 2005/06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title off current holders (Rangers).\n\nThings didn\u2019t exactly get off swimmingly, and an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager losing 5-0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and 3 days later only managing to draw 4-4 away to Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. A few days later he recorded his first win in charge as Celtic won 4-0 in the return leg of the Champions League qualifier.\n\nHowever, that was not enough to avoid being put out of Europe before the season had got started in earnest. For many Celtic fans, these set of matches set the tone (for both WGS and the supporters) on how the mentality on governing the side\u2019s tactics was to be for future matches. It was a huge psychological blow, and some fans never seemed to forgive him. It was too regularly brought up in seasons to come.\n\nNevertheless, Celtic improved under Strachan, leading the SPL by as much as 20 points at one point despite playing with a defence that came under regular criticism from the media and fans. Rangers were in turmoil as Alex McLeish lurched from one disaster to another. Two notable victories over Rangers in November (scoring 5 goals and conceding none) was a gem of a time, and saw the emergence of Shaun Maloney as a front runner for the team.\n\nNot all went Celtic\u2019s way, and another low-point was the shock defeat in the third-round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they beat Dunfermline Athletic 8-1, a record victory margin for the SPL. Over the period after beating Rangers twice in November, the First Team went through a poor spell for two months where the First Team went behind in too many games, but thankfully fought back in to recover.\n\nWorse was that the First Team kept on conceding goals in all the games. It was not until Celtic played against Rangers in mid-February that the first team had a game that they didn\u2019t concede a goal in.Celtic were winning games but the weaknesses of the side were beginning to be seen, and in many ways they were the weaknesses that were to begin to haunt Celtic for over the next couple of seasons.\n\nAn important point that has to be made is that this was a season of transition, and anyone taking over from Martin O\u2019Neill as manager was going to have a hard task in front of them (a lot to live up to). Spats with Sutton and Agathe, saw both leave prematurely yet both could have contributed more. On the other hand, the players have to take in that the old regime was over and you have to understand and work with the new regime. With the less than stellar playing achievements of both after leaving Celtic, maybe WGS was right. Sutton in particular can be a prickly character and not predictable, so maybe it was best to move him on.\n\nOverall, Strachan\u2019s first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the Scottish League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time with six matches remaining. A difficult year of transition, but he\u2019d won most over to his side at this point.\n\nReflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted \u2018Manager of the Year\u2018 by the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Association eight days after the title was clinched.\n\nThis was just the beginning, and much better was expected of both him and the team in the next season in terms of entertainment and results (goals conceded, scored etc).\n\nSecond season (2006-07)\n\nHis second season was even more of a roller coaster compared to his first, with excuses out the window for many, and the arrival of Paul le Guen (PLG) seen by the press as leading \u201cLe Revolution\u201d at Rangers to challenge Celtic. To the surprise of practically everyone, there was no actual domestic challenge. Rangers went comedic from failure to tragic farce, and Celtic simply took advantage going over 20 points ahead of them at one point in the season. In games v Rangers, the best PLG did was one draw. The \u2018Hearts Revolution\u2019 was also a joke with their challenge petering out before it had even began.\n\nKnocked out early in the league cup was no issue, and WGS easily made it up with winning the Scottish Cup to wrap up a cup and league double. Overall, WGS was having a respite domestically from any strong challenge, but nobody should understate the level of his achievement. Whilst others floundered, he ensured that Celtic did not, and the players were building up a fair reputation as a unit.\n\nThe Champions League was where it\u2019s at, and there he excelled. Despite a tough group, Celtic won all three home games, with a special victory against Man Utd which led Celtic to qualify from the Group stages for the first time. You can\u2019t understate the work done by Gordon Strachan in this. He galvanised the players and had set them out correctly to push further than they expected. Not a unit of players as highly rated together as the best under Martin O\u2019Neill yet they achieved what they did not. The players were fit and able, and were pushing to the last minute of matches. It made a whole difference. Strachan was able to utilise players like Nakamura to his best and it was paying out.\n\nOn the other hand,Celtic were poor away from home and lost all 3 games, with WGS stating that he knew the problem and would have it resolved. The next round v AC Milan was very special for the Support, and WGS held to what he said and the first team didn\u2019t concede in 180mins of football, but sadly didn\u2019t score either. Ultimately,Celtic were outdone by a classic goal by Kaka in extra time. A sad way to go out, but a great achievement by WGS and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nRegardless of the European achievements, some criticism must also be put at WGS for his second season domestically. The quality of football in the last third of the season in particular was appalling, and the player effort by too many of the squad was deemed non-existent. Rangers\u2019 new manager (Walter Smith) had the better of WGS with a very comfortable win in the last game v Rangers in the season, and Celtic lost in some very drab games. People pay to enjoy the product on the pitch, it really was not good at Celtic. It wasn\u2019t \u2018The Celtic Way\u2019.\n\nA number of the signings were disappointing that season, Gravesen, Miller and Jarosik in particular, whilst Jan Venegoor of Hasselink was injured too often. A spat with Maloney over new contracts saw the club lose a great new wee player (transferred to Aston Villa) and the defence was as bad at the end of the season as at the start. The manager appeared to bamboozle and patronise fans on many occasions with his team selections, and what appeared to be a continuing spat with Derek Riordan saw the player play few games and being overshadowed by the far less productive Kenny Miller. A round of boos as Riordan was taken off in one match late in the season was evidence of this. It was a sorry situation.\n\nMany fans were simply disillusioned by WGS at the end despite the successes, and simply couldn\u2019t see where he was taking the team. The fear was that the club was moving backwards despite what had been accomplished in the last year. This should have put an end to the rubbish that the fans didn\u2019t like him as he wasn\u2019t a \u201cCeltic man\u201d (lazy journalism), it was all because of the criticisms as said above. A real roller coaster of a season, and after all the achievements in the season it\u2019s sad to have to have to summarise it all in a negative tone.\n\nThird season (2007-08)\n\nFor WGS, this season had seen him lose the support of most of the fans. However the death of Tommy Burns and his near breakdown after his loss (a close friend and work colleague) showed a side of WGS which many had not seen before in his time here.\n\nThe Support all felt for him and just how much the job and the club really did mean to him. Winning the league against the odds (big odds at that) appeared to have moved the fans and split the fans opinion on him whether to stay or go at the end of it all.\n\nThis season for WGS can be termed a success on paper. To quote him, the team achieved what he set out at the start of the year to do. On paper, Celtic won the league (three in a row) and got through the Champs League group stages again (two in a row) which cemented the club as being more than just a flash in the pan side as others in the past have been cynically referred as being.\n\nCeltic sold hapless Kenny Miller to Derby County for \u00a33m (amazing!), brought in a few quality players like Barry Robson, beat Rangers twice at home in very entertaining games and so on. Adding in that Celtic were seven points (plus a game played more) behind Rangers going into the end of the season, WGS must be given his due, even by his harshest critic, for leading the team to somehow comeback and win the league. The first team won the last seven games (which included 2 wins v Rangers) and got much pride back. That can\u2019t be smirked at by anyone, and the last win came just a week after Tommy Burns death (not an easy time).\n\nAt the end of the day, his style of football was uninspiring and unentertaining, and he seemed to stick with some players in his squad way beyond what he should have and then moved them on (e.g. Caldwell, Donati, JVoH), demonstrating an inability to accept criticism and that he had been wrong. A public rift with Derek Riordan depicted an unsettled atmosphere in the changing room although other comments by players, like Mark Wilson, Pressley and Venegoor, said otherwise praising WGS for his man management skills.\n\nBringing in Barry Robson into the Celtic team seemed to show admission that he needed steel in a lightweight side (and what a change he made to the team), whilst Hartley was a revelation this season and deserved all the praise in the world. Boruc as ever was great, but a kick up the back side was needed as it took him a year to manage a game where he didn\u2019t lose a goal away from home.\n\nAllegations were thrown at the Celtic support that they were spoilt (see this story) and that the support didn\u2019t like WGS as he wasn\u2019t a \u2018Celtic man\u2018. Complete balderdash and it was simply sloppy & cheapshot journalism. The fans pay up good money to watch Celtic, and many a time the performances were dreadful to watch with the manager unwilling to admit change was needed and seemed to anger many, especially when he criticised the fans for not understanding what he was trying to do. The zonal defensive play was not working, the formations weren\u2019t working and certain players needed a kick up the backside.\n\nThe First Team lost v Inv Caley when they were two ahead, lost against Hibs, Motherwell and even struggled in games v Gretna. The First Team lost the first two games v Rangers, with poor tactics amongst other points to blame for it. Transfers weren\u2019t working out, especially the enigma that was Donati. Taking in the club had spent more money than Rangers, it was embarrassing to go behind in the league and watching Rangers going to the end for a very undeserved potential quadruple (which thankfully they didn\u2019t achieve).\n\nAdding all this up, WGS has to take flak. However, as said, his emotions after Tommy Burns showed his real self to everyone and all felt for him. This season may probably have shown him to be more of a coach than a great manager, but unlike the other pundits on television at least he puts his money where his mouth is and takes up the challenge of football management. Moving on to next season he should have learnt from what had happened to become a more complete rounded manager.\n\nMust be said, any manager who wins three league titles in a row must be doing something right, so maybe the critics amongst the fans are wrong. A late find in Barry Robson was a revelation, whilst bringing Lennon into the coaching staff seemed to freshen things up.\n\nWGS can be quite an enigma but moving into the next season, more entertaining football really was a requirement.\n\nFourth Season (2008-2009)\n\nSo, was WGS to cement his name as a legend at Celtic by achieving the coveted \u201c4-in-a-row\u201d of league titles? But more importantly, it was questioned on how was his relationship with the fans going to develop this year? It was a (near) clean sheet for many on WGS after the emotional end to the last season.\n\nBefore the season had even begun, rumblings (as usual) had restarted about WGS and his transfers. Few buys to excite the fans made many apprehensive about the hope for greater entertainment, but in general the mood was that, despite all else, Celtic were going to win the league (confidence was high).\n\nThe season started off rather easily until the first game v Rangers where basically Celtic were turned over (at home) 4-2 and lucky not to have lost by more. The first team were hopeless, and the daggers were out for the manager. The pent up frustration from sections of the crowd was released in one big explosion, and the tone was decidedly frosty for the rest of the season with respect to the manager\u2019s relationship with the fans. Not a good start.\n\nNevertheless following on from there was a cracking set of games which saw Celtic take advantage and overhaul Rangers to go top of the league. There was some great football in the first third of the season, and this was the best to watch Celtic for a few seasons at least.\n\nAnyhow, the big headaches of the season began with injuries besetting the manager in his aim to overhaul Rangers. Credit to WGS as his policy of squad numbers above single big signings did pay off which enabled Celtic to be able to squad rotate players to cover for gaps in the side and keep their nose in front. Amazingly Celtic went 7pts ahead at the end of November, and December became the brightest time of the season and it was capped off with a Scott McDonald inspired 1-0 victory at Ibrox against Rangers. Great! Everyone thought Celtic were set up for the rest of the campaign. How the support were to be disappointed.\n\nDuring all this was the Champions league escapade. A poor final set of results saw Celtic finish bottom of their group and again fail to win any of the away games (see link for full write-up). After 4 years, WGS still hadn\u2019t managed an away win in Europe, something that can\u2019t be put down to bad luck alone, and something that was noticeable to all. Celtic got the breaks last season in Europe, this time they didn\u2019t.\n\nBack to the league, when did it all begin to go wrong? Basically from the turn of the new year, yet WGS seemed to do little.\n\nWhat was going on? To everyone\u2019s surprise, WGS himself summarised the situation well in a post-match interview:\n\n\u201cYou have to determine your own destiny. The eyes of the football world are upon us all. The question being asked is, \u2018Are you a team that plays just when everything is right for you?\u2019 That can\u2019t happen. The best way for us to recover is to get back on form as quickly as possible.\u201d (Mar 09)\n\nHowever, he quickly turned back to old irritating ways by stating in an interview a few weeks later: \u201cIf anyone can find a negative \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they will \u2013 then they are warped!\u201d after a Dundee Utd game in April where Celtic drew 2-2. Clearly and sadly showed a dividing line between the management and the fans. An unnecessary dig and it was an unworkable relationship. This post-match comment was very insulting and patronising to the support (and uncalled for). Difficult to see how things were going to be mended easily for many. Why exactly did WGS have to patronise and insult the support? Only he could answer this question, but best left to the end of the season.\n\nAdd to that, complaints about the lack of entertaining football were being swatted away with abandonment: \u201cIn terms of entertainment, yes, we do have responsibilities at Celtic and Rangers, because we have greater resources than most clubs up here to entertain, But most of the songs that the supporters sing are all about winning trophies \u2014 they don\u2019t sing nice wee ditties about the beautiful game. No one remembers the beautiful football, but they do remember the defeats.\u201d This line again seemed to show his distance from the Celtic ideal.\n\nOne nice break was the league cup final, beating Rangers 2-0 after extra-time, with both goals scored by two Irish internationals (O\u2019Dea & McGeady).\n\nFrom then on in, little went right for Celtic again, and after dropping points, Celtic were up against Rangers to see who was to win the league. The final league game v Rangers was a failure, losing one-nil and from then on the writing was on the wall.\n\nCeltic had lost the league to a poor Rangers side. The Celtic players did not perform, and the apathy around the club was heart-breaking. It was overall a poor season with under-performing players.\n\nThe football was generally poor to watch and it had been a continual complaint over the past few years. For many who were tired of the turgid football on display this was a bit much, and swathes of empty seats at Celtic matches became the norm rather than exception. With the global credit crunch beginning and hitting one and all, it was not a time to alienate the support. Yet WGS did, so why? Who knows? It doesn\u2019t require much to get on the side of the fans.\n\nThere are many reasons for the loss, but the manager has to take the flak and he was not one to ever take criticism lightly, being self-admittedly easily irritated. In fairness there were mitigating points, e.g. the loss of Barry Robson to injury was probably more costly to the First Team than anyone realised, as he was a strong driving force to the title run-in last season.\n\nWGS handed in his resignation with little surprise the day after the league defeat, and he left rightly with his head held high for his achievements over the past four seasons with uncharacteristically no smart remarks from him (thankfully). There was actually some sadness to see him go as there had been many good memories over his time. He had been the creator of his own downfall this last season, and in his own reflection on this last season will have to admit, to himself at least, where he went wrong.\n\nReview\n\nSo after all that, how should anyone take and look back on WGS? His predecessor is still lauded to this day, and in reflection Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements were hanging over WGS during his whole tenure at the club. Regardless, he had to deal with them, and if truth be said, then WGS can argue that on paper at least he has exceeded on par with what Martin O\u2019Neill achieved. Not that WGS would but the argument of who was the better manager (WGS or MoN) was a never ending debate which is all academic now. Martin O\u2019Neill was blessed to have had Henrik Larsson at hand so comparisons for WGS aren\u2019t easy or likely entirely fair.\n\nForgetting his predecessor, WGS had a few tasks to fulfill. Firstly, was to regenerate the squad and lower the cost base after the more spendthrift MoN years, win the league back and get Celtic further in Europe. On that score, he more than achieved what was set out. Wage costs were reduced, Celtic won the league back and in time achieved getting past the group stages in the Champions League twice in a row. Brilliant stuff.\n\nWinning the league three times in a row, as well as outliving two Rangers managers is surely a sign of success, especially after the hoo-haa over Paul Le Guen\u2019s management signing. Add in some incredible achievements in Europe (e.g. in beating European Cup holders AC Milan, the Naka winner v Manchester Utd, qualifying twice out of the Champions League group stages etc), and he can easily hold his head up high. The support were spoilt with success at many points.\n\nWhen Celtic won the league for the third time with him as manager, there is no denying that he had silenced all the doomsayers who were worrying that Celtic were out of the league title race. That last seven game winning run to win the league title against the odds will be spoken about for many a year. It was a phenomenal achievement to pick the players up and get them motivated. No matter what else can be said of his managerial ability, that was exceptional. The First Team came so close to reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup in one season and what a mark that would have been. This was all done without the sublime talents of Larsson, Petrov and Sutton.\n\nEurope had been a sore bugbear for predecessor Martin O\u2019Neill, and Gordon Strachan achieved what Martin O\u2019Neill failed to achieve by qualifying past the group stages (and did it twice). It put Celtic on the pedestal with the premier clubs in Europe, and it was a great place to be.\n\nGordon Strachan was the architect for the high points, and when they came off they were exceptional, and WGS deserves all the credit in the world. Post-match interviews could also be enlivened by some of his emotive witticisms, which on a number of occasions lightened the mood and made everyone smile.\n\nThe most exciting game? Well there were many. WGS himself said that the Spartak Moscow win in 2007 was the most exciting and many would agree but defeating Manchester Utd 1-0 to reach the KO stages of the Champions League was also very special.\n\nHe also helped to foster the careers of some of the younger players, such as Maloney, McManus, McGeady & Wilson, and in reflection they will be thankful for the role that WGS has played in their careers. Some will succeed (at Celtic or elsewhere) whilst others inevitably won\u2019t but at least he gave them the opportunity. WGS likely was the best developer of youngsters we\u2019d had for the past twenty years or so. Billy McNeil was the last to have done well with youngsters in the squad.\n\nSo why in reflection, is the mood relatively more sombre over WGS than an outsider would expect? Much of it has been reflected above in the season reviews. The fans can be said to have been very patient with him, but the truth is that the football in general was too often poor to watch and after four years of that, what are the fans to say? He failed with a number of big transfers, and many players seemed to have declined under him rather than improved.\n\nMany fans take the belief that he couldn\u2019t coach well; confusing squad rotations and team selections baffled players as much as fans, and the last season was woeful in so many ways, throwing away major leads. Tackling Rangers in his last two seasons shouldn\u2019t have been as difficult as it was as Celtic were far better resourced, yet tripped up in both seasons and only got out of jail the first time.\n\nHe never helped himself with a number of his post-match remarks either, the \u201cwarped\u201d comment in his last season in particular was particularly poor judgement. He readily admits that he is easily irritated, but he\u2019d been in football for over twenty years and worked in the media for some time, so he should have been able to know how to deal with it. Yet he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t!\n\nMany would agree that \u201cned-culture\u201d had been on the rise, and WGS in particular had been very vocal on this issue, taking journalists to task on occasion as well. However, when you give a flippant remark to a question or a thinly veil snide remarks to others, then how really is anyone to see him in a different light to those he criticised? Bit extreme but the point stands and he could end up making things worse for himself. All are irked by neds but he made too much of a crusade of it at times, and at Celtic it was the wrong place for his campaign.\n\nCeltic is a social community club, and thefore reflects a cross-section of society. So admittedly the support can have a small share of nefarious characters, but the support does push and emphasise the roots of the club in terms of charity and community, and this in turn is reflected by the good nature and reputation of the support. Winning is not the only aim, it\u2019s also about the ineffable \u201cto play the Celtic Way\u201d. WGS did not seem to comprehend this, and dismissed any criticism of his tactics stating that others didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to do. That was simply nonsense.\n\nHis \u201cwin at the cost of entertainment\u201d style may find favour in the cut-throat English championship but not at Celtic. That in itself had been what has been the crux of the friction between the support and WGS, and that was what created his downfall. He did things by the training manual but that is never sufficient, and he could be quite robotic with his decisions (such as always subbing on players in matches at an exact certain time) so leaving little room for flexibility or showing that he was able to be experimental in matches.\n\nFrom the outside, everything appeared to be rosy as Celtic won trophies but it\u2019s about more than that with the Celtic support. The supporters weren\u2019t most often enjoying the play on the pitch, reflected in the falling attendances.\n\nWGS is actually a very decent man. The players all spoke very highly of him, and there was little if any dissent at the time (McGeady and Riordan apart) even from those who left prematurely, although one or two (e.g. Sutton & Gravesen) have been quite critical of Strachan since leaving but much later on. All Celtic fans who have met him have generally commented well on him. Away from it all, a long one-on-one interview in December 2008 with Radio Scotland brought out his good side and there was a general amount of respect for him from this.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the full qualification to be a successful football manager, and WGS\u2019 natural managerial ability was below that level which all wish he was at. Maybe if he had spent some time with some great managers learning their skill, he could have been a far better manager. He was a player with Manchester Utd and Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson but his coaching began at Leeds (under the dour Howard Wilkinson) and then Coventry, and sadly it\u2019s those latter clubs that his coaching philosophy stems from. Ex-Celt Gravesen in an interview in 2018 commented on Strachan\u2019s extreme fear of losing games, noting criticisms made to Gravesen on defending the lead when he had scored a hat-trick after the game in question.\n\nAn important point must be noted that WGS is the first Celtic manager to have to grapple with the new media. Martin O\u2019Neill was manager when the internet got going, but it was in its infancy throughout most of MoN\u2019s reign, and the scale and importance in which the internet had taken in WGS\u2019 time had meant that he had another task to take on.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy anymore. Replays and events are dissected more thoroughly and for longer than ever before. There are cameras to capture everything, statisticians to tally up the most mundane of figures and heated wipe-spread discussions begin on the matches before they\u2019re even over (on the forums & social media) and not hours later in the pub as it all used to be. Sky Sports & its peers are everywhere, and unconscious comparisons with richer foreign leagues had been rising, which doesn\u2019t help with the club\u2019s limited resources. Sadly, that was the future, and WGS was the first Celtic manager to deal with it and few seemed to sit back and notice. Maybe if they did then he\u2019d have been cut more slack.\n\nHis biggest mistake? Should have left at the end of 2007/08 season as many fans were calling for. He stayed 12 months longer than he should have, and that set in the rot which accelerated over time. At the end of it all, most fans wanted him gone, and it\u2019s sad to see him have to leave in that kind of atmosphere. Much of it had been of his own creation, and his successor had the unenviable task to rebuild the squad in much the same way that WGS himself had to when he himself began.\n\nFor those who still believe that the Celtic support were irrational, they should take the following comment from Middlesborough legend & ex-player Bernie Slaven on Gordon Strachan\u2019s brief reign at Middlesborough after leaving Celtic, as there are parallels from his comment to the Celtic supporters\u2019 criticisms of Strachan\u2019s time at Celtic:\n\n\u201cAfter a year in charge, we [Middlesborough] had not improved one iota \u2013 the football was average, away results were abysmal, the worst league position in 20 years and he still doesn\u2019t know his best team. It wasn\u2019t just on the field that Strachan let himself down, off the field during post-match interviews he became an embarrassment to himself, the club and the fans. He was arrogant, obnoxious, sarcastic, cutting and rude. He came across to me like a man who was on the borderline of insanity.\u201d\n\nWe hoped WGS all the very best in the future, in whatever direction he was to take. Everyone knows from his honest comments that he grew to love the club, just at times his daft side too often got in the way. He is a good man, and for the great memories all will forever be thankful for them and there were a number of them along the way. In time, all at least missed his sense of humour from his interviews [see Quotes by and on Gordon Strachan].\n\nHe signed off from Celtic with a wonderful speech which contained the following great quote (from the Tommy Burn\u2019s tribute match, full wording below):\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pretend I came here as a Celtic supporter. I don\u2019t believe in kissing badges to get your support. I didn\u2019t know the words of \u2018Fields of Athenry\u2019\u2026. [but] From today, I\u2019ve become a Celtic supporter.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan (May 2009)\n\nPost-Celtic & Scotland management\n\nSince leaving Celtic, he had a relatively unsuccessful time as manager at Middlesborough. He took over a set of former Celtic (& Rangers) players to his new club making it dubbed by some as some kind of Glasgow old boys team. It didn\u2019t work out at all, and his time as a club side manager was over.\n\nHe returned to football analysis on TV & Radio, and to the joy of every Celtic fan, he has been incredible towards Celtic. Never hides his sympathy, and talks up the club at every opportunity. Really puts to shame some former players who have taken pot-shots. Without the pressure of management, Strachan has shown his knowledge of the game on TV and applied it in an easy accessible manner for the viewer and is very popular. A very different character to the fish-bowl like environment that a Celtic manager has to endure in Glasgow.\n\nThe support was very much warming to him, and possibly it\u2019s an indication that he may have regretted not having shown this more amiable side during his time at Celtic. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone, and maybe only once he was at a distance that he was able to admire what Celtic had offered and given him. The affection that Strachan now has with the support was increasingly mutual as was shown on his frequent trips back to Celtic Park.\n\nMust add that he had acted as a mentor in part for Neil Lennon. At one point there were stories of bringing Strachan back as a paid mentor for Neil Lennon but this didn\u2019t materialise. However, he has still acted as such and Neil Lennon publicly paid his respect to Strachan once after advise given by him which helped Celtic win a vital game against Rangers (and helped keep Neil Lennon in his job).\n\nCuriously, Strachan has claimed that there was no bias against Celtic in his time as manager of the club, but then again Rangers were so bad during much of the spell, bias wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (as it was to do so during Lennon\u2019s reign).\n\nScotland Managerial Tenure\n\nOver his entire time as a manager, his name was continually brought up as a possible future Scotland manager, and with the lack of candidates putting themselves forward for the role, Strachan in January 2013 was announced the new manager. Interestingly, one of the first questions he was posed at his initial press conferences was: \u201cIs this the biggest job in your career so far?\u201d, to which Strachan retorted: \u201cI was manager of Celtic, there\u2019s no bigger job than that!\u201d. Bless him, the support loved him more now than ever.\n\nThere was to be added spice for the Celtic fans. In 2013, Martin O\u2019Neill was announced as the Republic of Ireland manager with ex-Celtic player Roy Keane as his assistant. If you ever read back to the old match threads, reports and reviews by Celtic fans from the 2000\u2019s, a common argument was \u201cMoN v WGS\u201c, as who was the better manager: Martin O\u2019Neill or Gordon Strachan?\n\nThe comparisons were difficult, and the arguments at times nauseating, but in 2014 both Martin O\u2019Neill and Gordon Strachan were drawn to face each other in competitive matches for the Euro Championships. The first match was ironically played at Celtic Park as Hampden was being renovated, and Scotland triumphed 1-0, and the return leg ended 1-1 with ex-Celt Maloney (who had played under both at Celtic) the scorer for Scotland in both games. Nobody was going to truly believe this would settle any old arguments. Time has now passed by for the old debaters, and both managers should be respected for their time at Celtic.\n\nStrachan\u2019s second run at qualification had certain parallels to his time at Celtic, as in the roller-coaster aspect. A grim start to the qualification for the 2018 World Cup was compounded by his stubbornness where he opted to remain loyal to old stalwarts rather than new players or those regarded as currently on form in the Scottish league. Many also argued he had a bias against those based in the Scottish leagues in preference to the English leagues.\n\nThe qualifying campaign for Strachan to the 2018 World Cup was a roller coaster mirroring that of his time at Celtic. Having begun the campaign very poorly, his head was on the block, only to incredibly recover but then fell at the final hurdle. Part of the problem was his initial intransigence to play Celtic players who were then by far the best in the country, publicly rebuking calls for more Celtic players, most notably Griffiths.\n\nA 3-0 loss to Lithuania at the start of the campaign featured no Celtic players, but the turnaround featured a number. His fall at the final hurdle was in part due to the loss of two key Celtic central midfielders (Brown & Armstrong) to injury. The biggest issue was to be his patter, and a post-match comment about Scot\u2019s lacking height & genetics made him lampooned across the footballing circuits and infuriated everyone. He was still rubbing everyone up the wrong way.\n\nOn the other hand, Scotland were again a fighting side under his management. As at Celtic, last minute goals were notable event, e.g. crucial winner v Slovakia in Oct 2017, it was a great attribute. The amount of times his Celtic and Scotland teams have done it is remarkable. There comes a point where you can no longer say it\u2019s luck or fortune, and he genuinely does instil a belief and winning mentality into his teams. Fair enough the football wasn\u2019t always free-flowing and the mentality didn\u2019t necessarily always turn into victories, but the winning belief was a great trait to have.\n\nHe resigned in Oct 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to the 2016 Euros.\n\nFew were bemoaning the decision, but he had made a rod for his own back. His positives and negatives again came very much to the forefront in this role as it did at his time at Celtic. Sadly he would leave with little to write home about with Scotland (despite some progress) whilst his Celtic tenure had many wonderful highs. If anything, it vindicated the often ambivalent opinion the Celtic fans had of Gordon Strachan over his time at the club.\n\nPost-Football Management\n\nIn a curious twist of fate, his son Gavin Strachan was on the Celtic coaching staff in 2020/21 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and after a trip to Dubai due to Covid-19 isolation of 13 players and the manager & assistant manager, Gavin Strachan was the de facto acting manager for a couple of games. This meant the first father & their son to have managed Celtic.\n\nThere were reports he would join his son at Celtic, with Gordon Strachan given a role as director of football following Neil Lennon\u2019s departure. This was though was shot down by a number in the support, and the board likely backed away from it as at that point there was a lot of friction between the board & the support. Gordon Strachan did eventually return to Celtic for a short consultancy role in 2021.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWe wished Gordon Strachan the best.\n\nHonours as Celtic Manager\n\nScottish Premier League winner:\n\nScottish Cup winner:\n\nScottish League Cup winner:\n\nSPFA Manager of the Year:\n\n2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008-09\n\nSPL Manager of the Year:\n\nPictures\n\nQuotes\n\nForums\n\nArticles"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/gordon-david-strachan-1535.php", "page_content": "Before he professionally started playing football, he was offered a contract by Eddie Turnbull to play for a club, but his father opposed the decision by stating that the club did not cover sufficient expenses.\n\nGeorge David Strachan was born to Jim and Catherine in Muirhouse, Edinburgh.

The club struggled at the start of the 1996-1997 season, which resulted in Atkinson being asked to step down from the managerial position.\n\nAfter Strachan was appointed as manager, he helped his team reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1997-1998.\n\nIn 2001, he was appointed as the manager of Premier League Southampton, succeeding Stuart Gray. Under his leadership, the Southampton team earned their place for the UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, he returned to manage the team, Celtic, on June 1, 2005. Although he had a very shaky start as a manager, the team eventually began to do well under his management and started winning tournaments.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, he was signed on as the manager for Middlesbrough. However, after a series of defeats, he voluntarily stepped down as the manager during the 2010-2011 season."}, {"url": "https://www.besoccer.com/player/biography/strachan-266097", "page_content": "No microphone has been detected in the system x\n\nYou need to give permission for the microphone to be used to be able to use it x\n\nError while trying to use the microphone, the browser may not be compatible x"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52951616", "page_content": "Gordon Strachan's career began at Dundee in the mid-1970s and after successful spells with Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United, he was still playing English top-flight football for Coventry at 40.\n\nHe put his longevity down to a diet of porridge, bananas and seaweed tablets, and relied on fitness, acupressure and afternoon naps to extend his playing days.\n\nHere Strachan has chosen his \"basically unbeatable\" XI of former club team-mates.\n\nGoalkeeper: Jim Leighton\n\nThanks to Sportscene, I've been watching some Aberdeen and Scotland games recently. When you look back you think: \"What a good goalkeeper Jim was, making big saves at the right times.\" He was making good hits by good players look simple, when they were bouncing in front of him. The only time he embarrassed himself was when he started running.\n\nCentre-backs: Paul McGrath, Willie Miller & Alex McLeish\n\nStrachan describes his former Manchester United team-mate Paul McGrath, plus Brian Robson and Norman Whiteside, as \"first-class people\"\n\nI couldn't leave Paul McGrath out. He is probably one of the best players I ever played with, considering he was injured and all the problems he had throughout his career. He was a truly magnificent football player. On top of that he was a great lad, always good fun, never a bad word about anybody.\n\nWith those three, the rest of the team could just go out and attack. Any one of them coming forward with the ball to make it eight attacking players with two left behind, I'd have no problems whatsoever. Miller and McLeish could have played for any team in Britain at the time. They just enjoyed defending.\n\nSix of Strachan's greatest XI are in this Aberdeen squad photo from 1983-84\n\nCentre-midfielders: Norman Whiteside, Gary McAllister, Bryan Robson\n\nBryan Robson is the best player I ever played with. He had everything. You could put him in any position. He could score goals and defend. Like Willie Miller, he was a fantastic captain who would put the players first. The only negative was if he asked you if you wanted to go for a night out - it would be three days on the go never leaving a pub!\n\nGary McAllister and I played together at Leeds. He was a wonderful footballer but Leeds made him into a player. A footballer can play sometimes in the conditions that suit them. Gary turned into a player - he could play anywhere, any time, any game, any condition.\n\nRemi Moses, Arnold Muhren, David Batty, Neil Simpson, Neale Cooper, it's unbelievable the players I played with. Dougie Bell was a fantastic player. But Norman Whiteside could score wonder goals, tackle, header. He wasn't the fastest but he was a powerful runner.\n\nStrachan appointed Mark McGhee and Gary McAllister to his coaching team when he was Scotland manager\n\nWide midfielders: Stuart Kennedy & Peter Weir\n\nIf it wasn't for Stuart, I wouldn't be where I was later in my career. Stuart gave us the width and pace and I did the intricate things. We worked well together. Stuart would be at right wing-back.\n\nStrikers: Mark Hughes & Mark McGhee\n\nMark Hughes used to drive you crazy when he was a kid because you'd hit the ball up to him and he'd keep touching it. If you went to support him, you'd run by him because he'd have so many touches. But then he got older and got better and better and he could do anything.\n\nMark McGhee did something every game that was outrageous. He played in every game, he took knocks, he made runs, he held the ball up, he could jump, he was never unfit. Sir Alex [Ferguson, former Aberdeen and Manchester United manager] described him as one of the most important people in that [Aberdeen] team. He and Steve Archibald were absolutely magnificent."}, {"url": "https://www.thesportsdb.com/player/34171859-Gordon-Strachan", "page_content": "Gordon David Strachan OBE (born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish football coach and former player.

It was all at the top level. He saved them on many occasions from relegation. He was incredibly brave and he helped me become a better manager.\n\nRight back - Stuart Kennedy\n\nWe had a great relationship together and we worked well. He helped me become a better player and hopefully I helped him to be a good right-back.\n\nIn his mind, he was the best right-back the world has ever seen, so I have to take a bit of credit for making him the best right-back ever. He worked hard, he had this mindset that nobody could beat him. If somebody did beat him, it would be the fault of nature that he couldn't deal with, it was an act of God.\n\nCentral defence - Willie Miller and Paul McGrath\n\nMiller spent his entire club career at Aberdeen\n\nWillie was the best penalty box defender in the world at one point. He kept his back four close to him. He could deal with anything. He was a decent footballer who started life as a striker. He had a great mentality and was a great captain.\n\nPaul was truly incredible - he could play midfield. He was a magnificent centre-half. He could leap, he could pass, he could run - he had everything. A special man and such a lovely fellow.\n\nLeft-back - Danny McGrain\n\nDanny was the best Scotland ever had, you could play him at right-back or left-back. He was a phenomenal man, a machine.\n\nAt no point during the game did you think he was tired. He would get forward, although he didn't score many goals. He got into lovely positions, but he panicked a bit. When he hit you, you knew you were hit.\n\nI just thought he was a decent bloke who had time for everybody. He made it easier for people like myself coming in. Always polite, not over-friendly. He just did enough to make you welcome.\n\nLeft midfield - Davie Cooper\n\nI played against Davie when he was at Rangers and I played with him at Scotland. He had incredible skill, but he didn't have to run because his ability was so good.\n\nCooper played for Rangers in the 1970s and 80s\n\nHe was a magician. He was a bit like John Barnes. People would push him on to his right and he would somehow get it back on to his left. He didn't need a right foot. His left could do things as if it was on his right. It made no difference to Davie.\n\nMidfield - Bryan Robson\n\nHe was the best all-round player I have ever seen. He could play anywhere. I could pick him in most of the positions in this team and he would be as good as anybody.\n\nHe could do everything - goals, tackles, headers, social convener - and he was a great bloke. He always looked after his players as a captain and I can't speak highly enough about him. If you were lazy, Bryan would sort you out.\n\nMidfield - Gary McAllister\n\nA wonderfully, elegant, un-Scots like footballer. He should have been a Spaniard or an Italian. I think he did think he was Italian for a while with all the gear he used to wear. It looked good on models but not so good on him.\n\nHe was a wonderful footballer. He could hit a ball 50 or 60 yards and score great goals. He was harder than people thought. He could put his foot in and take a kick. He very rarely got injured.\n\nRight midfield - Peter Weir\n\nThe best two-footed player I ever played with. I saw him put in the performance of a lifetime against Ipswich and he destroyed them. He went inside and hit a ball in the back of the net. He went outside of a full-back and hit the ball in the back of the net. Right foot, left foot. He was a wonderful player.\n\nHe was a record transfer at the time for Aberdeen, but he was an unassuming fellow. He had a determination about him which went through the whole Aberdeen side.\n\nForward - Kenny Dalglish\n\nProbably the best Scottish player ever. He's a great man, misunderstood at times, but a wonderful, wonderful footballer who was, in his day, world class.\n\nHe wasn't the quickest, that was the only thing he didn't have. He made up for it with his body strength and his big backside - that was a weapon and a half.\n\nForward - Mark Hughes\n\nWhen you look at the teams he's played for - Manchester United, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and even when he went to Southampton - he was still a top player.\n\nHe could score any time. If you saw the ball being played up to him, you knew you had to get round him, but the ball stayed with him.\n\nManager - Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nHe's the best manager ever. I don't know how many titles he's won in England, it's phenomenal. It's not just for Manchester United. Look at St Mirren and what he did there. It was their best team ever as a group. There's no doubt about the team he created at Aberdeen, it's their best ever.\n\nHe's done it at three places, which is not a fluke. You can do it once. Brian Clough did it twice. I don't see anyone doing it three times."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/gordon-strachan/", "page_content": "Gordon David Strachan ( or ; born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish football coach and former player.

He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan, also footballers.\n\nClub career\n\nBorn and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy. His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery. At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within \"a thousandth of an inch\" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye. He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.\n\nDundee\n\nStrachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14. In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United, reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park. His natural talent was immediately apparent and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award. He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975; The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner. Strachan became a regular player in the 1975\u201376 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches. However David White's \"Dee\" were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.\n\nNew boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976\u201377 First Division campaign, and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee. However, the club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first team place early in the 1977\u201378 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was \"getting kicked a lot\" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker. Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that \"we need \u00a350,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate\". His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6\u20130 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as \"embarrassing\".\n\nAberdeen\n\nStrachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of \u00a350,000 plus Jim Shirra. Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977\u201378 a poor season for Strachan, though the \"Dons\" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers.\n\nMcNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager. Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game's opening goal. Though the 1978\u201379 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979\u201380 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park. They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides en route, where they lost 3\u20130 to Dundee United at Dens Park. At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year. After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.\n\nThe \"Reds\" could only manage a second-place finish in 1980\u201381, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become \"Britain's first \u00a32 million player\", in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games. He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach. With fit-again Strachan on the right flank \u2013 supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy \u2013 and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981\u201382, but had to settle for second place to Celtic. They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4\u20131 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.\n\nThe 1982\u201383 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5\u20131 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup. Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's European success came with a 2\u20131 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1\u20130 win over Rangers. The \"Dons\" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983\u201384, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic. This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.\n\nManchester United\n\nIn August 1984, Manchester United spent \u00a3500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford. However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC K\u00f6ln, United paid \u00a375,000 compensation to resolve the row \u2013 teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany. Strachan opened the 1984\u201385 campaign with four goals in seven matches, though the \"Red Devils\" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1\u20130 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.\n\nAfter winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985\u201386 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury. They proved unable to cope with their injuries \u2013 another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson \u2013 and limped to another fourth-place finish. Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, \"I never thought he'd follow me this far south!\" After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form. United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986\u201387, before rising to second place in 1987\u201388. Strachan's form was again patchy in 1988\u201389, as United slipped back down to 11th.\n\nLeeds United\n\nIn March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of \u00a3200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history. However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division. He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles. Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband. He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with hard-man Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989\u201390.\n\nWith the \"Whites\" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed. They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990\u201391, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup. Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.\n\nStrachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991\u201392. In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' hated rivals Manchester United the title. However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back. Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.\n\nHowever, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992\u201393 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League. Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award. He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993. This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4\u20130 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.\n\nStrachan managed 37 starts in 1993\u201394, and Leeds rose to fifth. He was rarely selected in the 1994\u201395 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.\n\nCoventry City\n\nIn March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997. Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson. He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation. However, Isa\u00edas left the club after falling-out with Strachan. Coventry signed Gary McAllister for \u00a33 million on wages of \u00a320,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal. The club struggled at the start of the 1996\u201397 campaign, and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.\n\nInternational career\n\nStrachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Stockholm. He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain. The Scots cruised to a 5\u20132 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, M\u00e1laga; Strachan was named Man of the Match. Scotland then lost 4\u20131 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn, Seville. In the third match, a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union back in M\u00e1laga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.\n\nScotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign. To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg. The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1\u20130 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualc\u00f3yotl to the unseeded \u2013 but highly fancied \u2013 Denmark. Strachan then scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates. In the third and final group match back in Nezahualc\u00f3yotl, Scotland drew 0\u20130 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when Jos\u00e9 Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.\n\nStrachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992. However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles. He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.\n\nManagerial career\n\nCoventry City\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to the manager's seat. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant. After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December. However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the \"Sky Blues\" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.\n\nStrachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan \u2013 all of whom would win international caps. Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997\u201398, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997\u201398 FA Cup. After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs. Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.\n\nThe club finished 15th in 1998\u201399 and 14th in 1999\u20132000, as Strachan spent \u00a36 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and \u00a35 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans. New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool. Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001\u201302 First Division campaign. His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.\n\nSouthampton\n\nStrachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary's Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002\u201303 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press. He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.\n\nCeltic\n\nAfter a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005\u201306, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5\u20130 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4\u20134 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4\u20130. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8\u20131, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association eight days later.\n\nStrachan ahead of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Spartak Moscow, August 2007\n\nThe following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's Derek Riordan; Chelsea's Ji\u0159\u00ed Jaro\u0161\u00edk; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost the tie, against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2\u20131 victory against Kilmarnock left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. However, by April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1\u20130 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1\u20130 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.\n\nDespite winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, after failing to lead Celtic to another league title in the 2008\u201309 season, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nStrachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate. He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager's job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player. His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty. On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5\u20131 away to Queens Park Rangers. After a poor run of results, including a 3\u20130 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1\u20130 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3\u20130.\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season meant Middlesbrough were down in 20th place, Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October. He voluntarily tore up his contract and left without compensation.\n\nScotland\n\nStrachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein. His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1\u20130 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan's first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots' slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup. After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.\n\nIn Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland. After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland. In their following match, Scotland produced an \"insipid\" performance, as they lost 1\u20130 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play. In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany. Scotland came from behind to lead 2\u20131 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive. A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention. Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association. After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.\n\nManagement style\n\nTypically playing a traditional 4\u20134\u20132 formation, and very occasionally 4\u20135\u20131, Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style, and states that he watches video replays of his club's matches two, sometimes three, times. He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed. Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.\n\nRenowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.\n\nEnmity with Alex Ferguson\n\nDespite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, \"I decided this man could not be trusted an inch \u2013 I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.\" In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was \"surprised and disappointed\". The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United. In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.\n\nOther work\n\nStrachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport's Match of the Day 2. He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV's coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV. In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during The Debate on Sky Sports. Following the release of convicted sex offender Adam Johnson from prison, Strachan had appeared to suggest that abusing Johnson for that offence was comparable with racial abuse.\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children's Villages, the official charity of the tournament.\n\nStrachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.\n\nIn July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.\n\nPersonal life\n\nStrachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man. Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers, and Gemma Strachan.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nClub performance League Cup League Cup Continental Total Season Club

has left his position as Scotland manager by \"mutual consent\", four days after the team failed to qualify for the World Cup.\n\nThe decision, taken in conjunction with the board of the Scottish Football Association, means 60-year-old Strachan leaves a job he took in January 2013.\n\nAssistant Mark McGhee also departs.\n\n\"On behalf of the board I would like to thank Gordon for his excellent service to the national team,\" said Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan.\n\nStrachan succeeded Craig Levein in the role, initially to oversee the end of the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nScotland's attempt to qualify for Euro 2016 began brightly but they ultimately fell short of reaching the finals in France.\n\nStrachan and the SFA board agreed he would stay on to lead Scotland in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, but a 2-2 draw in Slovenia on Sunday ended their hopes of finishing second in Group F and reaching the play-offs.\n\n\"I said on my first day as Scotland manager that it was the proudest moment of my career and that I wanted to put a smile back on the nation's face again,\" Strachan said.\n\n\"I share the profound disappointment at missing out on the play-offs, especially having worked so hard to fight our way back into contention.\n\n\"The players should receive immense credit for that resilience in coming back from a difficult start and I would like to thank each and every player who has come in to represent their country.\"\n\nScotland: I'm very surprised Strachan has decided to leave - Gordon Smith\n\nStrachan said he and the players had shared \"some magical moments\" and the memories \"will live with me for ever\".\n\nHe added: \"Of course, what made those moments special was the unwavering support of our fans.\n\n\"Through highs and lows you have stayed with the team and my biggest regret is not being able to provide the finals tournament you deserve.\n\n\"I would like to thank the board, the backroom staff and everyone at the Scottish FA for the help and support they have given me as national coach. It has been a real privilege.\"\n\nThe SFA board met at Hampden on Thursday to discuss the position of Strachan, whose contract was due to end next month. They will now begin the search for a successor.\n\n\"I know how disappointed he was that we couldn't secure a play-off place but to come so close was a tribute to the belief he instilled in his squad,\" Regan said.\n\n\"After almost five years the board felt it was time for a new direction to prepare for the Uefa Euro 2020 qualifying campaign and also the forthcoming Uefa Nations League.\n\n\"We are grateful to both Gordon and Mark for their efforts and wish them the best of luck in the future.\"\n\nScottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan, left, and president Alan McRae, right, were part of the board that discussed Gordon Strachan's future\n\nAnalysis - 'There was only ever going to be one outcome'\n\nBBC Scotland senior football reporter Chris McLaughlin\n\nThere will be disagreements about the decision but few would argue that the news came as much of a shock. The SFA could not be seen to be rewarding failure and as the players trudged off the pitch in Ljubljana. It felt like the end, not only for their world cup chances, but for the manager.\n\nHe had come close to walking away in the past and the speed of today's decision was most likely aided by a reluctance from the man himself to carry on. The players loved him, the media tolerated him and the fans were split down the middle but ultimately the results dictated he couldn't carry on.\n\nYes, performances improved but ultimately it was two campaigns and two failures.
