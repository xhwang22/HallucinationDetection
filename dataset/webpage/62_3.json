Lee distinguished himself academically, studying mathematics and graduating with a first-class degree (1974) from the University of Cambridge before earning a master\u2019s degree (1980) in public administration from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. He then became an officer in the Singaporean military, eventually rising to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nLee\u2019s political career began in 1984 when he joined his father\u2019s party, the ruling People\u2019s Action Party. Later that year he was elected to Parliament and was also appointed minister of state in both the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defense. In 1985 he chaired the Economic Committee, which recommended a large tax reduction and the implementation of a consumption tax. A year later he was elected to his party\u2019s Central Executive Committee, and in 1987 he became minister for trade and industry and second minister of defense. Lee assumed the position of deputy prime minister immediately upon the ascension of his father\u2019s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, in 1990. Lee was treated for lymphoma in the early 1990s. The cancer ultimately went into remission, and he made a vigorous return to political life, serving as chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (1998\u20132004) and as finance minister (2001\u201307).\n\nOn August 12, 2004, Lee assumed office as prime minister of Singapore, replacing the outgoing Goh. The transition had been planned and occurred without an election. Lee\u2019s father was appointed to the newly created cabinet post of \u201cminister mentor,\u201d and Goh remained as the senior cabinet member; both men resigned from the cabinet in 2011. In addition, Lee\u2019s wife, Ho Ching, served as executive director of the government-run investment firm Temasek Holdings, which owned stakes in some of Singapore\u2019s largest companies. The cabinet included for the first time two female ministers of state; it was made up primarily of appointees who had been reassigned from other ministry posts.\n\nWhile observers expected Lee to retain tight control over the prosperous city-state, he appeared sensitive to the desire among many Singaporeans for a more open society. He promised to permit greater freedoms in a country where rigid social policies and limits on political expression were strictly enforced. Revised guidelines on free speech were announced shortly after Lee was sworn in, but while certain restrictions were eased\u2014licenses for indoor political meetings were no longer required, for example\u2014many remained intact. During his tenure as prime minister, Lee was subject to charges of nepotism and corruption and, as had his father, took a number of his detractors to court for libel. Though he was successful in such legal proceedings, he drew disapprobation over what was perceived internationally as the suppression of free speech.\n\nLee championed the legalization of gambling in 2005, attracting significant foreign investment in the development of casino facilities. His 2006 economic package disbursed a portion of the large budget surplus as a bonus to citizens and channeled money to health care, education, and housing programs. Even greater attention was paid to those programs after the 2011 parliamentary elections, when opposition candidates made an unexpectedly strong showing. Notable was the creation of a compulsory health care insurance plan, which was to go into effect by the end of 2015.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In response, Lee promised to donate a significant portion of his earnings to charity and to voluntarily subject himself to a salary freeze. Continued criticism of the high salaries, however, prompted the government in 2012 to cut the pay of ministers (including the prime minister) by about one-third and that of Singapore\u2019s president by half."}, {"url": "https://www.gic.com.sg/who-we-are/board-of-directors/lee-hsien-loong/", "page_content": "Chairman, GIC Board\n\nLee Hsien Loong has been Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister since 2004.

Because of COVID-19, we cannot gather all our cadres and activists physically in one place. Some of us are here at the NTUC Centre at One Marina Boulevard. The CEC itself, the branch chairmen, our retired MPs, and of course our NTUC brothers and sisters. But many comrades are participating virtually, from the Party HQ in Bedok and party branches all over the island.\n\nThis split arrangement also means we cannot have our usual party awards this year but rest assured, we have not forgotten the many members who have served the party loyally and well over so many years, and particularly in this extraordinary COVID-19 and election year. I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart, for everything that you have done. When the situation normalises, we will hold a proper ceremony to recognise your sacrifices and contributions.\n\nGE2020\n\nThis is also our first Party Conference after GE2020. I had called the election to ask voters to give the PAP a fresh mandate and a new full term. So that we can focus on dealing with COVID-19 and the economic crisis; coping with a shifting and uncertain external environment; and setting the long-term direction for Singapore.\n\nWe won our mandate, with over 61% of the popular vote, and 83 out of 93 seats. Our activists worked extremely hard during the GE. Quite a few constituencies were hard fought. We held West Coast GRC and East Coast GRC, where the opposition put up strong challenges and where they had significance beyond the numbers. We also held Bukit Batok SMC. These were important wins.\n\nOur activists in the opposition wards had the most difficult task. You have tended hard ground over the last five years and longer. Representing the PAP, helping residents there with their needs. Patiently, gradually, striving your best to win their hearts and minds. It was not an easy task. Your poured heart and soul into it. In the end, we were disappointed not to have done better in Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC. It was not for any lack of zeal or effort. On behalf of the party, I would like thank our candidates and activists there for your hard work and your very heavy personal sacrifices.\n\nIn addition, we narrowly lost Sengkang GRC. This was a painful loss for all of us, and especially for our GRC team of candidates \u2013 Comrades Ng Chee Meng, Lam Pin Min, Amrin Amin and Raymond Lye. But we respect the decision of Sengkang voters. The PAP will not give up in these opposition constituencies. We will maintain our presence. We will strive to win back the voters there and one day we will succeed.\n\nOverall, the election results fell short of our expectations, but I was not completely surprised. Before the elections, several commentators had predicted a landslide victory for the PAP. They said this was a crisis election, so there would be a flight to safety. PAP \u201cbao yia\u201d, sure win. The Opposition even claimed this in order to frighten Singaporeans, claimed that they feared a wipe out, or a whiteout.\n\nI never believed this. On Nomination Day, I said I did not think this was a realistic outcome. I was confident that Singaporeans firmly supported the government\u2019s efforts against COVID-19 \u2013 far more so than in many other countries. But I also knew that public health was not the only thing on voters\u2019 minds. By the time the election was held in July, people were feeling the pain, both from our safe distancing restrictions and also from the sharp lockdown and the sharp economic downturn. Despite strong government support over four Budgets \u2013 now five, quite a few had lost their jobs, or suffered falls in income. Many others were worried about their livelihoods and future. Businesses were also frustrated by the impositions placed upon them. For example, in the construction industry, many contractors found it difficult to comply with the stringent rules and approvals which were needed to get their workers cleared to resume work safely. Because of all this, the mood was not upbeat, it was apprehensive. The anxiety was palpable, and it cost us votes.\n\nThere was also a broader desire for more alternative voices and a stronger Opposition to check the PAP government. 1ASG alluded to his just now. The pandemic shifted attention towards more immediate public health and bread-and-butter issues but this desire for alternative voices has been there for several elections, and has grown over time. It was below the surface and it resurfaced once the election was called, and particularly when the Opposition played it up.\n\nNotwithstanding these trends, the unequivocal signal from voters was that they wanted the PAP to form the government, and to see Singapore through the challenges ahead. Even many who voted for the opposition, did so fully expecting that the PAP Government would be returned to power, and Singapore would continue to be in good hands. This voting behaviour did not arise because people wanted the PAP out. On the contrary and paradoxically, people voted like this because they believed that the PAP is the only party that could win and govern Singapore. The outcome is already certain; so no need to make extra sure. It is a strange dilemma that we face. But that is how it is.\n\nAs Comrade Heng Swee Keat said earlier, we will review the General Election result carefully, to draw lessons that will help us do better next time. Comrade Desmond Lee who is heading the After Action Review has been seeking views from our activists and branches. Many of you have given valuable feedback, for example, how we can organise ourselves more effectively; how to strengthen our branches to fight future elections; which voter groups we need to pay more attention to; how we can pitch our message more precisely at different voters. The Party will act on this feedback, and also address the issues that surfaced during the campaign.\n\nPAP MPs and activists are already back, working hard on the ground. In politics there is no substitute for the hard, patient work of reaching out to people, solving their problems, and winning their trust and confidence. COVID-19 has made this work a little harder. But our MPs still have to tend the ground in their constituencies, cultivate their support base and engage their residents, both online and in person. At the same time, they must engage different groups beyond their own wards, for example trade associations, interest groups, community organisations. These groups are all part of our society. The PAP will continue to reach out to them, work with them on common agendas, and tap their energies and passions, to bring us all closer together and to move us all forward.\n\nBut even as our Party solves people\u2019s problems and strengthens our ground support, we must not neglect the political contest. In the new normal, the political contest has become more intense. We must work harder to translate programmes and policies that benefit Singaporeans, into messages that people will identify with and embrace. We must stand ready to face closer scrutiny, both in and out of Parliament. Where the criticisms are fair and the suggestions are constructive, we will take them in, and improve our policies and performance.\n\nBut we should also defend vigorously what we believe in and stand for, take the fight to the opposition, and persuade Singaporeans of the best way forward. If we are not prepared to fight hard for what we believe in, people will soon sense it. All these years, the people have been with us because they knew we had backbone: we will fight even with our backs to the wall, and we will never let them down. That is how we have been able to win support for our ideas and plans, and shown Singaporeans that we remain the best team to secure their future. You must have guts, you must have conviction, you must have that spunk and that fight. You may feel desperate with your back against the wall. You believe in it. Stand for it. Fight for it. If need be, die for it.\n\nThe Tasks Ahead\n\nNow that the election is behind us, we must focus attention on the urgent priorities which prompted the election. First, keep ourselves safe from the virus. Second, to get our economy back on track.\n\nThis is what Singaporeans elected the PAP to do, and what we will be judged by in the next election. We have to deliver competent government and ensure that the substance of our policies are right. But good policies must be accompanied by good politics. Especially in these tough times, the PAP must provide Singaporeans with strong political leadership. To imbue Singaporeans with determination and confidence. To put our people at the centre of everything we do, listen to their aspirations and anxieties, and light a candle in this hour of darkness. We have to rally the nation together, to overcome our most serious challenge since independence.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nSince COVID-19 first reached our shores in January, we have taken many drastic but essential steps which have saved the lives of many Singaporeans. After a tremendous effort, and after many disruptions and sacrifices, we have finally got the situation under control, and we have been keeping the situation under control for several months now.\n\nNow our task is to keep the COVID-19 outbreak stable, and get into a position where we can safely and confidently open up further. We cannot simply relax the current restrictions, and hope that COVID-19 cases will remain low. The more we open up and resume normal activities, the more likely it is that we will have new cases including from overseas, either visitors or returning Singaporeans. And therefore, we have to keep up and refine our safe distancing measures. We also have to improve our processes and our safeguards, to deal with the cases which pop up, to prevent isolated cases from becoming clusters, and clusters from becoming generalised outbreak.\n\nThis is why we have been working hard to strengthen our testing and contact tracing capabilities for example by developing and deploying rapid test kits by expanding our Safe Entry and TraceTogether programmes, and distributing TraceTogether tokens and the apps. These measures will help us to detect new cases early, and prevent them from developing into new clusters.\n\nThen, we will be able to progress to Phase 3 without suffering a big second wave of infections, and get back to a more normal life, or at least a new normal. We can then permit larger social gatherings, including bigger groups at weddings and resume more international travel to strengthen and expand our business links, in the first instance. And in time, also for family visits and leisure travel.\n\nManaging this, pulling this off is a very delicate balancing act. Many countries have tried to get it right, but failed. After getting their COVID-19 numbers down, they opened up, relaxed, and the population relaxed with too few precautions. Cases shot up again, and they had to lock down severely a second time, sometimes a third time. But by then, people had become tired and cynical about the restrictions. They were less stoic, less forgiving of the measures, and more resentful of the authorities. Instead of solidarity and resilience, there was fractiousness and recrimination. People turned against their governments, blaming them for the bad outcomes. Sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly. But they are angry, it did not matter. This is happening in many European countries, and in North America as well. These countries are currently experiencing a huge second wave of COVID-19, much bigger than the first wave.\n\nSo COVID-19 is not just a public health problem; it is also a political problem because it takes political leadership to convince people that we need to keep the measures in place, especially when the case numbers are low. We still need the measures because without the measures, the case numbers would not be low. The danger is not very far away, and it can pop in and up any time. We must show people while we do all these things, that we care for them, and we empathise with their difficulties and we must maintain public trust in the government and its leaders. So that if we need to implement new measures or policies, people will accept them, cooperate with them and give them a chance to work. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for us to survive this crisis without further mishap.\n\nEconomy\n\nBeyond public health, we also have to deal with the economic fallout of COVID-19. When we implemented the circuit breaker in April and May, the economy nosedived. Now many sectors are gradually picking up again. But some are still in suspended animation, aviation, transport, tourism, , and they are likely to remain in suspended animation for quite some time. Because with the US and Europe having major outbreaks ongoing, they are not going to open their borders. Furthermore the outbreaks in Europe and America will affect their economies, and will affect our export markets. Therefore we must expect the general economy, we hope it will remain stable, but I do not see it picking up in a vibrant way very soon.\n\nManaging this protracted economic downturn is another major political challenge. Some businesses will find that they cannot carry on without government support and government support cannot last forever. Some workers will have to look for new jobs. Insecurity over livelihoods will stay high. The government cannot save every job and every business, but we will do our level best and go all the way to help every worker.\n\nIn policy terms, we know what we need to do: We are helping workers and companies through the crisis, the schemes are there, the Jobs Support Scheme, the Jobs Growth Incentive, foreign worker levy rebates. Most importantly, we must create more new jobs by revitalising the economy and that means helping companies transform themselves and find new markets and attracting new investments from existing as well as new companies which will create new jobs.\n\nBesides having the right economic policies, we must also address people\u2019s concerns and anxieties. One major worry is that COVID-19 will affect lower income households and workers disproportionately. This would undo the years of progress we have made levelling up low-wage workers, building social cohesion and the sense of hope that in Singapore, we start off poor, but you work hard and do your best, you have a chance of doing better in life. We must prevent low-income households from being disproportionately hit by COVID-19. The government will pay special attention to lower income groups, and to tackling inequality in our society. We will do this comprehensively. Not through glib slogans or half-baked proposals. But with a full range of practical support measures, and we have them, the Progressive Wage Model, Workfare, Silver Support, CHAS, and there will be more and we will develop new ways of achieving this objective. We will make sure that taken together, our schemes offer real, sustainable support to lower wage workers.\n\nThis is fundamental to the PAP\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. It is the purpose of our existence as a party. We began as the party of workers and unions, striving for the uplift of all the people, and especially the most vulnerable ones among us. Hence, we built \u201ca democratic society based on justice and equality\u201d. We will always stay true to that purpose. A second worry that many Singaporeans have is the competition from foreign work pass holders. I fully understand these pressures. They exist, and Singaporean workers must feel reassured that the government will help them to hold their own against competition from foreign workers or competition from abroad, and make sure that they are fairly treated compared to foreign workers. Otherwise, we will have a lot of angst and social tensions. Even if we manage to get the economy going again.\n\nAt the same time, we must convince Singaporeans that the best way to protect livelihoods and families is to keep Singapore open for talent and for business. If we just close ourselves up and send away the work pass holders, it will result in fewer jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans, and more hardship for our workers and their families. So this is a very delicate balance to strike. But we have to address these issues we have to do it, we have to get the right balance and the right mix of the touch as well as the clear headedness,- because that is the only to bring our people through the crisis safely, body and soul. This is a major political task. It takes leadership; it takes courage. We must not falter.\n\nWe must rally our people and give them hope. Times are tough for every country, but relative to other countries, Singapore has considerable strengths. Our workforce has a sterling reputation as the best workforce in the world for which we have to give thanks to the workers themselves and also to the unions and labour movement who have helped them. Our society is cohesive, united in fighting COVID-19 and in striving for a better life. Our government works, is efficient, and consistently delivers results for Singaporeans. And our politics is stable, with Singaporeans firmly backing the government they have elected. In Singapore, everything works and everyone expects everything to work because together, we have made it work. It did not happen by itself, we made it happen.\n\nThat is why even in this depressed economic climate, so many investors are setting up offices, factories and headquarters in Singapore, and expanding their footprints here, creating opportunities for us here. Recently I broke ground for a new project for Hyundai Motors in Jurong. It will be an R&D facility to do research and development on future mobility technologies, in particular, electric cars and it will also manufacture electric cars, for a start, up to 30,000 cars a year, EVs. This will create many new jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. Singapore has not produced cars for a very long time. Yes, we used to have a Ford assembly factory along Upper Bukit Timah Road. The cars came in pieces, you put the pieces together, screw them together, and we said, Made in Singapore. It really did not work and in 1980, that factory closed down and now it has become a museum! But electric car manufacturing is different from traditional auto manufacturing. It is higher tech, deeper skills and more automation and we have a chance to do this. So Singapore is making a comeback! The lesson is that even when skies are grey, there are rays of light and we must look for them, make the most of them, and through our own efforts, create even more promising opportunities for ourselves.\n\nThis COVID-19 and the economic crisis, the PAP government has its work cut out for it. We have to lead from the front, rally our people to press on, carrying them with us come what may but we cannot do this alone.\n\nPAP-NTUC Symbiotic Ties\n\nIn fulfilling our role to lead Singapore, the PAP is fortunate to have a staunch ally- the Labour Movement. The LM stands shoulder to shoulder with us and has done so since the very beginning.\n\nWe have been close partners since the founding of the PAP. It has been an enduring and productive relationship and the foundation of our harmonious tripartite relations, and Singapore\u2019s sustained economic success.\n\nThis partnership between the PAP and the LM is what we call a symbiotic one. We live with one another and the cooperation makes things better for both of us. Unionists work with the PAP to protect workers, improve their lives, help them keep up with economic transformation and reach their full potential. And the PAP understands that its foremost responsibility is to the people of Singapore, which means the workers of Singapore, and their families. Fighting for workers is deeply embedded in the PAP\u2019s DNA. That is why the PAP sends representatives to attend the NTUC Delegates\u2019 Conferences, and why we are honoured to have our NTUC brothers and sisters joining us today at this Party Conference\u2014which is being held at the NTUC headquarters, at OMB. It is not just for old times\u2019 sake, but an expression of our abiding close ties.\n\nIn this time of crisis, it is especially vital to strengthen the partnership between the PAP and the NTUC. This is when unions need the government to be on their side, looking after workers\u2019 interests, supporting their families, protecting jobs and livelihoods. And this is when the PAP government needs strong support from the LM, to keep a finger on the pulse, to get workers to understand and support the measures and the policies that will help us get out of this black time and get through this difficult period. That is why I am very happy to see the PAP and NTUC branches working together on the FairPrice Food Voucher Scheme for the needy. I\u2019d like to thank Brother Ng Chee Meng, Brother Seah Kian Peng and the NTUC and NTUC FairPrice team for generously stepping up and donating the food vouchers. Last year they donated $1.2 million, this year $3 million worth of food vouchers. It will be deeply appreciated. On behalf of all our voters and residents, thank you very much.\n\nOne day, COVID-19 will subside. But after that, we will be in a very different world. There will be much more economic disruption, much greater turbulence in the job market. We can expect new models of work, more contract and short-term employment arrangements, faster churn as workers shift or try to shift from declining to emerging industries.\n\nThe close partnership between the PAP and the NTUC will be a precious asset as Singapore navigates our way through this uncertain future. Workers will need a strong Labour Movement more than ever, while the government will rely on the unions to fulfil their responsibilities, to protect workers and take Singapore forward. At the leadership level, the partnership remains very strong. But on the ground, between our party branches and individual unions and union branches, the engagement is not so deep. PAP MPs are often invited to serve as advisors to various unions. The MPs should go beyond advising, to helping out with the union ground, engaging workers directly. That way when worker issues arise, PAP MPs and leaders have a solid feel and understand the ins and outs of the issues and why workers are worried, what their concerns are. And then, the PAP MPs can speak up on behalf of workers in Parliament, and show them that they have a voice in the PAP.\n\nWe should also recruit more union leaders to join the PAP, and have more party activists in the union ranks. So that ties are kept warm and close at the working level, whether it is in the unions, or in party branches. Then the PAP and NTUC can continue to nurture our symbiotic relationship and groom new generations of activists, and work hand-in-hand to take Singapore forward for more generations to come.\n\nFuture of Singapore Politics\n\nWhen I spoke in Parliament in September, I explained why the PAP has a special responsibility to Singaporeans. I want to say it again today, directly to our party activists \u2013 to explain to you why you have a special responsibility to Singapore and to Singaporeans. The PAP has won every general election since 1959, until now, more than half a century now. We have got good people into politics, to serve the party and the nation. With the support of Singaporeans, we have been able to take care of their needs \u2013 housing, education, healthcare, security, hope and opportunities. And because we have had political stability, we have looked forward, made long term plans for our future, and created opportunities for Singaporeans to maximise their potential at every stage of their lives. That is how we have worked with Singaporeans to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation, year after year. And that is why Singaporeans have returned us to power, election after election, entrusting us with the heavy responsibility of leading Singapore.\n\nThis is a virtuous cycle \u2013 each step feeds into the other, the next, and then it feeds back again. Because we delivered the goods, we gained strong political support. Because we had strong support, Singapore had political stability. Because we were assured of political stability, we could think long term, we could bring good people, committed people into politics. And because we could do that\u2013think long term, we could deliver better lives for all our people. And then because we delivered progress, we could retain the confidence of the people and win the elections again. It feeds into itself, it\u2019s a virtuous circle, each time you come back, something better, rise higher.\n\nWe must keep this cycle going for as long as possible. Once we break it, it will be impossible for any party to restore it, not even the PAP. Many countries have more fiercely contested democratic systems, and more exciting politics, but these do not always add up to good government. Too often, contestation makes the politics unstable and divided. Governments come and go. Policies get introduced, then jettisoned with each change of government. Naturally, those in power focus on their own short-term political survival. Those out of power make irresponsible, extravagant claims to get in. They offer deceptive short-cuts and painless remedies, without being upfront about the costs and the consequences. As a result, governments cannot make any long-term commitments, and the country cannot maintain a consistent long term direction to steer its way forward.\n\nSingapore is not like that but very few countries work like Singapore. Just read the newspapers. Never mind whether it is international news, elections in the US or crisis in Europe. Or the regional news, much closer to home- very exciting politics. Do we want such excitement in Singapore? Is it good for Singapore- to have these ups and downs, the hurly burly, unpredictability, the bitterness, the division, the rancour, the splits that will take many, many years to heal? Or do we want to keep on building on what we have, treasuring what we have achieved, remedying the flaws, the shortcomings which there will always be\u2014 making it less imperfect, a little bit better, a little bit better, a little bit better, patiently, year by year, election by election. So that by the time you hand over to your successors, hand over to your children, you can say, we made Singapore better for you, please do the same for your successors and your children.\n\nSo that is what we want to do. To sustain the Singapore model, the PAP cannot stand still. The country is changing. The politics is changing. And so, the PAP must change as well. We must adapt to what Singaporeans want to see in their politics. Singaporeans still want stability and progress, job security and opportunities for themselves and their children. But increasingly, Singaporeans want other things too. To participate more actively in shaping our society. To re-examine basic assumptions, and look beyond the tried-and-tested way of doing things. And to have greater checks and balances, and more alternative voices, more robust public debates, and closer scrutiny of government policies. These expectations and desires will only grow with every generation of Singaporeans. The PAP must respond to them. At the same time, we have to maintain our core identity and what we stand for. We must continue representing all Singaporeans, and not just a particular sliver or segment of the population.\n\nWe have long established our identity as a party \u2013 for 66 years now. The PAP has kept itself vigorous and stayed in power by constantly evolving and rejuvenating ourselves, and keeping our policies fresh and relevant to the times. We have to keep on doing this, even as we forge fresh bonds between the PAP and successive generations of Singaporeans.\n\nThat is why the 4G leaders have been leading initiatives to encourage Singaporeans to come forward and express themselves. Engage, participate, argue, work things out, make the compromises, form the bonds and build the team. 1ASG spoke about SG Together, and the Emerging Stronger Conversations. Our hope is that through these platforms, Singaporeans will feel empowered to make a difference and contribute to society, working hand-in-hand with the PAP.\n\nThat is also why we have been renewing the party leadership at every GE. I am especially proud of our latest batch of MPs. They have each established themselves and made a mark in their own professions and their own communities. They can speak from direct personal experience, with conviction and passion, to represent and champion the concerns and interests of Singaporeans. Let me name a few: Hany Soh, an active grassroots leader in Bukit Panjang for many years, who also co-chairs the Law Society\u2019s community legal clinics committee. Yeo Wan Ling, who founded a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers. Mohd Fahmi, who was the Deputy Chief Guards Officer in the SAF, then served in MUIS as Deputy CEO, and is now in the NTUC. They, and many others, will do the Party and Singapore proud. We are proud of them, we have confidence in them.\n\nI have appointed several of the new MPs, as well as some previous backbenchers, to the Cabinet or as office holders. They will reinforce the 4G team, and help the PAP to provide Singapore with the leadership it needs, beyond me and my older colleagues\n\nLeadership renewal remains one of my top priorities. But as I have explained, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, it is my duty to see our nation through the crisis, before I hand over responsibility for Singapore in good shape to the next team and into safe hands. I ask you to support me and my whole team \u2013 older and younger MPs, office holders and backbenchers. We will do our very best to fulfil our duty at this critical time.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery party member should be deeply conscious of the heavy responsibility that Singaporeans have entrusted us with. Singaporeans will judge the PAP not only by what we have done for them in the past, but by what we will be doing this term with them and what we can continue to do with them. Our actions must strengthen their trust in the PAP, and our policies and plans must continue to take Singapore forward. So the PAP must continue to govern Singapore well, work the ground, stay accessible to voters, and lead by example. I ask all our comrades to commit ourselves to these tasks.\n\nNever forget we are the PAP \u2013 the People\u2019s Action Party. We are not the party of special interest groups or particular communities. We represent the people of Singapore. We are a party of purpose, of conviction, of action. We have made life better for millions of Singaporeans. We will constantly pursue a more just and equal society and we are ever determined to walk alongside every Singaporean, striving towards a brighter future together.\n\nMajulah NTUC, Majulah PAP, Majulah Singapura."}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2023/06/08/singapore-senior-minister-tharman-to-run-for-president", "page_content": "SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/Asia News Network): Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam (pic) will be running for president in the upcoming election, stepping aside from politics after 22 years.\n\n\u201cI wish to inform you that I have decided to put myself forward as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election.

This General Election is critical for our future.\n\nThe government that you elect will have its hands full. It must continue fighting the virus, and keep Singaporeans safe. It must save jobs and businesses, so our people can continue to make a living. It must persevere with our long-term plans, so Singaporeans can still look forward to a better future.\n\nAll these are massive challenges.\n\nOur lives, our jobs and our future are at stake.\n\nFor us to come through, we will need two critical elements. First, the best possible leadership for Singapore. Second, a solidly united population, that gives the leaders they have chosen full support.\n\nOur Lives\n\nWe have been fighting COVID-19 since the beginning of this year. It has been a tough and relentless battle. There were some heart-warming stories of recovery. A centenarian, an old lady aged 102, caught the virus, recovered and is now again enjoying her favourite durian. A Bangladeshi worker, hospitalised for five months, is now discharged, and looking forward to going home and seeing his new born son for the first time. These stories have encouraged and motivated our people working tirelessly on the frontlines.\n\nBut we are still in the thick of this fight. Up to now, we have kept Singaporeans safe, through a heroic effort. The Ministerial Task Force has led our efforts to combat COVID-19. The Task Force has mobilised the whole public service, with support from many volunteers and activists. Singaporeans have played your part too, by following safe distancing rules, minimising social contact, wearing masks when outdoors, and maintaining good personal hygiene. Your cooperation has made all the difference.\n\nWe will have to sustain this collective effort for perhaps a year, or even longer. We are opening up in phases, businesses are restarting, Singaporeans are getting back to work, extended family and friends can meet again. But as we open up, we must be prepared for a resurgence in cases. It has happened in South Korea, Germany, and several states in the US, which have opened up after initially curbing the virus.\n\nHow can we prevent this from happening in Singapore? On the government\u2019s part, we are expanding testing capacity and improving our contract tracing, to identify and stamp out new cases faster. But this is only half the solution. We must all continue to maintain discipline and comply with the safe distancing rules. Even if our daily cases have come down, and the problem appears to have gone away because this is the only way to keep the number of cases low, and to protect our families and others around us. Our success depends on the government and people working together and trusting each other. If we are careless or lax, a major outbreak can happen, and we may have to lock ourselves down again and that would be a severe setback.\n\nAn equally essential task for the government is to restart our economy. COVID-19 has caused a global recession, the deepest since the Great Depression. We have avoided massive job losses and company closures so far, because we acted decisively.\n\nBut the worst of the economic downturn is yet to come, especially since the virus is surging again in the US and elsewhere. There will be more retrenchments and some of these jobs may never come back.\n\nTherefore, one key focus of the government, in the coming months and years, must be jobs. We are doing our best to encourage companies to keep their workers and take on new ones. We aim to create 100,000 new job and training opportunities and we are investing heavily in SkillsFuture, so Singaporeans can pick up new skills and move on to better jobs.\n\nBut beyond subsidies and support schemes, fundamentally we must grow our economy in order to create more new jobs in total and new investments are an important way to do that. EDB is working very hard to attract investments to Singapore. They secured $13bn in new investments in only the first three months of this year and this is extraordinary, because in an ordinary year we attract around $10bn only during the whole year. This $13bn of investments in the first quarter will generate several thousand jobs over the next few years\n\nHow was EDB able to do this, during a pandemic and a recession? It is because Singapore enjoys a strong reputation internationally, and investors have confidence in us. Investors know the quality of our government \u2013 they have met our Ministers and worked with our public service. They also know our government has strong popular support. They are confident that the government can get Singaporeans to back policies that will grow the economy, attract talent and investment, and eventually create jobs for Singaporeans. These have been the fundamentals of our economic success, and the reason why MNCs have kept faith with us. In a crisis, it is even more critical for us to reinforce these fundamentals, in order to attract more investments and jobs to Singapore.\n\nOur Future\n\nEven as we deal with the immediate priorities of fighting COVID-19 and reviving our economy, we must not lose sight of our longer-term mission to improve Singapore. One day, the pandemic will pass. The recession will be over but the world after COVID-19 will look very different. Our external environment will be less stable. The world economy will be less integrated. It will not just be a changed world, but a changing one. We will have to be resilient and adaptable, to earn our living in this new world.\n\nBut we cannot only be responding to changes in the world. We must know where we want to go, and how we will get there. What do we want for Singapore? How can we make it happen, despite the great changes around us? Even as we battle through the worst of the storm, we must not let the wind and the waves carry us where they will. We may have to take down some sails, divert around the worst weather, shift our present course but our ultimate destination does not change.\n\nThe PAP has many long-term plans for Singapore. Every National Day Rally, I have been sharing these plans with you, to give you a sense of where we are going, and what Singapore can be. We have ideas for more and better pre-schools, for affordable healthcare for the elderly. We want to transform Singapore\u2019s landscape by developing new HDB towns and parks, by building new MRT lines and Changi Terminal 5, by realising the Punggol Digital District and the Greater Southern Waterfront and we have begun preparing for climate change.\n\nThese are ambitious plans, spanning decades with the crisis, we will have to revise some of them. E.g. delaying Changi T5 for two years while we reassess the aviation industry post-COVID-19 but our basic ideas remain valid, and we are resolved to realise them. Because we are determined to always be exceptional, always distinguishing ourselves in an ever-changing world. So that every generation improves on what they have inherited, and can pass on a better Singapore to their children.\n\nCapable government leadership is essential in this endeavour. But the leadership can only succeed if it wins the strong support of the people. Our people too must feel that we are building Singapore not just for the current generation of Singaporeans, but as a sustained effort spanning generations. The world may be uncertain, and many dangers lurk which can derail our plans. But if our government and people are united, trusting each other and working together with a clear direction, we can overcome any challenge that comes our way, and make steady progress, decade by decade, towards our long term vision.\n\nLeadership\n\nIn this election, Singaporeans are choosing the leadership team to take Singapore safely through the current pandemic and economic pain, and also to lead you beyond the crisis, into better days ahead.\n\nMy PAP team has worked very hard to put together the best team to serve you. It is an experienced team anchored by Ministers and MPs who have seen Singapore through past crises, and therefore know what to expect, what to do, what pitfalls and traps to avoid. We have also refreshed the team with a younger generation of promising Singaporeans. They come from all walks of life. Indeed, our new candidates this time are among the most grounded, the most organic, the most relatable we have had in years. They have been knocked about and learnt about life, made mistakes and learnt from them. They reflect our evolving society, and they each have their individual perspectives and passions. Most importantly, they all share core values and convictions, and the courage to do right by Singapore, like every generation of PAP leaders before them.\n\nThe PAP is determined to provide Singapore not only a strong leadership team for the next five years, but a team that has depth, and continually renews itself for the future. This is why the PAP has an unremitting focus on leadership renewal. My duty as PM is not just to take good care of Singapore during my own time in office. I must also prepare younger leaders to be ready to take over the baton from me and my older colleagues\n\nThat is why I put the younger Ministers in charge of the Ministerial Task Force. They are directing our response to COVID-19. This is not a dry run, nor even a live firing exercise. This is deadly serious real-life crisis management, in an unprecedented global crisis. I am happy that over the last six months, the younger Ministers have proven that they are up to the task. This is what it means to be a responsible steward of Singapore, and of our future.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor 60 years, the PAP has served Singaporeans faithfully. We led the Pioneer Generation to fight for self-government and independence. We worked with the Merdeka Generation to take our country from Third World to First. Singapore has made it thus far against all odds, only because generations of Singaporeans have trusted the PAP, and worked with us to build this country. Your support has been the PAP\u2019s greatest strength. And the PAP has never let you down.\n\nNow, we must face the crisis of a generation together, and carve out our place in the world anew. I ask you to once again give me and my PAP team your mandate. Please vote for the PAP . So that we can work with you, for you, and secure our lives, our jobs, our future.

And maybe also William Gibson\u2019s observation that the country is like \u201cDisneyland with the death penalty.\u201d But the hypermodern nation and close partner of the United States is also a place where things work. Indeed, some say the city-state runs like an extremely efficient corporation. What has kept this ticking?\n\nOne answer is the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), which boasts an enviable record of political longevity. After its foundation by Lee Kuan Yew and his comrades in 1954, it has governed the nation continuously since 1959. The British granted self-government in 1959, with full independence coming in 1965 in the form of a painful separation from Malaysia, with which Singapore had briefly merged. This represents an unparalleled dominance, matched by few if any political parties. Singapore has evoked a mixture of fascination and incomprehension from external observers. Some in the West view it as authoritarian (chewing gum, caning), while others (including, some say, China) think that it possesses some sort of elixir that, if not replicable in its entirely, offers valuable lessons.\n\nI am the author of a history of the PAP from 1985 to 2021, which was recently published by the National University of Singapore Press. The idea for the book came from Singapore\u2019s modern founding father and premier for 31 years (1959-1990), Lee Kuan Yew. An outstanding intellect, Lee\u2019s insights were sought by many (and he is probably the only world leader to meet every U.S. president from Johnson to Obama).\n\nLee left the Cabinet in 2011, but was always thinking about world events and what these meant for Singapore. An unnamed senior U.S. leader once called him a \u201cone- man intelligence agency.\u201d\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nLee spoke to me in 2011 and asked whether I could take on the job of writing the history of the PAP since 1985. (Another historian was also asked to chronicle the period before this). Lee wanted a sense of how far the party-in-government had come, some sense of the internal discussions and debates within the Party, and a discussion of the challenges it had faced in governing.\n\nEnjoying this article?

But it seemed clear, talking to Lee at the time, that he felt that people\u2019s memories were fading, and that the younger generation was in danger of taking things for granted. He was concerned that young people did not understand what Singapore was about \u2013 out of sheer sense of wanting to try something else, they might elect the Opposition, which to him was unthinkable.\n\nHe told me at the initial meeting that he wanted an unvarnished account \u2013 nothing was off limits \u2013 but also a book that people (especially young people) would actually read.\n\nMy 10-year journey of research and writing, which included access to top Party leaders and documents from the PAP archive, offered me the chance to provide an exposition of the Party\u2019s DNA, how its leadership is forged, and the adaptive capabilities of the Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned.\n\nThe PAP\u2019s Ideology of Pragmatism\n\nDoing what worked: this is what characterized the thinking of Lee and his closest colleagues. They rejected \u201cisms\u201d and ideologies.\n\nIt my research and interviews, what came through most clearly was this sort of practical governance and policymaking. What works is kept. What does not is discarded. So many things would not have come to fruition if PAP leaders had been straitjacketed by political theories or even what might be been deemed acceptable in other locales. One example is the policy, introduced in the 1980s, of ensuring that high-rise public flats built by the Housing and Development Board, which housed the majority of the population, had to have the same racial mix as the nation as a whole \u2013 75 percent Chinese, 14 percent Malay, 10 percent Indian, and a smattering of others, a measure designed to prevent ghettoization and the formation of racial enclaves.\n\nThe best ideas for running the country have to surface, and if the mechanisms do not exist, then they have to be invented, and Lee was not averse to tinkering with the system of constitutional democracy to get people with ideas into Parliament. It is mainly at his prompting in the 1980s that the second generation of PAP leaders, gradually being tested for leadership, introduced an innovative system that allow MPs into Parliament even if they have not been elected: the scheme allows \u201cbest loser\u201d MPs from elections, as well as MPs nominated by various sectoral interest groups, to take seats in Parliament and provide alternative voices.\n\nRenewal: An Existential Impulse\n\nTwo other key themes stand out. The first is renewal. Renewal was from the get-go an existential issue for Lee and his closest colleagues. It\u2019s in the Party\u2019s DNA.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nEvery key decision maker at the top I have spoken to has touched on this issue. The Party is continually preoccupied with finding people of high caliber \u2013 in recent years, including those who might have serious differences with the Party \u2013 and bringing them in.\n\nThe recruitment process uses referrals from within, personal contacts, and meticulous screening of the lists of the top performers in the Civil Service. The first stage of screening is the Party\u2019s famous \u201ctea sessions,\u201d which are used for sussing out intentions, character, and intelligence. Actual interviews for those who pass this stage then carries on in formal interview sessions until candidates who have not fallen by the wayside are grilled by the apex of the Party: the Central Executive Committee.\n\nIt is quite clear that inducting the best talent, never easy for the party, has become appreciably more difficult in recent years. Of every 10 (perhaps even more) approached to stand, perhaps just one individual might in the end consent to stand. The vast majority of them say no, with many going on to be immensely successful in their chosen field. Top leaders of the Party suggested to me that increasing scrutiny, given the forensic dissection of their lives and their pasts on social media, where anonymous individuals vent their spleen on candidates they do not like, they are not entirely sure they would consent to stand in the current era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponsiveness and Trust\n\nEven though the book covers high politics, the leadership, and policymaking, as one might expect, the other theme that stands out is responsiveness. The PAP has always emphasized being attuned to the needs, desires, and aspirations of the people. Ground sentiment must be ventilated upwards and discussed by the leadership.\n\nThe Party\u2019s responsiveness is also about the largely unsung work done by PAP MPs on the ground, in building rapport with the constituents, being available to them and hearing their concerns, and trying new ways to do outreach even as the times and the people have changed. This is what makes the Party tick at the grassroots. PAP MPs in Parliament have to surface issues \u2013 grievances and views on topics ranging from taxation to the cost of living to the number of foreigners in the workforce \u2013 but they have to thread the needle to doing so in a way that does not undermine the standing of the Party.\n\nThe flip side of responsiveness is the periodic national consultation exercises or \u201cconversations\u201d that are held every few years. The efforts have become more inclusive, and indeed more accepting of dissenting views, even as the next generation of PAP leaders has played an increasingly active role in these exercises.\n\nThese exercises have a dual role. The government gets unfiltered ground feedback, while the event puts in one room different Singaporeans from all walks of life. People do not necessarily leave these conversations convinced, but they have had the experience of having come face to face with other thinking Singaporeans who may have very different views on any given issue.\n\nThe Social Compact\n\nIn the eyes of some of its top leaders, the PAP is not just a political party; it is the only national institution capable of taking Singapore into a challenging future.\n\nKey government leaders I interviewed refer to a \u201creservoir of trust\u201d between government and people. This means that bitter pills, policy-wise, can be swallowed, understood, and accepted by the people, partly on account of the Party\u2019s track record.\n\nHowever, maintaining this reservoir is going to prove increasingly difficult.\n\nAt the 2020 general election, the PAP was returned to power but with a nearly 10 percent reduction in vote share compared to 2015. Younger voters increasingly demand fairness and transparency. They want not just an Opposition, but a strong one.\n\nThe Party\u2019s historical response to electoral setbacks has been to take stock, recover, reorganize, and renew ties with the people. There is little doubt that it will attempt to do so again and ensure that its dominance continues. But the question is how successfully it can do given the changing circumstances, which are, some would say, growing ever more messy, normalizing, and democratic."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east-asian-studies/article/explaining-elections-in-singapore-dominant-party-resilience-and-valence-politics/B4313DB214400AF11ED31DC80F673611", "page_content": "With each successive victory, the dominant party gains increased resources with which to reshape the country's politics and society.

Remember, elected governments are only as good as the people who choose them. Lee Kuan Yew, Eve of National Day Broadcast (1988)\n\nWhy do Singaporeans vote for the People's Action Party (PAP)? From the achievement of independence in 1965 to the present, the PAP has won each of Singapore's 12 post-independence general elections with at least 60 percent of the popular vote. Each of these elections has been open to challengers and free of the electoral fraud and threats of violence that commonly buttress dominant party regimes across East and Southeast Asia. The PAP's dominance over Singapore's politics and society has, in short, been secured and continuously renewed through the votes of Singaporeans. The resilience of the PAP thus constitutes a genuine puzzle, as \u201cSoutheast Asia's miracle city-state\u201d is \u201cthe only among the world's richest [and open] countries never to have changed its ruling party\u201d (The Economist 2015, 1), thereby contradicting the claims and predictions of numerous theories of democratization.\n\nWe argue that valence considerations are the dominant factor in explaining why Singaporeans vote for the PAP and a critical piece to the puzzle of the PAP's resilience. Specifically, we claim that assessments of party \u201ccredibility\u201d\u2014what Au (Reference Au and Chong2010, 105) describes as the sense of \u201ctrustworthiness, competence, and professional qualification that has become the touchstone of local electability\u201d\u2014are the primary drivers of voting behavior in Singapore, and that they thus affect outcomes more substantially than do either positional considerations, such as ideological and policy alignment between voters and the PAP, or a \u2018climate of fear\u2019 regarding the potential consequences of supporting the opposition.\n\nFurthermore, we argue the primacy of valence politics is at least partially by design. Since independence, the PAP has done as Pempel (Reference Pempel and Pempel1990, 334) suggests: it has used its control of Singapore's high-capacity state to reshape politics and society \u201cin its own image and likeness,\u201d through an ensemble of policy initiatives and institutional reforms. As a result, voters increasingly have focused on valence considerations, which contributes to the resilience of the PAP in two ways. First, when voters focus on valence considerations, the PAP maximizes the dividends it draws from its control of the state and from Singapore's successful record of development. Second, a strong focus on valence considerations crowds out ideological alternatives that are incompatible with the PAP's platform. In short, electoral competition on valence considerations allows the PAP to effectively maximize its advantages and minimize its vulnerabilities, and this explains a substantial portion of the puzzle of the PAP's resilience.\n\nBy showing that a large portion of Singaporean voters \u201csincerely\u201d support the PAP on valence considerations, our argument stands in contrast with alternative explanations that emphasize ideological or policy alignment (e.g. Singh Reference Singh2012), as well as those that highlight a \u2018climate of fear\u2019 to explain PAP support (e.g. Ortmann Reference Ortmann2011; Amnesty International 2009). Regarding the broader literature on dominant party regimes, our argument builds on Magaloni's (Reference Magaloni2006) influential work on voting behavior under dominant party rule in two ways. First, we show that voters \u201csincerely\u201d support dominant parties for reasons beyond expected macro-economic performance; voter choice is motivated by broader concerns, ranging from social stability to the efficient and responsive delivery of local services. Second, we show that voter preferences in dominant party regimes are endogenous to the dominant party's preferences over the long term. This contrasts with implicit assumptions in the literature that voter preferences are fixed. The time distinction is critical: in the short term, dominant parties respond to the sticky preferences of voters through incentives designed to maximize their vote share given those preferences. In the long term, as the Singaporean case demonstrates, dominant parties can use their control of the state to reshape voter preferences themselves. When this is done strategically, voter preferences can be made to align with the strengths of the dominant party, thereby reinforcing the equilibrium that perpetuates its dominance.\n\nWe use a multi-methods approach that leverages novel data and a unique feature of elections in Singapore to produce evidence in support of our argument. We begin with a within-case, historical analysis to demonstrate that the centrality of valence considerations is at least partially by design. After a period of political pluralism in the years before and immediately after the achievement of self-rule in 1959, serious ideological alternatives to the PAP were eliminated in the early 1960s. The PAP faced virtually no challengers until the 1980s, paving the way for dominant party rule. During this period, the PAP used its control of Singapore's high-capacity state to reshape politics and society through an ensemble of policy initiatives and institutional reforms that entrenched the PAP's paradigm of effective governance. By the time the opposition first mounted comprehensive challenges in the mid-2000s, the primacy of valence considerations\u2014described in the local vernacular in terms of \u201ccredibility\u201d\u2014was widely internalized by Singapore's electorate.\n\nWe then substantiate the endpoint of this claim by conducting a qualitative analysis of contemporary party competition and voter behavior during recent general elections (GEs). First, we show that opposition parties generally do not attempt to differentiate themselves from the PAP in positional terms when making appeals to voters. By contrast, there is significant variation between the PAP and opposition parties in terms of voter assessments of party credibility, with the PAP being broadly viewed as more competent and capable than opposition challengers. Second, we review survey evidence that suggests voters overwhelmingly cued on valence considerations in GE 2015: factors like the quality of party leadership, parties, and candidates were more frequently identified as important for voters\u2019 decisions than were positional issues, government benefits, or fear of consequences from voting against the government (Welsh Reference Welsh2016b).\n\nNext, we conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Singapore's 2011 and 2015 GEs, in which we leverage a unique feature of elections in Singapore to demonstrate the effect of party credibility on PAP support. The PAP competes in a series of two-cornered fights (i.e. pair-wise contests) against a range of opposition parties. This pattern of competition allows us to use historic survey data on party credibility to estimate its marginal effects on PAP support. We leverage novel data from a variety of other sources, which we describe in detail in our data section, to generate covariates that engage the work of numerous scholars of Singaporean politics and control for alternative explanations. These include candidate incumbency and challenger quality (Mutalib Reference Mutalib2003); party and state grassroots infrastructure (Slater Reference Slater2012; Welsh Reference Welsh2016a; Weiss, Loke, and Choa Reference Weiss, Loke and Choa2016); the demographic composition of electoral divisions (Rodan Reference Rodan and Rodan1993); key features of the electoral system including district magnitude, malapportionment, and redistricting (N. Tan Reference Tan2013; N. Tan and Grofman Reference Tan and Grofman2016); and policy positions. We present the results of this analysis in the subsequent results section and find strong support for our argument even after controlling for alternative explanations.\n\nLast, we clarify scope conditions and examine the implications of our findings for politics in Singapore, as well as in dominant party regimes more broadly. Ultimately, the primacy of valence politics in Singapore creates a fundamental dilemma for opposition parties looking to challenge the PAP. They face significant disadvantages in competition on valence considerations, given the PAP's control of the state and its record at the helm of Singapore's successful development. Campaigning on ideological or policy alternatives is similarly fraught, however, as positional appeals do not resonate with a sufficiently large proportion of the electorate to secure victory at the ballot box. This Catch-22, we argue, explains a substantial but previously overlooked portion of the PAP's enduring resilience, and provides insights into the resilience of other dominant party regimes.\n\nWHY DO VOTERS SUPPORT DOMINANT PARTIES? Why do voters support dominant parties? Popular discourse as well as some scholarship emphasizes ideological or policy alignment. From this perspective, voters support dominant parties because they take positions on salient issues that align with voter preferences. Greene (Reference Greene2007) notes that control of the state confers dominant parties with some advantages in such \u201cpositional\u201d contests, as they are often able to lay claim to positions that align with the preferences of the median voter, thereby forcing opposition parties to take extreme positions to differentiate themselves. This advantage has natural limits, however, as it depends upon the shape of the underlying distribution of voter preferences and requires a political environment in which ideological incoherence is tolerated by voters. Other explanations note that parties outside of Europe and North America are rarely programmatic, thereby de-emphasizing positional appeals in electoral contests. In such contexts \u201cvalence issues,\u201d which Stokes (Reference Stokes1963) defines as those over which there is general agreement among voters (e.g. the desirability of economic growth, social stability, and national defense), dominate campaigns. Electoral competition then involves attempts to demonstrate competence on the valence issues, making elections not about what should be delivered, but rather about which candidate or party is most capable of delivering the generally desired outcomes. Examples of this have been documented in numerous contexts, including Africa (Bleck and Walle Reference Bleck and van de Walle2013) and Taiwan (Ho et al. Reference Ho, Clarke, Chen and Weng2013). While not explicitly framed in terms of valence politics, Magaloni's (Reference Magaloni2006) influential theory of why voters support dominant parties nevertheless contains elements that suggest the importance of valence issues. Magaloni differentiates between \u201cstrategic\u201d and \u201csincere\u201d motivations for supporting dominant parties. Strategic motivations relate to direct transfers that voters receive for supporting the dominant party, whereas sincere motivations relate to the expected economic performance of dominant parties relative to challengers.Footnote 1 Where dominant parties possess a record of strong long-term growth and exercise control over an efficacious \u201cpunishment regime\u201d that can identify and sanction opposition voters, dominant parties can create a \u201cself-reinforcing authoritarian equilibrium\u201d in which voters themselves feel they are better off under the dominant party. This equilibrium obviates the need for dominant parties to fall back on electoral fraud and violence in order to win elections. Magaloni (Reference Magaloni2006) considers Singapore under the PAP to be an instance of such an equilibrium. We offer two advancements on her theory, driven by the Singaporean case. First, we argue that the motivations for sincerely supporting dominant parties extend well beyond just economic growth, which is Magaloni's principal focus: in the context of Singapore, the desirability of social stability, national sovereignty, and the ability to efficiently deliver a range of services at the grassroots level all motivate sincere PAP votes. Second, and in contrast to Magaloni's treatment of voter preferences as exogenous, we argue that voter preferences can be treated as endogenous to the preferences of dominant parties over the long term. To be clear, voter preferences are indeed sticky in the short term, which imposes constraints on all parties. Given a sufficiently long horizon, however, we contend that control of a high-capacity state provides dominant parties with the ability to strategically reshape society. In doing so, voter preferences can be brought into alignment with the dominant parties\u2019 comparative advantages, thus maximizing their chances of retaining power. In short, the long-term reshaping of voter preferences constitutes an additional channel through which to entrench this \u201cself-reinforcing authoritarian equilibrium.\u201d The resilience of dominant parties is at least partially a function of voter preferences and motivations. We contend that electoral competition on valence issues allows dominant parties to maximize the advantages conferred by control of a high-capacity state. This is because, ceteris paribus, they are better positioned than opposition parties to attract and groom high-quality candidates; to leverage the state to efficiently deliver local services; and to effectively claim credit for past developmental gains. Being situated outside of the state relegates opposition parties to making appeals based on hypotheticals, and impedes their ability to attract high-quality candidates, putting them at a distinct disadvantage on valence considerations. By contrast, when competition occurs primarily on positional issues, dominant parties are vulnerable to challenges on ideological or policy alternatives, which even a start-up party without a proven record can launch provided that its platform resonates with the electorate and is incompatible with the dominant party's agenda. Specifically, dominant parties are able to leverage their close relationship with the bureaucracy and other state organs to recruit performance-proven individuals into the party. The pool available to opposition parties is far smaller, especially in the presence of a (real or perceived) stigma against publicly opposing dominant parties (Greene Reference Greene2007; Mutalib Reference Mutalib2003). Asymmetric access to resources also grants dominant parties advantages in training and managing their ranks, as well as in cultivating a more professional interface with the electorate. Both channels have implications for the perceived quality of parties and their candidates. The ability to coordinate activities across levels of government as well as greater access to resources confers dominant parties with advantages in delivering local services. As this is the immediate point of contact with the state for much of the electorate, differences in grassroots level efficacy easily translate into an electoral advantage when competence and the ability to deliver are the main criteria for electoral decisions (Weiss Reference Weiss2016). Furthermore, dominant parties are able to leverage past developmental successes as evidence for competence in strong-state countries like Singapore that have experienced dramatic improvements in living conditions. The conflation of state and party for the purposes of assessing past performance becomes the basis of the \u201cperformance legitimacy\u201d that has benefited the PAP (Chua Reference Chua1995).\n\nRESHAPING POLITICS AND SOCIETY IN SINGAPORE This section provides a within-case, historical analysis to support our claim that the centrality of valence considerations in Singapore is at least partially by design. We show that politics in the run-up to self-rule were marked by heated ideological competition, and were thus markedly different from the current political landscape in which valence considerations dominate. Indeed, the centrality of valence considerations took root after the emergence of dominant party rule, when the PAP used its control of Singapore's high-capacity state to reshape politics and society through an ensemble of policy initiatives and institutional reforms. Political Pluralism in Pre-Independence Singapore While Singapore's formal political institutions\u2014being mostly a carryover from the British colonial period\u2014have retained their core form from the achievement of internal self-rule in 1959 to the present, the nature of politics in the small and multi-ethnic country has changed substantially.Footnote 2 Indeed, its sometimes-sterile contemporary politics bear little resemblance to what Mary Turnbull (Reference Turnbull2009, 259) calls the \u201clusty [and] vociferous\u201d political awakening in the decade-long run-up to self-rule.Footnote 3 During this early period, political competition was pluralistic in nature, the result of a \u201cstormy and acrimonious battle\u201d between political factions with widely differing ideological convictions and visions for the future. Carnell (Reference Carnell1955) describes the climate as one in which parties with clearly defined ideological and policy positions\u2014right and left, communalist and non-communalist\u2014appealed for support from Singapore's newly enfranchised population. The most visible of these factions was a grassroots leftist movement that grew substantially in size during the 1950s, spawning radical student and labor associations that engaged in regular strikes and boycotts. The movement later coalesced into a broad coalition of anti-colonial groups, trade unions, student associations, and political parties that called itself the \u201cUnited Front.\u201d The PAP's roots also lie in this period. The party was formed around an English-educated core that Turnbull (Reference Turnbull2009, 273) describes as \u201cpragmatists, [who] attracted men of similar ilk to their ranks: economists, bankers, architects, and town planners. [They] took pride in rejecting not merely communism but ideologies in general, in the belief that people wanted good government in the solid shape of jobs, housing, schools, and healthcare.\u201d For reasons of political expediency, the nascent PAP merged into the United Front and led elements of the coalition\u2014then under the PAP banner\u2014to victory in the 1959 legislative assembly elections over a range of alternative parties. Table 1 displays results from this election to the present. This expanded version of the PAP was inherently unstable due to fundamental ideological disagreements between its pragmatist core and its left-wing members. The resultant tensions ultimately caused the left-wing of the party to split off and form the Barisan Sosialis (BS\u2014Socialist Front) in 1961. As an independent party with a strong grassroots following, the BS represented a substantial electoral threat to the PAP, which itself lacked a mass base. In fact, the PAP lost two by-elections in 1961, and secured only 46.9 percent of the popular vote in 1963, relative to 33.2 percent for the BS. Against the backdrop of the anti-Communist Emergency in Malaya, the conflict came to a head through Operation Coldstore in 1963. This joint security exercise by British, Malayan, and Singaporean forces detained 130 leftist political figures, including many from the BS leadership. As described in Ramakrishna (Reference Ramakrishna2015), there is debate among contemporary historians over the interpretation of this action. Some historians, as well as the PAP itself, maintain that the detainees were overwhelmingly Communists or Communist sympathizers who threatened to undermine Singapore's nascent electoral democracy through extra-institutional mobilization and agitation. Others have contested this view and argued that the arrests were pursued out of political expediency, with the aim of consolidating the PAP's grip on power through elimination of political opponents (Thum Reference Thum2013). We leave the matter of interpretation to historians of Singapore. Moreover, we leave open whether the ideological pluralism during the time of transition represents a natural equilibrium for Singapore, or whether it was a temporary by-product of the transition and the broader historical context of the post-World War II era, and thus destined to dissipate even in the absence of PAP interventions. In either case, the outcome of Operation Coldstore and the subsequent arrests of additional BS leaders and cadres is clear: the BS was effectively incapacitated as a political entity, which removed the only significant ideological alternative to the PAP from electoral competition. This left the PAP firmly in control of Singapore's high-capacity state and paved the way for the emergence of dominant party rule after the dissolution of the short-lived 1963\u20131965 merger with Malaysia. The new equilibrium was further reinforced, as discussed below, through a range of policy initiatives that depoliticized electoral competition and entrenched the primacy of valence politics. Dominance and the Reshaping of Politics and Society With largely uncontested control of fully independent Singapore, the PAP quickly moved to reshape politics and society by establishing a practice of pragmatic and development-oriented policy-making that was unconstrained by ideological paradigms (Mauzy and Milne Reference Mauzy and Milne2002; Morgenbesser Reference Morgenbesser2016). The PAP initiated numerous public campaigns, a fundamental reform of the education system, and intrusive programs including mandatory National Service and the Housing Development Board (HDB) public housing scheme, all of which were intended to orient the electorate's preferences and priorities towards development and national cohesion. They are notable for their penetration into society: a large majority\u2014currently over 80 percent\u2014of the population lives in HDB units; all males are required to serve approximately two years of national service; and with few exceptions, attendance in public schools is mandatory for all Singaporeans. Other practices, like weekly Meet-the-People Sessions through which members of parliament face their constituents to address grievances (Ong Reference Ong2015), can be seen as valence politics in action at the grassroots level. In aggregate, these initiatives brought a vast majority of the population into close contact with the state, and by extension, with the PAP's developmental agenda. The initiatives were complemented by a state-sanctioned \u201csurvival narrative\u201d that held Singapore to be uniquely vulnerable to a range of potentially catastrophic threats, against which the only protection was perpetual growth and the steadying hand of a capable, uncompromising, and farsighted government. The widespread propagation of this narrative in politics facilitated its internalization by large segments of the population (Abdullah Reference Abdullah2017b). The messaging was eventually reinforced through the National Education program, which was launched in 1997 to \u201cinculcate an understanding of the challenges and vulnerabilities that are unique to Singapore\u201d (Ministry of Education 1997). Ultimately, with the need for consistent performance framed as the only viable response to the country's systemic vulnerabilities, little space remained for engagement with ideological alternatives, which were dismissed as a luxury that Singapore's precarity disallowed.Footnote 4 Writing ten years after the emergence of dominant party rule, Chan (Reference Chan1975, 1) describes the effects of these early initiatives in reshaping politics and society: One of the most significant developments in Singapore politics in the last decade has been the steady and systematic depoliticisation of a politically active and aggressive citizenry \u2026 the People's Action Party Government has argued that rapid development of newly independent countries is contingent upon the shift of emphasis from politics to economics. Reinforced by the remarkable strides in development and with a fragmented opposition, the PAP faced no serious opposition challenges for nearly two decades. By the time the PAP conceded control of a seat in Parliament in a narrow 1981 by-election loss to the Worker's Party (WP) and a second seat to the newly formed Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) in GE 1984, the PAP's pragmatic and performance-oriented model of politics, which eschewed competition through ideological and policy appeals, was firmly entrenched. Nevertheless, the loss of two seats to the opposition and the slide in vote share during GE 1984 shook the PAP's leaders, who had become accustomed to receiving 70 percent or more of the popular vote since independence. In response, they initiated a series of institutional reforms, including the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Town Council schemes.Footnote 5 The GRC scheme, implemented in 1988, transformed a number of single-member districts into party-centric, multi-member districts decided by party block vote. Depending on the magnitude of these multi-member GRCs, parties nominate teams of between 3 and 6 candidates. Voters cast a party ballot. Whichever party receives a plurality of votes then receives all of the seats within the district (N. Tan Reference Tan2013). The Town Council scheme, likewise implemented in 1988, decentralized the management and administration of HDB public housing estates\u2014in which the majority of Singaporeans reside\u2014from HDB to newly formed town councils headed by elected MPs. The reform itself was explicitly framed to voters in terms of valence considerations\u2014specifically, the competence and integrity of MPs\u2014and how this might impact the delivery of local services. In the words of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew during his national broadcast on the Eve of National Day 1988: [The Town Council Act] will put the MP in charge of his constituency's town council. The honesty and competence of your MP will then directly affect you because he will be in charge of the maintenance and administration of your housing estate \u2026 If your MP is not honest, or not competent, you will know it soon enough \u2026 So you had better take a careful look at the persons \u2026 who seek to represent you. Your personal well-being will be at stake when you choose your MP. This change will make for careful and better selection of MPs by you and by political parties, and will be good for Singapore. These measures all served to deepen the transformation of Singaporean politics. The GRC scheme amplified the importance of the party label and party credibility. Furthermore, it enabled the PAP to \u201canchor\u201d each GRC team with a cabinet minister, thereby creating potentially serious national-level implications for supporting the opposition, which further dissuaded cautious voters from casting an opposition ballot. Both of these entailed entrenchment of valence considerations. The Town Council reforms reinforced this at the candidate level by directly linking the quality of local service provision to the quality of the candidate. The electorate had become so responsive to the PAP and its model of politics by the 1990s, that the opposition was compelled to adapt a radical strategy: From 1991 to 2006, it pursued a \u201cby-election\u201d strategy of contesting fewer than 50 percent of seats, following the logic that if ex ante assured of a PAP victory before polling began, the country's cautious voters would be more inclined to cast an opposition vote. During this time, opposition campaigns focused predominantly on the practical need for more balance in parliament, rather than on offering ideological or policy alternatives to the PAP. The 2011 and 2015 GEs diverged from earlier elections in several important ways. Notably, the opposition abandoned its \u201cby-election\u201d strategy such that the PAP faced challengers in every electoral division for the first time since 1963.Footnote 6 They were also the first elections in which the opposition managed to secure a GRC, which had previously seemed impenetrable. The more competitive nature of GE 2011, in which the opposition secured nearly 40 percent of the popular vote, saw observers characterize it as a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment in Singaporean politics (K. Tan and Lee Reference Tan and Lee2011; Chong Reference Chong2012) and led to suggestions that Singapore had transitioned into a more competitive phase (Ortmann Reference Ortmann2011). GE 2015 saw the tide shift back somewhat: two momentous events in the months before the election\u2014the death of \u201cfounding father\u201d Lee Kuan Yew and the celebration of Singapore's fiftieth anniversary of independence\u2014produced a wave of nostalgia that strengthened the hand of the PAP (Chin Reference Chin2016; K. Tan and Lee Reference Tan and Lee2016; Weiss, Loke, and Choa Reference Weiss, Loke and Choa2016). Furthermore, squabbles between opposition parties during the campaign period revealed disunity and harmed their credibility in the eyes of some voters (Ong Reference Ong2016).\n\nPARTY COMPETITION AND VOTER BEHAVIOR This section provides a qualitative analysis of contemporary party competition and voter behavior, which further substantiates the claim that valence politics has largely displaced other forms of electoral competition. First, we examine contemporary party competition and show that\u2014following the PAP's model\u2014opposition parties generally focus on convincing voters of their ability to deliver results, largely eschewing ideological or policy appeals in the process. Second, we review the results of a 2015 post-election survey, which supports the notion that the PAP's model of pragmatic politics has been internalized by a large portion of Singapore's voters, who prioritize considerations of party and candidate quality over positional appeals. Parties and Party Competition Opposition parties have a rich history in Singapore, with around 20 typically registered at any time.Footnote 7 Eight opposition parties contested seats in GE 2015 alone. This is a remarkable number for a country that uses a majoritarian electoral formula and has only 29 electoral divisions with roughly 2.4 million eligible voters in total. Table 2 displays the results of GE 2015 by party, as well as the cumulative number of seats won by each party since independence. The oldest and most visible of the opposition parties is the Worker's Party (WP), founded in 1957 by Singapore's first Chief Minister. It was the first opposition party to send a member to parliament and has captured more seats than any other since independence. The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), National Solidarity Party (NSP), and Singapore People's Party (SPP) have all regularly contested elections since at least the 1990s, holding a cumulative total of five, zero, and two seats respectively. The Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) was conceived as an opposition coalition in 2001, but infighting caused several of its component parties (including the SPP and NSP) to abandon formal cooperation, leaving the SDA to contest independently. The Reform Party (RP), Singaporeans First (SGF), and People's Power Party (PPP) are fringe parties without substantial mass followings. Ideological and Policy Appeals How do parties appeal to voters? Spatial models assume that parties compete by making positional appeals, thereby offering voters different sets of policies. These policy programs are typically structured by contrasting ideological convictions situated along the left\u2013right spectrum (or some version thereof). Singapore's parties have occasionally been described in these terms. Singh (Reference Singh2012, 47), for example, describes the PAP as center-right, while \u201cmost opposition parties occupy the centre-left.\u201d More frequently, however, the PAP and most opposition parties are described as unbound by clear ideological commitments. We unpack and develop this further through two arguments: first, the PAP's policy positions are not consistently structured within a recognized ideological framework, making the left\u2013right spectrum unsuitable for describing its positions. Second, opposition parties in Singapore frequently do not adopt or campaign on policy positions that differ markedly from those of the PAP. In contrast to characterizations that paint the PAP as center-right in its orientation, Mauzy and Milne (Reference Mauzy and Milne2002, 52) note that the party \u201cprides itself on not having any [ideological] \u2018sacred cows\u2019 to prejudice freedom of action,\u201d and bases its decision making on the litmus test of \u201cdoes it work?.\u201d A review of the PAP's major policy positions illustrates this commitment. The strong orientation towards fostering competition and economic growth, coupled with low tax burdens and an absence of extensive protectionist measures, has elements of a \u201crightist\u201d or pro-market orientation. Simultaneously, the PAP maintains a strong and highly interventionist state that uses welfare-like mechanisms to shape citizen behavior; these are more reminiscent of a \u201cleftist\u201d or statist orientation. The tightly controlled public housing program, which provides apartments to over 80 percent of Singapore's population, is a clear example of this. On issues that featured prominently in the GE 2011 and 2015 campaigns\u2014including cost of living, job security, housing, public transportation, and inward migration\u2014the PAP's policy positions did not cluster into an ideologically coherent program, but rather reflected fluidity in response to evolving conditions. While arguments have been made that the PAP adheres to an ideology\u2014for example, dedication to economic growth (Chua Reference Chua1985) or pragmatism as a response to global neoliberalism (K.P. Tan Reference Tan2012)\u2014these are not ideological convictions that require coherent policy programs as assumed by positional theories. The more established opposition parties, having determined that the PAP's model of pragmatism resonates strongly with voters, generally eschew substantial departures from the PAP's policy positions. This is particularly the case for the WP, the oldest and strongest of the opposition, which Abdullah (Reference Abdullah2017a, 495) argues \u201clargely propagates and supports the PAP's key [positions] and does not propose alternatives.\u201d The possible exception to this among the more established opposition is the SDP, whose proposals reflect a focus on social welfare policies and a stronger orientation towards the ideals of constitutional liberalism. The younger and least established parties\u2014including the RP, SGF, and PPP\u2014differentiate themselves primarily through antagonistic stances against the PAP; policy positions are generally vague and do not articulate clear plans for implementation. Campaigning during GE 2015 strongly reflected this picture. Both sides overwhelmingly focused their campaign rhetoric on promising results in areas like cost of living, job security, public transportation, and housing affordability. The PAP adopted a strategy of referring to its past performance to argue that it was the most capable of delivering positive outcomes on salient issues. The opposition, by contrast, focused most of its efforts on attacking the PAP's performance and arguing that it could \u201cdo better,\u201d or at least that increased opposition presence in parliament would improve outcomes on the same set of issues. Notably absent across the opposition parties were concerted efforts to establish clear policy alternatives replete with trade-offs and shortcomings of their own. Party Credibility In stark contrast to the meagre attempts at positional differentiation among parties, there is substantial variation in their perceived ability to govern. From independence until roughly a decade ago, a \u201ccredibility gap\u201d\u2014which describes the gap in perceived trustworthiness, competence, and professionalism between the PAP and the opposition\u2014clearly distinguished the PAP from its competition in the eyes of most voters.Footnote 8 This was a function both of the PAP's efficacy in leading Singapore's economic development and the significant infighting, coordination failures, and personal blunders that hampered the opposition (Mutalib Reference Mutalib2003; Singh Reference Singh2012). While the credibility gap between the PAP and opposition parties is still substantial, modest changes became apparent in the years prior to GE 2011. The PAP made several blunders for which it offered unprecedented public apologies, giving the appearance of cracks in the exceptionalism of the party. Simultaneously, some opposition parties managed to successfully recruit and field numerous high-quality candidates from the upper echelons of the private sector, civil service, and academia, several of whom ostensibly matched the credentials of their PAP counterparts. Only the WP, however, was able to capitalize on this effectively, as the SDP, SPP, and NSP continued to be plagued by infighting and poor organization. Ong and Tim (Reference Ong and Tim2014), in fact, argue that in the run-up to GE 2011, the WP managed what no other opposition party could: they created a clear party brand, coupled with effective grassroots outreach and a slate of credible candidates, which drew them nearer to the PAP in terms of credibility on valence considerations. This has created a de facto three-tiered hierarchy among Singapore's parties. The 2011 and 2015 Post-Election Surveys from the Institute of Policy Studies support this notion. The PAP clearly retains the top tier, with 93 percent of respondents viewing it as a credible party and only 4 percent disagreeing in the 2015 wave. The moderate WP, while still trailing at 71 percent and 19 percent respectively, is closer to the PAP than to the next opposition party, the SDP (46 percent / 43 percent). The remaining parties fare even more poorly: NSP (26 percent / 61 percent); RP (22 percent / 64 percent); SGF (29 percent / 58 percent). Voters and Voting Behavior What motivates the voting decisions of Singaporeans in recent elections? Results from a GE 2015 survey conducted by Bridget Welsh (Reference Welsh2016b) with technical assistance from the Merdeka Center for Opinion Research are particularly revealing in this regard. The survey involved asking a random sample of Singaporeans the following question: In this election, what would you say was your main consideration in voting? Figure 1 displays the results. Collectively, 71 percent of respondents indicated that either Party Leadership, Party, or Candidate were their main considerations. Only 11 percent, 10 percent, and 2 percent respectively indicated that Issues, Government Benefits, or Fear of Voting Against Government were most important. The importance of considerations related to parties is consistent with our portrayal of Singapore's elections being strongly party-centric. Note: Figure 1 based on data reported in Welsh ( Reference Welsh 2016b ). Results from follow-up questions on the survey regarding campaign issues provide further evidence for our argument. Survey respondents were asked the following question: In the recent election campaign, was there a particular issue that was most important to you? Figure 2 displays the results. While the modal respondent was unable to identify a specific issue, the two most widely cited \u201cissues\u201d\u2014Strength of Political Party and Candidate Qualities\u2014 underscore the extent to which perceptions of party or candidate qualities dominate the considerations of voters. With the possible exception of Social Welfare Benefits and Foreigner Influx, the positions of parties do not substantially diverge on the next seven most cited issues. Note: Figure 2 based on data reported in Welsh ( Reference Welsh 2016b ).\n\nDATA We conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Singapore's 2011 and 2015 GEs to further demonstrate evidence in support of our claim that valence considerations like party credibility play a key role in why Singaporeans vote for the PAP.Footnote 9 Since the PAP competes in a series of two-cornered fights against a range of opposition parties, we are able to estimate the marginal effects of party credibility on PAP support while controlling for a range of alternative explanations. In short, we assess the relative influence of valence considerations against the myriad alternative explanations proposed to explain why Singaporeans vote for the PAP. Party Credibility and PAP Support The key observable implication of our argument in the Singaporean context is that voters\u2019 relative assessments of PAP and opposition party credibility should correlate with PAP support during elections: When facing an opposition party that is perceived as relatively more credible, the PAP will ceteris paribus receive less support than when it faces one that is perceived as relatively less credible. We operationalize PAP support using vote share. We collect data on vote returns from the Singapore Elections Department (ELD) and generate our dependent variable\u2014PAP Vote Share\u2014 by dividing the number of votes cast for the PAP by the total number of valid votes cast in each electoral division. Figure 3 displays the geographic distribution of resulting PAP Vote Share for GE 2011 and 2015. Note: Figure 3 based on authors\u2019 calculations using data reported by Singapore Elections Department. We operationalize relative assessments of party credibility using data collected through a series of post-election surveys conducted by Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies.Footnote 10 We generate our independent variable\u2014Difference in Party Credibility\u2014by calculating the difference between the percentage of respondents that either agree or strongly agree that the PAP is a credible party, and the percentage that either agree or strongly agree that a given opposition party is a credible party. In order to address potential concerns regarding post-treatment bias, we use data from preceding survey waves to calculate Difference in Party Credibility in a given election. We then assign the resulting values to electoral divisions based on the opposition party that contested the division in a given election.Footnote 11 We expect a positive relationship between Difference in Party Credibility and PAP Vote Share. Alternative Explanations Although our focus is the relationship between party credibility and PAP support, we also address alternative explanations. Slater and Wong (Reference Slater and Wong2013, 719) argue that three dimensions of party strength underpin the \u2018victory confidence\u2019 of dominant parties in developmental Asia: The cultivation of experienced electoral candidates; the construction of a territorially encompassing infrastructure; and the development of cross-cutting constituencies. In addition, dominant parties also have at least some ability to shape the electoral system within which they face electoral challenges in ways that may advantage them. Furthermore, some popular accounts attribute the success of dominant parties to their ability to take policy positions that align with voter preferences. We explore each set of alternative explanations below. Experienced Electoral Candidates Dominant parties benefit strongly from their ability to cultivate experienced electoral candidates that have the personal attributes necessary to successfully contest and win elections. This includes incumbent candidates with a personal connection to voters as well as prior campaign experience, and new candidates with prior experience and a reputation that can inspire the trust of voters. The magnitude of this advantage, however, is conditional on the quality of the opposition's candidates. Candidate quality has long been identified as a strength of the PAP and a corresponding weakness of opposition parties in Singapore (Mutalib Reference Mutalib2003). Although opposition parties that voters perceive to be more credible are presumably more likely to attract and field high-quality candidates, it is important to disentangle the potential effects of candidate incumbency and challenger quality from party credibility. To this end, we emulate the empirical strategy used to estimate the effects of candidate incumbency and challenger quality in US congressional contests. We collect candidate-level data from singapore-elections.com in order to generate two covariates: Candidate Incumbency and Challenger Quality. Candidate Incumbency assumes a value between one and negative one. It equals one if a PAP incumbent or a team of PAP incumbents runs for reelection in their former constituencies; negative one if an opposition incumbent or team of opposition incumbents runs for reelection; or zero if no incumbents run. When incumbents slated to retire occupy constituencies located in multi-member GRCs or in those that are later merged into GRCs during the redelineation process, the subsequent teams of candidates will be comprised of a mix of incumbents and new candidates. Under these circumstances, Candidate Incumbency equals the percentage of GRC team members that are incumbents. Challenger Quality captures the effect of high-quality challengers. We adopt the simple measure of candidate quality proposed by Jacobson (Reference Jacobson1990)\u2014whether the candidate has ever held elective public office of any kind\u2014to capture challenger quality. While we recognize that there are alternative ways to conceptualize and operationalize quality, the operative assumption of our coding scheme is that prior experience indicates a candidate has been previously deemed by voters to have the qualities required of an office holder. This type of experience is widely perceived in Singapore as an indicator of quality.Footnote 12 Challenger Quality equals one if there is a high-quality opposition challenger or team of challengers in the race and negative one if there is a high-quality PAP challenger or team of challengers in the race. Mixed teams are coded as a percentage following the logic of the Challenger Quality coding. We expect a negative relationship between Challenger Quality and PAP Vote Share. Territorially Encompassing Infrastructure A territorially encompassing infrastructure of local branches and cells enhances dominant party rule by allowing dominant parties to directly engage with voters at the grassroots level. Through this infrastructure, dominant parties can provide selective incentives for voters to support them during elections. Since coming to power, the PAP has carefully built and maintained such an infrastructure that encompasses the entire country, penetrates to the grassroots, and plays an important role in securing mass support between and during elections. Yet rather than operate through local party branches and cells, this infrastructure instead operates through the People's Association (PA)\u2014itself a state-funded, statutory board\u2014and its dense network of para-state grassroots organizations (GROs). Within each electoral constituency, the PA organizes a Citizens\u2019 Consultative Committee (CCC) that in turn oversees and coordinates the activities of the network of subordinate GROs. These include Community Center Management Committees (CCMCs), Resident's Committees (RCs), and Neighbourhood Committees (NCs). Kenneth Paul Tan (Reference Tan2003, 5) suggests that although GROs are apolitical organizations, the overlapping membership of GROs with local party branches makes this distinction \u201ca purely technical one.\u201d Moreover, Tan (Reference Tan2003, 6\u201310) suggests that GROs ultimately serve a range of political functions by providing a platform to co-opt community leaders; conducting surveillance and helping exercise local control; providing a feedback channel between elections; and acting as a reservoir of manpower, organizational, and logistical support during elections. Accounting for this infrastructure and the local density of the organizational networks is no simple task: despite the PA being state-funded, disaggregated information on GROs such as budgets or the number of \u2018grassroots leaders\u2019 per constituency is unavailable. We therefore collect information on the number of CCCs, CCMCs, RCs, and NCs located within each electoral division from a range of official sources to generate a proxy for GRO density. We generate the covariate PA-GRO Density by dividing the number of GROs by the number of electors within each division. We expect a positive relationship between PA-GRO Density and PAP Vote Share.Footnote 13 We use information on PAP Community Foundation (PCF) kindergartens to create an additional covariate for infrastructure. In order to counter its rival Barisan Sosialis in the early 1960s, the PAP began to provide subsidized kindergarten education through its local branches and soon became the dominant provider of kindergarten education in Singapore. Indeed, the provision of kindergarten education was one of the two key functions of local party branches that helped the PAP crowd-out its rivals at the grassroots following independence. The PAP established the PCF in 1986 and transferred responsibility for administering its kindergartens from its local party branches to the newly established entity. Today, PCF kindergartens account for approximately 60 percent of all kindergartens registered with Singapore's Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and offer working families the lowest-cost option for early childhood education and childcare. We collect data from the ECDA to determine the number of PCF and non-PCF kindergartens in each electoral division. We generate the covariate PCF Kindergarten Share by dividing the number of PCF kindergartens by the total number of kindergartens in each division. We expect a positive relationship between PCF Kindergarten Share and PAP Vote Share. We recognize these covariates imperfectly capture the grassroots infrastructure that underpins dominant party strength and might fail to capture residual sources of PAP support. To that end, we estimate Previous PAP Vote Share using a weighted average of vote shares received by the PAP in electoral divisions used during the previous GE. We collect data on previous vote returns from the ELD as well as on transfers of electors between electoral divisions during the reapportionment and redistricting process from Electoral Boundaries Review Commission (EBRC) reports. We then construct the weighted average of PAP vote share per division in the previous GE and weight according to the proportion of electors these divisions contribute to the redrawn divisions used in the present GE. The covariate's value is thus an estimate of the vote share for the division during the previous GE.Footnote 14 We expect a positive relationship between Previous PAP Vote Share and PAP Vote Share. Despite lacking access to state resources with which to build up a competing infrastructure, opposition parties dig in where they do win seats and attempt to build a localized infrastructure, creating \u2018opposition strongholds\u2019 like Potong Pasir SMC and Hougang SMC. Within these electoral divisions, opposition parties actively engage at the grassroots level and cultivate a close relationship with constituents, undercutting local PAP support. We generate the covariate Opposition Stronghold to capture this localized effect, which equals one if a division has been held by the same opposition party during the two previous GEs, and otherwise equals zero. We expect a negative relationship between Opposition Stronghold and PAP Vote Share. Cross-cutting Constituencies Dominant parties that develop cross-cutting constituencies which span potentially salient social cleavages also enjoy higher \u2018victory confidence.\u2019 The PAP has long endeavored to develop such constituencies by positioning itself as a multi-ethnic party capable of incorporating Singapore's sizable ethnic Malay and Indian minority communities, thereby bridging visible ethnic cleavages. The PAP has further sought to span emerging class cleavages resulting from rapid development since independence. The PAP's success in developing such constituencies and mobilizing their support during elections, however, is disputed. Although Singapore has not experienced a recurrence of interethnic violence seen in the 1950s and 1960s, Rahim (Reference Rahim, Barr and Trocki2008) suggests that the PAP has nevertheless struggled at times to secure and mobilize electoral support from Singapore's ethnic Malay minority. Barr and Skrbi\u0161 (Reference Barr and Skrbi\u01612008, 261) further suggest that Singapore has been strongly Sinicized under the PAP during the last three decades, reducing space for ethnic minorities and contributing to a \u201csubdued sense of alienation among Malays and Indians.\u201d Similarly, Rodan (Reference Rodan and Rodan1993) suggests that a sense of alienation among members of Singapore's educated and wealthy middle class also holds the potential to erode support for the PAP. Singapore's middle class is itself a product of changes in class structure resulting from rapid development, and the middle class has been one of the major beneficiaries of PAP rule. Nevertheless, Rodan argues that changes in the preferences of the middle class for greater autonomy from the PAP-dominated state during the 1980s and 1990s explains their potential to act as a force for qualified rather than fundamental political change. One way to evaluate the PAP's degree of success in developing and mobilizing cross-cutting constituencies that span these social cleavages is to control for the demographic composition of electoral divisions. The Singaporean government, however, does not currently report population data according to electoral divisions. We address this issue by estimating the demographic composition of electoral divisions using official population data from the Census of Population 2010 and General Household Survey 2015. Specifically, we use GIS software and high-resolution, satellite-based population distribution data from the WorldPop Project to map official population data\u2014reported according to Urban Redevelopment Agency administrative boundaries\u2014to electoral division boundaries. We conduct a number of cross-validation exercises to evaluate the reliability of our estimates against alternative sources and the results suggest our strategy produces reliable estimates.Footnote 15 We generate three covariates to evaluate the effect of ethnic cleavages on PAP support. Percent Malay, Percent Indian, and Percent Other is the estimated percentage of the population in the electoral division that are members of Singapore's ethnic Malay, Indian, or Other minority communities, respectively. We generate an additional covariate to evaluate the effect of class cleavages. Percent High-Middle Income is the estimated percentage of households in the division with a gross monthly income of SGD 7,000 or above. To the degree that the PAP struggles to develop and mobilize constituencies that span potentially salient ethnic and class cleavages, we expect a negative relationship between these covariates and PAP Vote Share. In addition, we use the same data and estimation strategy to generate the covariate Percent HDB to reflect the percentage of households that reside in HDB public housing estates. Controlling for housing-type is important in Singapore, as over 80 percent of the population resides in HDB public housing estates, and residence has implications for vote choice. It is widely perceived that access to services in these estates, such as government-sponsored upgrading programs, is contingent on levels of PAP support, providing residents with strong material incentives to support the PAP during elections. We therefore expect a positive relationship between Percent HDB and PAP Vote Share. Electoral System Dominance also gives dominant parties the ability to select and manipulate the electoral system within which they face challenges to their rule. To be clear, neither this ability nor its exercise necessarily implies intent on the part of dominant parties to undermine the democratic process. Nevertheless, the choice of systems by dominant parties historically tends to benefit those parties at the expense of challengers, and often creates opportunities to manipulate elections through ancillary strategies like malapportionment and partisan gerrymandering. Singapore's electoral system is not unique in this regard. Netina Tan (Reference Tan2013) notes that Singapore's mixed single-member district-plurality and multi-member district-party block vote plurality system\u2014similar to other electoral systems that use majoritarian formulae\u2014exhibits \u2018mechanical\u2019 effects that create disproportionality in the translation of votes into seats, and ultimately favors the larger PAP over smaller opposition parties. The electoral system also exhibits \u2018strategic\u2019 effects for opposition parties and voters. Opposition parties typically face substantial resource constraints relative to the PAP. Consequently, they are less likely to field candidates in the high-magnitude, multi-member GRCs that require greater investments to be competitive. They instead tend to focus their attention on the low-magnitude GRCs or single-member constituencies (SMCs), where limited resources are more likely to have an impact. Strategic voters presumably respond by being less likely to vote for the opposition in high-magnitude electoral divisions. We generate the covariate District Magnitude to capture evidence of such strategic effects on opposition parties and voters. We expect a positive relationship between District Magnitude and PAP Vote Share. Majoritarian electoral formulae combined with geographically defined electoral divisions also create opportunities to manipulate elections through malapportionment and partisan gerrymandering. With respect to malapportionment, Tan and Grofman (Reference Tan and Grofman2016) point out that the logic of malapportionment implies that if used to manipulate elections, then divisions which contain fewer voters than expected if boundaries were drawn based on equal numbers of voters should exhibit greater PAP support. With respect to partisan gerrymandering, Tan and Grofman (Reference Tan and Grofman2016, 14) further point to a \u201csuspicious\u201d pattern of the EBRC creating new SMCs inside or at the edges of GRC strongholds prior to both the 2011 and 2015 GEs. We generate three covariates to test for evidence of malapportionment and partisan gerrymandering. Deviation from Electoral Quotient captures malapportionment and is defined as the percentage deviation in number of eligible voters above or below the electoral quotient. In line with the observations of Tan and Grofman (Reference Tan and Grofman2016), we test for evidence of partisan gerrymandering through the inclusion of two additional covariates: New GRC and New SMC. If the EBRC recommends and the government creates a new GRC, then the value of New GRC equals one; if not, then zero. The same holds for New SMC. We expect a negative relationship between Deviation from Electoral Quotient and PAP Vote Share, and a positive relationship between New SMC or New GRC and PAP Vote Share.Footnote 16 Policy Positions Lastly, the policy positions adopted by dominant parties and their opposition are popularly posited to affect voter behavior. In order to assess this possibility, we use data on the policy positions of parties during GE 2015 generated by the Electionaire project to test whether policy positions affected electoral outcomes. Electionaire is a Voting Advice Application created at Yale-NUS College in Singapore to match voters with parties according to their policy preferences. The team coded policy positions for each party that contested GE 2015 based on information from party manifestos and public statements.Footnote 17 We use these data in the following way: we divide the coded positions into four policy or issue domains\u2014Social Welfare, Immigration, Central Provident Fund (CPF) Issues, and Civil Liberties\u2014and conduct a principal component analysis on positions within each domain. We take party-specific scores for the first component of each of the four domains and rescale them to range between zero and one. We then calculate Difference in Policy Positions\u2014the square of the difference between the PAP's position and the positions of each of the eight opposition parties\u2014to capture relative differences in the positions taken by the PAP and opposition parties within each domain.Footnote 18\n\nRESULTS In order to test our claim that valence considerations like party credibility play a key role in why Singaporeans vote for the PAP, we estimate a series of pooled OLS models in which we regress PAP Vote Share on Difference in Party Credibility while controlling for the aforementioned range of alternative explanations. We report the results in Table 3. Model 1 is the baseline regression. Models 2 through 6 include covariates to control for experienced electoral candidates, territorially encompassing infrastructure, cross-cutting constituencies, and key features of the electoral system. We include opposition party and election fixed effects in all models. The key result is that relative assessments of PAP and opposition credibility do indeed correlate with PAP support: Difference in Party Credibility exhibits a positive and significant relationship with PAP Vote Share in all models. This result is consistent with our argument and implies that the PAP receives more support when facing an opposition party that is perceived as less credible, and less support when facing an opposition party that is perceived as more credible. Estimated coefficient values as well as standard errors are stable across models and do not appear sensitive to the addition of covariates. Substantively, model estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in Difference in Party Credibility translates into somewhere between a 3.04 percent and 3.26 percent increase in PAP Vote Share. In addition to this result, Table 3 also reports results that support alternative explanations. In particular, results point to the importance of experienced electoral candidates in explaining PAP support. We find that Candidate Incumbency and Challenger Quality both exhibit the expected relationships with PAP Vote Share. Substantively, model estimates suggest that incumbent candidates\u2014mostly PAP candidates\u2014enjoy somewhere between a 6.5 percent and 10.1 percent increase in PAP Vote Share. Yet estimates also suggest that high-quality challengers can substantially narrow the resulting gap by between 6.0 percent and 6.6 percent. Results also point to the importance of a territorially encompassing infrastructure and cross-cutting constituencies, although the effects of these dimensions of party strength on PAP support are less obvious. While PA-GRO Density, PCF Kindergarten Share, Previous PAP Vote Share, and Opposition Stronghold all exhibit the expected relationships with PAP Vote Share, only Opposition Stronghold reaches standard levels of significance in all models. The absence of any clear effect of ethnicity and social class on PAP support points to the success of the PAP in constructing and maintaining itself as a \u201ccatch-all\u201d party capable of developing constituencies that span potentially salient ethnic and class-based cleavages. Lastly, results provide only limited support regarding key features of the electoral system for explaining PAP support. Although District Magnitude, Deviation from Electoral Quotient, New SMC, and New GRC all exhibit the expected relationships with PAP Vote Share, they all fall below standard levels of significance. The results reported in Table 3 show strong support for our claim that valence considerations like party credibility play a key role in why Singaporeans vote for the PAP. They do not, however, directly address the related claim that valence considerations overshadow positional considerations based on ideological or policy stances. We therefore estimate another series of pooled OLS models in which we regress PAP Vote Share on Difference in Party Credibility while controlling for Difference in Policy Positions. We report the results in Table 4. Model 1 is the baseline regression. Models 2 through 5 include Difference in Policy Positions for each of the four policy domains, respectively. We include opposition party fixed effects in all models. Once again, relative assessments of PAP and opposition party credibility correlate with PAP support, as Difference in Party Credibility exhibits a positive and significant relationship with PAP Vote Share; the inclusion of Difference in Policy Positions does not alter this result. Furthermore, Difference in Policy Positions fails to reach standard levels of significance across all policy domains, and so provides little traction in explaining PAP support. We stress that the null results do not imply the total irrelevance of positional considerations, but rather underscore their secondary nature relative to valence considerations."}, {"url": "https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-02-04_094340.html", "page_content": "People's Action Party: Post-independence years Established on 21 November 1954, the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) has been the ruling political party in Singapore since ...\n\n1959 Legislative Assembly General Election On 30 May 1959, a General Election was held to elect 51 members for the Legislative Assembly.

Such longevity is the hallmark of an institution that is itself dynamic and responsive. But remarkably, the story of the party as an institution has not received the sustained study it deserves, from historians or political scientists.\n\nThis narrative history of the PAP follows the decisions made by party leaders as they have sought to respond to the changing demands and expectations of the Singapore electorate, over a 36-year period that saw Singapore enter the ranks of developed nations. It is fully up to date with the Party\u2019s response to their loss of seats in the 2020 General Elections, and changes in party leadership succession announced in April 2021. Leadership renewal is one of four dimensions of change in the party that are the book\u2019s focus: the others being the party\u2019s communications methods and styles, the mechanisms developed for managing institutional change, and the evolution of economic and social policy.\n\nDrawing on internal party documents and multiple interviews with key leaders over a 10-year period, this work provides a detailed portrait of a robust political institution and establishes a distinctive new narrative of Singapore politics."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-election-opposition-file-ex-idUSKBN24702X", "page_content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singaporeans are expected to return the People\u2019s Action Party to power in a July 10 general election, extending its unbroken rule since the Southeast Asian island\u2019s independence in 1965.\n\nSingapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of the People's Action Party arrives to give a speech at a nomination center ahead of the general election in Singapore June 30, 2020. REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nIn that time, Singapore has had only three prime ministers: independence leader Lee Kuan Yew, his cabinet colleague Goh Chok Tong and Lee\u2019s son, the present prime minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nHaving overseen rapid economic growth and prosperity, the PAP has become entrenched in power. But there are other factors that have kept rivals at bay.\n\nUNIQUE MODEL\n\nVoting in the former British colony is compulsory, and around 2.65 million will cast their ballots in the coming election.\n\nSingapore\u2019s electoral system is broadly based on the Westminster \u2018first-past-the-post\u2019 model where the candidate who wins the most votes in each constituency is elected, and the number of seats is not proportionate to the vote share.\n\nIn the last 2015 election, the PAP garnered 69.9% of the vote but secured about 93% of parliamentary seats.\n\nFor a graphic on previous election results, click here: tmsnrt.rs/3dFIStm\n\nBut there is also a twist in Singapore\u2019s electoral system. In some constituencies, candidates run in teams of up to six with at least one member from a minority group - a system designed to ensure better racial representation in the Chinese majority city-state.\n\nSmaller and less well-resourced, some opposition parties struggle to find enough candidates for these so-called group representation constituencies.\n\nBut the ruling party is sensitive to shifts in its overall vote share. After its worst result in 2011, when it secured 60% of the vote, the PAP accelerated foreign labour curbs to allay people\u2019s unease about immigration and jobs. Similar issues have dominated this campaign as Singapore braces for its deepest ever recession due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\nRights groups like ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights have long-flagged various other election processes that they say disadvantage the opposition.\n\nFor example, Singapore\u2019s electoral divisions are revised regularly to reflect population growth and shifts. But the process is opaque and opposition figures have previously made allegations of gerrymandering.\n\nThe prime minister can also call for an election, with presidential approval, at short notice, creating difficulties for the opposition to prepare. The campaigning period for the coming vote is just nine days.\n\nThe financial cost of running can also be a deterrent. Candidates must put up election deposits of S$13,500 ($9,675) to stand, compared to 500 pounds ($623) in Britain, and they need to win more than one-eighth of total votes to get their deposit back.\n\nDISPARATE GROUP\n\nThe opposition is fractured.\n\nA record 11 parties will be contesting the 2020 election: the PAP will stand in all 93 seats, followed by the new Progress Singapore Party (24), the Workers\u2019 Party (21) and the Singapore Democratic Party (11). The rest will stand in 10 or fewer.\n\nPolitical analysts say opposition parties tend to pitch themselves as a check against the PAP\u2019s dominance rather than offering a viable alternative government.\n\nThe mainstream local media - which has close ties to the government - generally supports the government and state policies even during an election, rights groups say. The PAP did not respond to a request for comment and its leaders have previously said press freedoms must be practised with national interests in mind.\n\nLEGAL PROBLEMS\n\nOpposition figures, including the late J.B. Jeyaretnam and the SDP\u2019s Chee Soon Juan, have been sued by PAP members and made bankrupt. PAP leaders have said the libel suits were necessary to protect their reputations.\n\n(reut.rs/38jqKEt) (reut.rs/2BtSFWg)\n\nMore recently, some opposition figures fell foul of a controversial fake news law, and were told their online posts must carry a banner stating that they contain false information."}, {"url": "https://www.pap.org.sg/party-constitution/", "page_content": "ARTICLE VII\n\nManagement of the Party\n\n1.

The victory saw the PAP\u2019s vote share slide by close to nine percentage points from the last General Election, where it garnered 69.9 per cent of the votes.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong acknowledged that despite winning the mandate, the percentage of the popular vote was not as high as he had hoped for.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the results reflect broad-based support for the PAP,\u201d Mr Lee said at a press conference marking the end of the election. \u201cSingaporeans understand what is at stake and why we must come together to uphold our national interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will use this mandate responsibly to deal with COVID-19 and the economic downturn to take us through the crisis safely and beyond,\" he added.\n\nIn the 2015 General Election, the PAP secured 83 seats out of 89 seats in 29 constituencies.\n\nWith the WP\u2019s victory in the newly formed four-member Sengkang GRC, this election marks the first time that an opposition party will hold two GRCs since the GRC scheme came into effect in 1988.\n\n\n\nWith 52.13 per cent of the votes, the Sengkang team comprising Jamus Lim, Raeesah Khan, He Ting Ru and Louis Chua edged out the PAP\u2019s team that included labour chief Ng Chee Meng, political office-holders Lam Pin Min and Amrin Amin as well as lawyer Raymond Lye, who is a new face this election.\n\nThe WP also retained the five-member Aljunied GRC - where it increased its vote share by nine percentage points - and Hougang Single-Member Constituency (SMC).\n\nThis year\u2019s election was also contested by the newly formed Progress Singapore Party (PSP) led by former PAP Member of Parliament (MP) Tan Cheng Bock, who set up the party last year. The party contested 24 seats in four GRCs and five SMCs, the most among all the opposition parties.\n\nIn one of the closest battles of the night, Dr Tan\u2019s team finished with 48.31 per cent of the votes in West Coast GRC, just 3.38 percentage points behind the PAP. In 2015, the PAP team there won 78.57 per cent of the votes against the Reform Party (RP).\n\nFor the second time in Singapore\u2019s history, all seats were contested, with two constituencies - Pioneer SMC and Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC - seeing three-cornered fights. Altogether, there were 10 opposition parties and one independent candidate who vied for a spot in Parliament.\n\nA total of 2,535,565 votes, including rejected votes, were cast in what was the country\u2019s 13th election since independence. This made up 95.63 per cent of the 2,651,435 registered electors, the largest turnout since 1997.\n\nJust less than an hour before polls were due to close, the Elections Department announced that voting hours were being extended by two hours to 10pm after COVID-19 precautionary measures caused delays at a number of polling stations and long waiting times for many voters.\n\nTHE PAP'S BIGGEST WINNERS\n\nThe PAP\u2019s team of Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Shawn Huang, Rahayu Mahzam, Xie Yao Quan and Tan Wu Meng claimed the highest percentage of victory in any constituency, winning in Jurong GRC with 74.62 per cent of the vote against new party Red Dot United (RDU).\n\nThis was followed by PAP's Melvin Yong in the new Radin Mas SMC, who clinched 74.03 per cent of the votes; the party's incumbent Lim Biow Chuan in Mountbatten SMC with 73.84 per cent; and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s team in Ang Mo Kio GRC, which scored a 71.91 per cent against RP secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam's team.\n\nIn a video broadcast online, Mr Lee said his team was grateful for the trust and confidence the Ang Mo Kio residents had given his team, and they would do their best to serve residents for the next five years."}]}
