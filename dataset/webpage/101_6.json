He enjoyed a distinguished career as a player, captaining the France team that won the 1984 UEFA European Football Championship on home soil. He holds the record for the number of goals in a EURO final round, scoring nine times in the 1984 tournament. He also took part in three FIFA World Cups, in 1978, 1982 and 1986, reaching the semi-final of the latter two competitions. In 72 international appearances for France \u2013 49 as captain \u2013 he scored 41 goals, an achievement that stood as a record for a number of years.\n\nHe played for three clubs \u2013 AS Nancy-Lorraine (1973-79) and AS Saint-\u00c9tienne (1979-82) in France, and Juventus (1982-87) in Italy. In a career spanning 501 matches, he scored 265 goals, and won the Ballon d'Or for European Footballer of the Year three successive times, in 1983, 1984 and 1985. Following his retirement, he was coach of the French national team from 1988 to 1992, before embarking on a career as a football administrator, both in France and at FIFA and UEFA.\n\nMichel Platini served as a member of the UEFA Technical Development Committee, before his election as a member of the UEFA Executive Committee in 2002. He was elected as UEFA\u2019s sixth President at the UEFA Ordinary Congress in Dusseldorf on 26 January 2007, and was re-elected twice, in March 2011 and March 2015. He became a FIFA Vice-President on his election as UEFA President.\n\nHis love of football, and the respect he enjoyed for his achievements in the game, were important factors in many of the far-sighted decisions taken under his presidency.\n\nHe initiated financial fair play measures to stabilise clubs\u2019 financial management, and led UEFA in the fight against match-fixing, racism and violence in stadiums. Michel Platini also promoted the value of Respect on and off the field, and nurtured the close relationship between UEFA and its associations, as well as fostering the exchange of knowledge between associations for the overall benefit of European football. He championed the constant development of UEFA\u2019s club and national team competitions, while always adhering to the belief that football should come first in all of UEFA\u2019s actions.\n\nMr Platini resigned from his post of UEFA President on 14 September 2016.\n\n\n\nLennart Johansson (Sweden)\n\nUEFA President from 19 April 1990 to 26 January 2007\n\nLennart Johansson was President of UEFA for 17 years. Born on 5 November 1929 in Bromma, a suburb of Stockholm, his love of football has seen him remain loyal to his home-town club \u2013 Swedish outfit AIK Solna.\n\nAfter gaining his initial administrative experience with AIK, Mr Johansson came through the ranks in the Swedish Football Association (SvFF), and served as the association's president between 1984 and 1991. Establishing a reputation as a strong, capable leader, Mr Johansson was elected as UEFA's fifth President at UEFA's Malta Congress in 1990, and he held the position until January 2007.\n\nDuring his term of office, the face of the European game changed completely, in sporting and commercial terms. UEFA itself developed from being a purely administrative body in a suburb of the Swiss federal capital Berne to a dynamic modern business enterprise based at the House of European Football in Nyon, on the banks of Lake Geneva in western Switzerland.\n\nWhile Mr Johansson was at the helm, the UEFA Champions League was launched at the start of the 1990s and turned into the world's most prestigious club competition, a blue-riband sporting and commercial event bringing together the best players on the planet and followed by millions of football enthusiasts.\n\nNational-team football also flourished, with the UEFA European Championship final round growing into one of the most popular events on the world sporting calendar alongside the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. Mr Johansson was named Honorary UEFA President by his successor Michel Platini at the UEFA Congress in Dusseldorf in January 2007.\n\nJacques Georges (France)\n\nUEFA President from 12 August 1983 to 19 April 1990\n\nJacques George, as first vice-president, assumed the post of UEFA President ad interim upon the tragic death of Artemio Franchi (Italy) in August 1983. He was duly elected President at the UEFA Congress in Paris in 1984.\n\nBorn on 30 May 1916, Mr Georges enjoyed a splendid career as a football administrator which spanned more than half a century, beginning in the Vosges region of eastern France in the late 1940s. He was elected to the French Football Federation's (FFF) federal bureau in 1961, and he became responsible for the French national team as a director. In 1968, he was the ideal person to take over the role of FFF President for a first term.\n\nBlessed with a deep understanding of the game and wider European issues, Mr Georges was elected to the UEFA Executive Committee in 1972. He played an active role in the development and modernisation of UEFA, in particular at a time of increased media coverage and heightened TV interest.\n\nMr Georges was UEFA President during a time for European football when EU matters were occupying a wider stage through issues such as freedom of movement, and as security considerations became of paramount importance in the wake of the Heysel disaster in Brussels in 1985.\n\nThe Frenchman helped lay the foundations for the modern-day UEFA Champions League, before stepping down in 1990 and returning to office with the FFF as the association's president, while also becoming Honorary UEFA President. He passed away in February 2004.\n\nArtemio Franchi (Italy)\n\nUEFA President from 15 March 1973 to 12 August 1983\n\nArtemio Franchi was a brilliant football administrator who loved the game and enjoyed a splendid career that was cut short by a tragic road accident in Tuscany in August 1983.\n\nHe served as UEFA President for ten years, having been elected as the third President, following the death the previous year of his predecessor Gustav Wiederkehr, at a UEFA Extraordinary Congress in Rome in March 1973. Mr Franchi's first attachment to the game came as a player, and then as a referee and refereeing administrator. He became president of the ACF Fiorentina club, rose through the ranks of the Italian Football League and Italian Football Federation (FIGC), and served twice as president of the latter body \u2013 from 1967 to 1976 and from 1978 to 1980.\n\nMr Franchi became a UEFA committee member in 1962, and a UEFA vice-president in 1968. As president, he made a significant contribution to the modernisation of the UEFA competitions, advocating an increase in the number of final-round teams for the 1980 European Championship in Italy to eight, and overseeing the introduction of the UEFA Cup. He was tireless in his efforts to reduce violence in the game, and was acutely aware of the power that football held as a social phenomenon.\n\nCompetent, diplomatic, intelligent and charming, Mr Franchi was a man of culture who valued human contact. His sudden death was mourned by everyone within the European game. Stadiums in Florence and Siena are named after him, as was the trophy for a competition played twice, in 1985 and 1993, between the European and South American national team competition champions.\n\nGustav Wiederkehr (Switzerland)\n\nUEFA President from 17 April 1962 to 7 July 1972\n\nGustav Wiederkehr was elected as UEFA's second president at the sixth Ordinary UEFA Congress in Sofia (Bulgaria) on 17 April 1962, succeeding Ebbe Schwartz (Denmark). He had been president of the Swiss Football Association (SFV/ASF) since 1954.\n\nBorn on 2 October 1905, Mr Wiederkehr took over the UEFA President's post at a critical time in the organisation's development. European football was in a phase of construction and rapid expansion, as a result of the newly-created European club competitions, as well as the advent of television and improved travel across Europe.\n\nA committed European, Mr Wiederkehr saw his role as helping to consolidate and build up Europe's prominent position within international football. An uncomplicated, but dynamic, enterprising and inventive man, he had studied economics and was on several occasions a member of the FIFA World Cup Organising Committee, and he also became a FIFA vice-president.\n\nThe UEFA President's love for the game shone through \u2013 he was a player in his youth, and also served as chairman of the Young Fellows Z\u00fcrich club. Astute, an intelligent negotiator and an innovate businessman in the carpet industry, he served as President for 10 years until his sudden death in summer 1972.\n\nEbbe Schwartz (Denmark)\n\nUEFA President from 22 June 1954 to 17 April 1962\n\nDanish football administrator Ebbe Schwartz was an ideal figure as the first UEFA President. He was known as a man of great diplomacy, enjoyed an international education and came from a country with a long football history.\n\nBorn in Copenhagen on 5 March 1901, Mr Schwartz was an expert in trade and commerce, and became a joint owner of his family engineering works and iron foundry company in 1931.\n\nHe played as a goalkeeper with AB Copenhagen, but was to make his mark as a football administrator, serving as head of the Danish football delegation when the team won the bronze medal at the London Olympic Games in 1948, and taking the position of Danish FA President in 1950 \u2013 a position he was to hold until his death in 1964.\n\nMr Schwartz served two four-year terms as UEFA President, before leaving the post in the spring of 1962 for a seat on the FIFA Executive Committee. He had led UEFA skilfully through its early years following the body's birth in June 1954."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Michel_(politician)", "page_content": "Mathieu Michel (born May 18, 1979) is a Belgian politician for the French-speaking liberal party Reformist Movement.\n\nMichel was born on May 18, 1979, Mathieu Michel.

The end of 2021 will bring with it the end of an era: thanks to term limits, Eugene will be forced to leave office.\n\nAs is true across much of New York City, the past decade-and-a-half have brought immense changes to the 40th Council District, which covers Flatbush and parts of surrounding areas.\n\nThe latest results from the 2020 census show that the Black population in most of the neighborhoods east and south of Prospect Park fell 15% or more, while the white population grew significantly over the last decade. An area once defined by low-to-mid rise buildings now has a few bigger ones, including the 24-story Parkline building at 626 Flatbush Avenue and the 26-story apartment complex at 123 Linden Boulevard. Before pandemic moratoriums put a (temporary) halt to evictions, Flatbush had become one of the toughest places in Brooklyn for a renter to avoid getting kicked out of their home.\n\nPart of the area became the Little Caribbean or Little Haiti, depending on who you ask. New businesses opened on the neighborhood\u2019s commercial corridors, like Flatbush Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, even as vacancies remained high. Serious crime in the police precincts that overlap with the Council District (the 67th, 70th, and 71st) fell significantly, from 6,557 instances of the seven major felonies tracked by the NYPD in 2007 to 3,970 incidents in 2019, before inching back up to 4,079 in 2020.\n\nThroughout it all, there was Council Member Mathieu Eugene, who has represented the area for 14 years, the longest tenure of any member of the municipal body. The end of 2021 will bring the end of an era: Eugene will be forced to leave office thanks to term limits.\n\nHow much the changes that reshaped the district in that era\u2014for better or worse\u2014have to do with him is difficult to say.\n\nOpinions about Eugene, now 68, remain complicated, and many of those who live and work in the district feel he has been ineffective and unresponsive to community concerns.\n\n\u201cYou never knew if he would show up to a meeting or event,\u201d said Brenda Edwards, president of the Prospect Lefferts Gardens Neighborhood Association (PLGNA).\n\nEarlier in the 2010s, Edwards was part of another local group, Prospect Park East Network, that led an ultimately unsuccessful fight to stop the construction of the tower at 626 Flatbush Avenue. Though Eugene eventually voiced support for the group\u2019s cause, calling for a temporary moratorium on development in the district, Edwards said she felt the Council Member never gave them the attention or respect they deserved.\n\n\u201cIt took a while to get a meeting with him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would go to his office after it was scheduled and then find out he was going to be late or he couldn't make it. We finally sat with him, just to be lectured about how he was very busy, how he understood the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found out later he didn't really understand the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bottom line is he really wasn't going to fight for us. Even if he knew he couldn't win, he didn\u2019t even bother trying to help.\u201d\n\nThe Flatbush Tenant Coalition (FTC), a housing advocacy group, had a similar experience earlier this year. In April, the group rallied outside Eugene\u2019s office to encourage him to support a bill that would guarantee tenants legal counsel during eviction proceedings. Though Eugene eventually signed on to the bill, the Coalition\u2019s organizers remained frustrated by the amount of work required to get his attention. District 40 has been home to the city's worst landlords, according to the list made annually by the city's Public Advocate, for over a decade.\n\n\u201cHe was speaking to us as if we do not know that this is a housing crisis, as if we do not know that we\u2019re in a pandemic,\u201d Sarah Guillet, an FTC organizer who attended the rally, told The Haitian Times. \u201cIt took him months to give us any attention.\u201d\n\nThe perception of Eugene as insufficiently communicative and not present in the district\u2019s key battles is not uncommon. Eugene\u2019s replacement in the Council seat will almost certainly be Rita Joseph, a longtime teacher who was also born in Haiti and who won the Democratic primary race for the seat in June. Joseph\u2019s campaign declined to comment for this story, but in a recent interview with the outlet City & State, when asked what she would do differently than her predecessor, she made her opinion clear.\n\n\u201cNo. 1, be present,\u201d she said. \u201cGood governance. And that was one of the things I encountered as I was knocking on doors. \u2018Oh, wow, we've never seen our current Council member, but we see you.\u2019 So being present, being available and being ready to serve on day one.\u201d\n\nOf course, Eugene wouldn\u2019t have survived in office for so long without at least a few fans.\n\nEven as his margins of victory became smaller in each successive Council Democratic primary (he won 59% of the vote in 2009, 48% in 2013, and 41% in 2017), he retained a strong base of support, particularly in the eastern portions of the district most heavily populated by Haitian and other Caribbean immigrants. And despite his poor overall showing in the Democratic primary race for Brooklyn Borough President this summer, Eugene managed to win a large swath of election districts in Flatbush, along with much of Canarsie and Flatlands.\n\nA map showing the results of the Democratic primary race for Brooklyn Borough President, broken down by election district (Map created by Sam Hudis and Competitive Advantage Research)\n\n\u201cI've been very successful at making a difference in the lives of the people of the community and I'm very confident people are satisfied,\u201d Eugene told Bklyner in an interview earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019ve got such a good connection with my constituents. That\u2019s the reason why I'm the most tenured member in the City Council.\u201d\n\nHe bristled at criticism that he has been insufficiently responsive to community needs, calling it inaccurate and \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople stop me every time to come to me, bring their issues, ask me for my assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m driving, people stop me to approach me and I always stop to talk to them. If I'm walking two or three blocks in my district, people come to hug me. Beyond politics, that's what I\u2019ve been doing. I'm not a politician, I'm a people-tician.\u201d\n\nMuch of that love comes from a couple of distinct sources. Partially, it\u2019s the community of people that rely on the area\u2019s hospitals, Health+Hospitals Kings County, and SUNY Downstate, to which Eugene, a doctor by training, has directed at least $66 million in discretionary funding.\n\nBut Eugene\u2019s primary base is the area\u2019s large Haitian population, where he has deep ties and strong name recognition. He has sought to position himself as a sort of unofficial ambassador for Haiti and its people. After the 2010 earthquake in that country, his Council office served as a conduit for the thousands of Haitian Brooklynites trying to get news about loved ones on the island, and in 2015, he sponsored a resolution in the City Council establishing October 9th annually as \u201cNew York City Haitian Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've done for the Haitian community more than anyone,\u201d he told Bklyner.\n\nBut Eugene has also faced questions about his financial commitment to the community. An investigation by The Haitian Times earlier this year found that Eugene gave over $946,000 in discretionary funds to groups outside District 40 in the last fiscal year, compared to around $298,600 to organizations located within the district. Haitian and other Caribbean organizations in CD40 and nearby areas received only $82,000 from Eugene.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been historically like that for the past few years with his office not supporting us enough,\u201d Spencer Cassius from the Haitian-American Community Coalition told the paper.\n\nTo Bklyner, Eugene called The Haitian Times \u201ca paper that from day one was against me.\u201d He said they were \u201ctrying to sabotage\u201d his borough president campaign, \u201cand everybody in the Haitian community knows that.\u201d\n\nAs for the distribution of funding, he said it was an issue of the capacity of local organizations.\n\n\u201cEven when I provide funding to them, after the first year, they lose it, because they don't have the structure, they don\u2019t comply with the rules and regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed to his efforts a decade ago to help create the NY-Haitian Leadership Fellowship, which he said was intended to help build capacity amongst Haitian community groups. And he said many of the groups he did direct funding to, several of which are Jewish, provided essential services to all the communities in the district. Some of those organizations, including the Flatbush-based Council of Jewish Organizations (COJO), which received $51,593 from Eugene that year, came to the Council Member\u2019s defense after the investigation was published.\n\n\u201cI know that whether it\u2019s placing thousands of young people in summer jobs through the city\u2019s SYEP program or graduating hundreds of students who take our Adult Computer or High School Equivalency or Adult Basic Education classes, we do so for all who come to us and with the knowledge that public servants like Mathieu Eugene make it all possible,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO Louis Welz wrote in a letter to the editor.\n\nCriticism has come on other fronts. The advocacy group StreetsPAC derided Eugene\u2019s record on transportation issues, describing him as someone \u201cfor whom transportation has been an afterthought, at best.\u201d This news outlet chastised him for taking four years to push the city\u2019s transportation department to install a single crosswalk and traffic signal near a school and for being unresponsive to media requests. A City & State analysis of the 2019 legislative session found that he ranked 45th of 51 members in terms of the number of bills introduced.\n\nEugene has been the primary sponsor of 141 pieces of legislation in his 14 years in the Council, according to the body\u2019s legislative database. However, 78 of those were \u201cresolutions\u201d\u2014effectively non-binding statements with little impact on city operations. Of the remaining 63 sponsored \u201cintroductions,\u201d or proposed changes to local law, 11 have been enacted. Compare that to the Brooklyn Council Member that won this summer\u2019s Democratic primary Brooklyn Borough President: Antonio Reynoso. In just eight years in the Council, Reynoso was the primary sponsor of 70 introductions, 20 of which became law.\n\nTo Bklyner, Eugene defended his legislative record. He said he was particularly proud of a 2018 resolution (again, nonbinding) calling on federal and state governments to create a special commission to address health emergencies and infectious diseases, which was passed last year. He also mentioned a 2017 law he sponsored that created \u201ca disconnected youth task force.\u201d The task force published a report with recommendations in January of this year, three years late.\n\nBut Eugene also says focusing solely on legislation is missing the point.\n\n\u201cLegislation is very important but I think we have to do more than legislation,\u201d he told Bklyner. \u201cAnd my philosophy is we have not been doing enough. Gun violence, for example, we have so much legislation on gun violence, but shootings are up. They're shooting kids in the park. My approach is to invest in the human being.\u201d\n\nUltimately, that approach wasn\u2019t enough to convince voters he was the man for the Brooklyn Borough President job. His campaign generated relatively little attention in the primary race, and he ultimately finished fourth in the contest.\n\nIt was a stark contrast from the flurry of headlines that accompanied Eugene\u2019s ascension to the Council in a special election in 2007. Some were celebratory: in central Brooklyn\u2019s heavily Caribbean 40th Council District, New York had elected the Council\u2019s first Haitian-born member. Eugene had won with backing not only from the politically influential mother-daughter team of Una and Yvette Clarke (who had held the seat until she was elected to Congress the preceding November) but also from Representative Anthony Weiner, 1199 United Healthcare Workers East, and the rapper Wyclef Jean.\n\nBut things quickly got messy; questions arose about whether he actually lived in the district he was elected to represent.

The result was historic, as Obama, a first-term U.S. senator, became, when he was inaugurated on January 20, 2009, the country\u2019s first African American president. He also was the first sitting U.S. senator to win election to the presidency since John F. Kennedy in 1960. With the highest voter turnout rate in four decades, Obama and Delaware senator Joe Biden defeated the Republican ticket of Arizona senator John McCain, who sought to become the oldest person elected president to a first term in U.S. history, and Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who attempted to become the first woman vice president in the country\u2019s history, winning nearly 53 percent of the vote.\n\nThe 24/7 news cycle and the proliferation of blogs as a means of disseminating information (both factual and erroneous) framed the contest as both campaigns attempted to control the narrative. McCain\u2019s campaign tried to paint Obama as a naive, inexperienced political lightweight who would sit down with the leaders of anti-American regimes in Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela without preconditions, claimed that he was merely a celebrity with little substance (airing an ad comparing Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton), labeled his ideas socialist (hammering away at Obama\u2019s tax policy in particular and pouncing on Obama\u2019s comment to \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d that he would seek \u201cspread the wealth\u201d), and attacked his association with Bill Ayers, who had cofounded the Weathermen, a group that carried out bombings in the 1960s. Ayers, in 2008 a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2014and constantly called an \u201cunrepentant domestic terrorist\u201d by the McCain campaign\u2014lived a few blocks from Obama in Chicago, contributed to his reelection campaign for the Illinois Senate, and served on an antipoverty board with Obama from 1999 to 2002. Obama downplayed his acquaintance with Ayers and denounced Ayers\u2019s activities as \u201cdetestable\u201d but was quick to note that these activities had occurred 40 years ago when the candidate was eight years old. In addition, on the basis of e-mails and other assertions never proved, a small but still significant percentage of the public erroneously believed Obama (a practicing Christian) to be a Muslim. To defend against the attacks, Obama\u2019s campaign took the unprecedented step of establishing a Web site, \u201cFight the Smears,\u201d to \u201cfight back against \u2018hateful,\u2019 \u2018vicious,\u2019 and \u2018desperate\u2019 robocalls and mailers.\u201d In turn, Obama\u2019s campaign attempted to cast doubt on McCain\u2019s maverick persona and diminish his appeal to independent voters by tying him at every opportunity to Pres. George W. Bush, whose popularity was among the lowest of any modern president, and broadcasting ads that showed the two in embrace and often repeating that McCain voted with the Bush administration 90 percent of the time. The Obama campaign also sought to frame McCain as \u201cerratic,\u201d a charge that was often repeated and that some alleged was an oblique reference to McCain\u2019s age, as he would be the oldest person ever to be inaugurated to a first term as president.\n\nThe fall campaign was also conducted against the backdrop of a financial crisis that gripped the country in September, when world markets suffered heavy losses, severely hitting the retirement savings of many Americans and pushing the economy to the top of voters\u2019 concerns, far outdistancing the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism. From September 19 to October 10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 26 percent, from 11,388 to 8,451. At the same time, there was a severe contraction of liquidity in credit markets worldwide, caused in part by the subprime mortgage crisis, which resulted in the U.S. government\u2019s providing emergency loans to several American firms and the bankruptcy or sale of several major financial institutions. The U.S. economic and political establishment reacted by passing (after an unsuccessful first attempt) the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which sought to prevent further collapse and to bailout the economy.\n\nThe effect of the economic crisis was dramatic, turning a small McCain-Palin lead in the polls in early September into a steady Obama-Biden lead. Obama\u2019s lead was further supported by his performance in the three presidential debates, with polls indicating that he was the winner of all three. In both the debates and his response to the financial crisis, Obama scored points with the public for his steadiness and coolness (characterized as aloofness by his critics). Whereas McCain announced the suspension of his campaign for a few days in September to return to Washington, D.C., to address the financial crisis and suggested that the first debate be postponed, Obama played more of a behind-the-scenes role and insisted that the debate take place, saying \u201cIt is going to be part of the president\u2019s job to deal with more than one thing at once.\u201d Obama was also aided by his decision to opt out of the federal financing system, which would have limited his campaign to $84 million in spending. The McCain campaign criticized this decision, citing a questionnaire Obama filled out in 2007 in which he pledged to stay within the public financing system; however, Obama defended the decision, arguing that in the same document he called for a plan that would require \u201cboth major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election\u201d and that if he won the Democratic nomination he would \u201caggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.\u201d The Obama campaign\u2019s decision paid off, as it attracted more than three million donors and raised an astounding $150 million in the month of September alone, enabling the campaign to outspend the McCain campaign by significant margins in the battleground states and to purchase 30 minutes of prime-time television six days prior to the election (more than 33 million Americans watched the Obama infomercial).\n\nBritannica Quiz U.S. Presidential History Quiz\n\nThe campaign generated enormous enthusiasm, with millions of new registrants joining the voting rolls (though the McCain campaign alleged that many of these were registered illegally, after allegations surfaced that several employees hired by ACORN, an interest group that lobbies on behalf of lower-income families, had submitted falsified registrations). McCain hosted numerous townhall meetings (a format in which he excelled) throughout the country, in which attendees could question the candidate; however, some of these meetings came under media scrutiny when some audience members became heated in their criticism of Obama. Obama rallies consistently attracted large crowds\u2014including some 100,000 at a rally in St. Louis, Mo., in mid-October\u2014and tens of thousands often came out to see Palin on the stump (the campaign had provided only limited access to Palin for the media). Although some commentators, including conservative ones, questioned her readiness for the vice presidency and presidency, she proved enormously popular: a record 70 million Americans tuned into the vice presidential debate, and her appearance on Saturday Night Live, whose Tina Fey had lampooned her several times previously, drew the show\u2019s highest ratings for 14 years.\n\nThe 2008 primary campaign was also historic. On the Democratic side, the field narrowed quickly to pit Barack Obama against Hillary Clinton. Both candidates were seeking to become presidential \u201cfirsts\u201d\u2014Obama the first African American president and Clinton the first woman president. A sometimes bitter contest between Obama and Clinton produced the narrowest of victories for Obama. The Republican campaign produced a surprising winner, John McCain. Many pundits had written off McCain during the summer of 2007, as his campaign was faltering, while many others had anointed Rudy Giuliani as the front-runner. But Giuliani failed to capture a single state in the primaries, and McCain went on to defeat strong challenges from Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee easily."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6952209", "page_content": "The French municipal elections of 2008 were held on 9 March in that year (with a second round of voting taking place, where necessary, one week later on 16 March ) to elect the municipal council s of France 's 36,782 communes.

As you may recall, she was in a similar position eight years ago \u2014 and, after a long and bitter contest, she ended up losing.\n\nThere are several factors that, considered together, explain Clinton's 2008 primary defeat: Barack Obama's powerhouse fundraising, position on the Iraq war, appeal to black voters, and small-state organizing all helped him narrowly edge out a victory. Meanwhile, Clinton failed to dominate the fundraising or endorsement games, and she had long looked vulnerable in a key early state.\n\nHowever, none of these factors that helped Obama appear to be present this time around. So, to understand why Clinton looks so extraordinarily dominant in the 2016 primaries, it's worth taking a look back why she went down to defeat. Such a review suggests she probably won't lose again.\n\n1) Democrats hated the Iraq war\n\nHillary Clinton had a huge weakness going into the 2008 primary that was clear from the start \u2014 she had voted to authorize the Iraq war, and Democrats really, really hated the Iraq war.\n\nThis chart shows a poll from August 2007, in which a massive 81 percent Democratic voters said the war was a mistake. At this point, Clinton had also become critical of the war. But her main opponent, Barack Obama, had given a speech saying war with Iraq would be a \"dumb\" idea around the same time that she had voted to authorize it. And on the campaign trail, Clinton refused to characterize her own vote as a mistake or to apologize for it.\n\nInequality is not Iraq\n\nThis provided a crucial contrast on an issue that was dominating politics at the time \u2014 giving Obama one very specific example he could use to to set himself apart from the frontrunner. Obama also capitalized on serious resentment from party activists against Clinton and other Democratic leaders who had authorized the war.\n\nSome have suggested that the issue of economic inequality could similarly springboard a less-known Clinton challenger in 2016, but this doesn't appear likely. It's not really clear what would be the \"Iraq war vote\" of income inequality \u2014 a clear and galvanizing moment that puts Clinton on the wrong side of the issue, to her party's base. Indeed, Clinton has been arguing lately that inequality is a big problem, as has the rest of her party. Beyond that, polls have shown that Democrats don't actually want a nominee who's more liberal than Clinton.\n\n2) Clinton didn't dominate in endorsements\n\nAs frontrunner, Hillary Clinton won many more more endorsements than any of her rivals did in 2007. But her overall total wasn't so strong, historically.\n\nThis chart shows data on endorsements before the Iowa caucuses amassed by the political scientists who wrote The Party Decides. The authors collected all the endorsement information they could find \u2014 involving sitting governors, to former elected officials, to local officeholders and even celebrities \u2014 and weighted it by the importance each endorser seemed to hold in the party.\n\nTheir data shows that though Clinton topped Obama and Edwards in weighted endorsements, her total of 45 percent was rather low \u2014 in contrast to Al Gore's 82 percent in 2000, Bill Clinton's quite high 70 percent in the 1992 open contest, and even Walter Mondale's 56 percent in 1984. The party had not unanimously lined up behind Clinton \u2014 far from it. This left an opening for a challenger.\n\nNow, in contrast, Clinton has been racking up endorsements from top Democrats, even though she's not yet officially running. And top Obama operatives like Jim Messina, Joel Benenson, and Jim Margolis are joining the Clinton fold rather than waiting for, say, Vice President Joe Biden to announce his plans.\n\n3) Obama basically tied Clinton in fundraising\n\nMany people remember the 2008 campaign as featuring Clinton as a clear frontrunner and dominant, expected victor, until Obama's shocking Iowa caucus win.\n\nObama's fundraising let him compete on Super Tuesday\n\nIn fact, it was clear well before Iowa that Obama was a serious contender \u2014 because he was a powerhouse fundraiser who amassed nearly as much money as the purported frontrunner did throughout 2007.\n\nFundraising is a proxy for support and enthusiasm among members of the party \u2014 both from elites (who give big donations), and its base (many of whom give smaller donations, but vote). Obama performed very well with both \u2014 it turned out that many wealthy and non-wealthy liberals wanted to give him their money.\n\nObama's fundraising also let him have the money he needed to effectively capitalize on his early state wins in Iowa and South Carolina. There were 24 primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday. If Obama had raised much less cash, he may not have been able to effectively compete in as many of them as he did.\n\nThis time around, it's obviously too early to say definitively if any challenger to Clinton would be able to compete with her in fundraising. But the only potential candidate with obvious star power and a recent record of massive fundraising success, Elizabeth Warren, isn't running.\n\n4) Iowa looked really tough for Clinton all along\n\nSimilarly, many people remember that Clinton was leading most of the final polls before the Iowa caucuses and that Obama's eight-point win there was somewhat of a surprise. Indeed, Clinton ended up coming in third, narrowly behind John Edwards.\n\nBut though Obama's rise in Iowa came late, Clinton's weakness in the state had been clear for a year. For the first half of 2007, the putative frontrunner trailed Edwards in the crucial early state. Indeed, the situation in Iowa looked so dire that Clinton's team even considered bypassing the caucuses. They ultimately opted against this drastic move.\n\nThings improved somewhat when Clinton began to regularly lead Iowa polls in the second half of the year. But even then, she never topped 35 percent of the vote \u2014 that wasn't a secure lead.\n\nThis year is quite different. Clinton is, on average, a 46 percentage points ahead of a her nearest Iowa competitor, Bernie Sanders. It's possible that this margin will tighten a bit, but the early and obvious vulnerability Clinton had in 2007 in the state just isn't there now.\n\n5) Obama won delegates in small states and caucuses\n\nAfter the first few contests in 2008, Clinton frequently won primaries in the most populous states \u2014 while Obama's team focused on amassing the delegates that would actually deliver him the nomination. They did so by organizing in small states and caucuses, to run up Obama's margin of victory there.\n\nFor instance, on Super Tuesday, Clinton won the biggest states, but Obama ended up with more delegates \u2014 for instance, he topped the 11 delegates Clinton netted from New Jersey by netting 12 in Idaho. A month later, in Texas, Clinton won the primary by 3 points, but Obama won a caucus responsible for one-third of the state's delegates by 12.5 points. Again, Obama ended up with a greater delegate haul overall.\n\nClinton ended up winning the popular vote in 7 of the 8 states with the biggest populations, with Obama's only victory coming in his home state of Illinois. But \"between Idaho, Nebraska, Vermont, Maine, Mississippi, North Dakota, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and Alaska, Obama would amass 118 delegates to Clinton's 57,\" according to a Washington Post report. A Democratic rival to Clinton in 2016 would likely have to replicate this very impressive organizing success \u2014 and generate a great deal of enthusiasm among grassroots volunteers \u2014 to have any shot.\n\n6) Obama won big among black voters\n\nObama had an opening with his Iraq war opposition, he raised a lot of money, and he organized in caucus states. But none of this would have been enough to make him the nominee if he didn't win the strong support of black voters.\n\nAs this chart shows, Obama won every primary in the eight states where more than 20 percent of the population is black, and sometimes racked up huge margins in them. This dominance was because he won the votes of between 78 and 91 percent of black voters in each of these states, according to exit polls. He'd net over 100 delegates from these eight states \u2014 close to the margin of his pledged delegate lead when the primary season ended.\n\n\"It's when black Americans back a challenger that the establishment candidate falters,\" Jamelle Bouie writes at Slate. \"If Hillary Clinton had kept a decent share of the black vote, she would have become the Democratic nominee.\" So unless a challenger to Clinton can manage to win big among black voters in 2016, her position looks strong.\n\n7) Clinton didn't appear more electable than Obama\n\nOnce Obama's narrow delegate advantage after Super Tuesday became evident, it was clear that Clinton was the underdog. She needed something that could shake up a race that was looking incredibly stable.\n\nObama was still a new face, and there were lingering fears among many Democrats that he might perform more weakly in the general election than Clinton. If there were some evidence to support this argument, Clinton might have been able to persuasively appeal to Democrats fearful of losing the White House three times in a row to nominate her instead.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the polling data showed just the opposite. As you can see above, polling in the two months after Super Tuesday (early February to early April 2008) showed that in head-to-head matchups, Obama beat McCain more often than Clinton beat McCain. With that polling, there was no reason for Obama-supporting Democrats to doubt their choice.\n\nThis time around, Clinton consistently leads head-to-head polls against all her potential Republican rivals. Now, general election polls so many months in advance aren't very predictive, and frequently reflect name recognition.\n\nBut imagine what might be happening if Clinton was consistently losing these polls. Potential rivals would sense weakness, and some in the party might risk taking a chance on someone else. As it is now, though, Democrats seem happy with the candidate they've got."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Dukakis", "page_content": "Michael Dukakis, in full Michael Stanley Dukakis, (born November 3, 1933, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.), American politician and lawyer, who served as governor of Massachusetts (1975\u201379, 1983\u201391) and who was the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president in 1988.\n\nThe son of Greek immigrants, Michael Dukakis graduated from Swarthmore College in 1955. After serving in the U.S. Army in South Korea, he attended Harvard Law School, earning his law degree in 1960. He subsequently became active in Massachusetts Democratic politics and served eight years (1962\u201370) in the state\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\nBritannica Quiz U.S. Presidential Elections Quiz\n\nHe lost a bid for the Massachusetts lieutenant governorship in 1970 but in 1974 was elected governor, in which post he coped with a serious budgetary crisis and restored the state\u2019s fiscal health. He lost his bid for reelection in 1978 but was again elected governor of Massachusetts in 1982. During his second term as governor he coordinated the government\u2019s policies so as to greatly strengthen the state\u2019s economic base, saving old industries and encouraging the growth of new ones. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1986. Partly as a result of his efforts, Massachusetts for a brief time had one of the nation\u2019s healthiest state economies.\n\nIn April 1987 Dukakis declared his candidacy for the presidency. He emerged as the most popular candidate in the 1988 Democratic primaries and won his party\u2019s nomination for president. Although he initially had a lead over his Republican opponent, George H.W. Bush, Dukakis\u2019s popularity waned amid an onslaught of negative ads, the most controversial of which was the so-called Willie Horton ad featuring a felon who was let out on a weekend furlough in Massachusetts and subsequently assaulted and raped a woman. The ad, which was considered racist by many, was run by an independent group. Although a moderate, Dukakis was portrayed as a dangerous liberal. In the November 1988 election, he was easily defeated by Bush. Dukakis later announced that he would leave office at the expiration of his term as governor in January 1991.\n\nDukakis subsequently taught at several schools, including Harvard and Northeastern University. A longtime supporter of public transportation, he served on the board of Amtrak for a number of years. In addition, he lent his support to various Democratic politicians, notably Elizabeth Warren. His books included How to Get into Politics\u2014and Why (2000; written with Paul Simon)."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/elections-of-1957-and-1958-feature", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nIn 1957 and 1958, Canadian voters swept aside 22 years of Liberal rule for the untested Conservatives under John Diefenbaker, whose campaign brilliance won him first a minority government, and then a historic majority.\n\n\"Uncle Louis\" Calls Election\n\nPrime Minister Louis St-Laurent did not have to call an election for 10 June 1957. His government had not been toppled by a vote of non-confidence, and there was still more than a year remaining in his term. But after 22 consecutive years of Liberal government, extending back to 1935 and the third return to power of Mackenzie King, St-Laurent was under the illusion that the Liberals would win regardless of when the election was held.\n\nLiberal campaign poster for Louis St. Laurent. Image: Library and Archives Canada/R1300-207.\\r\n\n\n\nFrom the Liberal perspective, there were compelling reasons to believe that they would win another majority government. The leader, while old and presumably fighting his last campaign, was nevertheless respected and even loved as \"Uncle Louis,\" the benevolent prime minister of a nation thriving in the aftermath of the Second World War. The economy was booming. The Cabinet St-Laurent had built included some of the strongest ministers and best minds ever assembled in Ottawa \u2014 C.D. Howe had his finger in every pie, but was in reality Minister of Trade and Commerce and of Defence Production; Paul Martin Sr. was a highly respected Minister of National Health and Welfare; and Lester Pearson, on the verge of being awarded Canada's first Nobel Peace Prize for his solution to the Suez Crisis, was Secretary of State for External Affairs. There were others, too, and they ran the Liberal Party with a precision that comes only with years in office. There was nothing, surely, that would turn the voters away from the efficient, successful government of the Liberals under Louis St-Laurent.\n\nFor all its superficial chaos, the Pearson government left behind a notable legacy of legislation (Library and Archives Canada / C-010435). The minister of Trade and Commerce speaking at the official opening of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation loading facilities at Picton, Ontario, 1955 (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-472). PreviousNext\n\nNew PC Leader\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives (PCs) saw things differently. The business of government might have been dispatched with managerial efficiency, but it was also conducted with a degree of arrogance that the Conservatives found unbearable. They hoped the electorate would too. Debate over the building of a gas pipeline across Canada had been suspended by the imposition of \"closure,\" a decidedly undemocratic and rarely used parliamentary procedure, which unilaterally cut off House of Commons discussion on the matter. Conservatives across the country campaigned against the sense of entitlement with which the Liberals seemed to govern. They also drew attention to Liberal stinginess: in an era of economic prosperity, the Liberals had agreed only to a $6.00 increase to the existing Old Age Pension, prompting calls of \"Six Buck Harris\" in the direction of Finance Minister Walter Harris. From the Conservative perspective, these were issues that could be turned into campaign fodder in the spring of 1957. Whether or not they could be turned into gains in the House of Commons was another matter.\n\nJohn G. Diefenbaker MP, speaking in the House of Commons in 1948 (photo by Louis Jacques, courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-080883).\n\nThe new PC leader, John Diefenbaker, was the real unknown in the equation. Selected at a leadership convention the year before, Diefenbaker was by no means a unanimous choice. Frequently on the losing end of campaigns and leadership contests in the past, his win came as a surprise, and was secured with virtually no support from Qu\u00e9bec Conservatives. Because Qu\u00e9bec was one of the provinces where the party most needed to make gains if they wanted a chance at winning the election, Diefenbaker's selection was considered risky by many.\n\nWhat no one had really taken into account was Diefenbaker's powerful presence on the campaign trail. A tireless orator, he brought vitality to the election, something that was missing on the Liberal side. On the advice of his aide Merrill Menzies, Diefenbaker began to talk of a new national policy, one based on a program of developing Canada's North. Without much in the way of a formal platform, what Diefenbaker said on the hustings became the Conservative policy.\n\nJohn Diefenbaker at the Ottawa convention in 1956 when he was chosen to succeed George Drew as leader of the Conservative Party (courtesy NAC).\n\nDiefenbaker was a self-proclaimed underdog. The party campaigned under the slogan \"It's time for a Diefenbaker government,\" emphasizing the need for change after so many years of Liberal rule. But in 1957, more was needed to slay the Liberal goliath than that, and a more powerful weapon came in the shape of Ontario's Big Blue Machine. A Conservative stronghold since 1943, Ontario premiers George Drew \u2014 coincidentally Diefenbaker's unsuccessful predecessor as the leader of the national PCs \u2014 and Leslie Frost had built a powerful political organization in the province.\n\nAfter working with the Liberals in Ottawa for the better part of a decade, Frost had finally tired of the federal government's position on tax-sharing and, hoping for better fiscal results from the Conservatives, agreed that it was, indeed, \"time for a Diefenbaker government.\" Frost threw his considerable political weight into Diefenbaker's campaign, and lent him the use of his own party machinery.\n\nDiefenbaker Wins\n\nNo one predicted the results of the 1957 election, which saw 112 Conservatives elected, despite making little headway in Qu\u00e9bec, but thanks in large part to the support of Ontario. That left 105 Liberals, 25 members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party (CCF), 19 Social Credit members and 4 Independents. The result was Canada's first post-war minority government. It was the least anticipated result of any previous Canadian federal election. The Conservatives were thrilled at the chance to govern. But the Liberals \u2013 facing defeat not only as a party in the election, but also individually in the ridings of many of the powerful ministers \u2013 were in a state of shock. That response was to have important implications for the next election.\n\nThe Liberals \u2013 stripped of power and access to the civil servants who had helped them design policy, and having lost the Cabinet ministers who in the past had kept them in touch with the mood of the country (though obviously not in 1957) \u2013 tried to regroup. St-Laurent retired, and was replaced as leader by Lester Pearson, a boy wonder in the diplomatic field but one as yet unprepared for the prime minister's chair. New policy advisers were quickly pulled together, but there was not nearly enough time for a complete rethinking of Liberal Party policy. Rashly, Pearson took the first parliamentary opportunity available to him to demand Diefenbaker's resignation, giving Diefenbaker just the excuse he needed to call a snap election.\n\nHistoric Majority\n\nOnce again, Diefenbaker shone brightly on the campaign trail. He had perfected his new national policy rhetoric, offering up a vision of \"One Canada\" for everyone, and a northern development policy built on \"roads to resources.\" There were flaws in the scheme, and little of the policy would ever be fully realized, but it caught the imagination of the electorate in ways that Pearson's platform never did. The Liberals ran a disorganized campaign, offering increases to old social policies and the addition of new ones such as health insurance, but the public was more inclined to give the Conservatives \u2014 who had already increased pensions and mother's allowances \u2014 a real chance to govern. The Conservatives won 208 seats in the election of 31 March 1958, the largest majority ever. It would be surpassed only by Brian Mulroney's staggering victory in 1984."}, {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/who-were-barack-obamas-challengers-in-2008-and-2012-us-presidential-elections/articleshow/78590968.cms", "page_content": "2008 presidential election\n\n2012 presidential election\n\nNEW DELHI: Barack Hussein Obama served as the President of the United States twice - from 2008 to 2016 - while defeating John McCain and Republican challenger Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2016 presidential elections, respectively.In the first term, Obama defeated Arizona Senator John McCain in November 2008 US presidential election.
