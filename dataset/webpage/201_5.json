Abrams.\n\nSix Degrees debuted on September 21, 2006 and was pulled from the airwaves after only six episodes due to low ratings. ABC assured fans of the show that the series would return in January. That didn\u2019t happen. In January, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPhearson said of The Nine and Six Degrees, \u201cthose two actually may get back on the air in (primetime).\u201d Not a guarantee for sure.\n\nThe one promising point was this: though ABC only ordered 13 episodes, Six Degrees is actually still in production in New York City. The cast and crew reportedly took some time off to creatively retool the series and Josh Charles (who you may remember from Aaron Sorkin\u2019s Sports Night) has been added to the cast.\n\nABC has just announced that Six Degrees will return to primetime on Friday, March 23rd at 9pm. It\u2019s unknown how long it will remain in that slot but hopefully fans can see the seven unaired episodes.\n\nNow, if the revisions to Six Degrees are successful and the show attracts decent ratings, it\u2019s possible that ABC could give the go-ahead for future episodes and perhaps even a second season.

As she tries to catch him in a lie, she also encounters Steven (Mr. Scott), a photographer and recovering drug addict who longs to be reunited with his school-age son. While having a pedicure, she also starts talking to Laura (Ms. Davis), a recent widow with a daughter.
