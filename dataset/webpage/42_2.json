Hundreds of thousands lost their lives and thousands more were left vulnerable. Philippe Dodard, a celebrated and admired figure in the Haitian art world and abroad, used the significant and tragic event to create art and encapsulate the emotions and memories born out of the earthquake.\n\n\n\n\u201c[At first] I could not paint because painting seemed to be a recreation to me in a period of emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to help as much as I could, those who were in severe difficulties. My home in Montagne Noire was left unscathed and thus became a host house for those who were coming to help the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt that moment, he was focused on what needed to be done to help the country get back on its feet. However, after an interview with a German television station about the loss of major art in museums and patrimonial places like the St. Trinity Church, his focus started to shift. During the interview, he showcased a piece titled \u201cThe Premonition\u201d that he began one week before the earthquake. Inspiration had returned to Dodard.\n\n\n\nThe Rising\n\nSince then, the artist has painted five emotive and powerful pieces immortalizing this traumatic moment in Haitian history. The \u201cEarthquake\u201d collection is a reflection on the toll the catastrophe took on the land and its people. There is one painting in particular, \u201cRising Souls,\u201d that Dodard believes especially captures the apocalyptic moment.\n\n\n\nDodard is not only an artist but also a man of action. He participated in an art therapy program to help those trying to cope with the trauma of the earthquake. Exploring tragedy through creative outlets can help people cope, he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe experience of art therapy with the 3,000 children of Plas Timoun, Djenny Seneque and the children from Champ de Mars Camp revealed how the expression of art can rebuild someone\u2019s broken soul and restore life with love and hope,\u201d said Dodard. \u201cChildren that could not speak after the trauma, captured the attention of others by telling their dramatic story through painting, singing, dancing, and sculpting with clay.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/how-haitian-artist-philippe-dodard-became-one-of-the-wealthiest-men-in-the-country-with-a-net-worth-of-102m/ar-AA16aEJC", "page_content": "Born in Port-au-Prince in 1954, Philippe Dodard did his primary studies at the Petit-S\u00e9minaire Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Martial and his secondary studies at the Cours priv\u00e9s Roger Anglade.

Many of the city\u2019s key landmarks, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building and the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, were destroyed or severely damaged. During the two weeks following the earthquake a series of at least 52 aftershocks continued to rock Haiti.\n\nFor Haiti\u2019s people, the impact has continued to be felt long after the aftershocks ceased. Lives were turned upside down and priorities reassessed. Haitians and their friends on the international stage channelled their energy into rebuilding people\u2019s lives \u2013 the country\u2019s artists were no exception.\n\nDespite its poverty, Haiti has always been culturally rich, famous for its abundance of artists and vibrant art scene. The earthquake destroyed much of Haiti\u2019s cultural heritage. Irreplaceable artwork, sculptures and historical buildings lay in ruins. However, with such a rich cultural heritage and long artistic tradition to draw on, art has since been identified as one tool for building a sustainable future for Haiti. In the aftermath of the earthquake, one of Haiti\u2019s most highly regarded contemporary artists, Philippe Dodard, who has turned his hand to everything from painting and graphic design to sculpture and metal work, was called upon to play his role in rebuilding the nation.\n\nBorn in 1954, Dodard was awarded his first prize for drawing in 1966 when he was just 12 years old. Drawing led him to painting, a passion he inherited from his mother, who used to produce copies of the classical French masters. During his twenties Dodard dabbled with various styles from Impressionism to Surrealism and Cubism until he developed his own style, Aquatisme. Through fluid water-like imagery he explored \u201cthe essence of spirituality\u201d and his relationship with people and nature. As Haiti entered a period of political turmoil during the 1980\u2019s, Dodard\u2019s style evolved once again, into what has become his signature style: Use of bold black and white strokes of ink to capture the reality of life for people in Haiti and powerful symbols from the Haitian voodoo tradition. His \u201cabstract expressionist\u201d artwork, heavily influenced by African art, aims, he tells me, to \u201cspeak to your soul and appeal, not only to your sense of aesthetic, but to what humans have inside, an essential spirituality and power\u201d, like \u201cthe beat of the silent drum that you can feel inside your body and soul.\u201d\n\nTragically, the earthquake drowned out the beat of the drum for a time. Dodard told me about his personal experience of 12th January 2010.\n\n\u201cMy life changed that day\u2026 I almost died twice. I was at the Presidential Palace and I left 20 minutes before the earthquake, thanks to my agent who called me for a meeting. I was in a car very close to the Hotel Montana where all the houses collapsed completely. My phone was working \u2013 I told him \u201cjust keep on driving, don\u2019t stay there\u201d and even though the car was bumping along and he said \u201cI can\u2019t drive\u201d, I told him to \u201cjust keep on driving, go.\u201d We passed a 15 metre wall and right after that the wall collapsed on five cars behind me.\u201d\n\nThe earthquake has had a profound impact on Dodard. Ever since, he has dedicated himself to projects which use art for the benefit of Haiti and its people. He tells me \u201csince that time I have wanted my art to be useful for my community.\u201d For the entire year after the earthquake he worked with Haiti\u2019s First Lady Madame Pr\u00e9val on a project called Plas Timoun (The Children\u2019s Place), which provided a safe place for Haitian children to express how they had been affected by the earthquake through art and learn to cope with the trauma. The children who participated in the project learned not only to cope with their traumatic past but to explore their creativity and hidden talents. Dodard is now a strong advocate of the power of art and its potential to contribute to Haiti\u2019s future.\n\nBesides Plas Timoun, Dodard has worked on other projects to help rebuild the country. He played a key role in the reconstruction of the iconic Iron Market (Marche de Fer), which served as a commercial and social hub in Port-au-Prince from 1891 until the earthquake brought it down. The new market, rebuilt with as much of the original material as possible, provides a base for almost 1,000 market traders to sell their wares and stands as a potent symbol of hope for future economic and cultural regeneration.\n\nThereafter Dodard went on to work with one of the world\u2019s most famous fashion designers, who shares a passion for Haiti and the potential of its artists. On a visit to the island, Donna Karan was inspired by his artwork, writing in her blog \u201cno one captures Haiti\u2019s heart and soul like artist Philippe Dodard.\u201d Donna Karan\u2019s Spring/Summer 2012 collection featured prints inspired by Dodard\u2019s black and white paintings and were exhibited side by side in Miami\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art. He also continues to be involved in Urban Zen, the foundation she established to help develop and market the work of Haitian artisans internationally. Dodard told me about this initiative.\n\n\u201cWith Donna and her Urban Zen Foundation we are developing artisans\u2019 skills to produce very high quality products that can be sold on the international market. Working with a designer of such a high level has helped me see how Haitian art can be promoted on the international market. We are working on developing the skills of artisans, the quality of the products and developing an understanding of how to be competitive on the international market, to ensure good service and how to conduct business sustainably.\u201d\n\nDodard\u2019s current primary focus is the National School of Arts (ENARTS). In January 2012 he received a phone call from President Martelli requesting he take on the role of Director of the School. Dodard accepted. The role is in many ways a natural progression of the various projects he has been involved in up until this point. He explains his hopes for the school.\n\n\u201cIt was a school that needed to developed, to be more professional, to be equipped and develop new spaces to be built. It is a challenge for an artist. I accepted the challenge and it is my main work now\u2026 I want to make the students aware of their role in developing the country and how they can contribute to it and make a living out of that.\u201d\n\nDodard firmly believes that, with nurturing, the emerging generation of Haitian artists can make a major impact on the world stage and on Haiti\u2019s cultural and economic regeneration.\n\n\u201cWhat we have in our culture, we can really take that to sell different kinds of products and different kinds of services: performance, theatre, music, dance, fine art, fashion\u2026 The fashion industry is big \u2013 why can\u2019t Haiti be in that market? Artisans have a big role to play in that development.\u201d\n\nSo, with memories of the earthquake still raw and its impact still keenly felt, Dodard is firmly focussed on the future and the beat of the silent drum is reverberating more powerfully than ever.\n\nThis article was originally published in Issue 4 of The Caribbean Property Investor magazine.

But the ground was still shaking in the nation\u2019s rubble-strewn capital, Port-au-Prince, and 87-year-old Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut wasn\u2019t taking any chances. One of the most prominent Haitian artists of the past 50 years was sleeping in a crude tent made of plastic sheeting and salvaged wood, fearful his earthquake-damaged house would collapse at any moment.\n\n\u201cDid you feel the tremors last night?\u201d Duffaut asked.\n\nYes, I had felt the ground shake in my hotel room around 4:30 that morning. It was the second straight night of tremors, and I was feeling a bit stressed. But standing next to Duffaut, whose fantastical naive paintings I have admired for three decades, I resolved to put my anxieties on hold.\n\nIt was Duffaut, after all, who had lived through one of the most horrific natural disasters of modern times. Not only was he homeless in the poorest nation of the Western Hemisphere, his niece and nephew had died in the earthquake. Gone, too, were his next-door neighbors in Port-au-Prince. \u201cTheir house just completely collapsed,\u201d Duffaut said. \u201cNine people were inside.\u201d\n\nThe diabolical 15- to 20-second earthquake on January 12 also stole a sizable chunk of Duffaut\u2019s\u2014and Haiti\u2019s\u2014artistic legacy. At least three artists, two gallery owners and an arts foundation director died. Thousands of paintings and sculptures\u2014valued in the tens of millions of dollars\u2014were destroyed or badly damaged in museums, galleries, collectors\u2019 homes, government ministries and the National Palace. The celebrated biblical murals that Duffaut and other Haitian artists painted at Holy Trinity Cathedral in the early 1950s were now mostly rubble. The Haitian Art Museum at College St. Pierre, run by the Episcopal Church, was badly cracked. And the beloved Centre d\u2019Art, the 66-year-old gallery and school that jump-started Haiti\u2019s primitive art movement\u2014making collectors out of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the filmmaker Jonathan Demme and thousands of others\u2014had crumbled. \u201cThe Centre d\u2019Art is where I sold my first piece of art in the 1940s,\u201d Duffaut said quietly, tugging on the white beard he had grown since the earthquake.\n\nDuffaut disappeared from his tent and returned a few moments later with a painting that displayed one of his trademark imaginary villages, a rural landscape dominated by winding, gravity-defying mountain roads filled with tiny people, houses and churches. Then he retrieved another painting. And another. Suddenly, I was surrounded by six Duffauts\u2014and all were for sale.\n\nStanding beside his tent, which was covered by a tarpaulin stamped USAID, Duffaut flashed a satisfied grin.\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cFour thousand dollars [each],\u201d he said, suggesting the price local galleries would charge.\n\nNot having more than $50 in my pocket, I had to pass. But I was delighted that Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut was open for business. \u201cMy future paintings will be inspired by this terrible tragedy,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat I have seen on the streets has given me a lot of ideas and added a lot to my imagination.\u201d There was an unmistakable look of hope in the old master\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cDeye mon, gen mon,\u201d a Haitian proverb, is Creole for \u201cbeyond the mountains, more mountains.\u201d\n\nImpossibly poor, surviving on less than $2 a day, most Haitians have made it their life\u2019s work to climb over, under and around obstacles, be they killer hurricanes, food riots, endemic diseases, corrupt governments or the ghastly violence that appears whenever there is political upheaval. One victim of these all too frequent calamities has been Haitian culture: even before the earthquake, this French- and Creole-speaking Caribbean island nation of nearly ten million people did not have a publicly owned art museum or even a single movie theater.\n\nStill, Haitian artists have proved astonishingly resilient, continuing to create, sell and survive through crisis after crisis. \u201cThe artists here have a different temperament,\u201d Georges Nader Jr. told me in his fortress-like gallery in P\u00e9tionville, the once-affluent, hillside Port-au-Prince suburb. \u201cWhen something bad happens, their imagination just seems to get better.\u201d Nader\u2019s family has been selling Haitian art since the 1960s.\n\nThe notion of making a living by creating and selling art first came to Haiti in the 1940s, when an American watercolorist named DeWitt Peters moved to Port-au-Prince. Peters, a conscientious objector to the world war then underway, took a job teaching English and was struck by the raw artistic expression he found at every turn\u2014even on the local buses known as tap-taps.\n\nHe founded Centre d\u2019Art in 1944 to organize and promote untrained artists, and within a few years, word had gone out that something special was happening in Haiti. During a visit to the center in 1945, Andr\u00e9 Breton, the French writer, poet and a leader of the cultural movement known as Surrealism, swooned over the work of a self-described houngan (voodoo priest) and womanizer named Hector Hyppolite, who often painted with chicken feathers. Hyppolite\u2019s creations, on subjects ranging from still lifes to voodoo spirits to scantily clad women (presumed to be his mistresses), sold for a few dollars each. But, Breton wrote, \u201call carried the stamp of total authenticity.\u201d Hyppolite died of a heart attack in 1948, three years after joining Centre d\u2019Art and one year after his work was displayed at a triumphant (for Haiti as well as for him) United Nations-sponsored exhibition in Paris.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Haitian art market relied largely on the tourists who ventured to this Maryland-size nation, 700 or so miles from Miami, to savor its heady m\u00e9lange of naive art, Creole food, smooth dark rum, hypnotic (though, at times, staged) voodoo ceremonies, high-energy carnivals and riotously colored bougainvillea. (Is it any wonder Haitian artists never lacked for inspiration?)\n\nThough tourists largely shied away from Haiti in the 1960s, when self-declared president-for-life Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier ruled through terror enforced by his personal army of Tonton Macoutes, they returned after his death in 1971, when his playboy son, Jean-Claude (known as \u201cBaby Doc\u201d), took charge.\n\nI got my first glimpse of Haitian art when I interviewed Baby Doc in 1977. (His reign as president-for-life ended abruptly when he fled the country in 1986 for France, where he lives today at age 59 in Paris.) I was hooked the moment I bought my first painting, a $10 market scene done on a flour sack. And I was delighted that every painting, iron sculpture and sequined voodoo flag I carried home on subsequent trips gave me further insight into a culture that is a blend of West African, European, native Ta\u00edno and other homegrown influences.\n\nAlthough some nicely done Haitian paintings could be bought for a few hundred dollars, the best works by early masters such as Hyppolite and Philom\u00e9 Obin (a devout Protestant who painted scenes from Haitian history, the Bible and his family\u2019s life) eventually commanded tens of thousands of dollars. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C. added Haitian primitives to their collections. And Haiti\u2019s reputation as a tourist destination was reinforced by the eclectic parade of notables\u2014from Barry Goldwater to Mick Jagger\u2014who checked into the Hotel Oloffson, the creaky gingerbread retreat that is the model for the hotel in The Comedians, Graham Greene\u2019s 1966 novel about Haiti.\n\nMuch of this exuberance faded in the early 1980s amid political strife and the dawn of the AIDS pandemic. U.S. officials classified Haitians as being among the four groups at highest risk for HIV infection. (The others were homosexuals, hemophiliacs and heroin addicts.) Some Haitian doctors called this designation unwarranted, even racist, but the perception stuck that a Haitian holiday was not worth the risk.\n\nThough tourism waned, the galleries that sponsored Haitian painters and sculptors targeted sales to overseas collectors and the increasing numbers of journalists, development workers, special envoys, physicians, U.N. peacekeepers and others who found themselves in the country.\n\n\u201cHaitians are not a brooding people,\u201d said gallery owner Toni Monnin, a Texan who moved to Haiti in the boom-time \u201970s and married a local art dealer. \u201cTheir attitude is: \u2018Let\u2019s get on with it! Tomorrow is another day.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the Gingerbread gallery in P\u00e9tionville, I was introduced to a 70-year-old sculptor who wore an expression of utter despondence. \u201cI have no home. I have no income. And there are days when me and my family don\u2019t eat,\u201d Nacius Joseph told me. Looking for financial support, or at least a few words of encouragement, he was visiting the galleries that had bought and sold his work over the years.\n\nJoseph told gallery owner Axelle Liautaud that his days as a woodcarver, creating figures such as La Sirene, the voodoo queen of the ocean, were over. \u201cAll my tools are broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t work. All of my apprentices, the people who helped me, have left Port-au-Prince, gone to the provinces. I\u2019m very discouraged. I have lost everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you love what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Liautaud asked.\n\nJoseph nodded.\n\n\u201cThen you have to find a way to do it. This is a situation where you have to have some drive because everyone has problems.\u201d\n\nJoseph nodded again, but looked to be near tears.\n\nThough the gallery owners were themselves hurting, many were handing out money and art supplies to keep the artists employed.\n\nAt her gallery a few blocks away, Monnin told me that in the days following the quake she distributed $14,000 to more than 40 artists. \u201cRight after the earthquake, they simply needed money to buy food,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, 90 percent of the artists I work with lost their homes.\u201d\n\nJean-Emmanuel \u201cMannu\u201d El Saieh, whose late father, Issa, was one of the earliest promoters of Haitian art, was paying a young painter\u2019s medical bills. \u201cI just talked to him on the phone, and you don\u2019t have to be a doctor to know he\u2019s still suffering from shock,\u201d El Saieh said at his gallery, just up a rutted road from the Oloffson hotel, which survived the quake.\n\nThough most of the artists I encountered had become homeless, they did not consider themselves luckless. They were alive, after all, and aware that the tremblement de terre had killed many of their friends and colleagues, such as the octogenarian owners of the Rainbow Gallery, Carmel and Cavour Delatour; Raoul Mathieu, a painter; Destimare Pierre Marie Isnel (a.k.a. Louco), a sculptor who worked with discarded objects in the downtown Grand Rue slum; and Flores \u201cFlo\u201d McGarrell, an American artist and film director who in 2008 moved to Jacmel (a town with splendid French colonial architecture, some of which survived the quake) to head up a foundation that supported local artists.\n\nThe day I arrived in Port-au-Prince, I heard rumors of another possible casualty\u2014Alix Roy, a reclusive, 79-year-old painter who had been missing since January 12. I knew Roy\u2019s work well: he painted humorous scenes from Haitian life, often chubby kids dressed up as adults in elaborate costumes, some wearing oversize sunglasses, others balancing outrageously large fruits on their heads. Although he was a loner, Roy was an adventurous sort who had also lived in New York, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nA few nights later, Nader called my room at Le Plaza (one of the few hotels in the capital open for business) with some grim news. Not only had Roy died in the rubble of the gritty downtown hotel where he lived, his remains were still buried there, six weeks later. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find someone from the government to pick him up,\u201d Nader said. \u201cThat\u2019s the least the Haitian government can do for one of its best artists.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Nader introduced me to Roy\u2019s sister, a retired kindergarten director in P\u00e9tionville. Marl\u00e9ne Roy Etienne, 76, told me her older brother had rented a room on the top floor of the hotel so he could look down on the street for inspiration.\n\n\u201cI went to look for him after the earthquake but couldn\u2019t even find where the hotel had been because the entire street\u2014Rue des C\u00e9sars\u2014was rubble,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I stood in front of the rubble where I thought Alix might be and said a prayer.\u201d\n\nEtienne\u2019s eyes teared when Nader assured her he would continue pressing government officials to retrieve her brother\u2019s remains.\n\n\u201cThis is hard,\u201d she said, reaching for a handkerchief. \u201cThis is really hard.\u201d\n\nNader had been through some challenging times himself. Although he had not lost any family members, and his gallery in P\u00e9tionville was intact, the 32-room house where his parents lived, and where his father, Georges S. Nader, had built a gallery that contained perhaps the largest collection of Haitian art anywhere, had crumbled.\n\nThe son of Lebanese immigrants, the elder Nader was long considered one of Haiti\u2019s best-known and most successful art dealers, having established relationships with hundreds of artists since he opened a gallery downtown in 1966. He moved into the mansion in the hillside Croix-Desprez neighborhood a few years later and, in addition to the gallery, built a museum that showcased many of Haiti\u2019s finest artists, including Hyppolite, Obin, Rigaud Benoit and Castera Bazile. When he retired a few years ago, Nader turned over the gallery and museum to his son John.\n\nThe elder Nader had been taking a nap with his wife when the quake struck at 4:53 p.m. \u201cWe were rescued within ten minutes because our bedroom did not collapse,\u201d he told me. What Nader saw when he was led outside was horrifying. His collection had become a hideous pile of debris with thousands of paintings and sculptures buried under giant blocks of concrete.\n\n\u201cMy life\u2019s work is gone,\u201d Nader, 78, told me by telephone from his second home in Miami, where he has been living since the quake. Nader said he never bought insurance for his collection, which the family estimated to be worth more than $20 million.\n\nWith the rainy season approaching, Nader\u2019s sons hired a dozen men to pick, shovel and jackhammer their way through the debris, looking for anything that could be salvaged.\n\n\u201cWe had 12,000 to 15,000 paintings here,\u201d Georges Nader Jr. told me as we stomped through the sprawling heap, which reminded me of a bombed-out village from a World War II documentary. \u201cWe\u2019ve recovered about 3,000 paintings and about 1,800 of those are damaged. Some other paintings were taken by looters in the first days after the earthquake.\u201d\n\nBack at his gallery in P\u00e9tionville, Nader showed me a Hyppolite still life he had recovered. I recognized it, having admired the painting in 2009 at a retrospective at the Organization of American States\u2019 Art Museum of the Americas in Washington. But the 20- by 20-inch painting was now broken into eight pieces. \u201cThis will be restored by a professional,\u201d Nader said. \u201cWe have begun restoring the most important paintings we have recovered.\u201d\n\nI heard other echoes of cautious optimism as I visited cultural sites across Port-au-Prince. A subterranean, government-run historical museum that contained some important paintings and artifacts had survived. So did a private voodoo and Ta\u00edno museum in Mariani (near the quake\u2019s epicenter) and an ethnographic collection in P\u00e9tionville. People associated with the destroyed Holy Trinity Cathedral and Centre d\u2019Art, as well as the Episcopal Church\u2019s structurally feeble Haitian Art Museum, assured me that these institutions will be rebuilt. But no one could say how or when.\n\nThe United Nations has announced that 59 countries and international organizations have pledged $9.9 billion as \u201cthe down payment Haiti needs for wholesale national renewal.\u201d But there\u2019s no word on how much of that money, if any, will ever reach the cultural sector.\n\n\u201cWe deeply believe that Haitians living abroad can help us with the funds,\u201d said Henry Jolibois, an artist and architect who is a technical consultant to the Haitian prime minister\u2019s office. \u201cFor the rest, we must convince other entities in the world to participate, such as the museums and private collectors who have huge Haitian naive painting collections.\u201d\n\nAt the Holy Trinity Cathedral 14 murals had long offered a distinctively Haitian take on biblical events. My favorite was the Marriage at Cana by Wilson Bigaud, a painter who excelled at glimpses into everyday Haitian life\u2014cockfights, market vendors, baptismal parties, rara band parades. While some European artists portrayed the biblical event at which Christ turned water into wine as being rather formal, Bigaud\u2019s Cana was a decidedly casual affair with a pig, rooster and two Haitian drummers looking on. (Bigaud died this past March 22 at age 79.)\n\n\u201cThat Marriage at Cana mural was very controversial,\u201d Haiti\u2019s Episcopal bishop, Jean Zach\u00e9 Duracin, told me in his P\u00e9tionville office. \u201cIn the \u201940s and \u201950s many Episcopalians left the church in Haiti and became Methodists because they didn\u2019t want these murals at the cathedral. They said, \u2018Why? Why is there a pig in the painting?\u2019 They didn\u2019t understand there was a part of Haitian culture in these murals.\u201d\n\nDuracin told me it took him three days to gather the emotional strength to visit Holy Trinity. \u201cThis is a great loss, not only for the Episcopal church but for art worldwide,\u201d he said.\n\nVisiting the site myself one morning, I saw two murals that were more or less intact\u2014The Baptism of Our Lord by Castera Bazile and Philom\u00e9 Obin\u2019s Last Supper. (A third mural, Native Street Procession, by Duffaut, has survived, says former Smithsonian Institution conservator Stephanie Hornbeck, but others were destroyed.)\n\nAt the Haitian Art Museum, chunks of concrete had fallen on some of the 100 paintings on exhibit. I spotted one of Duffaut\u2019s oldest, largest and finest imaginary village paintings propped against a wall. A huge piece was missing from the bottom. A museum employee told me the piece had not been found. As I left, I reminded myself that although thousands of paintings had been destroyed in Haiti, thousands of others survived, and many are outside the country in private collections and institutions, including the Waterloo Center for the Arts in Iowa and the Milwaukee Art Museum, which have important collections of Haitian art. I also took comfort from conversations I had had with artists like Duffaut, who were already looking beyond the next mountain.\n\nNo one displays Haiti\u2019s artistic resolve more than Frantz Z\u00e9phirin, a gregarious 41-year-old painter, houngan and father of 12, whose imagination is as large as his girth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky to be alive,\u201d Z\u00e9phirin told me late one afternoon in the Monnin gallery, where he was putting the finishing touches on his tenth painting since the quake. \u201cI was in a bar on the afternoon of the earthquake, having a beer. But I decided to leave the bar when people starting talking about politics. And I\u2019m glad I left. The earthquake came just one minute later, and 40 people died inside that bar.\u201d\n\nZ\u00e9phirin said he walked several hours, at times climbing over corpses, to get to his house. \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned that my stepmother and five of my cousins had died,\u201d he said. But his pregnant girlfriend was alive; so were his children.\n\n\u201cThat night, I decided I had to paint,\u201d Z\u00e9phirin said. \u201cSo I took my candle and went to my studio on the beach. I saw a lot of death on the way. I stayed up drinking beer and painting all night. I wanted to paint something for the next generation, so they can know just what I had seen.\u201d\n\nZ\u00e9phirin led me to the room in the gallery where his earthquake paintings were hung. One shows a rally by several fully clothed skeletons carrying a placard written in English: \u201cWe need shelters, clothes, condoms and more. Please help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do more paintings like these,\u201d Z\u00e9phirin said. \u201cEach day 20 ideas for paintings pass in my head, but I don\u2019t have enough hands to make all of them.\u201d (Smithsonian commissioned the artist to create the painting that appears on the cover of this magazine. It depicts the devastated island nation with grave markers, bags of aid money and birds of mythic dimensions delivering flowers and gifts, such as \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201chealth.\u201d) In March, Z\u00e9phirin accepted an invitation to show his work in Germany. And two months later, he would head to Philadelphia for a one-man show, titled \u201cArt and Resilience,\u201d at the Indigo Arts Gallery.\n\nA few miles up a mountain road from P\u00e9tionville, one of Haiti\u2019s most celebrated contemporary artists, Philippe Dodard, was preparing to bring more than a dozen earthquake-inspired paintings to Arte Am\u00e9ricas, an annual fair in Miami Beach. Dodard showed me a rather chilling black-and-white acrylic that was inspired by the memory of a friend who perished in an office building. \u201cI\u2019m calling this painting Trapped in the Dark,\u201d he said.\n\nI have no idea how Dodard, a debonair man from Haiti\u2019s elite class whose paintings and sculptures confirm his passion for his country\u2019s voodoo and Ta\u00edno cultures, had found time to paint. He told me he had lost several friends and family members in the quake, as well as the headquarters of the foundation he helped create in the mid-1990s to promote culture among Haitian youth. And he was busily involved in a project to convert a fleet of school buses\u2014donated by the neighboring Dominican Republic\u2014into mobile classrooms for displaced students.\n\nLike Z\u00e9phirin, Dodard seemed determined to work through his grief with a paintbrush in hand. \u201cHow can I continue living after one of the biggest natural disasters in the history of the world? I can\u2019t,\u201d he wrote in the inscription that would appear next to his paintings at the Miami Beach show. \u201cInstead I use art to express the deep change that I see around and inside me.\u201d\n\nFor the Haitian art community, more hopeful news was on the way. In May, the Smithsonian Institution launched an effort to help restore damaged Haitian treasures. Led by Richard Kurin, under secretary for history, art and culture, and working with private and other public organizations, the Institution established a \u201ccultural recovery center\u201d at the former headquarters of the U.N. Development Program near Port-au-Prince.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not every day at the Smithsonian that you actually get to help save a culture,\u201d Kurin says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Haiti.\u201d\n\nOn June 12, after months of preparation, conservators slipped on their gloves in the Haitian capital and got to work. \u201cToday was a very exciting day for...conservators, we got objects into the lab! Woo hoo!\u201d the Smithsonian American Art Museum\u2019s Hugh Shockey enthused on the museum\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nKurin sounded equally pumped. \u201cThe first paintings we brought in were painted by Hector Hyppolite. So we were restoring those on Sunday,\u201d he told me a week later. \u201cThen on Monday our conservator from the American Art Museum was restoring Ta\u00edno, pre-Colombian artifacts. Then on Tuesday the paper conservator was dealing with documents dating from the era of the Haitian struggle for independence. And then the next day we were literally on the scaffolding at the Episcopal cathedral, figuring out how we\u2019re going to preserve the three murals that survived.\u201d\n\nThe task undertaken by the Smithsonian and a long list of partners and supporters that includes the Haitian Ministry of Culture and Communication, the International Blue Shield, the Port-au-Prince-based foundation FOKAL and the American Institute for Conservation seemed daunting; thousands of objects need restoration.\n\nKurin said the coalition will train several dozen Haitian conservators to take over when the Smithsonian bows out in November 2011. \u201cThis will be a generation-long process in which Haitians do this themselves,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes donations from the international community will keep the project alive.\n\nAcross the United States, institutions such as the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, galleries such as Indigo Arts in Philadelphia and Haitian-Americans such as Miami-based artist Edouard Duval Carri\u00e9 were organizing sales and fund-raisers. And more Haitian artists were on the move\u2014some to a three-month residency program sponsored by a gallery in Kingston, Jamaica, others to a biennial exhibition in Dakar, Senegal.\n\nPr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut stayed in Haiti. But during an afternoon we spent together he seemed energized and, though Holy Trinity was mostly a pile of rubble, he was making plans for a new mural. \u201cAnd my mural in the new cathedral will be better than the old ones,\u201d he promised.\n\nMeanwhile, Duffaut had just finished a painting of a star he saw while sitting outside his tent one night. \u201cI\u2019m calling this painting The Star of Haiti,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, I want all of my paintings to send a message.\u201d\n\nThe painting showed one of Duffaut\u2019s imaginary villages inside a giant star that was hovering like a spaceship over the Haitian landscape. There were mountains in the painting. And people climbing. Before bidding the old master farewell, I asked him what message he wanted this painting to send.\n\n\u201cMy message is simple,\u201d he said without a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cHaiti will be back.\u201d\n\nBill Brubaker, formerly a Washington Post writer, has long followed Haitian art.

Particularly, he says, to the Haitian students who either never lived in Haiti or left long before they could remember their roots.\n\nCarol Damian, director of the Frost Art Museum at Florida International University, invited Dodard to display his work for Haitian Heritage Month. His exhibit is called \"Tradition,\" made up of large paintings and metal sculptures.\n\n\"We want people to see it and say, 'Oh, I'm coming to a Haitian show. This isn\u2019t what I expected. I expected to see small sort of naive paintings with palm trees, the beautiful landscape and the sea.\u2019 And this doesn't look like that at all,\" she says.\n\nDamian describes Dodard\u2019s art work as abstract. She says he has a \"magical way\" of transporting himself from the island and its traditions into the contemporary world.\n\n\"It's a wonderful example of the fact that Haitian art is as diverse as art anywhere,\" says Damian.\n\nDodard says his work is \"profoundly inspired from the human conditions of the Haitian people and the way they express their joy, their sorrow, their hope.\"\n\nBefore Dodard\u2019s exhibit opened, he took a walk through his display in the Frost Museum.\n\nHe stood in front of an older acrylic painting from 1996 called \"A Coeur Ouvert.\" It depicts a Haitian woman carrying a filled basket on her head. Dodard chose orange and light yellows to recreate dawn. Around 4 a.m., he often hears these women walking past his house in La Montagne Noire, or the Black Mountain.\n\n\"I believe that women in Haiti are very powerful and very strong and they carry the weight of the whole family sometimes on their shoulders,\" he says.\n\nOn the other side of the wall where the painting hangs is a metal sculpture. It\u2019s called \"In Memoriam.\" He made it for the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the United States.\n\n\"I used the tools that enslaved people used to work on the field,\" he says.\n\nOn the black metal of the tools, you can see small line markings Dodard says symbolize the whipping of enslaved people, but they also count the days of slavery.\n\n\"You see that the piece can... symbolize also the sugar cane machine,\" he says. \"When you look at this piece you can feel what they went through.\"\n\nWhen \u201cTradition\u201d opened to the public, some observers picked up on the Haitian symbols Dodard uses throughout his work.\n\n\"We memorialize dead people a lot in Haiti, so I think that's one of the ways that his paintings kinda show tribute to his culture,\" says Haitian FIU junior Phalancia Louisy.\n\nVodou symbols appear throughout Philippe Dodard's collection. So do musical representations.\n\n\"I really like what he's doing right now,\" says retired Broward professor Shirley Bayard. \"He's involving a lot of music and dances to the art.\"\n\n\"Haiti is a very beautiful country to discover, to visit and the culture is very rich there,\" says Dodard. \"And they will see that through the collection that I am presenting.\"\n\nPhilippe Dodard's \"Tradition\" will be open at the Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami, until June 29."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/philippe-dodard/", "page_content": "Philippe Dodard (born 1954) is a Haitian graphic artist and painter.
