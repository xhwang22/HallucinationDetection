At the induction ceremony of the World Golf Hall of Fame 2022, Finchem took the further step to enhance the Players Championship events, building a new clubhouse, and renovating the course in 2006.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTim was born on 19th April 1947 in Ottawa, Illinois, and is currently living in his late 50s. He went to the Princess Anne High School, Virginia, where he received his primary education. Later, he went to receive his secondary education from the University of Richmond, receiving a bachelor of arts in 1969. Finchem received his degree of law from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. He had a paper route and used to perform other off jobs.\n\nRather than spending his money on purchasing candy and other small toys, Finchem was interested since childhood to play golf. So he used to spend his money only on playing golf. Finchem was brought by Harold (father) who was a career marine and used to permit his 8 years old young child to play golf with his buddies. Finchem is one of the oldest sons born in a family of six children, including three boys and three girls.\n\nTim Finchem Career\n\nBefore coming into the field of gold administration, Tim Finchem had pursued a great career in the line of law and practice. He practiced law in Virginia Beach at the University of Virginia School of Law for at least three years. Afterward, he served his position in the White House while being under the administrative powers of Jimmy Carter. He served as the deputy advisor to the President in the office of Economic Affairs.

Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem has an opportunity to plot a good course.\n\nAnyone following the PGA Tour knows that 2007 will bring significant changes to the season\u2019s schedule. A shorter season, playoffs, and what is being called \u201cThe Quest for the Card\u201d are all a around the corner. The man steering the ship into new waters is PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem.\n\n\n\nBorn on April 19, 1947 in Ottawa, Illinois, Finchem grew up enjoying golf. In a 2003 Golf Digest interview, Finchem recalls what cured him of his golf course temper tantrums. When golfing with his dad at age 15, he hit a 5-iron thin on a par-3 and started cussing the second the ball left the clubface. He was still cussing when as it flew over the pond, kicked onto the green, and rolled into the cup. \u201cI shut up immediately,\u201d said Finchem, \u201cAnd looked over at my dad. The look he gave me was not one of congratulation. I was tremendously embarrassed and never lost my temper again.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Richmond and then the University of Virginia Law School he practiced law for three years. He went on to serve in the White House as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. After his White House job he co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group. Finchem joined the PGA Tour staff as Vice President of Business Affairs in 1987. Having taken the helm of the PGA Tour on June 1, 1994, Finchem has overseen some important years in professional golf.\n\nThe First Tee program has been one of Finchem\u2019s favorite projects. First Tee strives to involve young people in the game of golf by including them in instructional programs. It is great to have a commissioner that has put so much effort into golf for kids as this will ensure an ongoing appreciation of the game.\n\nA great deal of the Tour\u2019s success under Finchem can be credited to being in the right place at the right time. The paths of newly appointed Commissioner Tim Finchem and a certain Tiger Woods happened to meet in 1996 and Finchem cashed in. I don\u2019t mean to minimize the accomplishment of other touring professionals nor would I take away from Finchem\u2019s work, but the \u201cTiger effect\u201d took the Tour further than any one man could take it. History will be kind to Finchem as a result. Participation and interest in golf went through the roof as Woods joined the Tour. He is a commissioner\u2019s dream come true.\n\nNavigating the mine field of leadership is a daunting task for anyone. One of the gripes some viewers have had is the amount of colorful language heard televised on Tour events. When Couples, Vijay, and Woods drop an \u201cF\u201d bomb on national television Finchem squirms. So far there hasn\u2019t been much of an uproar. John Daly\u2019s use of colorful language can\u2019t be compared to Janet Jackson\u2019s theatrics at the Super Bowl. At least the FCC doesn\u2019t think so. But I digress.\n\nIf Finchem thought his job was to keep everyone happy he would have quit a long time ago. His task has been to sustain and grow the PGA Tour by using name recognition to expand audiences of PGA Tour events and PGA television. A wider television audience means more advertising which translates into increased revenues.\n\nAt a press conference on November 2nd Tim Finchem outlined several significant changes that will come to the Tour. In late October we reported that 2007 would bring a new PGA Tour and Erik Barzeski blogged Finchem\u2019s press conference just a few days later. A shorter season leading up to a late-season playoff is the first proposal. The FedEx Cup would be the culmination of the previous week\u2019s playoff series. Finally, players trying to qualify for next season\u2019s Cards would participate in \u201cThe Quest for the Card.\u201d Pretty basic.\n\nI have a couple of observations about Finchem\u2019s proposed Tour schedule. First of all, there are many questions left unanswered in the wake of his recent press conference. How the points system culminating in the FedEx Cup works is anyone\u2019s guess. What happens when a no-name wins against Tiger, Vijay, Retief, Mickelson (should he play in September), and Els at the FedEx Cup? They\u2019ll get the trophy, the $10 million first prize, and some serious bragging rights. Remember Todd Hamilton at the British Open? Yes? He did well. Remember him this year? No? Me neither. I\u2019ll conceded that Finchem and his PGA Tour minions have something up their sleeve, or will by the time the 2007 season rolls around, but we have yet to find out what that will be.\n\nThe playoffs and FedEx Cup will give PGA Tour fans a bigger event to look forward to at the end of the year. If the rumors are true and $10 million is the prize awaiting the one who comes out on top this event clearly could be worth watching. While there is no way to match the tradition surrounding The Masters, The British Open, The U.S. Open, and The PGA Championships, the FedEx Cup could become a significant event.\n\nThe majors are not going anywhere. There is so much history and hype surrounding the majors that Finchem won\u2019t touch them. If anything, the changes will give the majors more weight as they tend to get watered down a bit with a PGA Tour season that often feels like it never ends.\n\nI like the fact that we\u2019ll get to watch the pros hovering around 125th on the money list fight it out in \u201cThe Quest for the Card.\u201d This is going to give September through November more weight and punch. By the time the PGA Championship is over most fan excitement is spent and the Tour season just sputters to a close prior to the Tour Championship. Marketing \u201cThe Quest for the Card\u201d will be much easier than marketing minor events intended to help people we\u2019ve never heard about keep playing golf on the PGA Tour.\n\nA shorter season is going to be good for the PGA Tour. As much as I love to follow the Tour from January \u2019til November, the Tour will benefit by having a three month break. It\u2019ll reward players who retain their Tour Cards with a much needed break and give others the opportunity to play again the following year.\n\nThe years Finchem presides over the PGA Tour have given him the chance to make an impression on one of the world\u2019s greatest sports. His years as Commissioner have been good ones, easy in some respects, as golf has enjoyed a resurgence in the last several years. with the Tour\u2019s proposed changes, Tim Finchem has the opportunity to do his part.\n\nPhoto Credits: \u00a9 Gregory Smith/AP."}, {"url": "https://latestinbollywood.com/tim-finchem/", "page_content": "Tim Finchem Wiki:- Tim is an American lawyer along with being a former golf administrator.

The Presidents Cup gave the sport another great international competition. And the World Golf Championships created greater opportunities for international golfers to compete together beyond the majors. And the 1997 rights deal he negotiated changed the relationship between TV and golf forever as it required every round of every tournament be carried on TV.\n\n\u201cThe most impressive thing about Tim is he was a remarkable consensus builder,\u201d says Sean McManus, CBS Sports, chairman. \u201cHis relationships with the players, with the tournaments, with the sponsors, and TV networks were all first rate where everyone felt like they were getting full value.\u201d\n\nHe also spearheaded efforts to coordinate the bid for golf\u2019s return to the Olympics, which became a reality in the 2016 Games after a 112-year absence and gave NBC a chance to bring one of its most important rest-of-the-year properties to its Olympic programming schedule.\n\n\u201cTim Finchem super-charged the PGA TOUR during his tenure as commissioner by adding World Golf Championships, the Presidents Cup, and the FedEx Playoffs,\u201d says Molly Solomon, executive producer/president, NBC Olympics Production, and executive producer, Golf Channel. \u201cWhat the PGA TOUR looks like today is due in large part to his big ideas and creative leadership.\u201d\n\nAdds Tommy Roy, NBC Sports, lead golf producer, credits Finchem with allowing NBC to have more than a dozen cameras on the island green for THE PLAYERS Championship, allowing the network to capture shots from almost any angle.\n\n\u201cHe gave us the ability to put a camera six feet away from Tiger Woods when he was about to execute a magical, game winning shot,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd he also gave us the ability to put microphones three feet away from Phil Mickelson and [caddie] Bones when they were discussing the execution of a great shot.\u201d\n\nSports Broadcasting Hall of Famer Dick Ebersol says he was lucky enough to have a front row seat to Finchem\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cTim built the PGA Tour into one of the most important franchises in all of American TV sports,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, he helped oversee First Tee\u2019s growth into a great youth-development organization, reaching more than 15 million youngsters (during his tenure as commissioner, the PGA TOUR and its tournaments raised more than $2 billion in charitable contributions).\n\n\u201cTim Finchem\u2019s vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\u201d said Jay Monahan, PGA TOUR commissioner and World Golf Foundation board chairman, when Finchem was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame last year. \u201cHis enshrinement in the World Golf Hall of Fame will forever stand as a testament to his tireless dedication and contributions, but, more important, so will the countless lives \u2014 whether those are the players on the PGA TOUR and beyond, millions of First Tee participants, or charitable organizations around the world \u2014 impacted by his life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nFinchem became commissioner in 1994 when then-Commissioner Deane Beman, just 55 years old, retired to resume his playing career, this time as a member of the then-Senior PGA TOUR.\n\n\u201cMy history is one of just being in the right place at the right time,\u201d says Finchem. \u201cSo much of where you\u2019re headed is based on the individuals that you\u2019re interfacing with.\u201d\n\nFor example, prior to joining the PGA TOUR, Finchem was in the Jimmy Carter Administration, working with the president and his staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a great run with regard to being around people who are extremely successful and thoughtful and committed to making this place a better place to live,\u201d he says. \u201cI look back at all those people I met and the players that I interfaced with, and I was very, very fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d One example: he became commissioner only a few weeks before a player named Tiger Woods turned professional.\n\nAnd the beginning of the Woods era and the beginning of Finchem\u2019s tenure as commissioner coincided with a time when some of the greats of the game had retired but were still an active part of the PGA efforts.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d Finchem says, \u201cbecause I came into the PGA TOUR at a time when I had the opportunity to meet Sam Snead and Byron Nelson and all these great players and spend a fair amount of time with them. In some ways, many of those players were similar to working with the president because of their knowledge of the sport, their intensity about transferring that information to fans and to people like myself.\u201d\n\nFinchem always had a passion for golf and freely admits to using his paper-route money to support his golf habit.\n\n\u201cMy dad was in the Marine Corps for 30 years, and I started playing golf when I was 8 or 10,\u201d he says. \u201cHe took me to the Azalea Open in North Carolina; Arnold Palmer won, and I was mesmerized by him. Years later, I\u2019d call him up from time to time and say, Take me through one of your wins. He\u2019d say, Which one? and I\u2019d tell him that one.\u201d\n\nAlthough nearly half his adult life has been spent at the PGA TOUR, Finchem didn\u2019t set out to work in sports administration. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship and graduated in 1969, then received his law degree from Virginia four years later. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the Carter White House as deputy advisor to the president in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979.\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s leadership was invaluable for the growth of the game,\u201d says Sports Broadcasting Hall of Famer and CBS Sports Lead Play-by-Play Announcer Jim Nantz. \u201cHis thoughtful decision-making helped the PGA TOUR soar to incredible heights. He led his global partners in promoting and implementing a World Golf Championship series, and, here at home, he brought life to the PGA TOUR\u2019s end of the season. Lastly, Tim saw the value of nurturing and respecting his television relationships. He has been viewed by all as a great partner.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://latestinbollywood.com/tim-finchem-wife-age/", "page_content": "Tim Finchem Wife:- Tim Finchem is well recognized as an American lawyer along with being a former golf administrator.

It's just the opposite.\n\nFinchem will be remembered for ushering in the Tiger Woods era, capitalizing financially on the frenzy, and maintaining that boon through global economic crises and the downturn of Woods' career. He will be remembered for inventing a season-ending playoff system that created not only a viable conclusion but also greater monetary windfalls for his membership. He will be remembered for overseeing a transition of the tour from a pleated-pants, country-club set to a promising alternative for any athletic kid who would've previously opted for other endeavors.\n\nAll of these rivers flow into the same ocean. The greatest legacy of Finchem's career is money -- securing it for his tour, increasing it for his players, and producing more of it from various sources than ever before.\n\nTim Finchem, who soon will retire from his role as PGA Tour commissioner, addresses the media at East Lake Golf Club, site of this week's Tour Championship. Stan Badz/PGA TOUR\n\nAnd so, yes, it's fitting that his final address occurred at the FedEx hospitality venue, the name alone epitomizing the intrinsic value that the commissioner has heaped upon the tour over the past two decades.\n\nNot that he's buying any of it.\n\nWhile seated in the swanky suite off the new 18th hole sponsored by a company that will reward a lone playoff champion with $10 million later this week, Finchem took the honorable road. Asked about the greatest legacy of his tenure, he didn't mention anything about \"financial impact\" or \"economic progress\" or so many other money-related phrases he's so often repeated over the years. Instead, he pointed to his people.\n\n\"I'm proudest about the quality of our team and the interface with the players,\" he answered. \"Working with these people is just a fabulous experience. Watching their growth, the number of good people that have come to us, has been really rewarding. If you have that kind of strength, then good things happen. So I'm really comfortable with watching the transition now going forward and what's going to happen. I think some of the changes that are already being made, even before I step aside, are really, really good changes.\"\n\nAgain, it's honorable. It's also a bit misguided.\n\nLet's allow the numbers to do the talking. When Finchem took over for Deane Beman during the 1994 season, there were 44 events on the schedule. The total combined prize money was $56.4 million, with a top winner's share of $540,000. This year? With 46 events, the prize money is $320.4 million and the greatest winner's share is $1.89 million.\n\nThat's a 568 percent increase in total prize money and a 350 percent increase in the highest winning paycheck while adding just two events to the calendar.\n\nAs if to only further this point, most of this year's winners have earned more than the value of most entire tournament purses from the year Finchem became commissioner.\n\nFinchem congratulates Tigers Woods on winning the 2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. The PGA Tour cashed in on Woods' popularity and dominance during Finchem's tenure as commissioner. AP Photo/Phil Long\n\nSure, much of this is the direct correlation of Woods' rise as the game's most dominant player and one of the world's most popular athletes. But that doesn't mean marketing and selling a tour that included him was ever a foolproof proposition.\n\n\"By '98, Tiger was dominant,\" Finchem said Tuesday. \"So the questions were: How do you manage to grow the tour when your dominant player is playing 17 or 18 times and you have 46 events? How does that work? Well, between '96 and today, every one of those tournaments has grown in virtually every category almost every year. The lesson there is that fans like golf. They demonstrated that they like having a dominant player. ... [It] demonstrated that we can grow, and I think that's a good lesson for the future.\"\n\nIt's a future that soon won't include Finchem, at least not on a formal basis.\n\nHe maintained that he'll still be happy to serve as a consultant to incoming commissioner Jay Monahan, if need be. Finchem will work on his handicap, which is either a 4.3 or a 6.5, depending on which GHIN number you trust. And if you're wondering what to get for the man who has everything, he said the perfect retirement gift would be riding 18 holes in a golf cart at Latrobe Country Club alongside none other than Arnold Palmer.\n\nOther than that, Finchem can rest easy when he steps down, secure in the knowledge that he didn't just leave the PGA Tour in a better place than when he started, but he ushered it through one era and into the next, producing a level of financial stability that will endure as his lasting legacy -- even if he doesn't think so."}, {"url": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2019/05/29/pga-tour-paid-tim-finchem-10-million-bonus-money-retired/", "page_content": "While Tim Finchem stepped down as PGA Tour commissioner at the end of 2016, he still was paid more than $10 million in bonus and incentive money, according to the organization\u2019s 990 tax records for 2017.\n\nIn 2017, Finchem received $12,216,755 in compensation from the PGA Tour, according to the 990 that was made available by Pro Publica.

Finchem\u2019s base salary was reported as $906,646 and he received additional compensation of $698,946.\n\nHe also received $6.67 million in compensation from related organizations, according to the 990.\n\nFinchem, who retired in late 2016 after taking over as commissioner in 1994, is credited with bringing a financial windfall to the Tour as prize money grew to nearly $300 million during his tenure. That prize money figure did not include the majors.\n\nIn 2016, Finchem was paid $4.47 million, which included a base salary of $1.19 million and bonus pay of $3 million. He received another $4.7 million from related organizations, according to tax records. His total compensation from the Tour was $3.99 million in 2015, including bonus pay of $2.7 million. He received another $2 million from related organizations that year.\n\nThe former commissioner was by far the highest-paid person listed on the Tour\u2019s tax filings for 2017. Current commissioner Jay Monahan received total compensation of $4.78 million that included a base salary of $998,077 plus bonus and incentive pay of $2.8 million.\n\nOutside of Finchem and Monahan, there were 14 others among the Tour\u2019s officers and highest paid employees who made more than $1 million in 2017. Thomas E. Wade, the PGA Tour\u2019s chief commercial officer, received $3.1 million, according to the tax records.\n\nPlayers who earned the most prize money were listed as independent contractors. Justin Thomas, the season\u2019s FedEx Cup winner, led the way in 2017 with $17.1 million followed by Jordan Spieth ($11.8 million) and Dustin Johnson ($10.5 million).\n\nWorth W. Calfee, who is the former president of the Web.com Tour, received $1.5 million in compensation, which included a bonus of $784,293.\n\nThe PGA Tour has non-profit status that lawmakers have unsuccessfully challenged in the past. To compare the Tour to other pro sports, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made $31.7 million in 2015, the last year for which his salary was reported.\n\nIn 2017, the Tour paid $28.9 million in compensation to current officers, directors, trustees and key employees, compared to $20.5 million in 2016.\n\nTotal revenue increased to $1.47 billion, up by about 15 percent over the previous year. Total expenses also grew to $1.41 billion compared to $1.2 billion the previous year. The Tour says its organization and its tournaments generated more than $180 million in charitable donations in 2017.\n\nIn revenue, the Tour reported $458 million in TV rights, up from $433 million in 2016.

Who needs them, the detractors said, when you've got four majors and The Players?\n\nGolf in the Olympics? Ditto.\n\nThe FedEx Cup? What was wrong with the money list to determine the best players?\n\nThe First Tee? Don't we have PGA professionals to teach and grow the game?\n\nFinchem said there's only one thing to do in those situations.\n\n\"If you're in a leadership position, you do the research, involve the best and brightest from your staff and you set the goals,\" said the 74-year-old Finchem, who retired from the PGA Tour at the end of the 2016 season, following 22 years as the commissioner. \"If you've done your homework, proceeded correctly and made the right calls, they will have an impact.\"\n\nHOF MC:David Feherty will preside over World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony as Tiger Woods to be inducted\n\nGallery:World Golf Hall of Fame opens exhibit honoring Tiger Woods, Tim Finchem, Susie Maxwell Berning, Marion Hollins\n\n'He's the reason we're out here:' Tiger Woods' career takes center stage for World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony\n\nAnd Finchem, the son of a career Marine officer who built a legal and political career before getting involved in golf, will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday at the PGA Tour's Global Home because of the impact he made on multiple fronts.\n\nFinchem will join Tiger Woods, Susie Maxwell Berning and the late Marion Hollins in the induction ceremony, which will be held at 7 p.m. and aired by Golf Channel. He also joins his predecessor, Deane Beman, in going from Tour commissioner to the Hall of Fame.\n\nA player on the Tour's policy board famously told Finchem that Beman had left him with a high-powered luxury car when he retired in 1994.\n\n\"All you need to do is keep it filled with high-test,\" the player said.\n\nFinchem did more than that. Under his direction, the Tour's total purses jumped from less than $60 million per year in 1994 to more than $250 million by 2006. The World Golf Championships and the FedEx Cup playoffs ensured the best players in the world would be on the same golf course the same week more often. And he took further steps to enhance The Players Championship, renovating the course in 2006, building the new clubhouse and bumping the purse to keep it the most lucrative in golf.\n\nThere are even critics of the success the Tour had under Finchem. Tiger Woods, they say, should get the bulk of the credit after he burst on the scene and went on to win 15 majors, two Players and 82 Tour titles, transforming the game of golf into a more athletic pursuit open to anyone of any race or background who could shoot the scores.\n\nFinchem will never deny that Woods being the game's top player for 20 of his 22 years as the commissioner was a huge factor, especially on the three new TV deals that were negotiated on Finchem's watch.\n\nBut Finchem had the foresight and business acumen to take advantage of Woods' dominance, such as involving Woods and his father Earl heavily in the launching of The First Tee, the World Golf Foundation's initiative to make golf more accessible and affordable to youth in at-risk areas and situations.\n\nThe First Tee is celebrating its 25th year with 150 worldwide chapters, 10,000 schools in its program to make golf part of a P.E. curriculum and more than 3 million kids reached per year through golf and its Life Skills and educational programs.\n\n\"There's no question about his impact,\" Finchem said of Woods. \"And there's no question that going forward, Tiger will have even more of an impact if he wants to be involved and show leadership more than he already has. His presence in anything related to golf is incredibly strong.\"\n\nFinchem was asked jokingly two years ago what the sport would have looked like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a much more difficult job,\u201d he admitted.\n\nFinchem expanded the international reach of the Tour through the WGC events, the Presidents Cup, developmental tours in China, South American and Canada, taking Tour events to Mexico, Japan, Korea and China, and finally throwing the weight of the Tour and the World Golf Foundation behind the drive to return golf to the Olympics.\n\nFinchem said the secret to success is never admitting that you\u2019ve been as successful as you\u2019re going to get.\n\n\"You always ask yourself, 'is there a better way for this to work?'\" Finchem said. \"Asking that question has resulted in hard work at organizing and working together with various organizations in golf and our international activity in golf. The more we focused on that, the more we learned, and the more we learned the more effective we were.\"\n\nFinchem, who graduated from the University of Richmond in 1969 (he had a debate scholarship) and got his law degree from Virginia, had a practice in Virginia Beach and got involved in local politics, moving quickly to the national scene when he worked President Jimmy Carter's campaign in 1976, then served on President Carter's Office of Economic Affairs.\n\nFinchem was later the national campaign chairman for Walter Mondale when he ran against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nHe started at the PGA Tour as the vice-president of business affairs and quickly climbed the ladder to be Beman's successor, serving as chief operating officer of the Tour and then deputy commissioner.\n\n\"He was the right guy at the right time,\" Beman said. \"He was always there to back up and do the things that needed to be done. He was a good administrator and understood the legal issues ... very adept at analyzing everything from every side.\"\n\nMonahan said Tiger Woods provided the punch. Finchem maximized it.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" Monahan said when it was announced in March of 2020 that Finchem would enter the Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-finchem-idCAKBN22229R", "page_content": "FILE PHOTO: PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem attends a news conference during the 2015 Presidents Cup golf tournament in Incheon, South Korea, October 10, 2015.
