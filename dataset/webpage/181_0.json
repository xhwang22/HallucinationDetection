My concentration, of course, was on lyric singing, classical music, mostly European music.\n\nAmong Ithamara's accompanists are guitarist John McLaughlin (on \"Man Alone,\" his first recording backing a vocalist), Azymuth (\"Love Dance\"), Marcos Valle (a duet performance of his composition \"Flame\"), and Gonzalo Rubalcaba (offering piano backing on \"La Puerta\" and Jobim's \"Amparo\"). Other tunes are Jobim's \"Ligia,\" \"Someday,\" \"Blauauge,\" and \"I Loved You\" (composed by the brilliant arranger Claus Ogerman).\n\nFor this new album--inspired by Mark Murphy's 1988 Milestone session September Ballads--Koorax and her producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro assembled a phenomenal international cast as well as a challenging, inspiring repertoire. Singing in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Koorax has chosen unexpected beauties from Brazilian masters including Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonfa, Marcos Valle, and Ivan Lins; from Claus Ogerman and pianist Jurgen Friedrich; and even Vernon Duke (a tender reading of \"April in Paris,\" recorded as a duet with Bonfa just a few months before his death).\n\nIthamara's extraordinary follow-up CD, Love Dance: The Ballad Album, will certainly establish her artistry in the most convincing possible terms. It was just voted #5 Best Beyond Album in the 2003 Down Beat Readers Poll, behind only the latest discs by Norah Jones, Steely Dan, Radiohead and The Roots. Love Dance was also acclaimed as one of the Top 10 Vocal Albums for 2003, by the critics of the prestigious The Independent Weekly.\n\nBack in 2000, Ithamara was voted for the first time one of the world's best jazz singers by Down Beat, also appearing as #3 Best Beyond Artist, behind only Sting and Carlos Santana, and ahead of such heavyweights as Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder and Joni Mitchell. Serenade In Blue (featuring Deodato, Jay Berliner, Azymuth, Dom Um Romao, Kevin Jasper, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Nelson Angelo) was voted #7 Best Beyond Album in that same 2000 Down Beat Readers Poll.\n\nAlthough Rio de Janeiro-based vocalist Ithamara Koorax has long been established as a recording artist in her native Brazil as well as in Europe and Japan, it wasn't until 2000 that American listeners were introduced to her unique vocal stylings on Milestone's Serenade in Blue. That release helped position her for a 4th-place finish in the Female Singer category--behind Cassandra Wilson, Diana Krall, and Dianne Reeves--in the 2002 Down Beat Readers Poll.\n\n\"But when I was around 18 or 19, I started earning money by singing ad jingles and doing backup vocals for many Brazilian pop stars. I realized then I wanted to do something else. I had become familiar with singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Elis Regina. But the most important influences on my singing were Elizeth Cardoso [the uncredited singer in the original Black Orpheus soundtrack], Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn, and Flora Purim.\"\n\nKoorax's reputation as a controlled and expressive vocalist spread quickly and her voice became a very hot commodity in studios all over Rio. Her first solo recording \"Iluminada\" launched her into the limelight when the song was included as the theme for one of Brazil's popular novelas (soap operas). The soundtrack went platinum and her career never looked back.\n\nIthamara soon began performing with the likes of Hermeto Pascoal, Edu Lobo, Azymuth, and Martinho da Vila, and returned several times to the hit parades with more novela theme songs. (In Brazil, everything stops for the evening soaps whose soundtracks become instant hits because of the hammering TV exposure. Inclusion in a novela is a very prestigious gig.)\n\nDescribing this emerging new voice, one of Brazil's top popular music critics, Tarik de Souza, wrote: \"Possessing a rare vocal range, Ithamara... exercises her well-crafted instrument in stylistic schools that run from Barbra Streisand and Johnny Mathis to Elis Regina, Yma Sumac, and Elizeth Cardoso. But she does so in her own way, alternating delicate intimacy with heated passion... a dazzling, heady lesson in vocal techniques.\"\n\nThen her fame spread halfway around the world. \"In 1991 the novelas had given me so much exposure,\" Itha recalls, \"even tourists were crowding my gigs. A Japanese impresario heard me one night and invited me to do a tour of Japan. I didn't even have a record there yet. Later I did three more tours and now I am considered one of the four top jazz singers by Japanese critics!\" That same year, in May 1991, she took part in an all-star session alongside Art Farmer, Eddie Gomez, Jack DeJohnette, and Gil Goldstein, produced in New York by Creed Taylor (CTI) but never released in this country.\n\nHer debut solo album, Luiza (Live in Rio), won the Brazilian version of the Grammy: the 1994 Sharp Award for Best New Artist. The CDs she eventually released in Japan, including Luiza (1994), Rio Vermelho (1995, which, by the way, included Jobim's last recorded performance), and Almost in Love/Ithamara Koorax Sings the Luiz Bonfa Songbook (1996, featuring Bonfa, Ron Carter, Larry Coryell, Sadao Watanabe, and Eumir Deodato), have all been prominently recognized on Japanese best-seller and best-of lists.\n\nIn testimony to Ithamara's talent, composer and guitar legend Bonf remarked, \"It's an honor and a privilege to work with such a great artist as Ithamara, one of the best singers in the world.\" Jobim himself referred to her as \"simply one of the best singers on the scene.\"\n\nOn another front, her acid-jazz version of the Jo?o Donato/Caetano Veloso tune, \"The Frog,\" became a dancefloor hit in Europe in 1994, anticipating later collaborations with Dom Um Romeo (formerly with Sergio Mendes, Frank Sinatra, and Weather Report, among others), including an appearance on Rom?o's much-acclaimed albums Rhythm Traveller (1998), Lake of Perseverance (2000) and Nu Jazz Meets Brasil (2002), as well as on Brazil All-Stars' Rio Strut (2003) for Milestone Records.\n\nLater that same year, in an able display of her versatility, she recorded the first Brazilian album in the drum 'n' bass genre, Bossa Nova Meets Drum 'n' Bass, and participated in a recording of works by Brazilian classical composer Hekel Tavares.\n\nIthamara's Milestone CDs--both the new Love Dance and its predecessor Serenade in Blue--grew out of her desire to be known, not as a Brazilian singer of Brazilian music, but \"as a singer--period.\"\n\nLove Dance is a very personal record in which the musicians made deeply personal contributions, as composers and accompanists, to their friend and colleague Ithamara, who turned in some of her most affecting performances to date. It's a stunning effort from a uniquely gifted artist. Brazil Show less"}, {"url": "https://www.allaboutjazz.com/news/interview-ithamara-koorax-part-1/", "page_content": "In 1958, the bossa nova began to expand beyond Brazil and attract international attention, particularly in the U.S. While jazz artists here began adapting the Brazilian folk beat in the 1950s and early 1960s, the bossa nova didn't become a bona fide sensation until the release of Getz/Gilberto in 1964. On that album, Stan Getz was joined by two bossa nova stars, pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim and guitarist Joao Gilberto. Today, of the pair, only Gilberto survives. So last year, when Brazilian singer Ithamara Koorax was contemplating her next CD, she decided to pay tribute to Gilberto, whose debut album was released in 1959.\n\nBim Bom: The Complete Joao Gilberto Songbook is Ithamara's 11th solo release and the result of her life-long affection for the composer's hushed melodies and beat. If you're unfamiliar with Ithamara, she is a throwback to the days of graceful and poised Brazilian singers, when conveying passion and vulnerability mattered most of all. Ithamara's voice has the girlish breathlessness of early bossa nova singers but also the brash confidence and stamina that today's modern vocal style demands.\n\nIn Part 1 of my two-part interview with Ithamara, 44, the Brazilian singer talks about Joao Gilberto's importance, why the guitarist did not record on her tribute album, why she chose to record with guitarist Juarez Moreira, and the process she uses to learn songs before singing them:\n\nJazzWax: Why did you decide to record an album of Joao Gilberto's compositions?\n\nIthamara Koorax: Guitarist Joao Gilberto [pictured] is the most important living legend on the Brazilian music scene. Along with pianist Joao Donato, he's the last living genius of the bossa nova era. So, after recording with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonf, Dom Um Romao and Joao Donato, I felt it was only natural that I turn to Gilberto in terms of a tribute album. I grew up listening to Gilberto's recordings, including the album Cano do Amor Demais by singer Elizete Cardoso. The 1958 LP featured the single Chega de Saudade, now known as No More Blues. Gilberto played the new rhythmic beat behind her, and the single is considered the first pure bossa nova recording.\n\nJW: Why is Gilberto called the \u0093Bossa Nova Pope?\"\n\nIK: Because he was the one who invented the style. Of course there were others who inspired him, like Luiz Bonfa and Garoto, another great guitarist who is still little known outside Brazil. But Gilberto [pictured] was the one who developed the bossa nova beat on the guitar. My producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro played me a few Joao Donato recordings from the mid-50s on which you can hear a very similar beat played by the pianist on the accordion. Nevertheless, Gilberto was the one who mixed all the elements together--the rhythmic guitar beat, the soft singing style and the complex harmonies. It's that mix that became known as the bossa nova.\n\nJW: How does Gilberto differ from other great Brazilian composers?\n\nIK: I don't feel I'm able to translate his whole creative concept into words. But it's something magical that transcends music. The way his harmonies move and the way he develops his harmonic changes--they remain unmatched.\n\nJW: And yet you covered all of his compositions in your new CD.\n\nIK: Yes, Gilberto wrote only 11 songs--at least the only compositions that he and other artists have recorded. I decided to put all of them together on one CD. Of course I know that Gilberto has created some other pieces, some pretty tunes that he calls \u0093guitar miniatures.\" But he says they are \u0093unfinished business\" and would never allow me or anyone else to record them. He is an obsessive perfectionist, and he considers such unrecorded songs as mere sketches, not finished songs.\n\nJW: Why do you think Gilberto hasn't recorded more of his own compositions?\n\nIK: Gilberto is such a creative interpreter that he winds up becoming an unofficial \u0093co-author\" of any song he chooses to sing and record. He says that's the reason he never felt compelled to write hundreds of songs. He has always said he knows hundreds of great songs that already exist that he's satisfied trying to improve or re-do in his own style. [Pictured: Gilberto with his then wife Astrud Gilberto]\n\nJW: For example?\n\nIK: Look what he did with Estate, an Italian pop song recorded by Bruno Martino in 1960. Before Gilberto's interpretation of the song on his album Amoroso in 1977, nobody knew the song in the U.S. The song wasn't even popular in Italy, where it originated. Joao turned it into a universal jazz standard. Which is proof that he performs musical miracles [laughs].\n\nJW: What's the origin of Gilberto's song Bim Bom, the title track of your new album?\n\nIK: The song was first recorded in 1958 as the B-side of a 78-rpm single that featured Antonio Carlos Jobim's Chega de Saudade (also now known as No More Blues) on the A-side. Chega de Saudade was a hit and remains beautiful. But Bim Bom was much more intriguing and modern, and ahead of its time. At the time, most people other than musicians didn't pay much attention to it. They couldn't understand such a strange song. Another wonderful tune by Gilberto, Voce Esteve Com Meu Bem, was composed in 1953 and still sounds unbelievably modern.\n\nJW: Did you use song sheets or other artists' recordings to learn the melodies for your new album?\n\nIK: For half of the material I turned to Claus Ogerman's piano parts from a recording Joao Donato made with Claus in 1965 called The New Sound of Brazil. The songs, Forgotten Places and Glass Beads were co-written by Gilberto and Donato specifically for that album. So I made copies of the lead sheets and gave them to the great Brazilian guitarist Juarez Moreira, who adapted them for voice and guitar on Bim Bom.\n\nJW: When did you and guitarist Moreira meet?\n\nIK: We met a few years ago. In addition to being a fantastic musician, Juarez also is a huge fan of Gilberto. He told me he grew up listening to his father's Gilberto recordings. He learned most of them by ear when he was in his teens.\n\nJW: You've sung a few of Gilberto's songs before.\n\nIK: Oh, yes, of course. I sang Ho-Ba-La-La on my debut gig as a professional singer in January 1990 at a place called Rio Jazz Club. Since then it has become part of my repertoire in performances. But I had never recorded it before. As for Minha Saudade, I've recorded it on two different albums that were popular in Japan and in Europe. One is Wave 2001, an acid-jazz session recorded in Tokyo in 1996, and the other is Bossa Nova Meets Drum 'n' Bass, an electronic project for the jazz dance-floor market recorded in New York in 1998. But both sound very different from my new acoustic reading.\n\nJW: Your singing approach on Gilberto's songs is mostly wordless. Is that because his songs don't have lyrics?\n\nIK: Yes, exactly. But some of them, like Undiu appear as though they have lyrics because of the movement of the sounds. I repeat the same word Undiu throughout the track, and each time the word sounds different. Take a listen and I'm sure you'll hear what I mean. I felt in a kind of hypnotic trance while recording that tune. There's a very special and strong energy there, a very subtle Eastern influence.\n\nJW: Was there ever a plan to invite Gilberto to record this tribute album with you?\n\nIK: I can't deny that I dreamed of recording with him, although not specifically on this album. My producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro [pictured] has been friends with Gilberto for about 30 years. They have worked together on various projects. But I never wanted to take advantage of their professional relationship. Then when I met Juarez, I felt that diving into Gilbert's songbook with a guitarist as sensitive as Juarez would be fun and challenging.\n\nJW: Is Gilberto intimidating?\n\nIK: He doesn't like to do collaborations. Most of his recent albums are solo projects. He currently performs only solo concerts. Even on his albums Amoroso [1977], Brazil [1980] and Joo [1991], which were orchestrated respectively by Claus Ogerman, Johnny Mandel and Clare Fischer, Gilberto recorded his guitar and vocal tracks alone. Then the tapes were sent to the arrangers who added the rhythm sections and later overdubbed the orchestral parts.\n\nJW: Gilberto is quite a mysterious personality.\n\nIK: I know some of the guys who recorded on all of these album projects, and they said it was bizarre and frustrating that they never had an opportunity to meet Gilberto in person, not even at the studio. That's how Gilberto likes to work, which is very different from the way I like to interact with the musicians on my recording dates.\n\nJW: What did Gilberto say when you told him you were going to sing his songs on a tribute album?\n\nIK: Oh, it's a secret [laughs].\n\nJW: Come on!\n\nIK: If you knew Gilberto, you would understand. He's highly eccentric and one of the most exotic, shy and low-profile musicians ever. He even refused to perform on his daughter Bebel's albums.\n\nJW: Really?\n\nIK: Decades ago, when Bebel was a child, he sometimes invited her to perform with him during his concerts. But after she started a solo career, it never happened again, and he never recorded on any of her albums.\n\nJW: So what was his reaction to your project?\n\nIK: When Arnaldo told him that we were planning to record the album, Arnaldo said Gilberto smiled and said, \u0093Nobody will be interested in releasing a Joao Gilberto songbook.\" Don't ask me why the great Gilberto thought that [laughs].\n\nJW: What do you feel when you're singing one of Gilberto's songs?\n\nIK: Here's my creative process for any song: I listen to the original recording until I absorb all the elements. Then I start singing the song alone, a cappella, in my home studio. I do this for hours and hours. Sometimes I practice a tune for months. When I feel I have forgotten all that I have learned, I know I'm ready to sing the song live or record it.\n\nWhy?I have to ensure that I will not feel hesitation or fear, which will paralyze me. Nothing can compromise the free flow of passion and feelings when I sing.\n\nTomorrow Ithamara talks about singing with guitarist Juarez Moreira on her new album, working with bossa nova legends Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfa on previous projects, the biggest hurdles she faced when singing Joao Gilberto's songs, and the U.S. charity to which all Bim Bom proceeds are being donated.\n\n\n\nJazzWax tracks: Ithamara Koorax's Bim Bom: The Complete Joao Gilberto Songbook is a sensual bossa nova album and her finest CD to date. Ithamara's charm and optimism are irrepressible and a perfect fit for Gilberto's spare, smoldering melodies. What's more, Ithamara is joined here only by guitarist Juarez Moreira, who brings enormous technique and tenderness to the Gilberto canon. Together, they patiently tease out the beauty of Gilberto's simplicity in warm, shimmering lines. Bim Bom is available at iTunes and at Amazon here.\n\nAnother album by Ithamara with similar tenderness is Obrigado Dom Um Romao (2007). It's available at iTunes and Amazon here. By contrast, Brazilian Butterfly (2006) will give you a taste of Ithamara's stronger vocal style. It's available at iTunes.\n\nJazzWax clip: Here's Joao Gilberto's original recording of Bim Bom in 1958..."}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Ithamara%20Koorax", "page_content": "ArtistInfo App\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nArtistInfo for iOS and ArtistInfo for Mac are presenting musicians, composers and producers that are envolved in the musical work that you are listening to in Apple Music, iTunes, or Spotify.

That release helped position her for a 4th-place finish in the Female Singer category--behind Cassandra Wilson, Diana Krall, and Dianne Reeves--in the 2002 Down Beat Readers Poll.\n\nBack in 2000, Ithamara was voted for the first time one of the world's best jazz singers by Down Beat, also appearing as # 3 Best Beyond Artist, behind only Sting and Carlos Santana, and ahead of such heavyweights as Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder and Joni Mitchell. Serenade In Blue (featuring Deodato, Jay Berliner, Azymuth, Dom Um Romao, Kevin Jasper, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Nelson Angelo) was voted # 7 Best Beyond Album in that same 2000 Down Beat Readers Poll.\n\nIthamara's extraordinary follow-up CD, Love Dance: The Ballad Album, will certainly establish her artistry in the most convincing possible terms. It was just voted # 5 Best Beyond Album in the 2003 Down Beat Readers Poll, behind only discs by Norah Jones, Steely Dan, Radiohead and The Roots. Love Dance was also acclaimed as one of the Top 10 Vocal Albums for 2003, by the critics of the prestigious The Independent Weekly magazine.\n\nFor this new album--inspired by Mark Murphy's 1988 Milestone session September Ballads--Koorax and her producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro assembled a phenomenal international cast as well as a challenging, inspiring repertoire. Singing in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Koorax has chosen unexpected beauties from Brazilian masters including Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonf\u00e1, Marcos Valle, and Ivan Lins; from Claus Ogerman and pianist Jurgen Friedrich; and even Vernon Duke (a tender reading of \"April in Paris,\" recorded as a duet with Bonf just a few months before his death).\n\nAmong Ithamara's accompanists are guitarist John McLaughlin (on \"Man Alone,\" his first recording backing a vocalist), Azymuth (\"Love Dance\"), Marcos Valle (a duet performance of his composition \"Flame\"), and Gonzalo Rubalcaba (offering piano backing on \"La Puerta\" and Jobim's \"Amparo\"). Other tunes are Jobim's \"Ligia,\" \"Someday,\" \"Blauauge,\" and \"I Loved You\" (composed by the brilliant arranger Claus Ogerman).\n\nIthamara Koorax (pronounced ee-tah-MAH-rah KOH-rax) is a native of Rio de Janeiro, where she still resides. \"My family, Polish Jews, fled Europe during the second World War,\" the 37-year-old vocalist explains. \"I started to study singing and classical piano when I was very young, just five years old. My concentration, of course, was on lyric singing, classical music, mostly European music.\n\n\"But when I was around 18 or 19, I started earning money by singing ad jingles and doing backup vocals for many Brazilian pop stars. I realized then I wanted to do something else. I had become familiar with singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Elis Regina. But the most important influences on my singing were Elizeth Cardoso [the uncredited singer in the original Black Orpheus soundtrack], Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn, and Flora Purim.\"\n\nKoorax's reputation as a controlled and expressive vocalist spread quickly and her voice became a very hot commodity in studios all over Rio. Her first solo recording \"Iluminada\" launched her into the limelight when the song was included as the theme for one of Brazil's popular novelas (soap operas). The soundtrack went platinum and her career never looked back.\n\nIthamara soon began performing with the likes of Hermeto Pascoal, Edu Lobo, Azymuth, and Martinho da Vila, and returned several times to the hit parades with more novela theme songs. (In Brazil, everything stops for the evening soaps whose soundtracks become instant hits because of the hammering TV exposure. Inclusion in a novela is a very prestigious gig.)\n\nDescribing this emerging new voice, one of Brazil's top popular music critics, Tarik de Souza, wrote: \"Possessing a rare vocal range, Ithamara. . . exercises her well-crafted instrument in stylistic schools that run from Barbra Streisand and Johnny Mathis to Elis Regina, Yma Sumac, and Elizeth Cardoso. But she does so in her own way, alternating delicate intimacy with heated passion. . . a dazzling, heady lesson in vocal techniques.\"\n\nThen her fame spread halfway around the world. \"In 1991 the novelas had given me so much exposure,\" Itha recalls, \"even tourists were crowding my gigs. A Japanese impresario heard me one night and invited me to do a tour of Japan. I didn't even have a record there yet. Later I did three more tours and now I am considered one of the four top jazz singers by Japanese critics!\" That same year, in May 1991, she took part in an all-star session alongside Art Farmer, Eddie Gomez, Jack DeJohnette, and Gil Goldstein, produced in New York by Creed Taylor (CTI) but never released in this country.\n\nHer debut solo album, Luiza (Live in Rio), won the Brazilian version of the Grammy: the 1994 Sharp Award for Best New Artist. The CDs she eventually released in Japan, including Luiza (1994), Rio Vermelho (1995, which, by the way, included Jobim's last recorded performance), and Almost in Love/Ithamara Koorax Sings the Luiz Bonf\u00e1 Songbook (1996, featuring Bonf\u00e1, Ron Carter, Larry Coryell, Sadao Watanabe, and Eumir Deodato), have all been prominently recognized on Japanese best-seller and best-of lists.\n\nIn testimony to Ithamara's talent, composer and guitar legend Bonf remarked, \"It's an honor and a privilege to work with such a great artist as Ithamara, one of the best singers in the world.\" Jobim himself referred to her as \"simply one of the best singers on the scene.\"\n\nOn another front, her acid-jazz version of the Jo\u00e3o Donato/Caetano Veloso tune, \"The Frog,\" became a dancefloor hit in Europe in 1994, anticipating later collaborations with Dom Um Rom\u00e3o (formerly with Sergio Mendes, Frank Sinatra, and Weather Report, among others), including an appearance on Rom\u00e3o's much-acclaimed albums Rhythm Traveller (1998), Lake of Perseverance (2000) and Nu Jazz Meets Brasil (2002), as well as on Brazil All-Stars' Rio Strut (2003) for Milestone Records.\n\nLater that same year, in an able display of her versatility, she recorded the first Brazilian album in the drum 'n' bass genre, Bossa Nova Meets Drum 'n' Bass, and participated in a recording of works by Brazilian classical composer Hekel Tavares.\n\nIthamara's Milestone CDs--both the new Love Dance and its predecessor Serenade in Blue--grew out of her desire to be known, not as a Brazilian singer of Brazilian music, but \"as a singer--period.\"\n\nLove Dance is a very personal record in which the musicians made deeply personal contributions, as composers and accompanists, to their friend and colleague Ithamara, who turned in some of her most affecting performances to date.

On that album, Stan Getz was joined by two bossa nova stars, pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim and guitarist Joao Gilberto. Today, of the pair, only Gilberto survives. So last year, when Brazilian singer Ithamara Koorax was contemplating her next CD, she decided to pay tribute to Gilberto, whose debut album was released in 1959.\n\nBim Bom: The Complete Joao Gilberto Songbook is Ithamara's 11th solo release and the result of her life-long affection for the composer's hushed melodies and beat. If you're unfamiliar with Ithamara, she is a throwback to the days of graceful and poised Brazilian singers, when conveying passion and vulnerability mattered most of all. Ithamara's voice has the girlish breathlessness of early bossa nova singers but also the brash confidence and stamina that today's modern vocal style demands.\n\nIn Part 1 of my two-part interview with Ithamara, 44, the Brazilian singer talks about Joao Gilberto's importance, why the guitarist did not record on her tribute album, why she chose to record with guitarist Juarez Moreira, and the process she uses to learn songs before singing them:\n\nJazzWax: Why did you decide to record an album of Joao Gilberto's compositions?\n\nIthamara Koorax: Guitarist Joao Gilberto [pictured] is the most important living legend on the Brazilian music scene. Along with pianist Joao Donato, he's the last living genius of the bossa nova era. So, after recording with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonf, Dom Um Romao and Joao Donato, I felt it was only natural that I turn to Gilberto in terms of a tribute album. I grew up listening to Gilberto's recordings, including the album Cano do Amor Demais by singer Elizete Cardoso. The 1958 LP featured the single Chega de Saudade, now known as No More Blues. Gilberto played the new rhythmic beat behind her, and the single is considered the first pure bossa nova recording.\n\nJW: Why is Gilberto called the \u0093Bossa Nova Pope?\"\n\nIK: Because he was the one who invented the style. Of course there were others who inspired him, like Luiz Bonfa and Garoto, another great guitarist who is still little known outside Brazil. But Gilberto [pictured] was the one who developed the bossa nova beat on the guitar. My producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro played me a few Joao Donato recordings from the mid-50s on which you can hear a very similar beat played by the pianist on the accordion. Nevertheless, Gilberto was the one who mixed all the elements together--the rhythmic guitar beat, the soft singing style and the complex harmonies. It's that mix that became known as the bossa nova.\n\nJW: How does Gilberto differ from other great Brazilian composers?\n\nIK: I don't feel I'm able to translate his whole creative concept into words. But it's something magical that transcends music. The way his harmonies move and the way he develops his harmonic changes--they remain unmatched.\n\nJW: And yet you covered all of his compositions in your new CD.\n\nIK: Yes, Gilberto wrote only 11 songs--at least the only compositions that he and other artists have recorded. I decided to put all of them together on one CD. Of course I know that Gilberto has created some other pieces, some pretty tunes that he calls \u0093guitar miniatures.\" But he says they are \u0093unfinished business\" and would never allow me or anyone else to record them. He is an obsessive perfectionist, and he considers such unrecorded songs as mere sketches, not finished songs.\n\nJW: Why do you think Gilberto hasn't recorded more of his own compositions?\n\nIK: Gilberto is such a creative interpreter that he winds up becoming an unofficial \u0093co-author\" of any song he chooses to sing and record. He says that's the reason he never felt compelled to write hundreds of songs. He has always said he knows hundreds of great songs that already exist that he's satisfied trying to improve or re-do in his own style. [Pictured: Gilberto with his then wife Astrud Gilberto]\n\nJW: For example?\n\nIK: Look what he did with Estate, an Italian pop song recorded by Bruno Martino in 1960. Before Gilberto's interpretation of the song on his album Amoroso in 1977, nobody knew the song in the U.S. The song wasn't even popular in Italy, where it originated. Joao turned it into a universal jazz standard. Which is proof that he performs musical miracles [laughs].\n\nJW: What's the origin of Gilberto's song Bim Bom, the title track of your new album?\n\nIK: The song was first recorded in 1958 as the B-side of a 78-rpm single that featured Antonio Carlos Jobim's Chega de Saudade (also now known as No More Blues) on the A-side. Chega de Saudade was a hit and remains beautiful. But Bim Bom was much more intriguing and modern, and ahead of its time. At the time, most people other than musicians didn't pay much attention to it. They couldn't understand such a strange song. Another wonderful tune by Gilberto, Voce Esteve Com Meu Bem, was composed in 1953 and still sounds unbelievably modern.\n\nJW: Did you use song sheets or other artists' recordings to learn the melodies for your new album?\n\nIK: For half of the material I turned to Claus Ogerman's piano parts from a recording Joao Donato made with Claus in 1965 called The New Sound of Brazil. The songs, Forgotten Places and Glass Beads were co-written by Gilberto and Donato specifically for that album. So I made copies of the lead sheets and gave them to the great Brazilian guitarist Juarez Moreira, who adapted them for voice and guitar on Bim Bom.\n\nJW: When did you and guitarist Moreira meet?\n\nIK: We met a few years ago. In addition to being a fantastic musician, Juarez also is a huge fan of Gilberto. He told me he grew up listening to his father's Gilberto recordings. He learned most of them by ear when he was in his teens.\n\nJW: You've sung a few of Gilberto's songs before.\n\nIK: Oh, yes, of course. I sang Ho-Ba-La-La on my debut gig as a professional singer in January 1990 at a place called Rio Jazz Club. Since then it has become part of my repertoire in performances. But I had never recorded it before. As for Minha Saudade, I've recorded it on two different albums that were popular in Japan and in Europe. One is Wave 2001, an acid-jazz session recorded in Tokyo in 1996, and the other is Bossa Nova Meets Drum 'n' Bass, an electronic project for the jazz dance-floor market recorded in New York in 1998. But both sound very different from my new acoustic reading.\n\nJW: Your singing approach on Gilberto's songs is mostly wordless. Is that because his songs don't have lyrics?\n\nIK: Yes, exactly. But some of them, like Undiu appear as though they have lyrics because of the movement of the sounds. I repeat the same word Undiu throughout the track, and each time the word sounds different. Take a listen and I'm sure you'll hear what I mean. I felt in a kind of hypnotic trance while recording that tune. There's a very special and strong energy there, a very subtle Eastern influence.\n\nJW: Was there ever a plan to invite Gilberto to record this tribute album with you?\n\nIK: I can't deny that I dreamed of recording with him, although not specifically on this album. My producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro [pictured] has been friends with Gilberto for about 30 years. They have worked together on various projects. But I never wanted to take advantage of their professional relationship. Then when I met Juarez, I felt that diving into Gilbert's songbook with a guitarist as sensitive as Juarez would be fun and challenging.\n\nJW: Is Gilberto intimidating?\n\nIK: He doesn't like to do collaborations. Most of his recent albums are solo projects. He currently performs only solo concerts. Even on his albums Amoroso [1977], Brazil [1980] and Joo [1991], which were orchestrated respectively by Claus Ogerman, Johnny Mandel and Clare Fischer, Gilberto recorded his guitar and vocal tracks alone. Then the tapes were sent to the arrangers who added the rhythm sections and later overdubbed the orchestral parts.\n\nJW: Gilberto is quite a mysterious personality.\n\nIK: I know some of the guys who recorded on all of these album projects, and they said it was bizarre and frustrating that they never had an opportunity to meet Gilberto in person, not even at the studio. That's how Gilberto likes to work, which is very different from the way I like to interact with the musicians on my recording dates.\n\nJW: What did Gilberto say when you told him you were going to sing his songs on a tribute album?\n\nIK: Oh, it's a secret [laughs].\n\nJW: Come on!\n\nIK: If you knew Gilberto, you would understand. He's highly eccentric and one of the most exotic, shy and low-profile musicians ever. He even refused to perform on his daughter Bebel's albums.\n\nJW: Really?\n\nIK: Decades ago, when Bebel was a child, he sometimes invited her to perform with him during his concerts. But after she started a solo career, it never happened again, and he never recorded on any of her albums.\n\nJW: So what was his reaction to your project?\n\nIK: When Arnaldo told him that we were planning to record the album, Arnaldo said Gilberto smiled and said, \u0093Nobody will be interested in releasing a Joao Gilberto songbook.\" Don't ask me why the great Gilberto thought that [laughs].\n\nJW: What do you feel when you're singing one of Gilberto's songs?\n\nIK: Here's my creative process for any song: I listen to the original recording until I absorb all the elements. Then I start singing the song alone, a cappella, in my home studio. I do this for hours and hours. Sometimes I practice a tune for months. When I feel I have forgotten all that I have learned, I know I'm ready to sing the song live or record it.\n\nWhy?I have to ensure that I will not feel hesitation or fear, which will paralyze me. Nothing can compromise the free flow of passion and feelings when I sing.\n\nTomorrow Ithamara talks about singing with guitarist Juarez Moreira on her new album, working with bossa nova legends Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfa on previous projects, the biggest hurdles she faced when singing Joao Gilberto's songs, and the U.S. charity to which all Bim Bom proceeds are being donated.\n\n\n\nJazzWax tracks: Ithamara Koorax's Bim Bom: The Complete Joao Gilberto Songbook is a sensual bossa nova album and her finest CD to date. Ithamara's charm and optimism are irrepressible and a perfect fit for Gilberto's spare, smoldering melodies. What's more, Ithamara is joined here only by guitarist Juarez Moreira, who brings enormous technique and tenderness to the Gilberto canon. Together, they patiently tease out the beauty of Gilberto's simplicity in warm, shimmering lines. Bim Bom is available at iTunes and at Amazon here.\n\nAnother album by Ithamara with similar tenderness is Obrigado Dom Um Romao (2007). It's available at iTunes and Amazon here. By contrast, Brazilian Butterfly (2006) will give you a taste of Ithamara's stronger vocal style. It's available at iTunes.\n\nJazzWax clip: Here's Joao Gilberto's original recording of Bim Bom in 1958..."}, {"url": "https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en/music-database/musician/2457788ac70c0609e543653b3de5a8e419b932/biography", "page_content": "Ithamara Koorax\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nIthamara Koorax (born 23 May 1965 in Rio de Janeiro) is a popular Brazilian pop-jazz singer.

It was worth the wait. A look at the cast on this enigmatic set reveals a cast of all-stars. That said, the treasure is bittersweet on at least one level. Three of Brazil's greatest musicians -- and integral parts of this album -- all passed away after these sessions were recorded: the inimitable drummer and percussionist Dom Um Rom\u00e3o, bassist Manuel Gusm\u00e3o, and percussionist Eloir de Moraes. The core band on most of these sides includes Rom\u00e3o, electric pianist and keyboardist Paula Faour, and other electric bassist Jorge Pescara and/or acoustic and arco bassist Gusm\u00e3o. That said, there are a slew of guests on the record as well, including Azymuth, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Ron Carter, Nelson \u00c2ngelo, Raul de Souza, Thiago de Mello, Jos\u00e9 Carlos \"Bigorna\" Ramos, the Francesco Gazzara Group on one cut, and numerous others. Produced by Arnaldo DeSouteiro, who also did many of the album's arrangements and played percussion on some tracks, the set was recorded live in Brazil with the exception of \"Butterfly,\" which was cut in Italy with Gazzara's group. According to DeSouteiro, Dom Um Rom\u00e3o did the only overdubs, layering percussion on the tracks where he also played drums, and on the title track where Koorax fronted Gazzara's band in Italy.\n\nMusically, this is the showcase for Koorax's voice that fans have been waiting for, and it awaits a wider audience who need only to hear this once to be enthralled and entranced by its sophistication and heart. She is a diverse, adventurous, and utterly gifted vocalist who cannot be reined in by the stereotypical categorization of what the current generation calls a \"female jazz singer.\" Here she digs deep into Brazilian and Latin and even African and Cuban folk forms, modern and classic samba, electric jazz, vocalese, and more -- anything to allow the song itself to come through. Does that make Brazilian Butterfly a fusion record? Yes, but not any kind of fusion outing you've ever heard. People who need categories will call this \"world fusion\". But in truth, this set creates something new and should perhaps be called \"organic jazz fusion\", or \"new Brazil.\" There are so many elements woven into a tapestry so colorful, so brilliantly melodic, harmonically adventurous and multi-textured, it cannot be contained in any preset box. That said it has a very classic feel to it. One can hear traces of the early CTI sound here, but that is in the elegance, grace, and soulfulness of the grooves rather than in the musical style, for which there is no equivalent. The production and sound quality of this disc are simply gorgeous. From the opening track, the mysterious ambience that is Dorival Caymmi's \"O Vento\" beckons. Ramos' flute and Rom\u00e3o's shimmering cymbals introduce it, along with percussion by DeSouteiro and de Moraes; the listener can hear the spacious tantalizing strangeness in this mix. Koorax begins singing languidly, as if from a distance, seamlessly bridging the instruments and a creating certain lushness even before the rest of the band enters. Over eight minutes in length, there are fine solos by Faour and Ramos before Koorax and Rom\u00e3o trade up call-and-response vocal improvisation. (Rom\u00e3o is not a singer, but he was such a genius that his voice was as skilled a percussive instrument as his hands and feet.) Koorax engages him in this solo and even gets guttural; it is startling and entrancing, and could have gone on for another five minutes it's so inventive. It is followed by \"Escravos de J\u00f3,\" with de Moraes doing his own vocal improvisation and rap as Koorax digs deep into a modally constructed, almost droning samba melody. Carlos Fuchs adds his acoustic piano to the electric one by Faour, and the layered percussion by Koorax, de Moraes, Rom\u00e3o, and DeSouteiro give it an almost hallucinatory feel. The funky fretless bassline and hi hat work with de Souza's trombone on Rom\u00e3o's \"Amor em Jacum\u00e3\" makes it an utterly contemporary and forward-looking jazz tune. Here is where DeSouteiro evokes the beautiful arrangements of the early CTI groove tunes. Rubalcaba's taut piano solo offers a knotty and funky groove even in counterpoint with the bassline and \u00c2ngelo's shimmering, acoustic guitar work as Rom\u00e3o lays down breaks against a spacious yet kinetic four-piece percussion section! Koorax's voice rises and glides above that intimidating group with ease. Her voice is as rhythmic as Rom\u00e3o's kit. She phrases to suit the song: her chameleon-like quality is what gives her a unique identity. She doesn't play the fragile beauty on these tracks, she gets into the vamps and grooves as much as the players do: check her wailing soprano solo near the end of this cut for evidence of her ability to solo with any instrumentalist. The band pushes a steady, funky, airy, Latin-cum-samba groove behind her.\n\nEach track on Brazilian Butterfly uncovers a new mystery, reveals a hidden treasure, proving, of course, that Koorax is virtually limitless in her abilities. The interplay between Rom\u00e3o and Faour's keyboards and Pescara's bass on \"Lamento Negro\" puts it all in high gear. Rom\u00e3o gives voice to his approval and Koorax is so heavy and deep in the cut that she's downright funky, but Brazilian funky, which means of course that it isn't only about chop, it's about chops in the song. Her reading of Herbie Hancock's \"Butterfly\" is a completely new interpretation. Arranged by and co-produced by Gazzara in Italy, his utterly haunting nylon string guitar and Rhodes and acoustic piano work present this beautiful jazz tune in an almost ethereal way. His manner of adorning Koorax's voice is not as strident as what is heard on the rest of the recording, but that said it serves a wonderful purpose in showcasing her voice in a context she is very familiar with as a wonderful singer of ballads. The Italian, Spanish, and soul touches he and his band play underneath her interpreting of those lyrics allows her to inhabit the song fully and, perhaps even Hancock would agree, make it her own. This is only the first half of the recording and it's already better than any vocal record issued in 2006.\n\nThe latter half is the same wondrous, seamless, classy yet gritty amalgam of seemingly disparate elements that work marvelously as a whole: there are fine solos by many performers on this set, as Koorax and DeSouteiro allow plenty of room for improvisation as long as it fits the songs like a glove. But the real treasure here -- and one that unfortunately not many Americans have had the real pleasure of encountering -- is her voice. Her confidence is legion. If all you ever heard from this disc was Geraldo Vandr\u00e9's \"Fica Mal com Deus,\" with its driving rhythms and her voice punching right through them to add yet another layer to them, you'd be left dumbstruck. The song is outstanding. Her chant-like vocal, which introduces \"Noite de Temporal,\" another of the three tunes here by Caymmi, offers more of that \"world music\" vibe to the mix, but in the best possible manner: the fretless and arco basses playing off one another, the tribal drums and double percussion of DeSouteiro and Sidinho Moreira in the extended intro are deceptive, because as Faour's keyboards enter, this sounds like an ancient song being brought into the new world, Killer reggae piano, funk electric bass, bowed classical folk lines, and Koorax's voice coming out of the ether of antiquity and into the flesh in the present is worth the price of admission alone. The album's final track, \"Fren\u00e9tico,\" is very special since it is a duet. Koorax and de Moraes engage in a work of pure improvisation with only their voices and percussion instruments. De Moraes does his own awesome and effective take on scat as Koorax uses her voice as an effect, a percussion instrument with chatters, skitters, swoops, and washes of guttural onomatopoeia. It's almost nine minutes long and goes by in a flash; it's a hell of a way to close what is already your greatest recording, stamping it so individually it becomes almost iconoclastic. It cannot be touched. On Brazilian Butterfly, Koorax has set a new bar for jazz vocalists who come after her. As she does, they will need to embody many traditions and musical histories, root them in the tradition, and be able to comfortably combine as well improvise seamlessly with and between them. Thus far, Brazilian Butterfly is the jewel in Koorax's crown and a watermark in the 21st century, not only for Brazilian jazz, but for jazz and world music as a whole."}, {"url": "https://www.owlapps.net/owlapps_apps/articles?id=2477156&lang=en", "page_content": "Ithamara Koorax (born April 28, 1965) is a Brazilian jazz and pop singer.\n\nEarly life\n\nShe was born to a family of Polish Jews who fled Europe during World War II.
