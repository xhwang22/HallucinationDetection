{"Laurier L\u00e9vesque was the leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois from 1968 to 1985.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Parti-Quebecois", "page_content": "Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, English Quebec Party, provincial Canadian political party founded in 1968 by journalist Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and other French Canadian separatists in the largely French-speaking province of Quebec.\n\nIn 1968 L\u00e9vesque merged his Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association (Sovereignty-Association Movement)\u2014which advocated Quebec sovereignty in a new kind of looser association of Canadian provinces\u2014with other separatist groups to form the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Unsuccessful in the Quebec provincial elections of 1970 and 1973, the party in 1976 won 71 of 110 seats in the provincial National Assembly, and L\u00e9vesque was elected premier. The following year the Assembly decreed French the only official language of government and business in Quebec, and in 1980 L\u00e9vesque organized a referendum seeking approval for the provincial government to negotiate a new status and relationship with the rest of Canada. The referendum failed, however, with only two-fifths of Quebecers supporting sovereignty-association talks; those voting against the proposal included a small majority of French speakers.\n\nThe party maintained its dominance in Quebec\u2019s provincial assembly at the beginning of the 1980s, but membership declined thereafter as separatist fervour waned. In 1985 the independence plank was removed from the party\u2019s platform, and, following a series of defections and by-election defeats that year, L\u00e9vesque resigned; the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was swept from power in December. By 1987 the party was again controlled by militant separatists, and, when there was a resurgence in support for Quebec separatism in the 1990s, the party\u2019s hopes revived. It had informal ties with the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a Quebec separatist party that captured most of the province\u2019s seats in the House of Commons in the 1993 federal elections and served as the country\u2019s official opposition party from 1993 to 1997.\n\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won 77 out of 125 seats in the 1994 provincial election and formed a government under its leader, Jacques Parizeau. In 1995 the party held another referendum seeking popular approval to negotiate Quebec\u2019s secession from Canada; again the proposal was rejected, though this time it lost by only 1 percent of the vote. Lucien Bouchard, the leader of the federal Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Canada\u2019s former ambassador to France, became head of the party in 1996 and led it to victory in the 1998 provincial elections. Bouchard resigned as premier of Quebec in 2001 and was replaced as leader of the party and as premier of Quebec by Bernard Landry. In the provincial elections of 2003 the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was reduced to 45 seats and was ousted from power by the Liberals. In 2007 the party suffered its worst result since 1973, winning only 36 seats and falling into third place. In 2012 the party gained a plurality of seats in the National Assembly, enabling it to form a minority government under the leadership of Pauline Marois.\n\nIn March 2014, after only 18 months as head of the Quebec government, Marois, hoping to obtain majority rule, dissolved the legislature and called a new election. The Liberal Party, however, won a landslide victory on April 7, 2014, handing the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois its worst defeat in terms of seats won since 1970."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rene-levesque", "page_content": "\\u00a9 Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hudon.

L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, premier of Qu\u00e9bec 1976-85, politician, journalist, nationalist (born 24 Aug 1922 in Campbellton, NB; died 1 November 1987 in Montr\u00e9al, QC). A prominent member of Jean Lesage's Liberal Cabinet during the Quiet Revolution, L\u00e9vesque later founded the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ), eventually bringing it to power in 1976. The PQ's main objective was Qu\u00e9bec independence, and for 15 years L\u00e9vesque was the leading champion of that ideal \u2014 holding and losing the province's first referendum on sovereignty in 1980.\n\nGasp\u00e9 Childhood\n\nL\u00e9vesque grew up in the remote, coastal town of New Carlisle, among the fishermen and farmers of the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula. Because there was no hospital there in 1922, he was born in nearby Campbellton, New Brunswick, the eldest child of Dominique L\u00e9vesque, a prominent lawyer, and Diane Dionne. Although the L\u00e9vesques were well-to-do, poverty was dire in the Gasp\u00e9 at that time. Ren\u00e9 became aware at a young age that most of the French Canadians were poorer, with smaller homes and more wretched schools, than the English Canadian families \u2014 descendants of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution \u2014 who were the self-appointed elites of the region.\n\nA bright student who impressed his Jesuit teachers, L\u00e9vesque resolved early on at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 that he was destined to be a leader. He idolized his father, who introduced him to politics, and to French and English literature \u2014 giving the boy a bilingual upbringing. When L\u00e9vesque was 14, however, his father died in hospital at the age of 48. His mother quickly remarried, the family relocated to Qu\u00e9bec City, and L\u00e9vesque drifted away from both his family and his studies.\n\nExpelled from the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier for low marks, he finished his formal schooling at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec and enrolled in the law school at Universit\u00e9 Laval, but gave up on his studies before obtaining a degree.\n\nJournalism\n\nL\u00e9vesque had discovered radio journalism in 1938, his last summer in New Carlisle. In Qu\u00e9bec City he worked at CBV, a regional Radio-Canada station. When the Second World War broke out, he was keen to get into the action, not as a soldier but as a war correspondent. Radio-Canada refused to send him, so in 1944 L\u00e9vesque found a position in London with the French section of the United States government service, Voice of America \u2014 thereby avoiding conscription by the Canadian military. He didn't get to the front lines until February 1945, joining the American armies as they crossed the Rhine and swept through the devastated remains of Germany. He was among the first US correspondents to see the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp following its liberation.\n\nThe war instilled in L\u00e9vesque a fondness for Americans (versus English Canadians), and a deep awareness of the barbarism that can flow from the extremes of nationalism. It wasn't enough to erase his own nationalist impulses, but it did temper them; he was committed throughout his life to democracy.\n\nAfter the war L\u00e9vesque returned to Radio-Canada, becoming an announcer for La voix du Canada, a news program broadcast out of Montr\u00e9al to French-speaking countries around the world. He quickly established himself as an engaging and widely-followed foreign newsman, reporting from the Korean War in 1951 and the Soviet Union in 1955. From 1956 he hosted the television series \"Point de mire\" (Focal Point) and became one of Qu\u00e9bec's most influential TV commentators. Short, balding and chain-smoking, L\u00e9vesque lacked the good looks for this emerging visual medium, but his intelligence and wit, and his ability to explain world events to a domestic audience, enabled him to become one of Qu\u00e9bec's first TV stars.\n\nIn 1947, L\u00e9vesque married Louise L'Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e from before the war, with whom he wouldhave two sons and a daughter. Surrounded by admirers in the broadcasting world, L\u00e9vesque wasn't a faithful husband, and the couple would divorce in 1978.\n\nIn 1959, L\u00e9vesque became actively involved in a strike by Radio-Canada producers, who wanted to form a union. He was dismayed by the indifference of the Diefenbaker government in Ottawa, and of his English CBC colleagues, towards the strikers' goals, which only hardened his views towards English Canada and fuelled his political aspirations. He decided journalism wasn't enough \u2014 it was time to stop covering the world, and start changing it instead.\n\nLesage Cabinet\n\nL\u00e9vesque joined Jean Lesage's Liberals in the provincial election of 1960, becoming a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Montr\u00e9al and helping to defeat the old Union nationale government. It was the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, and L\u00e9vesque became one Lesage's most popular and energetic Cabinet ministers \u2014 helping to modernize Qu\u00e9bec, to encourage its French-speaking majority to become \"masters in our own house,\" and to help ease the province away from the oppressive influence of the Roman Catholic clergy.\n\nAfter a brief stint as minister of water resources and public works, in which he fought corruption in the civil service, L\u00e9vesque was appointed minister of natural resources in 1961. He became point-man for the controversial but ultimately successful effort to nationalize the province's private electric utilities and fold them into what became the energy colossus of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. If Francophone Qu\u00e9becers didn't own or control big business interests in their province, L\u00e9vesque insisted, they would at least control its vast natural resources, via their government.\n\nParti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\n\nIn 1966, the Lesage government was defeated and L\u00e9vesque \u2014 increasingly nationalistic, and critical of his party's relations with the federal government \u2014 quit the Liberals the following year to found the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, which in October 1968 became the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The move was hardly surprising. Through the 1960s, even as a Liberal minister, L\u00e9vesque had made his views on independence increasingly clear, telling the Anglophone media in Canada that he wouldn't be upset if Qu\u00e9bec separated. At the 1967 Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party convention he had even tabled an incendiary resolution, largely unsupported by other delegates, titled \"A sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union.\" Meanwhile, he grew increasingly antagonistic with Pierre Trudeau, who entered federal politics in 1965 advocating a very different vision.\n\nHaving managed to unite the various groups promoting independence and a new political status for Qu\u00e9bec, L\u00e9vesque's party won 23 % of the vote in the 1970 provincial elections \u2014 although he himself failed to win a seat. Then the October Crisis erupted, and Trudeau, now prime minister, invoked the War Measures Act. L\u00e9vesque joined a coalition of prominent Qu\u00e9becers in condemning what they saw as Ottawa's anti-democratic response to the crisis. At the same time, L\u00e9vesque and his friends failed to unequivocally condemn the terror kidnappings of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) and the group's subsequent murder of Pierre Laporte. This allowed the PQ's critics to publicly equate the party with the FLQ, costing the PQ considerable support.\n\nIn the 1973 provincial election the Liberals won a landslide victory, and L\u00e9vesque once again failed to win himself a seat. The PQ, however, managed to become the official Opposition.\n\nPQ Comes to Power\n\nIn the next election, in 1976, L\u00e9vesque and his party faced off against the now-unpopular Liberal regime of Robert Bourassa, weary after years in power and beset by scandal and accusations of nepotism. L\u00e9vesque promised good government. He also downplayed the PQ's essential goal \u2014 sovereignty \u2014 while reassuring Qu\u00e9becers that a PQ government would commit to holding a referendum on the issue first, rather than declaring sovereignty unilaterally. The PQ won a majority of 71 seats, including one for L\u00e9vesque, who became the province's 23rd premier. He headed the first Qu\u00e9bec government committed to breaking up Confederation. The rest of Canada was stunned.\n\nDuring its first term, the new government passed several progressive measures concerning automobile insurance, rezoning of agricultural lands and the abolition of secret electoral funding. One of the most important and controversial pieces of legislation was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which formalized the status of French as the official language of Qu\u00e9bec. Proclaimed lawin 1977, Bill 101 excluded English from the provincial legislature and courts, and restricted access to English schools to anyone other than children whose parents had attended English schools in Qu\u00e9bec. French schooling became compulsory for English-speaking immigrants, even those from other Canadian provinces.\n\nAlthough strongly supported by the public and the PQ, the law triggered an exodus of more than 130,000 Anglophones from the province between 1976 and 1981 . As well, a number of Montr\u00e9al-based companies, including Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, relocated their head offices to Toronto. In the ensuing years, court rulings would strike down many of the law's measures as contrary to the Constitution, including the ban on English in the legislature and courts. Eventually, children whose parents had attended English schools elsewhere in Canada, were allowed into English schools in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n1980 Referendum\n\nIn the fall of 1979, as time was running out on his government's mandate, L\u00e9vesque finally introduced in the National Assembly a plan for sovereignty-association \u2014 a politically independent Qu\u00e9bec, still economically tied to Canada. A referendum on the question was scheduled for 20 May 1980, only months after the defeat of Joe Clark's Conservatives in Ottawa, and the return to power of L\u00e9vesque's nemesis Pierre Trudeau.\n\nAfter an emotional campaign led on the \"non\" side by Liberal Opposition leader Claude Ryan and federal Cabinet minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien (with key support from Trudeau), and on the \"oui\" side by L\u00e9vesque and his ministers, the sovereigntists won only 40 percent of the vote, failing to capture even a majority of the Francophone vote. It was the hardest defeat of L\u00e9vesque's career. If there was any consolation, L\u00e9vesque believed the vote had at least legitimized the right of Qu\u00e9becers to determine their own future regarding Confederation. Ottawa had recognized that fact through its active participation in the campaign.\n\nConstitution Battle\n\nAgainst all expectations, the PQ was re-elected in 1981, with L\u00e9vesque heading his second majority government. The party may have been helped at the polls by the emergence of new battle lines pitting L\u00e9vesque and other provincial premiers against Trudeau, who had announced his intention to repatriate the Constitution from Britain and to proceed unilaterally if the provinces opposed him.\n\nTrudeau had made the vague promise, during the 1980 referendum campaign, of \"renewing\" the Constitution. Now his government was proposing new, centralized federal powers over the economy, a constitutionally-entrenched Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and a new constitutional amending formula. After months of political debate and grandstanding among Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque and the other premiers, the First Ministers, as they were called, assembled in Ottawa in November, 1981, in a final bid to settle their differences.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was one of several powerful and strong-willed premiers (along with Alberta's Peter Lougheed) \u2014 together comprising eight provinces, or the Gang of Eight \u2014 who opposed Trudeau's plans and had fought them through the courts. But huddled together in Ottawa that November, the seven English-speaking premiers in the coalition were won-over by the promise of a \"notwithstanding clause\" in the new Charter \u2014 limiting its power over provincial authority. The compromise was not enough for L\u00e9vesque, who had also insisted on constitutional recognition of Qu\u00e9bec as a \"distinct society,\" and on a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec. He accused his fellow premiers of abandoning \"Qu\u00e9bec at the moment of crisis.\"\n\nWith the agreement of nine provinces, Trudeau pressed ahead. The repatriated Constitution was signed by Queen Elizabeth in the spring of 1982 \u2014 with the support of all the premiers except L\u00e9vesque, whose government represented the second-most populous province in the country. It was a detail that would bedevil the country and its First Ministers for years to come.\n\nFinal Years in Office\n\nL\u00e9vesque returned to the National Assembly to face the hard task of governing. Confronted with economic recession and spiralling provincial deficits, his government met with considerable opposition and public disapproval, including illegal public-sector union strikes, when it attempted to reduce spending to solve its grave financial problems.\n\nThere was also turmoil inside the PQ and growing doubts about L\u00e9vesque's leadership. In 1984, a party crisis erupted when L\u00e9vesque announced his intention of not fighting the next election on the issue of independence, while maintaining sovereignty-association as the party's official raison d'\u00eatre. Several important ministers resigned in protest, but the party reaffirmed L\u00e9vesque's leadership at a special convention in January 1985. Still, exhausted by years of struggle \u2014 and the defeat of his fondest political goals \u2014 L\u00e9vesque, at 62, fell into depression and was even hospitalized against his will. In June 1985 he resigned as premier.\n\nLegacy\n\nL\u00e9vesque enjoyed two years of retirement, before his heart gave out on 1 November, 1987. In that time he wrote his memoirs, which proved hugely popular. Upon his death, he was remembered across the country, by friends and foes alike, as a giant of Canadian politics.\n\nL\u00e9vesque's mark on Qu\u00e9bec, and Canada, is as indelible as any leader that province has produced: as a journalist he opened the minds of Francophone Qu\u00e9becers and awakened them to the wider world; he was a central figure of the Quiet Revolution; a creator of the energy powerhouse that became Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec; founder of the PQ and leader of Qu\u00e9bec's first openly separatist government; the angry, intransigent torch-bearer of the \"distinct society\" ideal, who refused to endorse the 1982 Constitution, leaving an open wound in the federation that festers still.\n\nThrough it all, L\u00e9vesque acknowledged that whatever injustices Qu\u00e9becers suffered inside Confederation, Canada was still a free and decent country. \"Canada's federal system,\" he once said, \"is not excessively oppressive or anything like a gulag.\" He was never the most ardent nationalist or separatist of his time, yet he fanned the flames of nationalist sentiment in pursuit of his aims. His insistence on wanting to break up the nation, in spite of the Canadian virtues he admired, are what made him such a perplexing \u2014 and often hated \u2014 figure in the minds of English-speaking Canadians, both inside Qu\u00e9bec, and elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-referendum-1980", "page_content": "L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nPolitical Context\n\nIn the late 1950s and the early 1960s, several organizations were established to promote or achieve Qu\u00e9bec independence. Some of them, such as the Rassemblement pour l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance nationale (RIN; see Pierre Bourgault) also tried their luck in the province\u2019s political arena. On 13 October 1968, a political party was founded that was to continue to have an impact on Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian politics for many years to come. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, created by the merger of the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, led by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, and the Ralliement national, led by Gilles Gr\u00e9goire, also received the support of the militant base of the RIN, which was dissolved at about the same time. As a new, pro-independence political party, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois soon became the rallying point for almost all nationalist movements and associations in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nAfter enjoying moderate success on the political scene, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won the Qu\u00e9bec general election of 15 November 1976, defeating the Liberals under Robert Bourassa. This victory was attributable to a political manoeuvre, carefully orchestrated by Claude Morin, in which the party promised that it would hold a referendum on sovereignty-association during its first term in government.\n\nJoe Clark at the PC Convention at which he won his party's leadership (photo by John de Visser).\n\nOn 22 May 1979, the federal Liberal Party, led by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, lost the Canadian general election. Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque would now be dealing with a federal minority government led by Joe Clark, a prime minister who had little influence in Qu\u00e9bec. Thus conditions had at last become favourable for the date of the referendum to be announced. On 21 June 1979, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque told Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s National Assembly that the referendum would be held in the spring of 1980. In November 1979, the PQ government published La nouvelle entente Qu\u00e9bec-Canada (known in English as the White Paper on Sovereignty-Association), in which it asserted that \u201csovereignty is indissociable from association.\u201d The wording of the referendum question was announced on 20 December 1979:\n\nThe Government of Quebec has made public its proposal to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the equality of nations; this agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad \u2014 in other words, sovereignty \u2014 and at the same time to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency; any change in political status resulting from these negotiations will only be implemented with popular approval through another referendum; on these terms, do you give the Government of Quebec the mandate to negotiate the proposed agreement between Quebec and Canada?\n\nIn the meantime, in early December, the political calculus had changed again, when Joe Clark\u2019s government lost a vote of confidence on its first budget. New federal elections were set for 18 February 1980. This time, the Liberals won, taking 74 out of 75 ridings in Qu\u00e9bec, and Pierre Trudeau \u2014 who had returned as party leader \u2014 now formed a majority government ( see Elections of 1979 and 1980 ). He promised that his government would reform federalism and that a No vote in the upcoming Qu\u00e9bec referendum would not be a vote for the status quo.\n\nPierre Trudeau, speaking in 1968. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau speaks for the federalist side, during the campaign for the 1980 Quebec Referendum on sovereignty. PreviousNext\n\nResults of the Referendum\n\nWhen the referendum was held on 20 May 1980, the plan for sovereignty-association was rejected by 59.56% of the votes cast, with a participation rate of 85.61%. An estimated 50% of francophone voters had supported this option. Some observers attributed part of this support, especially among women, to a clumsy comment by Lise Payette, Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Minister of State for the Status of Women. In a speech in the National Assembly on International Women's Day (8 March 1980), she had decried the stereotypical character of Yvette, who still appeared in Qu\u00e9bec elementary school readers as the good little girl who helped around the house. At a partisan meeting the following day, Payette said that Claude Ryan, the leader of the No camp, wanted women to remain \u201cYvettes,\u201d and she then insulted his wife by saying that he was married to one. Liberal Party activists wasted no time in exploiting the minister\u2019s blunder. They held a massive \u201cBrunch des Yvettes\u201d in Qu\u00e9bec City, followed by several others, including one in Montr\u00e9al that attracted over 15,000 female supporters of the No camp. The \u201cYvettes\u201d movement may well deserve credit for reversing the initial trend that showed 47% in favour of the Yes option.\n\nDespite the democratic reforms and intellectual revival that Ryan brought to the Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party, his leadership was seriously questioned and he resigned in the fall of 1982 (Canapress).\n\nIn the days following the referendum defeat, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois reaffirmed that sovereignty was still the only viable option for Qu\u00e9bec and would one day win majority support. This hope was already palpable in the speech that Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque gave on the night after the referendum, when he said, \u201cIf I have understood you correctly, you are telling us, \u2018until the next time.\u2019\u201d\n\nConstitutional Talks Resume\n\nIn the aftermath of the referendum, intensive negotiations took place between the federal government and the 10 provincial governments (see also Constitutional History), but were suspended when the provincial representatives rejected the federal proposals to patriate the Canadian Constitution. Later, all of the provinces except Qu\u00e9bec embraced this idea.\n\nIn April 1981, despite its loss in the referendum, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was re-elected, with 80 seats in the National Assembly and 49.2% of the votes (an increase of more than 8% in popular support compared with the election of 1976).\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau signing the Constitution, 17 April 1982.\n\nConstitutional Accords Rejected and Second Qu\u00e9bec Referendum Held\n\nIn September 1984, a Conservative federal government was elected, led by Brian Mulroney, and constitutional discussions between the federal and Qu\u00e9bec governments resumed. In May 1985, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois announced the conditions that the government of Qu\u00e9bec would require in order to support patriation. They included recognition of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s distinct status and its right to either veto federal-provincial agreements or to opt out of them with adequate financial compensation if they were reached without Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s consent (see Federal-Provincial Relations).\n\nThe talks continued beyond the December 1985 Qu\u00e9bec general election, in which Robert Bourassa\u2019s Liberals were returned to power. In June 1987, an agreement was reached. Known as the Meech Lake Accord, it recognized Qu\u00e9bec as a \u201cdistinct society,\u201d comprised other constitutional changes as well, and was conditional on approval by the House of Commons and the provincial legislatures. At the end of the day, the agreement (see Meech Lake Accord: Document) was not adopted.\n\nIn October 1992, a Canada-wide referendum was held on another agreement, the Charlottetown Accord (see Charlottetown Accord: Document). This agreement was rejected by 54.3% of the voters. In October 1995, a Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government held another referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (see Qu\u00e9bec Referendum (1995)), which the No side won by a very slim majority: 50.58% of the votes. The participation rate was also very high: 93.25% of all Quebecers participated in this democratic exercise.\n\nAs of this writing, some two decades since this second referendum, the achievement of political sovereignty for Qu\u00e9bec is still part of the program of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. A second party in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s National Assembly, Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, has also taken a position in favour of the principle of sovereignty for Qu\u00e9bec."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-since-confederation", "page_content": "L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). founder of Le Devoir and opponent of Canadian involvement in foreign military adventures, Bourassa inspired the growth of a vigorous nationalism in Qu\u00e9bec (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-27360/Henri Bourassa Coll). PreviousNext\n\nWhen the Canadian Confederation was established in 1867, provisions were made for the creation of a provincial government in Qu\u00e9bec, the only region with a majority French-speaking population. This distinctive identity has exerted a profound influence on all facets of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s history and continues to fuel debate about the province\u2019s future.\n\nThe Catholic religion, too, has been an identity marker for just as long a time, exerting a strongly conservative influence on the province.

Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s francophones have lived side by side with their English-speaking counterparts \u2014 sometimes in harmony, sometimes in an atmosphere of tension \u2014 and have also incorporated contributions from other countries and cultures into their society. The Quiet Revolution of the 1960s marked a tipping point: a new nationalism emerged, religion declined, and plans to modernize the province were launched. This article presents the main trends and events that have marked the history of Qu\u00e9bec since 1867.\n\nThe End of the 19th Century\n\n\n\nConfederation opened the way to a permanent settlement of a political problem that Canada had faced for several decades \u2014 the existence of a French-Canadian nation in what had now become, through immigration, a predominantly English-speaking country.\n\nConfederation confirmed French Canadians as a minority but gave them in return \u2014 in addition to bilingualism in federal institutions \u2014 provincial status for their heartland, the former Lower-Canada. They were a majority in Qu\u00e9bec, the new province, and securely in control of their own cultural and social development. At the same time, the English-speaking minority in the province benefited from significant measures protecting their religion and language. But this political reorganization was only one of the fundamental changes that Qu\u00e9bec society was undergoing at the time.\n\nFor a long time, writers concerned with Qu\u00e9bec's development characterized it as a traditional society, largely closed to the changes occurring elsewhere in North America. Qu\u00e9bec was described as a peasant society, emphasizing its stability and arguing that at bottom its characteristics changed little between the 18th and mid-20th centuries. In the 1960s, however, new historical research began to show that Qu\u00e9bec was a much more complex society, constantly evolving and with phases of apparent stability between periods of rapid transformation. Qu\u00e9bec participated in the major developments that characterized the Atlantic world between 1815 and 1930: large-scale population movements and increasing industrialization and urbanization, in which respects the second half of the 19th century was a pivotal period.\n\nDemographic Changes\n\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of Qu\u00e9bec's population changed significantly over the 19th century. This can be seen first by looking at developments in demography. Heavy immigration to Qu\u00e9bec from the British Isles occurred between 1815 and 1860; in 1867 a quarter of Qu\u00e9bec's 1.2 million people traced their roots to Great Britain (mostly to Ireland) while three-quarters were of French origin. Around 1870, however, this large wave of immigration ended.\n\nMeanwhile, French Canadians were also increasing rapidly in number because of their high birth rate. In Qu\u00e9bec's older rural areas they soon became too numerous, and farmers' children had to look for jobs elsewhere. A French Canadian who wanted to be a farmer had to go to a distant colonization zone in Qu\u00e9bec where the soil was typically poor and living conditions were difficult. Some areas, such as the Bois-Francs, were on the South Shore, but most were located north of the St. Lawrence Valley, including the Laurentians, Lanaudi\u00e8re, the St. Maurice Valley, and Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean. The colonist was isolated and the deficiencies of his marginal farm forced him to work in the forest as a lumberjack to make ends meet. Few rural Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois were attracted by the new colonization regions, and most, regarding even the long hours of factory work as preferable to the life of a colonist, went to urban areas instead.\n\nThe textile mills of New England needed cheap and plentiful labour, which they found in the Qu\u00e9bec countryside. In the late 19th century, immigration to the United States became a mass movement (see Franco-Americans). It is estimated that between 1850 and 1930, almost a million French Canadians left Qu\u00e9bec for American destinations. Most of them left for good, but some returned to Qu\u00e9bec and helped to spread American influence, particularly in business, trade unions, the arts and journalism. The rural population surplus also stimulated the emergence of industries in Qu\u00e9bec itself. This was one of numerous reasons for the growth of industry in Qu\u00e9bec, others being the expansion of the Canadian domestic market, railway construction and the Canadian government's economic policies \u2014 especially the protective tariff of 1879 (see National Policy).\n\nIndustrialization\n\n\n\nIndustrialization in Qu\u00e9bec during this period occurred in two stages. The first, in the mid-19th century, was concentrated primarily in Montr\u00e9al. That city's industrial structure was also strengthened in the second stage, in the 1880s, but during this period industry grew in many small and mid-sized cities and towns as well, especially Qu\u00e9bec City and the urban centres of the Eastern Townships such as Sherbrooke, Magog, Coaticook and Granby.\n\nIndustrialization in Qu\u00e9bec was based mainly on light manufacturing, employing plentiful, underpaid labour and producing goods for immediate consumption, such as shoes, textiles and food. There was also some heavy industry in the transportation and metal-processing sectors, and it was centralized in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nIndustrialization increased the process of urbanization, and by the end of the 19th century a third of all Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois lived in cities and towns. The most significant urban and industrial growth took place in Montr\u00e9al, where half of Qu\u00e9bec's industrial production was concentrated and almost a quarter of all Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois lived in 1901.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Qu\u00e9bec's population was still in rural areas, where subsistence was beginning to yield to more commercial forms of agriculture. The farmers were weaned from their traditional attachment to grain cultivation and started to concentrate on dairy farming and the production of more specialized, market-oriented commodities. This change took place slowly, and its pace varied widely from region to region.\n\nNew social groups\n\n\n\nAs a result of the period's economic growth, a new bourgeoisie emerged. Unlike the bourgeoisie of the previous period, whose interests were purely commercial, this class also invested in transportation, the financial sector, and industrial corporations. It was drawn overwhelmingly from the English and Scottish groups, and was concentrated in Montr\u00e9al, Canada's leading economic centre. It controlled the major economic institutions that operated Canada-wide, such as the powerful Bank of Montreal (founded 1817). French Canadians were almost completely absent from the upper level of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, however, there arose a class of French-speaking businessmen with a much more local or regional economic base. They actively exercised a share of political power in Qu\u00e9bec and established specifically French-speaking institutions, e.g., banks, business periodicals and chambers of commerce.\n\nIndustrialization also led to the formation of a working class. In Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec City and the smaller industrial centres, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who had left farms to become workers lived under difficult conditions: low wages, long working hours, poor housing conditions, a high death rate and widespread seasonal unemployment. French-Canadian workers had the fewest skills and had to be satisfied with the lowest-paying jobs. This was especially true of women (see Status of Women), whose numbers were increasing in the textile, clothing, shoe and tobacco industries. The growing importance of the working class was confirmed by the rise of the labour movement in the 1880s and 1890s (see Working-Class History\u2013Qu\u00e9bec). The trade union movement quickly became dominated by two American organizations, the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor, which established affiliates in Canada. During this period, only a small proportion of Qu\u00e9bec's workers \u2014 primarily the most highly skilled ones \u2014 belonged to these unions.\n\nConservatism\n\n\n\nThis period was marked politically by the domination of the Conservative Party, which held power in both Ottawa and Qu\u00e9bec City except for brief intervals. After the death of George-\u00c9tienne Cartier in 1873, the party was gradually eroded by quarrels between its Ultramontane and moderate wings. Between 1867 and 1897 Qu\u00e9bec had 10 premiers: 8 Conservatives, including Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau (1867\u20131873) and Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau (1879\u20131882), and two Liberals, one of whom was Honor\u00e9 Mercier (1887\u20131891). He took power as the leader of a coalition known as the Parti national, which was established in response to the hanging of Louis Riel.\n\nThe actions of Qu\u00e9bec governments during this period were modest in scope because they had limited means. Provincial revenues came from federal grants and subsidies and royalties from natural resources. Municipalities were responsible for the largest public expenditures (roads and highways, water supply and drainage). Successive Qu\u00e9bec governments tried to foster economic development through the settlement of farmland, the exploitation of natural resources, and especially railway construction (see Railway History). They endeavoured to raise people\u2019s level of education, but in doing so they relied on the Catholic Church and school boards. The office of Premier enjoyed greater prestige and, particularly under Honor\u00e9 Mercier, grew to include the role of spokesperson for Canada\u2019s francophones.\n\nThe Power of the Catholic Church\n\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church (see Catholicism) was a powerful social force. It controlled the public education system, and through its network of parishes and religious associations it exercised tight control over people's morals. Its bishops (Ignace Bourget andElz\u00e9ar-Alexandre Taschereau, to name only two) enjoyed considerable authority. The rapid numerical growth of the clergy and religious communities, starting in the mid-19th century, was evidence of the church's vitality and its power in society. Women\u2019s communities had the most members and provided educational, social and hospital services. Under the Civil Code, a married woman\u2019s status was no more than that of a minor, so the religious life gave many Qu\u00e9bec women an opportunity to expand their horizons and take up an occupation, the limits placed on their personal lives notwithstanding. As for men, congregations of teaching brothers and priests arrived from France and then recruited new members in Qu\u00e9bec, with the result that religious supervision and leadership for men was strengthened.\n\nNevertheless, the Church was not ubiquitous and all-powerful. Despite its success in the social and cultural spheres, it was less effective in the political and economic realms. The clergy did not have the power to stop industrialization or immigration to the United States. And although the clergy did try to dominate Qu\u00e9bec's politicians, to the point of supporting the formation of a Catholic party in 1871, it was unable to control government institutions. Many priests were openly hostile to the Liberal Party, but the Liberals, under federal leader Wilfrid Laurier and provincial leader Honor\u00e9 Mercier, followed a strategy of softening their radicalism and increased their support among the population.\n\nThe Protestant clergy was much less monolithic. Practising Protestants, nearly all of whom were anglophones, were divided among Anglicans (the largest group), Presbyterians (see Presbyterian and Reformed Churches) and Methodists, but also among many sects. Protestant churches were everywhere and were home to a vibrant associative life. As a minority, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Protestants remained united for strategic reasons \u2014 to maintain their own educational institutions (school boards and McGill University) and healthcare institutions.\n\nCulturally, Qu\u00e9bec was still a society on the periphery. The motherland of France was a force of attraction for the French-speaking elites, in spite of the fact that the clergy condemned France in its official, republican and lay incarnation and promoted, instead, the rural, Catholic incarnation of France, with its deep roots. At the same time, US promoters dominated the performing arts and organized tours by orchestras and theatre companies; French-language performances were few and far between. In literature, the most popular genre was the French novel, which was serialized in newspapers. A home-grown literature slowly emerged with authors such as Louis-Honor\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chette, Joseph Marmette, and Laure Conan (F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Angers). In the visual arts, artists went to the US and France for their training. The sculptor Louis-Philippe H\u00e9bert and the painter Napol\u00e9on Bourassa enjoyed some success in their dealings with the political and religious authorities, who were the main sources of commissions. With respect to the media, it was during this period that the popular, large-circulation press developed (La Presse, La Patrie, and The Montreal Daily Star) and helped to shape Qu\u00e9bec culture.\n\nAlthough rural life was still a major feature of late 19th-century Qu\u00e9bec, the province's social and economic development was parallel to that of other parts of North America that were becoming industrialized. There were still significant differences of language and culture between Qu\u00e9bec and the rest of the continent. In addition, French Canadians were not masters of Qu\u00e9bec's economic development; they occupied a secondary economic position and were much more likely to be workers than employers.\n\nA Period of Growth (1896\u20131930)\n\n\n\nDuring the first 30 years of the 20th century, Qu\u00e9bec enjoyed strong economic growth, and the size of its population increased from 1.5 million to 2.9 million. The pace of change that had marked the previous period quickened. Industrialization and urbanization continued: by the First World War half the population lived in cities and towns, and this proportion grew to 60 per cent by 1931.\n\nTo an increasing extent, Montr\u00e9al was Qu\u00e9bec's metropolis, and in 1931 Greater Montr\u00e9al accounted for 35 per cent of the province's population. The city's industrial growth was remarkable: new industries developed while some old ones substantially increased production to meet the demand caused by Canada's rapid economic growth. Through its railway systems, large banks and many commercial and industrial corporations, Montr\u00e9al became the metropolitan centre for the development of Western Canada. Canadian wheat was exported to Europe from its harbour. It remained Canada's leading industrial centre and accounted for two-thirds of the value of Qu\u00e9bec's manufacturing production.\n\nA More Diverse Society\n\n\n\nAt the same time the Qu\u00e9bec countryside was being changed by a new kind of industrialization based on the exploitation of natural resources. Industries linked to hydroelectric and forest resources (pulp and paper, aluminum, chemicals) developed quickly in former colonization zones such as the St Maurice Valley and the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region. New cities and towns sprang up as a result, including Shawinigan, Arvida, and K\u00e9nogami. Further north, Abitibi was ceded to Qu\u00e9bec by the federal government in 1898. The settlement of farmland in the region began in 1912 under the impetus of the new National Transcontinental Railway. From the 1920s on, mining transformed the region, creating a new area of economic and industrial growth around Rouyn and Noranda. Emigration to the United States slowed, although it remained substantial until the 1930s.\n\nAs concentration in the industrial and banking sectors increased early in the century, economic power increasingly became centralized in the hands of a few Montr\u00e9al capitalists, almost all of them English Canadian; the French-Canadian bourgeoisie was reduced to a marginal position and increasingly limited to local institutions and traditional sectors. However, it maintained a strong political presence, especially at the provincial level.\n\nBut the vast majority of French Canadians could choose only farming or factory work. The situation of Qu\u00e9bec farmers improved as the trend towards specialization and market orientation continued up to Second World War. In the 1920s, Qu\u00e9bec farmers tended to come out of their traditional isolation and join together in associations and co-operatives (see United Farmers of Qu\u00e9bec; Co-operative Movement).\n\nIn the cities and towns, French-Canadian workers had to compete with a new wave of immigrants who came increasingly from continental Europe. The largest ethnic group that was neither French nor British consisted of eastern European Jews, and Italians were a distant second. In the second half of the 19th century, the proportion of French Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec's population had increased from 75 per cent to 80 per cent, and it remained at this level through the early part of the 20th century. The proportion represented by the British group, however, declined to 15 per cent by 1931, while people of neither French nor British origin accounted for almost 6 per cent. At the same time, ethnic diversity was a phenomenon that was increasingly limited to the Island of Montr\u00e9al, where people of French origin represented approximately 60 per cent of the population.\n\nThe situation of the working class improved. With the growth of unionism, workers enjoyed better working conditions. Public health measures (filtration of water, pasteurization of milk, vaccination of children) brought down mortality rates. New housing came with the comforts of modern life. Nonetheless, some major inequalities remained, and many unskilled workers could not find stable employment. Church-based charities continued to bear the heaviest load when it came to helping the destitute, and it was not until 1921 that the government started to provide financial support.\n\nIn contrast, urbanization fostered the growth of services and an increase in the number of jobs for office and store clerks, accountants, insurance agents and small retailers. A new middle class of white-collar workers emerged. At the same time, however, another employment sector developed, made up of low-paying jobs filled mainly by young women. More and more of these women entered the labour market, taking jobs in industry and in services, and kept working until they got married. Their wages were much lower than those of men.\n\nPolitical Polarization\n\n\n\nAs they had in the late 19th century, French-Canadian politicians and businessmen strongly supported Qu\u00e9bec's industrial development. The provincial Liberal Party, in power from 1897 to 1936, was solidly behind big business and the entry of American capital in the new resource-based industries. Premiers F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand (1897\u20131900), Simon-Napol\u00e9on Parent (1900\u20131905), Jean-Lomer Gouin (1905\u20131920) and Louis-Alexandre Taschereau (1920\u20131936) all pursued programs of modernization. The Gouin and Taschereau governments counted on technical and professional education along with scholarships to improve labour force training. They invested heavily in road and highway infrastructures (see Roads and Highways). In rural regions, they supported the growth of commercial farming. Under their leadership, the State became involved in support for social services and culture.\n\nHowever, a group of intellectuals and members of the liberal professions led in turn by Henri Bourassa and Abb\u00e9 Lionel Groulx and calling themselves nationalists, reacted by trying to resist rapid industrialization, and especially the sale of natural resources to foreigners. They received considerable support from the Catholic clergy, which was alarmed at the massive rural exodus (see Qu\u00e9bec rural society) and the rapid urbanization of the population. However, the clergy was not rejecting outright a process over which it had no control; instead, it developed a new strategy of establishing organizations to make it possible to dominate the new economic and social order from within. For example, the clergy promoted the establishment of Catholic unions, which were especially active in Qu\u00e9bec's smaller industrial towns. However, these new unions largely failed to take root in Montr\u00e9al, and, despite clerical support, only a quarter of all unionized workers in Qu\u00e9bec belonged to Catholic unions in the late 1920s, the great majority remaining with the big United States-based international unions (see Qu\u00e9bec Union Centrals).\n\nLiberal and Traditionalist Ideologies\n\n\n\nThroughout the period, two opposing conceptions of Qu\u00e9bec society confronted each other. The first, which can be called the liberal ideology (see Liberalism), was upheld by businessmen and most politicians. Emphasizing economic growth and the idea of progress, it placed a high value on the individual and free enterprise. Its representatives believed that the well-being of the nation would flow from the individual progress of its members, and that economic growth was the only road Qu\u00e9bec could take. Since they took the position that individual progress would lead to collective progress, they also believed that better education was the path to an improved economic situation. Their goal was to modernize the province\u2019s economic structures without disrupting relations among social groups. They did not dare challenge the power of the clergy, even though some tried to limit it, and most refused to amend the rights of men, on the one hand, and of women, on the other (see Status of Women).\n\nOpposed to the liberal ideology was the deeply traditionalist clerical-nationalist ideology, which suggested that the French-Canadian collectivity would achieve national well-being by withdrawing into itself and returning to rural life and traditional French-Canadian and Catholic values. Upheld by nationalist intellectuals and many clergymen, this ideology was opposed to almost everything foreign. It was forcefully expressed in a number of publications and in sermons and speeches. It was much more explicit and more fully articulated than was the liberal ideology, and hence historians and sociologists long maintained that it was Qu\u00e9bec's dominant ideology. However, the real situation was much more complex. Despite the resistance of clerical-nationalist ideologues, industrialization continued and increasing numbers of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois left their farms to live in cities and towns. A return to traditional rural society was a dream that did not come true.\n\nSocialist ideological currents were very important in Europe at the time, but they occupied only a marginal position in Qu\u00e9bec. Some representatives of the labour movement became involved in politics through the Parti ouvrier, but they were closer in their thinking to the British Labour Party than to European socialists.\n\nFeminism (see Women\u2019s Movement) also made its presence felt in both the anglophone and the francophone community of Qu\u00e9bec. The feminist movement gave women greater access to higher education and some professions, but the professions of lawyer and notary remained closed to them. In 1917, women won the right to vote federally, but the religious and political elites refused to give them the right to vote in provincial elections.\n\nThe social conservatism of the elites affected culture too. In literature, the ruralist, or \u201cregionalist,\u201d tradition survived, even though modernist, or \u201cexotic,\u201d authors challenged it. The new schools of fine art promoted the classical tradition, but some artists, including Morrice, Suzor-C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Cullen, reflected more modern influences in their work. France remained a dominant force in the academic world and the arts. It also made its presence felt in popular culture, but this field was influenced above all by the rapid growth of Americanization \u2014 a trend that was intensified by United States control over show tours and movie theatres as well as the widespread distribution of consumer goods and the \u201cAmerican Way of Life.\u201d\n\nThe rise of French-Canadian nationalism, moreover, posed the question of Qu\u00e9bec's place in Confederation. While Wilfrid Laurier was prime minister, French Canadians felt that they held some power. In fact, they witnessed the reduction of their educational and linguistic rights throughout various parts of the country, despite the vigorous battles fought by the nationalists. The nationalists' real political setback, however, the election of a Conservative government to Ottawa in 1911 \u2014 and especially the conscription crisis of 1917 \u2014 served to highlight the isolation of Qu\u00e9bec, which henceforth bound its fortunes to those of the Liberal Party. Another result of this electoral failure was that nationalism went in a new direction. Taking inspiration from Lionel Groulx, the new nationalism focused more clearly on Qu\u00e9bec as the homeland of French Canadians and condemned the marginalization of francophones and their language in their own province.\n\nGreat Depression and Second World War (1930\u20131945)\n\n\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s appeared to be a partial vindication of the clergy and the nationalist intellectuals who had long been predicting that the liberal model of society would fail. The area of Qu\u00e9bec most seriously affected was Montr\u00e9al. Because Montr\u00e9al was Canada's leading port, it suffered substantial unemployment when international trade and Canadian exports collapsed. In addition, its industries were hurt by a drop in domestic consumption. Montr\u00e9al teemed with tens of thousands of unemployed people living on public assistance.\n\nState Intervention\n\n\n\nAll over Canada, traditional solutions based largely on private charity proved inadequate to cope with the Depression. Governments had to intervene. Provincial governments were overwhelmed and appealed to Ottawa, which participated financially in assisting the unemployed. This intervention by the federal government in social policy led to a rethinking of Canadian federalism in the form of the Rowell-Sirois Commission (see Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations). It also marked the beginning of a long process of centralization favouring the federal government, which had a considerable impact on Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nThe Second World War, during which Ottawa intervened extensively in economic management, played a determining role in this respect. During the Depression and the war, the idea of more systematic government intervention, based on Keynesian economic policies, was gradually accepted. In a federal system such as Canada's, however, such a development raised a fundamental question: which level of government should be in charge of the regulatory instruments that were established? In general, English Canadians came to believe that this was the responsibility of the federal government, which should provide for equality of opportunity from coast to coast.\n\nBy contrast, most French-speaking political thinkers and politicians in Qu\u00e9bec were opposed to concentrating power in Ottawa's hands in this way, on the grounds that it threatened the autonomy that French Canadians had gained through the existence of a provincial government over which they had majority control. The question seemed especially complicated in Qu\u00e9bec's case because most Qu\u00e9bec representatives in Ottawa, the Liberals who were in power from 1935 to 1957, supported federal centralization. During the war, the federal government could impose its own solution, but once the war was over the issue reappeared, and as vexatious as ever. As a result, the recent history of Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 and of Canada as a whole \u2014 has been marked by federal\u2013provincial struggles.\n\nIn the economic disorder brought about by the Depression, there were many challenges to the prevailing political and social system. Although communist and socialist groups grew substantially in Canada during the 1930s, they had little success in recruiting French Canadians, among whom left-wing traditions were very weak. In Qu\u00e9bec, only immigrants and English-speaking intellectuals in Montr\u00e9al were attracted to these groups. Among French Canadians, nationalist and traditionalist movements enjoyed new popularity instead. In 1933, a group of priests and laypersons published the Programme de restauration sociale, or Social Recovery Program, which emphasized nationalism and corporatism. The following year, a group of disaffected Liberals founded a new party, the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale (ALN), and based its platform on these two themes. In the 1935 election, the ALN, with Paul Gouin as its leader, forged an alliance with Maurice Duplessis\u2019 Conservatives and came close to upsetting the Liberals. The alliance became the Union Nationale, and the following year it won the election, with the result that Duplessis took over as premier. Taking a very conservative stance on policy matters, the new government introduced farm credit and assistance to mothers in need but was unable to stimulate an economy that was still in crisis. It lost the 1939 election.\n\nEffects of Global Conflict\n\n\n\nIdeological effervescence of the 1930s was calmed by the war. In Qu\u00e9bec the war was synonymous with a return to prosperity and full employment. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois actually profited from the war \u2014 although they were reluctant to pay the price for their new prosperity. Thousands of French Canadians joined the Canadian Army to fight in Europe, but in its culture and operation the Canadian Army was a profoundly anglophone institution and held little attraction for French-speaking Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Nationalist leaders portrayed the war as something foreign that did not concern French Canadians, so that intense resistance to Canadian military participation in Europe, and especially to conscription, developed in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nIn 1942, Ottawa held a Canada-wide plebiscite on the question of conscription. An overwhelming majority of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois voted against compulsory military service, whereas a majority of English Canadians in the other provinces voted in favour of it; a deep national cleavage ensued. As a consequence, a new party, the Bloc populaire canadien, was created, with a federal and a provincial wing. However, it enjoyed very little success in elections.\n\nThe war also had highly significant long-term social consequences, which manifested themselves both concretely and in attitudes. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who served in Europe came into contact with different cultures and ways of life. Thousands of women worked in factories as part of the war production system, and even though many returned to traditional family life after the war, this exposure had long-term effects (see Women and War). But the impact of the war was probably felt most strongly by rural Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. They were increasingly integrated into the industrial capitalist economy, as many of them left the countryside to work in factories while others introduced changes that made their farms much more productive. Meanwhile, war propaganda, the increasing availability of radio and improved communications all tended to bring rural Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois into the broad current of modernization that had been felt in Qu\u00e9bec for several decades but had not reached all parts of the province in equal measure.\n\nDuring this period, the Liberal Ad\u00e9lard Godbout served as premier of Qu\u00e9bec (1939\u201344). His government introduced a number of reforms heralding the spirit of the Quiet Revolution. It settled issues that had been the subject of endless debate: women\u2019s right to vote (1940), compulsory school attendance (1942) and nationalization of power generation in Montr\u00e9al with the creation of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec (1944). It passed the Labour Code and launched a study on health insurance. It completed construction of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, which had been interrupted during the crisis, and promoted education reform. Because of Godbout\u2019s support for the war effort and his attitude during the conscription crisis, nationalist voters rose up against him, and this contributed to his defeat in 1944.\n\nThe Duplessis Era (1945\u201360)\n\n\n\nQu\u00e9bec entered another period of rapid economic growth after the war. This was conspicuous in the natural resource sector, where it was stimulated by American demand. Its most spectacular manifestation was the opening up of the North Shore of the St. Lawrence and the far north of the province, Nouveau Qu\u00e9bec, to mining development. But growth was also visible in the manufacturing and service sectors. Qu\u00e9bec underwent a new wave of urbanization, its standard of living improved substantially, and Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois had greater access to the consumer society. Rural exodus speeded up and by 1960 farmers were a small minority of Qu\u00e9bec's economically active population.\n\nPost-War Prosperity\n\n\n\nQu\u00e9bec's population grew substantially from 3.3 million in 1941 to 5.3 million in 1961. The number of births increased (see Baby Boom) and remained at a high level until the early 1960s. Immigration, which had almost stopped in the 1930s and during the war, resumed. The many newcomers came from the British Isles as before, but also \u2014 and in greater numbers \u2014 from southern Europe, especially Italy and Greece. Montr\u00e9al became even more cosmopolitan, and by 1961 Italian Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois constituted the largest ethnic group of neither French nor British origin.\n\nEconomic growth also had significant social effects. It brought about the rise of a new middle class made up of highly skilled workers, executives, managers and teachers. This group increasingly favoured a modernization of the social and political structures of Qu\u00e9bec, in which traditionalism and social control by the church played too large a role. The gap between socioeconomic reality and the needs of the population on the one hand, and the traditionalism that characterized Qu\u00e9bec's institutions and structures on the other, was increasingly evident.\n\nA new urban sprawl developed around big cities as a result of the popularity of the automobile and of the single-family home surrounded by lawns and typified by the bungalow. Home ownership became easier for city dwellers, the vast majority of whom had been renters. The suburban ideal depicted in the media underpinned an updated perception of a housewife and mother supposedly spared the drudgery of the hardest domestic chores by the advent of electrical appliances. The number of married women in the labour market remained small, but the female workforce increased substantially because of the growing participation of unmarried women. In addition, the establishment of many new educational institutions for women gave girls an opportunity to receive more extensive training, even though social conventions still confined them to employment ghettos and lower-level positions (see Status of Women).\n\nTraditionalism\u2019s Last Gasp\n\n\n\nThroughout the postwar period the Qu\u00e9bec government was dominated by the Union Nationale Party under Maurice Duplessis. Maintained in power by Qu\u00e9bec's most traditional elements, political corruption and an outdated electoral map, Duplessis ran a conservative, narrow-minded government with a traditionalist vision of society. While the need for a wide range of reforms was even more strongly felt, the Union Nationale effectively delayed them.\n\nThe Duplessis government used Qu\u00e9bec nationalism to justify its policies. Its nationalism was traditionalist and conservative, emphasizing the classic themes of religion, language and the rural character of French Canada. It resisted the federal government in the name of provincial autonomy. At the same time, the federal government represented a new and reform-oriented brand of liberalism that attracted many young French-Canadian intellectuals, who described this period as the era of the \"Great Darkness.\" Moreover, the federal government was led by a French Canadian, Louis St-Laurent, who had strong backing from the Qu\u00e9bec electorate. Thus, much of that electorate simultaneously supported two first ministers of opposing orientations.\n\nThe Duplessis period was especially difficult for the trade union movement, which came into conflict with the anti-union policies of the government. A number of strikes, especially the Asbestos Strike of 1949, had wide repercussions. There were also changes within the unions themselves: the Catholic unions became more secular and radical (see Confederation of National Trade Unions; Qu\u00e9bec Union Centrals), and the merger of the two American trade union congresses, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (see AFL-CIO), led to a similar reorganization among Qu\u00e9bec affiliates.\n\nWith the support of Duplessis, the Catholic Church continued to enjoy considerable prestige and power. However, there were not enough members of the clergy to meet the growing demand for education, healthcare, and social services. Religious institutions were overwhelmed and hired lay staff, who demanded a voice in how things were to be run. The church hierarchy fought back and tried to strengthen its authority (for example, by replacing Monseigneur Joseph Charbonneau with Cardinal Paul-\u00c9mile L\u00e9ger in Montr\u00e9al), but it was steadily losing its ability to block the social change that even some priests supported.\n\nBecause of their revolt against the clergy, the authors of the Refus global manifesto (1948) were temporarily ostracized. In spite of this setback, the cultural world had become a cauldron of change under the impetus of television (1952), which was controlled by the federal government and was at lightning speed becoming the primary mass medium.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution and After (1960\u201380)\n\n\n\nSome of Qu\u00e9bec society's institutions \u2014 especially the educational system, the social services and the administrative arm of the provincial government \u2014 were increasingly ill suited to the postwar world. When Duplessis died in 1959, it was the signal for the start of a new era, known as the Quiet Revolution, which lasted roughly from 1960 to 1966. The political and ideological heritage of the Duplessis era was liquidated with a speed that indicated how little it corresponded to contemporary socioeconomic realities.\n\nA Series of Reforms\n\n\n\nThe provincial Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage (1960\u20131966), proceeded to modernize government institutions, the school system and social services. This direction was followed, though less spectacularly, by subsequent governments: the Union Nationale of Daniel Johnson (1966\u20131968) and Jean-Jacques Bertrand (1968\u20131970), the Liberal Party of Robert Bourassa (1970\u20131976) and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois under Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and Pierre-Marc Johnson (1976\u20131985).\n\nEducational reform was highly emblematic of the changes effected in the wake of the Quiet Revolution. The government amalgamated school boards and created a Department of Education. It established co-education in schools, developed secondary education, and created C\u00e9geps, or junior colleges (1967), and then the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (1968). The effect on francophones\u2019 level of education was dramatic.\n\nGovernment reform was equally far-reaching and entailed the establishment of new departments and agencies and the professionalization of public servants. Operating in full compliance with the principles of the welfare state, the Qu\u00e9bec government took a more interventionist approach, taking over control of hospitals and social services. It increased the number of state corporations. After the 1962 election and on the strength of its \u201cMa\u00eetres chez nous\u201d (\u201cMasters in our own house\u201d) slogan, it nationalized private electricity companies and incorporated them in Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec (see Electric Utilities).\n\nIn addition, a major effort was made to upgrade infrastructures, with the construction of highways, hydro-electric dams, schools and public buildings. The term \u201crattrapage,\u201d or \u201ccatching up,\u201d was used to refer to the ever-faster pace of modernization of all facets of Qu\u00e9bec society.\n\nWith the Quiet Revolution, Qu\u00e9bec society made a major break from its traditional roots. A long tradition came to a close as the influence of religion and the clergy faded rapidly. The Catholic Church lost its control over education and social services, and its political power declined. An even more serious blow to the institution was the fact that it lost its control over churchgoers in spite of the renewal resulting from the Second Vatican Council. Religious observance declined, the ranks of the clergy shrank, and the bishops lost their influence over people\u2019s minds.\n\nNote that Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Quiet Revolution occurred during the \u201croaring sixties.\u201d During that period, the Western world was in the throes of a cultural revolution \u2014 youth self-affirmation, the creation of new forms of music, liberalization of morals, etc. The Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois joined the cultural revolution enthusiastically, and the success of the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montr\u00e9al (Expo 67) reflected their openness to the world. In this context, a new Qu\u00e9bec voice found expression. Freed of the traditional canons of French-Canadian culture, poets, novelists, singers and other artists shaped a new Qu\u00e9bec and exerted a significant impact on the public at large.\n\nWhile the Quiet Revolution marked a major break with the past, it was nonetheless part of a centuries-old process of ongoing development of Qu\u00e9bec society. The effects of industrialization, urbanization and the growth of the service sector, all of which had been in process for a long time, were then fully felt. Other trends continued: a rising standard of living, the emergence of a new middle class and new elites, and a higher level of education.\n\nFrancophone Self-Affirmation\n\n\n\nWhile postwar prosperity brought benefits to francophones, it also made them see much more clearly the extent of ethnic discrimination. In the workplace, French Canadians were limited to subordinate jobs, while in Montr\u00e9al department stores and the public arena in general their language held second place to English.\n\nA new form of nationalism emerged. Unlike Duplessis' nationalism, it was essentially reformist and demanded a change in Qu\u00e9bec's position in Confederation. This new nationalism manifested itself in a number of different tendencies. There were the Liberals, who favoured greater autonomy for Qu\u00e9bec but remained federalists; the independence movement, which grew in size and credibility during the 1960s; and the socialists, working within a newly strong trade union movement and in intellectual circles, who wanted to go beyond reformism.\n\nMajor struggles for power took place in Qu\u00e9bec in the 1960s and 1970s between old and new elites and between francophones and anglophones. Especially noteworthy were battles over language, the economy and politics.\n\nThe struggle on the language front was aimed at having French, the language of the majority, fully recognized as Qu\u00e9bec's primary language. One major objective was to integrate Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois of neither French nor British origin into the French-speaking majority. This engagement was fought on the battleground of the language of education. The goal of making Qu\u00e9bec French was achieved in stages, and at each stage it encountered resistance from non-francophone groups (see Qu\u00e9bec Language Policy).\n\nIn the late 1960s, the language struggle was fought in the streets, but it later found its way into Qu\u00e9bec's National Assembly and, more generally, into the forum of public debate. Three language laws were passed by three different provincial governments between 1969 and 1977. Step by step, these pieces of legislation increased the pressure in favour of French, widened its recognition as Qu\u00e9bec's official language and made its use compulsory. The third of these laws, Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise (Charter of the French Language) also known as Bill 101, went well beyond the educational field. It was aimed not only at bringing more children into French schools but also at making Qu\u00e9bec a more francophone society, and dealt with corporations, professional services, public signs, etc. By 1980 French was spoken and recognized everywhere in the province. The anglophones, nevertheless, retained their own institutions and their language rights as is guaranteed by the constitution.\n\nAnother struggle was over the question of economic power. One government objective was to introduce changes into the workplace so that French Canadians would have better jobs and career opportunities in the private sector. Another goal was to support and assist French-Canadian businessmen and the companies they owned so that they would grow and gain a larger share of the market. A third aim was to have large Canadian and international corporations which operated in the province take Qu\u00e9bec's specific needs increasingly into account. A final objective was to make the Qu\u00e9bec government a major partner with private enterprise in Qu\u00e9bec's economic development. In the 1960s and 1970s francophones made considerable economic progress.\n\nThe growth of new French-Canadian financial groups was significant, as was the increasing intervention of the Qu\u00e9bec government in the economy through such publicly owned corporations as Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec. These successes, however, were counterbalanced by the weakening of Qu\u00e9bec's economic position as the country's economic centre of gravity moved westward. In 1960, Toronto replaced Montr\u00e9al as Canada's metropolis and many companies moved their head offices or manufacturing operations to Ontario.\n\nQu\u00e9bec\u2013Canada Relations\n\n\n\nThe third struggle was over political power within Canada. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s there were continuing attempts to increase Qu\u00e9bec's influence in Confederation and to revamp the division of powers between the two levels of government. The Qu\u00e9bec government's goal was to stem the tide of federal centralization and to make itself the government with primary responsibility for French Canadians. The debate over the Constitution was clearly one of the major themes of the 1960s and 1970s. It was marked by provocative statements and battles over protocol and appearance, and also by discussions, negotiations and federal-provincial conferences. Qu\u00e9bec's firm self-assertion during the Quiet Revolution was followed by a period of federal resistance to the provinces' desire to increase their autonomy; the new federal stance became explicit when Pierre Elliott Trudeau came to power in Ottawa in 1968.\n\nThis long political conflict even had some violent episodes with the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec and the October Crisis of 1970. It was nevertheless fought through the legal democratic system. Over a 20-year period, considerable effort and energy was expended on the crisis, which led to defeat for both the advocates of independence and supporters of a strong Qu\u00e9bec within the Canadian Federation. As a result, centralized federal power was strengthened and Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s minority status in Confederation was confirmed. In fact, the position of Qu\u00e9bec with respect to the federal government appeared to be improving. Under Trudeau (1968\u20131979 and 1980\u20131984) there were more Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois than ever before in Cabinet, and federal institutions adopted a far more pronounced bilingual stance. But these circumstances depended on the influence of Qu\u00e9bec representatives in the Liberal Party.\n\nIn addition, there were conflicts internal to French-Canadian society. The growing strength of the trade-union movement during the 1960s led in the next decade to serious confrontations between the major union federations and the provincial government. At the same time there were profound tensions within the new French-Canadian middle class, which had grown up gradually in the postwar period and occupied centre stage during the 1960s and 1970s. There was relative unanimity during the Quiet Revolution, but afterwards deep divisions appeared \u2014 politically, with the polarization between the Liberal Party and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and socially, with the tensions between trade union leaders and provincial government administrators.\n\nFighting Inequality\n\n\n\nAlthough the province enjoyed a higher standard of living, serious inequalities continued to characterize Qu\u00e9bec society during this period. There were regional inequalities \u2014 as Montr\u00e9al flourished while other regions remained underdeveloped \u2014 and social inequalities \u2014 as Qu\u00e9bec's unemployment rate was substantially higher than the Canadian average and many of its citizens lived in poverty. Awareness of these problems was much greater in the 1960s and 1970s, and demands for a change in the situation were increasingly heard.\n\nThese demands were reflected in the many citizens\u2019 committees that sprang up in cities in the late 1960s and in the frequent street demonstrations.\n\nEven Aboriginal people, long treated as wards of the federal state, called into question their subservience. The provincial government\u2019s interest in developing Northern Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s natural resources compelled it to take Aboriginal land claims into account, and this led to the James Bay and Northern Qu\u00e9bec Agreement (1975), the first large-scale agreement between Qu\u00e9bec and Indigenous persons.\n\nWomen played only a marginal role in the Quiet Revolution; it was men who largely brought it about. Claire Kirkland-Casgrain was the first woman to win a seat in the National Assembly (1961). Later she became a minister and pushed through legislation providing for the legal equality of spouses (1964). From 1966 on, the emergence of a new feminist movement that was more aggressive in its demands for change enabled Qu\u00e9bec women to make significant gains in birth control (see Abortion) and, more broadly, in terms of equal opportunity. From this time on, governments acknowledged the importance of the issue, adopting anti-discrimination policies and establishing the Council on the Status of Women (1973) and a position of Minister of State for the Status of Women (1979). At the same time, the number of women at university and in the workforce grew substantially.\n\nA Period of Uncertainty (1980\u201395)\n\n\n\nThe period of upheavals and rapid transformations that had characterized Qu\u00e9bec since the start of the Quiet Revolution ended in the early 1980s. The following period was marked with uncertainty and turbulence as the ebb and flow of economic and political development evidenced sharp turnarounds.\n\nEconomic Highs and Lows\n\n\n\nQu\u00e9bec was hard hit by the recession of 1981\u20131982. Recovery was slow but it finally took hold, allowing for strong growth in the second half of the decade. The good times abruptly ended with the severe depression of the early 1990s, and it was not before the middle of the decade that the economy gathered steam again. The effects of these major crises were compounded by the fundamental restructuring of the economy, which had begun to take place before 1980 but whose consequences were now fully felt. Qu\u00e9bec's traditional light manufacturing industries, based on the use of low-skilled, cheap labour, were badly hurt by the new international competition. Numerous old plants closed, unemployment rose dramatically and great numbers of people were forced to go on welfare. There were signs of hope as the new economy, with its emphasis on leading-edge technology, took hold in the manufacturing and service sectors and fuelled economic growth. The adjustment process was nevertheless painful as the discarded workers could not easily find employment in the new highly skilled workplace. After rising steadily since the end of the Second World War, purchasing power began to stagnate, but this was offset by the broad trend toward two-income households.\n\nAfter 1980, despite those problems, Qu\u00e9bec society harvested the benefits of the economic, educational and language policies adopted during the two previous decades. The rise of new generations of highly trained people transformed all walks of life. Women's participation in the workforce became much more significant as they made inroads in many previously male-dominated sectors. Generally speaking, francophones gained a much higher profile. In the large Canadian and American corporations operating in Qu\u00e9bec, where they had long been confined to the lower ranks, they rapidly rose to prominent positions. Private enterprises owned by francophones became much more numerous and powerful; some of them, such as Bombardier and Cascades, achieved the status of multinational corporations.\n\nFrancophone entrepreneurs' successes shed new light on the role of the private sector and stirred questions about a cornerstone of Quiet Revolution policies: government intervention in the economy. This led to a drive for privatization and deregulation during the 1980s and 1990s. Ever-increasing deficits forced governments to cut expenses and to reduce the level of services offered by the welfare state. The pace of reductions accelerated in the mid-1990s, as the objective of a zero deficit was laid out for the end of the century. In spite of this, the general public continued to believe in the Qu\u00e9bec model of social solidarity, and governments had to take this into account.\n\nPopulation Movements\n\n\n\nSignificant demographic changes also occurred. The Qu\u00e9bec population had increased from 5.3 million in 1961 to 6.4 million in 1981. But then the growth rate slowed down, and by 1996, the size of the population had reached 7.1 million. Since the late 1960s, the birth rate of people of French origin had steadily declined and now ranked among the lowest in the world, compromising the future growth of that group. The population of British origin declined sharply as a result of migration to other provinces. These factors contributed to the rise in importance of other minorities whose ranks were fuelled by immigration. Introduced in the 1960s, the federal government\u2019s new immigration policy served to broaden the range of groups represented in Qu\u00e9bec. It also put an end to the absolute preference given to Europeans and rules discriminating against Asians, Africans and Latin Americans. Furthermore, from the 1970s on, successive Qu\u00e9bec governments signed agreements with the federal government that gave them a greater role in the immigrant selection process. The results quickly became evident: in the last quarter of the 20th century, new immigrants came from all regions in the world, and French-speaking countries \u2014 particularly France but also Haiti (see Caribbean People) and the countries of the Maghreb \u2014 were by far the main sources of new immigrants. Their presence was now officially acknowledged and recognized through the cultural communities policy, the Qu\u00e9bec version of multiculturalism, which was praised in the media. Representatives from these groups held a larger sway in public debate and in politics.\n\nThe Constitutional Issue\n\n\n\nThe political scene was characterized by back and forth movements between sovereignty and renewed federalism and between the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the Liberal Party.\n\nThe referendum of 1980 on Sovereignty-Association dealt a severe blow to the independence movement. In 1982, the Canadian government, led by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, managed to repatriate the Canadian Constitution against Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s wishes, and as a result the province was faced with an arrangement that it had never accepted. After this double failure, Premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque proposed trying the option of renewed federalism again, a move which created a schism within the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. He resigned in 1985 and his successor, Pierre-Marc Johnson, lost the provincial election a few months later. The departure of L\u00e9vesque, and that of Prime Minister Trudeau the year before, marked the end of an era. Liberal Party leader Robert Bourassa, back in power as premier in 1985, joined forces with the new prime minister, Progressive Conservative Brian Mulroney. They attempted to solve the Qu\u00e9bec\u2013Canada wrangle by proposing new constitutional discussions. The ensuing Meech Lake Accord (see Meech Lake Accord: Document), which nominally recognized the distinct character of Qu\u00e9bec and was designed to pave the way for Qu\u00e9bec to accept the Constitutional Act of 1982 (seeConstitutional Law). The Accord was drafted in 1987, but failed to get the constitutional approval of Newfoundland and Manitoba in 1990.\n\nThe failure of the Accord was widely resented in Qu\u00e9bec and fuelled a renewed support for the idea of sovereignty. Bourassa then challenged the rest of Canada to come up with acceptable alternative proposals. But his strategy backfired. In 1992 he was compelled to accept the Charlottetown Accord, which was rejected by a majority of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in a provincial referendum, as well as by the voters in five of the nine other provinces. These events had two major political consequences. The first was the creation of a federal party devoted to the sovereignty of Qu\u00e9bec: the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, headed by Lucien Bouchard. In the federal elections of 1993, the Bloc swept the province and won 54 of the 75 seats, becoming the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. The second consequence was the return to power of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, now headed by Jacques Parizeau, who won the provincial election of 1994 against Daniel Johnson's Liberals. The PQ launched a second referendum on sovereignty in 1995, but lost by a narrow margin, even though it won the support of most francophones.\n\nIn the midst of these dramatic turns of events on the constitutional front, Qu\u00e9bec was shaken by the Oka crisis (1990), an uprising of Mohawk groups in the Montr\u00e9al region who were unhappy with the way their land claims were being handled. The Canadian army was eventually sent in and ended the conflict, but tensions continued to simmer.\n\nPolitical conflict and two recessions dominated the period from 1980 to 1995 and explain the gloomy climate noted by many observers. Yet in spite of these difficulties, conditions improved for Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s francophones. Many left Montr\u00e9al for the suburbs in the 450 area code belt, where it was easier to buy a home. In the suburbs, they were able to establish a relatively homogeneous community in which their ethnocultural group was clearly predominant.\n\nThe Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois were proud of their culture, which was now being enriched by people of many different origins. They supported their novelists, singers and actors, all of whom could even aspire to international fame and recognition. The development of the Francophonie enabled Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois artists to work outside their province and to contribute to the emergence of a French-speaking multicultural world.\n\nThe Dawn of a New Century (1996\u2013present)\n\n\n\nAfter the referendum failure of 1995, support for sovereignty fell dramatically, but the nationalist parties were still backed by a significant proportion of francophone voters. As a result, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was well represented in Ottawa for a dozen years or so and usually won the most seats in Qu\u00e9bec. It stood up to Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Prime Minister of Canada (1993\u20132003), and then took advantage of the sponsorship scandal, which discredited the Liberals in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nProvincially, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was still in power and won the 1998 election. In January 1996, Lucien Bouchard succeeded Jacques Parizeau as leader of the PQ and premier. He convened economic summits and tried to reduce the provincial deficit by making thousands of public servants take retirement. He played a high-profile role during the Ice Storm of January 1998, which cut electrical power supply to nearly half of the Qu\u00e9bec population. In 2000, he launched a project to amalgamate municipalities, which was highly controversial and was hotly debated. The following year, he quit politics and was replaced by Bernard Landry, who focused on assisting Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s economic recovery and signed the \u201cPaix des Braves,\u201d or \u201cThe Peace of the Braves,\u201d with the Cree Nation.\n\nDaniel Johnson resigned as leader of the Liberal Party in early 1998 and, after an extensive show of public support, Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest resigned his federal seat and agreed to take up the nomination to replace Johnson as leader of the Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party. Federalists and Liberals counted on Charest to defeat the PQ. He was unsuccessful in 1998, but he won in 2003 and stayed in power until 2012. Initially he tried to implement a neo-liberal program, triggering considerable public resentment, but then he changed his tack. Charest made headlines in 2007 by appointing a cabinet comprising an equal number of men and women and reflecting the growing number of women in the National Assembly. At the same time, the Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec, or ADQ, (1994\u20132012) rose in popularity under the leadership of Mario Dumont (see Mario Dumont Interview) and on the strength of a conservative platform. It made a breakthrough in the 2007 election and formed the official opposition for a short time until the 2008 election. In 2006, a new left-wing party called Qu\u00e9bec solidaire was established, and it won its first seat in the National Assembly in 2008.\n\nEconomic Recovery\n\n\n\nAfter 1995, the Qu\u00e9bec economy recovered significantly. Exports rose dramatically because of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see Free Trade) and a weak dollar, but this growth would be jeopardized a few years later by competition from Chinese producers and a stronger dollar. Growth in demand from China triggered very strong interest in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s mining resources, which kick-started economic activity in resource-based regions that had been hurt by the decline in the lumber industry. Premier Charest took further steps to strengthen resource development by introducing his Plan Nord (2011). Another economic driver was residential construction, which expanded during the first 10 years of the 21st century, just as housing prices took off.\n\nIn these favourable conditions, population growth picked up. Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s population grew from 7.1 million in 1996 to 7.9 million in 2011. In a major reversal of trends, the birth rate started to rise again. This was probably due in part to the incentive policies introduced by the PQ and Liberal governments, including the $5/day daycare program (1997) and the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan (2006). Women\u2019s organizations had been calling for these initiatives for a long time, and the fact that a large percentage of the labour force was now made up of women with children largely explains why they were introduced.\n\nPopulation growth was also fuelled by continuing high levels of immigration. French-speaking countries, especially France and the countries of the Maghreb, were still among the main sources of immigration, but migration from Eastern Europe, Latin-American countries and China increased too. This new diversity in the immigrant population was not only ethnic but also religious, so in 1997 Qu\u00e9bec passed a constitutional amendment replacing confessional school boards with language-based school boards. Diversity was praised by some but feared by others. In 2007, in response to public alarm over immigration, the Charest government struck the Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences (Bouchard-Taylor Commission), which advocated harmonious integration through interculturalism.\n\nAn Unsettled Period\n\n\n\nToward the end of the decade, investigative reporters exposed corrupt practices in the construction industry and government contracts connected with illegal financing of political parties. There were calls from many quarters for an in-depth inquiry. The Charest government resisted the calls for a long time, but it finally agreed in 2011 and established the Charbonneau Commission. The subsequent hearings brought home the extent of the problem.\n\nAt the end of its term, the government had to deal with a student revolt against university tuition fee hikes. It had backed off in the face of an earlier student strike in 2005, but this time it held firm. Symbolized by the red square on the strikers\u2019 clothes, the student protest turned into a social movement. It was called the Maple Spring and expressed public dissatisfaction with the Liberal government (see 2012 Qu\u00e9bec Student Strike).\n\nIn the 2012 election, the Liberal Party lost power to the PQ, which then had to run a minority government. Dissident sovereigntist groups attracted many voters, and a new party called Coalition avenir Qu\u00e9bec won a number of seats. Pauline Marois became the first female premier of Qu\u00e9bec. Her government attacked political corruption and introduced measures to protect the environment (end of nuclear energy, asbestos production, and shale gas exploration). Its most controversial initiative was the Charter of Qu\u00e9bec Values, the goal of which was to standardize accommodation practices and affirm state secularism by prohibiting government representatives from wearing conspicuous religious symbols.\n\nMarois\u2019 term was short-lived, however. Hoping to win a majority, she called an election for the spring of 2014. The PQ\u2019s share of the popular vote dropped significantly, and the Liberal Party, under Philippe Couillard, won a majority. Coalition avenir Qu\u00e9bec and Qu\u00e9bec solidaire won seats too.\n\nThis overview of nearly 150 years of Qu\u00e9bec history has shed light on the many changes Qu\u00e9bec society has gone through. The French-speaking population is its largest component, its soul, and its raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 its development and progress have been significant. Thanks to the impetus of the Quiet Revolution, francophones were able to significantly improve their position within their own province and to shed the feeling of being second-class citizens.\n\nHowever, they failed in their attempt to redefine Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s relationship with the rest of Canada. Over the last century and a half, Qu\u00e9bec society has been transformed in major ways. Its evolution was not linear, but involved taking steps forward and back. There were winners and losers in the process and inequalities persisted. Continuing tensions show that Qu\u00e9bec is a complex society and that its history cannot be explained in simplistic terms. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois themselves have been, and still are, far from unanimous in their interpretation of Qu\u00e9bec's past, its future goals and its politics."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sovereignty-association", "page_content": "\\u00a9 Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hudon.

PreviousNext\n\nIntroduced in the document Option Qu\u00e9bec (tr. An Option for Qu\u00e9bec), written by the MSA leader Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, the expression sovereignty-association (or souverainet\u00e9-association in French) replaced the word independence and implied the idea of an association that would evolve from an agreement under international law and be limited to the economic domain (1967). In the 1970 PQ program, La Solution (1970), it is not presented as a necessary condition for Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s accession to sovereignty.\n\nAfter the Qu\u00e9bec referendum of 1980, the PQ\u2019s adoption of the strategy of the beau risque, which set the sovereignty option aside, in 1984, and the election of Jacques Parizeau as leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the use of the expression sovereignty-association declined, and the simpler term sovereignty gained ascendancy. Within the sovereignist movement, the defenders of sovereignty-association, like those of the \u201cgo-slow\u201d strategy, came to be regarded as the moderate wing, often described as mous (soft), as opposed to the hardline wing \u2014 the purs et durs.\n\nOrigins of Sovereignty-Association and the Referendum Strategy\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque left the Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party on 14 October 1967 and founded the MSA on 19 November 1967. At the time, the MSA appeared more moderate than the Rassemblement pour l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance nationale (RIN), from the standpoints both of economic policy and of anticolonialist rhetoric. It was on the specific issue of association that the negotiations between the RIN and the MSA broke down. When the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was founded in 1968, the RIN was disbanded, and its members were invited to join the PQ as individuals.\n\nStarting with the PQ congress in 1974, sovereignty-association became linked with the go-slow strategy proposed by Claude Morin. First, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois set aside the option of an independence election leading to sovereignty without a referendum. So as not to frighten voters, the PQ instead committed to holding a referendum once it had assumed power. Then a third step was added, making two referendums necessary: a first giving the Qu\u00e9bec government the authority to negotiate with the rest of Canada, and a second leading to sovereignty.\n\nDoctrine of Sovereignty-Association\n\nIn October 1978, Premier L\u00e9vesque declared in the National Assembly that Qu\u00e9bec had to radically transform its union with the rest of Canada, and that sovereignty and association should come about \"smoothly and simultaneously.\" In what came to be called the White Paper on Sovereignty-Association (La nouvelle entente Qu\u00e9bec-Canada), the PQ government claimed that \"sovereignty is indissolubly linked with association.\"\n\nThe document went on to describe the doctrine more fully: it foresaw a common monetary system with the rest of Canada, coupled with a reorganization of the tasks of the present Bank of Canada into new common institutions, including a central monetary authority. It also presupposed a joint free-trade zone and a common external tariff (though each of the two communities could protect its own agriculture). It allowed for the free passage of goods and persons between Qu\u00e9bec and Canada, and a variety of special agreements concerning jobs and immigration. A community council, composed of an equal number of ministers from each side and presided over alternately by a Canadian and a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, would settle any disputes that might arise.\n\nThree other Qu\u00e9bec-Canada institutions were proposed: a committee of experts to serve (under the council) as general secretariat to the community; a court of justice consisting of an equal number of Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian judges with exclusive jurisdiction over the interpretation and workings of the association treaty; and a joint monetary authority responsible for the management of the single exchange rate, but not for the debt of the two sovereign partners (each would handle its own). Sovereignty-association, in the view of the White Paper, was not an end in itself, but a means by which Qu\u00e9bec could freely direct its own affairs. Qu\u00e9bec would thus enjoy the economic advantages of the federal union and the benefits of political independence.\n\nDecline of Sovereignty-Association\n\nIn May 1980, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government used a referendum to ask the people of Qu\u00e9bec for a mandate to negotiate sovereignty-association, thus defined, with the federal and other provincial authorities. The PQ lost the vote (60 per cent to 40 per cent). In 1984, after consultation with its membership, the PQ decided to put aside this option, and not make it the party\u2019s platform in the next election. The beau risque (bold risk) was a constitutional reform strategy championed by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and made possible by the election of the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in Ottawa. This strategy led to internal dissent, and a group of dissidents faithful to the party\u2019s basic objective, including Jacques Parizeau, decided to leave. At the urging of the PQ\u2019s new leader, Pierre-Marc Johnson, the party adopted the concept of \u201cnational affirmation\u201d in the first article of its program, doing away with the concept of sovereignty-association. The PQ subsequently lost the Qu\u00e9bec election of 1985.\n\nThe PQ\u2019s referendum strategy evolved considerably after Jacques Parizeau became party leader in 1988. The term sovereignty was retained without being linked to the term association. In the Qu\u00e9bec referendum of 1995, the question asked no longer mentioned association, but instead proposed an economic and political partnership with the rest of Canada. Unlike the conditions in the 1980 referendum, in the 1995 referendum, Qu\u00e9bec could have acceded to sovereignty if the Yes side had won and negotiations with Canada had subsequently failed. Thus sovereignty-partnership would appear to be defined more as a form of political independence, whereas sovereignty-association meant a new agreement on Confederation.\n\nSee also French Canadian nationalism; Separatism; Constitutional History."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/history-since-confederation", "page_content": "Convention at Charlottetown, P.E.I., of Delegates from the Legislatures of Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island to take into consideration the Union of the British North American Colonies. September 11, 1864, Charlottetown, PEI. George P. Roberts / Library and Archives Canada / C-000733\n\n\n\n\n\nIts development can be broken into the following periods:\n\n(1867-1913) Immigration and Industrialization\n\n(1914-1918) War, Victory and Autonomy\n\n(1919-1938) Labour Unrest and the Great Depression\n\n(1939-1945) Second World War\n\n(1945-1971) Cold War and the Qu\u00e9bec Agenda\n\n(1972-1980) The Inflation Curse and Regional Divides\n\n(1981-1992) The Constitution Decade\n\n(1993-2005) Liberal Hegemony \u2014 and Collapse\n\n(2006-2014) Rise of the West\n\n(1867-1913) Immigration and Industrialization\n\nIn 1867, the new state\u2014beginning with Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario\u2014expanded extraordinarily in less than a decade, stretching from sea to sea. Rupert's Land, from northwestern Qu\u00e9bec to the Rockies and north to the Arctic, was purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869-70. From it were carved Manitoba and the Northwest Territories in 1870. A year later, British Columbia entered Confederation on the promise of a transcontinental railway. Prince Edward Island was added in 1873. Alberta and Saskatchewan won provincial status in 1905, after mass immigration at the turn of the century began to fill the vast Prairie West (see Territorial Evolution).\n\nSir John A. Macdonald's Dream\n\nUnder the leadership of the first federal prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and his chief Qu\u00e9bec colleague, Sir George-\u00c9tienne Cartier, the Conservative Party \u2014 almost permanently in office until 1896 \u2014 committed itself to the expansionist National Policy. It showered the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) with cash and land grants, achieving its completion in 1885. The government erected a high, protective customs-tariff wall to shield developing Canadian industrialism from foreign, especially American, competition. The other objective, mass settlement of the west, largely eluded them, but success came to their Liberal successors after 1896. Throughout this period there were detractors who resented the CPR's monopoly or felt \u2014 as did many in the West and on the East Coast \u2014 that the high tariff principally benefited central Canada. Yet the tariff had support in some parts of the Maritimes.\n\nRise of Radical Nationalism\n\nThe earliest post-Confederation years saw the flowering of two significant movements of intense nationalism. In English Canada the very majesty of the great land, the ambitions and idealism of the educated young and an understanding that absorption by the United States threatened a too-timid Canada, all spurred the growth of the Canada First movement in literature and politics \u2014 promoting an Anglo-Protestant race and culture in Canada, and fierce independence from the U.S.. The Canada Firsters' nationalist-imperialist vision of grandeur for their country did not admit the distinctiveness of the French, Roman Catholic culture that was a part of the nation's makeup.\n\nThe group's counterparts in Qu\u00e9bec, the ultramontanes, believed in papal supremacy, in the Roman Catholic Church and in the clerical domination of society. Their movement had its roots in the European counter-revolution of the mid-19th century. It found fertile soil in a French Canada resentful at re-conquest by the British after the abortive Rebellions of 1837, and distrustful of North American secular democracy. The coming of responsible government in Nova Scotia and in the Province of Canada by 1850, and of federalism in the new Confederation, encouraged these clericalist zealots to try to \"purify\" Qu\u00e9bec politics and society on conservative Catholic lines. The bulwark of Catholicism and of Canadien distinctiveness was to be the French language. Confederation was a necessary evil, the least objectionable non-Catholic association for their cultural nation. Separatism was dismissed as unthinkable and impractical, in the face of the threats posed by American secularism and materialism. But a pan-Canadian national vision was no part of their view of the future.\n\nThese two extreme, antithetical views of Canada could co-exist so long as the English-speaking and French-speaking populations remained separate, and little social or economic interchange was required. But as the peopling of border and frontier areas in Ontario and the West continued, and as the industrialization of Qu\u00e9bec accelerated, conflicts multiplied. The harsh ultramontane attacks on liberal Catholicism and freedom of thought in Qu\u00e9bec alarmed Protestant opinion in English Canada, while the lack of toleration of Catholic minority school rights and of the French language outside Qu\u00e9bec infuriated the Qu\u00e9becois (see Manitoba Schools Question). Increasing, social and economic domination of Qu\u00e9bec by the Anglophone Canadian business class exacerbated the feeling.\n\nProsperity and Growth\n\nEconomic growth was slow at first and varied widely from region to region. Industrial development steadily benefited southern Ontario, the upper St Lawrence River Valley and parts of the Maritimes. But rural Ontario west of Toronto and most of backcountry Qu\u00e9bec steadily lost population as modern farming techniques, soil depletion and steep increases in American agricultural tariffs permitted fewer farmers to make their living on the land. Emigration from the Maritimes was prompted by a decline of the traditional forestry and shipbuilding industries. The Maritime economy was also hurt by the withering of bilateral trading links with the New England states, due in part to Ottawa's protectionist National Policy. Nationwide, from the 1870s through the 1890s, 1.5 million Canadians left the country, mostly for the U.S. (see Population).\n\nConstruction gang in the 1870s reducing an embankment (courtesy PAO).\n\nFortunately, prosperous times came at last, with the rising tide of immigration\u2014just over 50,000 immigrants arrived in 1901, jumping to eight times that figure 12 years later. A country of 4.8 million in 1891 swelled to 7.2 million in 1911. The prairie \"wheat boom\" was a major component of the national success. Wheat production shot up from 8 million bushels in 1896 to 231 million bushels in 1911. Prairie population rose as dramatically, necessitating the creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905 and the completion of two new cross-Canada railways \u2014 the Grand Trunk Pacific and the Canadian Northern. Western cities, especially Winnipeg and Vancouver, experienced breakaway expansion as trading and shipping centres. Nearly 30 per cent of the new immigration went to Ontario, with Toronto taking the lion's share for its factories, stockyards, stores and construction gangs. Both Toronto and Montr\u00e9al more than doubled their population in the 20 years before 1914.\n\nSocial Change, Government Expansion\n\nAs Canada increasingly became an urban and industrial society, the self-help and family-related social-assistance practices of earlier times were outmoded. The vigorous Social Gospel movement among Protestants and the multiplication of social-assistance activities by Roman Catholic orders and agencies constituted impressive responses, however inadequate. Governments, especially at the provincial level, expanded their roles in education, labour and welfare. An increasingly significant presence in social reform work was that of women, who also began to exert pressure for the vote.\n\nThrough immigration, Canada was becoming a multicultural society, at least in the West and in the major, growing industrial cities. Roughly one-third of the immigrants came from non-English-speaking Europe. Ukrainians, Russian Jews, Poles, Germans, Italians, Dutch and Scandinavians were the principal groups. In BC there were small but increasing populations of Chinese, Japanese and East Indians. There were growing signs of unease among both English and French Canadians about the presence of so many \"strangers,\" but the old social makeup of Canada had been altered forever.\n\nResistance in the West\n\nMeanwhile, there was a reduction in the extent of territories controlled by First Nations, and in their degree of self-determination. In the Arctic, the Inuit remained largely undisturbed, but most western First Nations and M\u00e9tis people lost their way of life as white settlement, farming and railroads encroached on much of their hunting lands. In 1869-70 in the Red River region, and in 1885 at Batoche in Saskatchewan, there were unsuccessful armed M\u00e9tis resistance movements led by Louis Riel (see Red River Resistance; North-West Resistance). During the second uprising some First Nations groups were directly involved. Otherwise the settlement of the West was generally peaceful \u2014 land was obtained in exchange for treaty and reservation rights for First Nations, and through land grants to the M\u00e9tis. Order was kept by the new, North-West Mounted Police.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nIn 1896 the prime ministership of Canada passed to the Qu\u00e9becois Liberal Roman Catholic Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He presided over the greatest prosperity Canadians had yet seen, but his 15 years of power were bedeviled and then ended by difficult problems in Canada's relationships with Britain and the U.S.. During Laurier's tenure, Britain's interest in a united and powerful empire intensified. Many English Canadians were swept up in Imperial emotion and Canadian nationalist ambition, and called for an enlarged imperial role for Canada. They forced the Laurier government to send troops to aid Britain in the South African War, 1899-1902, and to begin a Canadian navy in 1910. In the same spirit came a massive Canadian contribution of men and money to the British cause in the cataclysm of the First World War.\n\nBy then the Laurier administration had been defeated, in part because too many English Canadian imperialists thought it was \"not British enough,\" and because the growing nationaliste movement in Qu\u00e9bec, led by Henri Bourassa, was sure that it was \"too British,\" and would involve young Qu\u00e9bec boys in foreign wars of no particular concern to Canada. But the chief cause of Laurier's defeat in the general election of 1911 was his proposed reciprocity or free trade agreement with the U.S., which would have led to the reciprocal removal or lowering of duties on the so-called \"natural\" products of farms, forests and fisheries.\n\nThe captains of Canadian finance, manufacturing and transport excited the strong Canadian suspicions of American economic intentions and, with their support, the Conservative Opposition under Robert Borden convinced the electorate that Canada's separate national economy and imperial trading possibilities were about to be thrown away for economic, and possibly political, absorption by the U.S..\n\n(1914-1918) War, Victory and Autonomy\n\nAlthough economic fears helped propel Borden into power, his government was soon preoccupied not with trade or the economy, but overseas war. Europe's great powers had embarked on a conflict like the world had never seen, and as Britain was drawn into the First World War, so automatically was Canada. There was extraordinary voluntary participation on land, at sea and in the air by Canadians (see Wartime Home Front). But in 1917 the country was split severely over the question of conscription, or compulsory military service. The question arose as a result of a severe shortage of Allied manpower on the Western Front in Europe. The subsequent election of a pro-conscription Union government of English Canadian Liberals and Conservatives under Borden, over Laurier's Liberal anti-conscriptionist rump \u2014 its support drawn largely from French Canadians, non-British immigrants and radical labour elements \u2014 dramatized the national split.\n\nCanada Emerges on World Stage\n\nYet the war also had a positive impact on Canada. Industrial productivity and efficiency had been stimulated. Canada won a new international status, as a separate signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, and as a charter member of the new League of Nations. And the place of women in Canadian life had been upgraded dramatically. They had received the vote federally, primarily for partisan political reasons. But their stellar war service, often in difficult and dirty jobs hitherto thought unfeminine, had won them a measure of respect; they had also gained a taste for fuller participation in the work world. Canadian men and women, on a much broadened social scale, had been drawn into the mainstream of a western consumer civilization.\n\nThe war itself ushered in slaughter on an industrial scale, and Canada paid a high price. Among the roughly 630,000 who served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, 425,000 were sent overseas \u2014 witnessing the horrors of battlefields at Ypres, Vimy, Passchendaele and elsewhere. By the end, more than 234,000 Canadians had been killed or wounded in the war.\n\nBy 1919, the attempted shift to a peacetime economy was soon clouded by high inflation and unemployment, as well as disastrously low world grain prices. Labour unrest increased radically, farmer protests toppled governments in the West and Ontario, and the economy of the Maritimes collapsed. Resentment over conscription remained intense in Qu\u00e9bec. The early national period of Canadian innocence was over.\n\n(1919-1938) Labour Unrest and the Great Depression\n\nCanada's population between the world wars rose from 8 to 11 million; the urban population increased at a more rapid rate from 4 to 6 million. The First World War created expectations for a brave new Canada, but peace brought disillusionment and social unrest. Enlistment in the armed forces and the expansion of the munitions industry had created a manpower shortage during the war, which in turn had facilitated collective bargaining by industrial workers. There had been no dearth of grievances about wages or working conditions, but the demands of patriotism had usually restrained the militant. Trade-union membership grew from a low of 143,000 in 1915 to a high of 379,000 in 1919, and with the end of the war the demands for social justice were no longer held in check. Even unorganized workers expected peace to bring them substantial economic benefits.\n\nLabour Troubles\n\nEmployers had a different perspective. Munitions contracts were abruptly cancelled and factories had to retool for domestic production. The returning veterans added to the disruption by flooding the labour market. Some entrepreneurs and political leaders were also disturbed by the implications of the 1917 Russian Revolution and were quick to interpret labour demands, especially when couched in militant terms, as a threat to the established order. The result was the bitterest industrial strife in Canadian history. In 1919, with a labour force of some 3 million, almost 4 million working days were lost because of strikes and lockouts. The best-known of that year, the Winnipeg General Strike, has a symbolic significance: it began as a strike by construction unions for union recognition and higher wages, but quickly broadened to a sympathy strike by organized and unorganized workers in the city. Businessmen and politicians at all levels of government feared a revolution. Ten strike leaders were arrested and a demonstration was broken up by mounted policemen. After five weeks the strikers accepted a token settlement, and the strike was effectively broken.\n\nIndustrial strife continued, with average annual losses of a million working days until the mid-1920s. By then the postwar recession had been reversed and wages and employment levels were at record highs for the rest of the decade. Some labour militants turned from the economic to the political sphere, becoming successful early in the decade in provincial elections in Nova Scotia, Ontario and the four western provinces, and J.S. Woodsworth, the pioneering preacher-turned socialist politician, was elected in north Winnipeg in the 1921 federal election.\n\nMackenzie King and the New Politics\n\nThe war also left a heritage of grievances in rural society. Rural depopulation had accelerated during the war, but the farmers' frustration was directed against the Union government of Sir Robert Borden, which had first promised exemptions and then conscripted farm workers. A sudden drop in prices for farm produce increased their bitterness. In postwar provincial elections, farmers' parties formed governments in Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, and in the federal election of 1921, won by William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberals, the new Progressive Party captured an astonishing 65 seats on a platform of lower tariffs, lower freight rates and government marketing of farm products.\n\nThese social protests declined by the end of the decade. Industrial expansion, financed largely by American investment, provided work in the automotive industry, in pulp and paper and in mining. Farm incomes rose after the postwar recession, reaching a high of over $1 billion in 1927. The political system also offered some accommodation. Most provincial governments introduced minimum wages shortly after the war, and the federal government reduced tariffs and freight rates and introduced old-age pensions. By the end of the decade the impetus for social change had dissipated. Even wartime prohibition experiments had given way to the lucrative selling of liquor by provincial boards.\n\nGreat Depression\n\nUnemployment victims during the Depression resorted to the soup kitchens like this one in Montreal in 1931, operated by voluntary and church organizations. After a meal, most people returned to the alleyways, parks, or flop-houses for the night (National Archives of Canada/PA-168131).\n\nBut the good times of the late 1920s didn't last. In fact, they masked brewing trouble in financial markets, and the coming trauma of the Great Depression. For wheat farmers it began in 1930 when the price of wheat dropped below $1 a bushel. Three years later it was down to about 40 cents and the price of other farm products had dropped as precipitously. Prairie farmers were the hardest hit because they relied on cash crops, and because the depressed prices happened to coincide with a cyclical period of drought, which brought crop failures and a lack of feed for livestock. Cash income for prairie farmers dropped from a high of $620 million in 1928 to a low of $177 million in 1931 and did not reach $300 million until 1939.\n\nDisaster also struck many industrial workers who lost their jobs. Unemployment statistics are not reliable partly because there was no unemployment insurance and so no bookkeeping records, but it is estimated that unemployment rose from three per cent of the labour force in 1929 to 20 per cent in 1933. It was still 11 per cent by the end of the decade. Even these figures are misleading: the labour force included only those who were employed or looking for work, excluding most women. Those identified as unemployed were often the only breadwinners in the family.\n\nRole of Government Evolves\n\nVoters turned to governments for an economic security that the system could not provide. Most governments were slow or unable to respond and were replaced by others at the first opportunity. King's Liberals, elected in 1926 after a brief period of Conservative rule, were again rejected in 1930, this time in favour of a Conservative government under R.B. Bennett. New political parties arose across the ideological spectrum, contesting the 1935 federal election \u2014 the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), Social Credit and the short-lived Reconstruction Party \u2014 with promises to regulate credit and business.\n\nEven Bennett's Conservatives promised improvements (see Bennett's New Deal), and Mackenzie King and the Liberals, who won the election, spoke vaguely of reform. At the provincial level, the Union Nationale was elected in Qu\u00e9bec under Maurice Duplessis and Social Credit in Alberta under William Aberhart. Older parties in other provinces often turned to new and more dynamic leaders who promised active intervention on behalf of the less privileged.\n\nGovernments tried to provide emergency relief, but they too soon needed help. Prairie farmers needed relief in the form of food, fuel and clothing, but they also needed money for seed grain, livestock forage and machinery repairs. Neither municipal nor provincial governments could meet these demands for assistance; in the drought year of 1937 almost two-thirds of Saskatchewan's population required some relief. Other provinces had declining revenues but were not as close to bankruptcy, with the possible exception of Alberta. Inevitably, as the Depression continued, the federal government had to contribute to relief costs.\n\nThe role of governments changed, but not dramatically. Most governments would have preferred to provide jobs by undertaking major public-works projects, but with declining revenues and limited credit the cost of materials and equipment was prohibitive. Direct relief was cheaper in the short run. Governments did become more involved in the regulation of business: mortgages and interest payments were scaled down by legislation, and new regulatory institutions such as the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Wheat Board were established. The major expansion of the bureaucracy, however, would come only after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.\n\nTrade-union activity revived with the beginning of industrial recovery: by 1937 trade-union membership was back to the 1919 level. Canadian auto workers and miners followed the American lead and formed industrial unions. Their effectiveness was limited by the opposition of Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn and Duplessis in Qu\u00e9bec, and the significant gains, once again, would come only during the war.\n\nA New Culture: Cars and Radio\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, two machines may have done more than the highs and lows of the business cycle to alter the Canadian way of life: the automobile and the radio. The 1920s were the decade of the car \u2014 in 1919 there was one car in Canada for every 40 people; 10 years later it was one car for every 10. The car created Canadian suburbs and altered the social patterns of the young.\n\nIn the 1930s it was the radio: there were half-a-million receiving sets in 1930 and over a million by 1939, bringing news and entertainment into most Canadian homes. The changes brought about by mass production and popular entertainment posed problems for Canadian identity. The tariff (see Protectionism) provided Canadian jobs by ensuring that cars and radios would be assembled in Canada. There was little concern at the time for one economic side effect: the expansion of U.S. manufacturing branch-plants. But there was concern for the broadcasting of American programs by Canadian radio stations. The result was the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, with French and English networks broadcasting a combination of Canadian and popular American programs. By 1939 Canadians looked to governments to provide cautious assistance in maintaining Canadian identity.\n\n(1939-1945) Second World War\n\nBefore the outbreak of another world war, Canada played host to the first overseas visit by a reigning British (and Canadian) monarch. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (later called the Queen Mother) spent one month crossing the country by train. In an age before television, it was a dazzling event, one of the greatest public spectacles in Canadian history. The royal couple was greeted by enormous crowds wherever they went in both French and English Canada, and the tour witnessed the first-ever royal walkabout \u2014 when the couple plunged into a crowd to shake hands at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The underlying purpose of the visit was to rally support in North America for the coming Allied war against Nazi Germany, and it wasn't long before Canada was once again transforming itself into a warrior nation.\n\nIn Confederation Square, Ottawa, across the street from the Chateau Laurier.

More than a million Canadians served full-time in the armed forces between 1939-1945, allowing Canada to play a critical role in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Allied bombing campaigns over Europe, the invasions of Italy and Normandy, and the subsequent liberation campaign in western Europe. More than 45,000 Canadians died fighting in Hong Kong, Dieppe, on the Atlantic and across Europe.\n\nCanada's political landscape had been fundamentally changed by the First World War. During the Second, many predicted another transformation. In 1943 the socialist Commonwealth-Co-operative Federation (CCF) party, a product of 1930s political discontent, stood highest in new public opinion polls. It became the official Opposition in Ontario in 1943 and in 1944 won decisively in Saskatchewan. In Qu\u00e9bec, Maurice Duplessis's Union Nationale recaptured power. Federally, Qu\u00e9bec's Bloc populaire retaliated against conscription in 1944. Once again it seemed that the traditional Canadian party system would become a casualty of a European war.\n\nLiberal Era Dawns in Ottawa\n\nIn the federal election of 11 June 1945 \u2014 held while thousands of veterans were just beginning to come home \u2014 Canadians returned the Liberal Party to office. Mackenzie King's majority was very small, but his survival is nevertheless remarkable: among Allied wartime leaders, only King and Stalin led their countries through both the war and the peacemaking.\n\nIn 1945, the Liberals added a new commitment to social welfare and Keynesian management of the economy (see Keynesian Economics). Liberal welfare policies \u2014 including family allowance begun in 1944, and unemployment insurance (see Employment Insurance), begun in 1940 \u2014 attracted many workers and farmers, and rebuffed the challenges from the CCF on the left and the Conservatives on the right. Although the national Liberals continued to enjoy support in all regions and from all economic groups, the CCF and Social Credit held power, respectively, in Saskatchewan and Alberta throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s, and Social Credit governed BC from 1952 to 1972.\n\n(1945-1971) Cold War and the Qu\u00e9bec Agenda\n\nSome historians have attributed Liberal political success to the postwar period's unparalleled prosperity, and to consensus on foreign policy arising from Cold War fears \u2014 few objected when Canada joined the United Nations (UN) in 1945 or, four years later, signed the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO), and then followed this by sending troops to NATO bases in Europe in 1951. Canadians understood that the nation needed political stability, and a highly competent cabinet and bureaucracy, after depression and war.\n\nLouis St. Laurent and Korea\n\nThe Korean War once again embroiled Canadian troops in overseas combat, this time as part of a UN-led coalition of 16 countries fighting the Communist forces of China and North Korea. Nearly 27,000 Canadian military personnel served in Korea between 1950-1953. Five hundred sixteen Canadians lost their lives, and about 1,200 more were wounded.\n\nIn 1954, Canada's prosperity, and the national consensus on Cold War issues and other foreign policy matters began to disappear. There was a sharp economic slump in 1954, followed by worries that Canada's postwar boom was too dependent upon (mainly American) foreign investment. The cabinet's competency obviously weakened in 1954 when three prominent ministers, Douglas Abbott, Lionel Chevrier and Brooke Claxton, resigned from the government of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. In 1956 the Pipeline Debate revealed apparent Liberal arrogance and political clumsiness. Western allies also became divided during the Suez Crisis when France, Britain and Israel attacked Egypt, and the U.S. and Canada did not support them. The Crisis put Canadian diplomat Lester Pearson on the world stage, as a pioneer of UN peacekeeping, as a means of defusing the conflict.\n\nJohn Diefenbaker\n\nOn 10 June 1957 the Conservative Party ended the Liberals' long reign in Ottawa. Most significant in explaining the victory was the Conservatives' choice of John Diefenbaker as leader. He brought a flamboyance and a populist appeal that his predecessor, George Drew, completely lacked. He was also a western Canadian who understood and shared the area's grievances against Ottawa. Diefenbaker's brief first term saw taxes cut and pensions raised. The new government also took Canada into the North American Aerospace Defence (NORAD) agreement with the U.S., and two years later scrapped the Avro Arrow interceptor and purchased Bomarc missiles, effective only with nuclear warheads.\n\nThe Arrow was the most advanced military aircraft of its time but it was cancelled, and Canada purchased American equipment instead (courtesy The Arrow Heads/Boston Mills Press).\n\nSeeking escape from the confines of a minority government, Diefenbaker called an election for 31 March 1958. Although the Liberals now had Lester Pearson as leader, Diefenbaker won 208 of 265 seats on the strength of his charisma, his \"vision\" of a new Canada and his policy of northern development. His support was well distributed, except in Newfoundland (which had become the 10th province in 1949).\n\nNo one had predicted the extent of the Conservative triumph, but that did not prevent many commentators at the time from forecasting a Conservative dynasty and a return to the two-party system. Today, historians and political scientists tend to consider the 1958 election as an aberration that neither reflected nor affected the fundamental character of Canadian politics. Yet closer scrutiny reveals a lasting imprint. Since 1958 Conservatives have commanded western Canadian federal politics, and Liberals have found western seats increasingly difficult to obtain. On the other hand, Conservatives, who won 50 seats in Qu\u00e9bec in 1958, did not recover from Diefenbaker's failure to build upon his victory there for more than 25 years.\n\nProvincial Political Change\n\nThe CCF and the Liberals began rebuilding almost immediately\u2014the Liberals by appealing to urban Canadians and Francophones, and the CCF by strengthening its links with organized labour. Provincial bases were important in this reconstruction. Social Credit governments in Alberta and, to a much lesser extent, BC assisted the Liberals. Within five days in June 1960, the Liberals were elected in Qu\u00e9bec and New Brunswick. In Qu\u00e9bec, Jean Lesage modernized Qu\u00e9bec liberal traditions and introduced the Quiet Revolution.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, the CCF made sacrifices for its federal counterpart. Long-time Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas went to Ottawa to lead the CCF's heir, the New Democratic Party, whose formation was an attempt to create a closer link with the labour movement. Without Douglas, the NDP in Saskatchewan bravely introduced medicare in 1962 and, under the lash of a scare campaign, lost the next election to the Liberals. Medicare, however, proved successful and soon became a popular national program.\n\nBy 1962 Diefenbaker's 1958 \"vision\" of Canada had become a nightmare to some and a joke to others. There had been postwar peaks in unemployment, record budget deficits and, in May 1962, a devaluation of the dollar. But neither Pearson nor Douglas made much impact as national leaders before the election of 18 June 1962; the Conservatives stayed in power as a minority government. By early 1963 the cabinet began to bicker, members resigned ostensibly on the issue of Canadian defence policy, and finally the government collapsed. In a bitter 1963 election campaign Diefenbaker charged that the U.S., which had openly criticized his refusal to accept nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, was colluding with the Liberals to defeat him. The Liberals brushed off the attack and excoriated Diefenbaker for alleged incompetence. On 8 April 1963, the Liberals won a minority government.\n\nLester Pearson\n\nThe Pearson government sought to be innovative, and in many ways it was \u2014 the armed forces were unified, social welfare was extended, and a distinctive new national flag was unveiled in 1964. The party also became ever more identified with the \"politics of national unity,\" dedicated to containing Qu\u00e9bec's sovereigntist aspirations. In reality all parties shared the need to deal with Qu\u00e9bec's demands for changes in Canada's federal system.\n\nThese years were marked by personality quarrels and numerous Cold War-related political scandals, especially the Munsinger Affair. They were also notable for the establishment of the Canada Pension Plan and the signing of the Canada-U.S. Automotive Products Agreement, a treaty intended to give Canada a larger share of the continental auto market. Desperate to escape from the minority straitjacket, Pearson called an election for 8 November 1965. He won only two more seats, remaining two short of a majority.\n\nCentennial and Expo\n\nIn 1967, Canada marked its Centennial birthday, and the world came to celebrate in Montr\u00e9al at Expo 67 \u2014 a world's fair notable for the striking architecture of many of its pavilions, including the U.S. contribution: a giant geodesic dome. Montr\u00e9al, then Canada's largest city, had come into its own as a confident, stylish and multilingual metropolis.\n\nThat same year the Conservatives replaced Diefenbaker with Nova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield. Pearson resigned at the end of 1967, to be succeeded by Pierre Trudeau, who largely restored party unity. The choice of Trudeau emphasized the Liberals' commitment to finding a solution to the \"Qu\u00e9bec problem.\" Trudeau's vigorous opposition to Qu\u00e9bec nationalism (see French Canadian Nationalism) and \"special status\" won support in English Canada, while his promise to make the French fact important in Ottawa \u2014 through official bilingualism, for example \u2014 appealed to his fellow Francophones. Conservatives and the NDP found difficulty in developing a similarly appealing platform, not least because both lacked support in Qu\u00e9bec. In 1968, Qu\u00e9bec's place in Confederation and Trudeau's personality dominated federal political debate. This dominance endured almost uninterrupted into the 1980s.\n\nPierre Trudeau\n\nIn 1968 Trudeau took the country by storm \u2014 winning a majority by appealing across class lines and even across regional barriers with his personal charisma and his 60s-era insouciance. Canadians hadn't seen a politician like him. The Liberals won more seats west of Ontario than since 1953. Over the next few years, Trudeau's harsh response to terrorism in Qu\u00e9bec during the 1970 October Crisis, the growth of leftist sentiment in the NDP, and Conservative leadership bickering strengthened Trudeau's position. However, when he called an election for 30 Oct 1972, the Liberals' position was considerably weaker. Their emphasis on biculturalism angered many English Canadians who feared fundamental changes in their lives and their nation; many were also unhappy with the cuts in defence and particularly in the forces dedicated to NATO. The Liberals were returned to power but with only a minority government, supported by the NDP under leader David Lewis.\n\n(1972-1980) The Inflation Curse and Regional Divides\n\nPaul Henderson scored the dramatic goal in Moscow to give the Canadians the series victory (photo by Frank Lennon/Toronto Star).\n\nA month before the 1972 election, Canadians were glued to their television sets, watching an unfolding international drama that was a mixture of politics and hockey. Amid Cold War tensions, the best hockey players from Canada and the Soviet Union squared off in the 1972 Summit Series. Paul Henderson scored the most famous goal in hockey history, winning the series for Canada on September 28 in Moscow. But it was a narrow victory, and the Soviets had shaken Canadians' confidence in themselves as the finest hockey players on the planet.\n\nParti Qu\u00e9becois\n\nTwo years later, Canadians were back at the voting booth in the 1974 federal election. Trudeau's reformist legislation and his opposition to the Conservative policy of anti-inflation wage and price controls brought many working-class voters to his side, especially in BC and Ontario. The Liberals won another majority, dependent for their support upon Qu\u00e9bec and urban Ontario. After 1974 Trudeau gave indecisive leadership. Personal problems, weakness in his cabinet and intractable economic difficulties \u2014 including oil-price shocks and other inflationary pressures \u2014 plagued his government between 1974 and 1979. He surged in popularity in 1976-77 when Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois gained power in Qu\u00e9bec, prompting fears in English-speaking Canada about national unity, which many considered Trudeau well-equipped to handle.\n\nIn 1976, Montr\u00e9al once again became the focus of world attention as host of the 21st Summer Olympic games. Innovative, though ultimately costly, new facilities were built including a distinctive concrete stadium (nicknamed \"the Big O). For the first time in Olympic history, the host nation did not win a gold medal.\n\nJoe Clark\n\nThree years later, in May 1979 Opposition leader Joe Clark defeated Trudeau \u2014 losing Quebec but sweeping English Canada \u2014 for a minority Conservative government. In December the Clark government presented a tough budget and lost a subsequent non-confidence motion, and an election was called for February 1980. Cleverly manipulating the Conservatives' internal differences, the Liberals under Trudeau (who had resigned and then returned) regained their majority in an election in which Ontario swung strongly behind the Liberals, whose policies on energy resource pricing they favoured and the West abhorred. The Liberals won no seat west of Manitoba and only two there. Deep regional divisions in Canadian politics resulted from economic strategies marking a fragmented party system, which mirrored a fragmented nation.\n\nTerry Fox\n\nIn the summer of 1980 a young man with only one leg ignited the interest of Canadians the way no politician could. Terry Fox's cross-country Marathon of Hope began in Newfoundland and ended on the Trans-Canada Highway at Thunder Bay, Ont.\u2014only halfway to Fox's Pacific goal. Fox died the following summer, but by then he was a national icon, and the annual Terry Fox Runs he inspired would go on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for cancer research, in countries around the world.\n\n(1981-1992) The Constitution Decade\n\nAfter 1980, Trudeau's government followed a nationalist course for a time. The National Energy Program offered great incentives to encourage domestic ownership in the petroleum industry, but it was seen in the West, especially Alberta, as meddling with provincial resource rights. Trudeau was also instrumental in keeping the country unified, by campaigning along with other \"No\" forces in the 1980 Qu\u00e9bec referendum on sovereignty association.\n\nTrudeau then set out to \"patriate\" the Canadian Constitution from Britain, and to create the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and entrench it in the new Constitution. After a long series of negotiations with provincial leaders, the patriated Constitution was signed in Ottawa in 1982 by Queen Elizabeth \u2014 but it left a festering political problem because Qu\u00e9bec's Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, alone among the premiers, had refused to endorse the document.\n\nBrian Mulroney\n\nTrudeau became ever more unpopular as inflation, interest rates and unemployment rose, and in 1984 the Liberals paid the price. The Conservatives had replaced Clark with a bilingual Quebec business executive, Brian Mulroney, in 1983. The Liberals chose John Turner as Trudeau's successor a year later. Turner quickly called an election. The result was an overwhelming Conservative victory.\n\nIn Ottawa meanwhile, Mulroney had tried and failed to win the Quebec government's endorsement of the Constitution via the Meech Lake constitutional accord, which became the central political drama of his first term in office. His government also negotiated a contentious free trade agreement with the U.S., which became a major election issue in 1988. Mulroney won another, though smaller, majority government and in 1989 Canada and the U.S. began a new trading regime that was later expanded to include Mexico. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) contributed to a greater integration of the North American economy and, its critics would argue, a harmonization a weakening of Canadian cultural protections.\n\nOutside the political arena, two very different dramas captured Canadians' attention during this time. On 23 June 1985, an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Toronto and Montreal to London, was blown up over the Atlantic, killing all 331 people on board, including 268 Canadians, mostly of Indian ancestry. The worst terrorist attack in Canadian history revealed deep flaws in Canada's domestic police and security services. It also led to a 20-year investigation and prosecution that yielded the conviction of only one conspirator, Sikh-Canadian Inderjit Singh Reyat.\n\nIn 1988 Calgary welcomed the world to the Winter Olympics. The city put on a party the likes of which the winter games had never seen. But once again, as in Montreal, the host nation failed to win a gold medal.\n\nTwo Failed Accords\n\nIn 1990, the Meech Lake Accord officially died, after several years of failed efforts to win approval among all the provincial governments. Qu\u00e9bec reacted angrily, as did a handful of Mulroney's Quebec MPs, who quit the Conservative caucus to form the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Parliament, under the leadership of former cabinet minister Lucien Bouchard. Wounded, but still pressing for a constitutional solution, the Mulroney government and the provinces worked out a new deal called the Charlottetown Accord (see Charlottetown Accord: Document). Despite support from all of the major parties and provincial governments, the Accord was also rejected \u2014 this time in a national referendum in October 1992. The rejection was probably as much the result of the angry public mood created by the worst postwar recession as the contents of the Accord itself. Canadians were also weary after more than a decade of constitutional wrangling, which had dominated the national agenda.\n\n(1993-2005) Liberal Hegemony \u2014 and Collapse\n\nIn October 1993, the Liberals under Jean Chr\u00e9tien were elected with a majority government. The Conservatives were reduced to only two seats, and the Official Opposition became the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Another Qu\u00e9bec Referendum, in 1995, resulted in an exceedingly narrow victory for the \"no\" side.\n\nDespite these national unity troubles, a buoyant economy and a fragmented opposition led to the re-election of the Liberals with a second majority in 1997. The Progressive Conservatives remained in the doldrums. However, the Reform Party \u2014 a western-based, right-wing, populist movement led by its founder Preston Manning \u2014 had its big breakthrough in 1997, becoming the Official Opposition. Yet in spite of its success, Reform had divided the conservative vote across Canada. Dislodging the Liberal hold on power appeared unlikely without some entente with the PCs. As Chretien governed, his opponents squabbled among themselves, with conservative voices increasingly calling for a serious effort to \"unite-the-right.\"\n\nBalancing the Budget\n\nThe federal government's budget deficits had reached alarming levels by the 1990s, and Chr\u00e9tien and his finance minister Paul Martin embarked on an aggressive program to cut spending and balance the budget, which they did in 1998. The Liberals were aided in this effort by revenues from the Goods and Services Tax (GST), introduced by Mulroney, and by downloading some federal costs to provincial governments. Nevertheless, they produced Canada's first balanced budget in 30 years.\n\nThe following year the largely self-governing Inuit homeland of Nunavut was officially created across two million square kilometres of the eastern Arctic, becoming Canada's third territory.\n\nWar in Afghanistan\n\nCanadians welcomed the new millennium in 2000, and re-elected the Chr\u00e9tien Liberals with a third majority government. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, soon transformed government agendas across the western world, especially Canada, which now faced rampant American security concerns over their long, undefended northern border. Canadians played a unique role on \"9/11,\" particularly on the East Coast, offering refuge and hospitality to airline passengers from the hundreds of trans-Atlantic aircraft diverted to Canadian airports.\n\nIn 2002, Chr\u00e9tien dispatched a small number of troops to join the U.S. counter-terrorism effort in Afghanistan \u2014 a military commitment that ramped up considerably in 2006, when Canada sent a battle group to fight Taliban insurgents around the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. Over the next eight years, 158 Canadian soldiers would die in Afghanistan, and hundreds more would be wounded.\n\nPaul Martin Takes Helm\n\nIn 2003, after a period of Liberal infighting, Chr\u00e9tien was replaced as party leader and prime minister by Paul Martin. Martin took over a party that had grown complacent in power, and was beset by a growing scandal over the abuse of government funds, by Liberal-friendly firms in Quebec. Martin tried to deal with the \"Sponsorship Scandal,\" as it was called, by appointing a public inquiry, which found evidence of illegal kickbacks of cash to the Liberals by Quebec businessmen who had received government contracts.\n\nAlthough Martin was personally exonerated by the inquiry, the Liberal brand took a beating. Under Martin they were reduced to a minority government in the 2004 election, and two years later they were defeated by the newly-united political right, under a new Conservative banner.\n\n(2006-2014) Rise of the West\n\nStephen Harper ended 13 years of Liberal rule, winning a minority government in 2006. His Conservatives were handed a second minority in 2008, but captured their long-sought majority in Parliament in 2011 \u2014 an election that saw the NDP elevated to Official Opposition status for the first time in the party's history.\n\nThe Commodity Juggernaut\n\nAn Albertan, Harper's political rise coincided with an economic power-shift under way in Canada. Since Confederation the country's manufacturing heartland of southern Ontario and Quebec had provided the bulk of the country's wealth, and determined much of its politics. But in the 21st Century, the growing importance of Pacific Coast trade with Asia, and the vast oil (see Oil Sands) and mineral resources of B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan made the West the economic engine of the country. On the East Coast, a smaller renaissance was taking place in Newfoundland and Labrador, where oil and other natural resources were turning once-poor provinces such as it (and Saskatchewan) into providers of jobs and exporters of wealth.\n\nVery heavy equipment is required to haul the tarlike bitumen from the earth so that it can be processed and refined to make oil (courtesy AOSTRA).\n\nAs if to reinforce Canada's new westward orientation, Vancouver hosted the Winter Olympics in 2010, and Canadian athletes captured the largest number of medals, to that date, in the country's Olympic history.\n\nEconomic Uncertainty\n\nDespite its booming resource sector, Canada's economy was hit by the 2008 global financial credit crisis and subsequent recession, although the country's banks weathered the storm better than many other western nations. But the job losses, and the further erosion of the manufacturing base, took their toll on government finances, and Canada was once again running budget deficits. Even so, Harper was judged by many Canadians the leader best able to manage the economy.\n\nOne of Harper's main political goals since coming to office was to re-make the country along social and economic conservative lines, and to strike a blow against the Liberal Party, which had governed Canada for most of its history. In 2011 he'd succeeded in putting the Liberals into third place in Parliament. But the Conservatives had failed to make lasting inroads in the important political battleground of Quebec. And by 2013, the Liberals had a young, new leader from that province \u2014 Justin Trudeau, son of the former prime minister \u2014 threatening Harper's vision and the Conservative hold on power."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec", "page_content": "Geography\n\nThe province of Quebec is composed of three of Canada\u2019s seven physiographic regions. These regions are the St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Canadian Shield and the Appalachian region. The St. Lawrence Lowlands is the most fertile and developed region. The majority of the population of Quebec lives here, mainly between Montreal and Quebec City. The Canadian Shield covers most of Quebec from approximately 80 km north of the St. Lawrence River valley up to the Ungava region. It is a vast region composed of thousands of lakes and thousands of square kilometres of forested area. On the south bank of the St. Lawrence River, between the Richelieu River and the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, is the Quebec part of the Appalachian mountain chain which extends from Gasp\u00e9 south to Alabama.\n\nWithin the province\u2019s three physiographic regions are four distinct zones with different landscapes. These are the arctic tundra, the taiga, the boreal forest and the temperate forest (see Vegetation Regions; Forest Regions). All except the temperate forest are sparsely inhabited.\n\nThe arctic tundra is the natural habitat of the polar bear, fox and arctic hare. In the taiga the largest group of the deer family (Cervidae) is the caribou. Numerous species of animals like deer, coyotes, moose and lynx populate the boreal and the temperate forests. The lakes and rivers abound with fish, particularly trout, yellow perch, black bass and pike. Overall, 105 species of freshwater fish populate the rivers and lakes of Quebec. Other species, like salmon and smelt, live in salt water but spawn in Quebec\u2019s fresh water. The St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers are also a refuge for sea mammals like seals, white beluga,killer, humpback and even blue whales.\n\nQuebec is also known for its countless lakes and rivers. The province\u2019s most important waterway and geographical feature is the St. Lawrence River, its estuary and the gulf. The main tributaries of the St. Lawrence River are, on the south shore, the Richelieu, Yamaska,Chaudi\u00e8re and Matap\u00e9dia rivers. On the north shore, they are the Saint-Maurice, Saguenay, Manicouagan and Ottawa rivers. The two other main watersheds are the James Bay and Hudson Bay basin and;Ungava Bay. In the James Bay region, the Nottaway, Rupert and Eastmain rivers were dammed in the 1970s as part of the largest hydroelectric project in Canada. Large reservoirs, such as the R\u00e9servoir Manicouagan, on the Manicouagan River north of Baie-Comeau, and the R\u00e9servoir Gouin on the Saint-Maurice, were also targeted for major hydroelectric projects. (See also Geography of Quebec.)\n\nPeople\n\nUrban Centres\n\nMontr\u00e9al is the economic and cultural centre of the province. In 2016, it was Quebec\u2019s largest urban centre with a population of 1,704,694, or 21 per cent of the Quebec population. Factoring in the Montr\u00e9al metropolitan area, this number rises to 4,098,927, or 50 per cent of the Quebec population. After Toronto, Montr\u00e9al is the second largest agglomeration in Canada. It is the largest francophone city in North America.\n\nThe province\u2019s capital is Quebec City. In 2016, the city\u2019s population was 531,902. The Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985. The next largest cities, in descending order of population, are Laval, Gatineau,Longueuil, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, L\u00e9vis, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and Terrebonne.\n\nLabour Force\n\nIn 2016, the sectors employing the most people in Quebec were health care and social assistance, retail and manufacturing. The unemployment rate was 7.2 per cent, or just below the national average. Approximately 36 per cent of the labour force was unionized, compared with 28 per cent in the rest of Canada. This high rate of union membership may be connected to the province's history of extremely militant Catholic unions. Formed in 1921, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des travailleurs catholiques du Canada was involved in many bitter strikes in the textile sector in the 1920s and in the famous Asbestos Strike in 1949. In 1960 the union was renamed the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux (CSN) and continues to be active today (see Working Class History \u2012 Quebec).\n\nLanguage and Ethnicity\n\nDuring the French colonial period, France was Europe's dominant power. Its population during the 18th century was between 20 and 25 million inhabitants while that of the British Isles was estimated at 7 million. Colonial rivalry between France and Britain was already global during the 18th century. Competition between the two nations had implications for all continents. But France, despite an impressive system of colonies, remained mainly a continental power during the 18th century while Britain was building an international system of colonies.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, religious minorities in Europe sought to emigrate in order to build societies according to their religious beliefs. France's minorities, such as the Huguenots, mainly moved to Central Europe while religious minorities in Britain emigrated to North America. The refusal of the church to allow religious minorities to move to New France, and the fertile soil and temperate climate of the Atlantic seaboard, led to a great disparity in the populations of New France and New England. Between 1608 and 1713, despite the success of its expansion on the continent, New France's population had grown little. New England had a population of 400,000 in 1715 and more than 2 million in 1763. Between 1715 and 1763 the population of New France grew from 15,000 to almost 70,000 inhabitants.\n\nIt was under the English regime after 1763 that the remaining French-speaking population grew substantially, from 100,000 in 1784 to over 400,000 in 1825 and almost a million in 1860. By 1911, the French-speaking population in Quebec was about 2 million people, 4 million in 1951 and almost 8 million in 2013. Between 1840 and 1930 one million French-Canadians, most of them seeking jobs in the manufacturing sector in New England, left Quebec for the United States. Under the French Regime land was settled in a distinct fashion. The seigneurial system, finally abolished in 1854, was organized to create a sense of community through the close proximity of neighbours. Individual lots, usually built along a river, were very narrow, about 175.5 m wide, and extremely deep, about 1,700 m long. Some have argued that the seigneurial system and the parish were the key institutions of a rural society and encouraged a mentality opposed to urbanization and industrialization. Other observers have argued that the unique fashion of the seigneurial system in Quebec was the main cause of the rise of an early urban civilization.\n\nDuring the 19th century, large numbers of French-Canadians moved to urban centres throughout North America. Despite the official but sometimes ambiguous opposition of the Church on the subject of emigration, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois left their rural homes as early as 1840 and moved to urban centres in New England or to cities in the province of Quebec. From 1850 to 1930, the rate of the province's urban population grew steadily. In 1871, only 15 per cent lived in cities. Two decades later, the number had doubled until, by 1921, 52 per cent of the people were urban. This figure was above the Canadian average and comparable to that of Ontario. According to Statistics Canada, in 2016, Quebec\u2019s urban population had reached 80.5 per cent, the fourth highest percentage in Canada after Ontario,British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, people of British origins made up 12.5 per cent of the total population. Several thousand of these people had come to Canada after the American Revolution (the Loyalists). During the 19th century, the source of immigration shifted to Britain, particularly Scotland and Ireland. During the 19th century, 17 million people left Britain, 9 per cent of whom came to Canada. These included 53,463 Irish between 1825 and 1829, 185,953 between 1830 and 1834, and almost 200,000 during the Great Famine of 1845-1849. About 20 per cent of the Irish immigrants settled in Quebec. By the end of the 19th century, the predominantly Irish immigration was replaced by East European Jews and Italians. The Jewish population in Quebec grew from 1.5 per cent of the total population in 1901 to 5.7 per cent in 1941. The Italian population was only 0.5 per cent in 1901 and 2.3 per cent in 1941.\n\nSince the Irish immigration of the 1830s and 1840s, Quebec society has been demographically and culturally diverse. According to the 2016 census, the most cited ethnic origins were Canadian, French and Irish, and 13 per cent of the province was a visible minority. Within the visible minority population, Black, Arab and Latin American were the largest communities. Just over 79 per cent of the population has French of their mother tongue, compared to 8.9 per cent who report English.\n\nThe three main Aboriginal groups in Quebec, according to linguistic classification, are the Algonquian, the Eskimo-Aleut and the Iroquoian (see Aboriginal Languages of Canada). In 2016, 2.3 per cent of the province\u2019s population was Aboriginal.\n\nReligion\n\nSince New France, the influence of the Catholic Church has been a major factor in the development of the province. After the Conquest, the British did not authorize priests from the Jesuit order and the R\u00e9collets, leaving the Sulpicians as the only major group of priests. There were also seven communities of sisters. By the end of the 19th century, however, there were more than 100 communities of priests and 200 communities of sisters. The Jesuits returned to Canada in 1842. The first Oblates arrived in 1844 and settled in the Ottawa region and in the James Bay region before sending missionaries to Western Canada. The Clercs de Saint-Viateur arrived in 1847. Communities of sisters were also active, particularly the Grey Nuns, an order formed in 1737.\n\nMany sociologists, political scientists and historians have argued that francophone Quebec was a society dominated by religion, obsessed with the maintenance of rural values and deeply opposed to modernity and its consequences, mainly urbanization and industrialization. Some facts are irrefutable. In 1900, the average number of parish members per priest was only 537. Overall, there was one member of the Church for every 109 Catholics in the province. This phenomenal bureaucracy probably had no equivalent in the Western world among Catholic countries \u2012 not even Italy. But while the bureaucracy was immense, there remains the question of whether it frustrated the province's development or provided a different road to modernity. The Church ran a relatively complex school system, invested in real estate and financial markets. At the same time, Catholic unions opposed trusts and big business. Communities of sisters, like the Grey Nuns, managed hospitals. The role of the Church in the history of Quebec is a complex one and continues to be debated by historians and sociologists.\n\nResults of the 2011 NHS show that 87.9 per cent of the Quebec population declared a religious affiliation, while 12.1 per cent declared no religious affiliation. By comparison, 76.1 per cent of the Canadian population declared a religious affiliation, while 23.9 per cent declared no religious affiliation. In Quebec, 5,766,750 people (74.6 per cent of the population) identified as Roman Catholic. The other most commonly reported religious affiliations are Islam (3.1 per cent) and Christianity (1.4 per cent).\n\nHistory: From New France to Confederation\n\nFrench colonization started when Jacques Cartier landed in Gasp\u00e9 in 1534. One year later the French came into contact with Iroquoian villages on both shores of the St. Lawrence River, for example at Stadacona near the location of the future Quebec City and Hochelaga (the future Montr\u00e9al). But the real beginning of French colonization in the St. Lawrence Valley was in 1608, when Samuel de Champlain established a fort at Cap Diamant, the site of Quebec City today. By the beginning of the 17th century, the St. Lawrence Iroquoians had mysteriously disappeared from the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. The Innu (Montagnais-Naspaki) population on the north shore was then around 4,000 people. In 1666, the first census revealed a colonial, non-native population of only 3,215 people.\n\nThe French North American empire expanded considerably during the 17th century. In 1672 and 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette explored the Mississippi River and, in 1682, Robert Cavelier de La Salle reached the Gulf of Mexico by following the Mississippi River. Many institutions were established: hospitals like H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec in 1639, H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Montr\u00e9al in 1657. In 1664, the Coutume de Paris became the law in the colony. In 1663, Bishop Fran\u00e7ois de Laval opened the first seminary, the Grand s\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, while the S\u00e9minaire de Saint-Sulpice opened in Montr\u00e9al in 1677. In 1713 the Treaty of Utrecht, following France's defeat by a coalition of European countries in the War of the Spanish Succession, demanded that France surrender Acadia (in the territory of Nova Scotia, excluding that area which is today Cape Breton Island), Newfoundland and the lands around Hudson Bay. Several thousand Acadians thus became part of the British empire in North America. Following the Seven Years\u2019 War, Quebec City and Montr\u00e9al were claimed by the British. It was the end of the French empire in North America.\n\nA few years after the Conquest, the remaining French population of the new British colony benefited from tension between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain with the Quebec Act of 1774. The Quebec Act enlarged the frontiers of the Province of Quebec, recognized freedom of religion for Catholics, the legality of the seigneurial system and the French civil code. After the American Revolution, the Constitutional Act of 1791 reduced the frontiers of the province for the purpose of establishing a new colony, Upper Canada (eventually Ontario), and guaranteed a legislative assembly, although with limited powers, in each colony (Upper Canada and Lower Canada).\n\nFrench-Canadians were, during the years 1791 to 1867, extremely active both politically and in every aspect of economic life. Local markets, as revealed by recent research, were extraordinarily complex and diversified. At the international level some French-Canadians, like Augustin Cuvillier and Joseph Masson, were also involved in international commerce and banking. Both men were administrators of the Bank of Montreal while other French-Canadians opened French-Canadian banks like the La Banque du peuple in 1835.\n\nIn 1837-38, the rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada over the principle of self-government resulted in military repression and the Durham Report of 1839. Lord Durham recommended the application of the principle of self-government but suggested that the only solution to the French-Canadian problem was the union of the two colonies. The aim was to assimilate the French-Canadians. That plan was implemented in 1841 through the Union Act, voted in London in 1840 and enacted in 1841. Section 41 of the Union Act stipulated that English was the only language of the new colony. But, when Britain abolished the mercantilist system between 1846 and 1848, the principle of self-government was granted to the colonies as compensation for the loss of protected access to the British market.\n\nFollowing that decision, a coalition of reformists led by Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hyppolite LaFontaine formed the first democratic government of the Province of Canada (the colony formed by the union of Lower and Upper Canada) in 1848. The right of the French language was recognized by the reformists. By 1864, during negotiations for a new federation of British North American colonies, it was clear that there was a growing recognition of the French reality in the proposed federation. (See also Quebec and Confederation; Quebec since Confederation.)\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economic history of Quebec can be divided into five major periods. The first period started with the arrival of the French and lasted until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The main economic activity was the fur trade. Under the mercantilist system imposed by France, colonies \u2012 including New France \u2012 exported their natural resources and in return received manufactured goods from the metropolis. The fur trade was the heart of New France's economy. Other economic activities in the colony that might compete with the home country were discouraged.\n\nDuring the second period (1713-1812), the economy of New France remained dominated by the fur trade although an attempt was made to diversify the economy by improving farming and by encouraging projects like the Forges Saint-Maurice. The Conquest of 1760 did not fundamentally change the mercantilist system, at least for a while, as Britain was also a protectionist country. During the third period (1812-67), wheat and timber (see Timber Trade History) replaced fur as the main export products. This period marked the rise of commercial capitalism. The major event of the period, between 1845 and 1848, was the Britain's abolition of its protectionist laws and the abandonment of the mercantilist system.\n\nThis radical change caused the business elite of Canada and Quebec, Montr\u00e9al being the most important commercial and financial centre of the colony, to alter its economic strategy. The solution was to transform Canada into an industrialized country. The political expression of that solution was Confederation in 1867 (see British North America Act). That year marks the beginning of the fourth period (1867-1945), which was characterized by the rise of industrial capitalism. Quebec, particularly the Montr\u00e9al region and Montr\u00e9al harbour, played a crucial role in the country's industrialization. In 1900, 51 per cent of Canada's manufacturing capacity was based in Ontario, compared to 32 per cent in Quebec. The main industries in Quebec were in the sectors of textiles, footwear, food, railways and timber. By 1900, hydroelectricity was the main source of energy while pulp and paper mills and aluminum factories were sectors of high employment and substantial foreign investment. The fifth and final period is from 1945 to today. It is characterized by the rapid development of modern communications and services. In contrast to previous periods, there has been a shift away from manufacturing. During the 1990s, the government invested significantly in the technology sector, and the province became an important international player with companies such as Softimage, CGI, CAE and Ubisoft.\n\nAgriculture\n\nIn the 1990s, Quebec's portion of Canadian agricultural production was around 13 per cent. Quebec has 6.8 million ha of arable land. After a period of intense speculation and urban growth between 1972 and 1978, the government began protecting agricultural land. Quebec farmers have supplied public markets since the 1880s, if not before, according to historians. Recent studies have revealed the presence of a complex local economy during the 19th century. Pork and dairy products were a Quebec speciality by the end of the 19th century. Specialization increased the industrialization of agriculture and, as a result, the value of agricultural production in Quebec increased by more than four times between 1901 and 1921 (see History of Agriculture).\n\nThe Agricultural Land Protection Act (Loi sur la protection du territoire agricole ) was passed in 1978 and now protects Quebec's best farmland. Other measures to support the farming industry were also taken, including the introduction of crop insurance and stabilization insurance plans. There was also a substantial increase in allocations to various assistance programs. In 2012, agriculture revenue totalled $8.4 billion, compared with $4.6 billion in 1996. Dairy production remained the largest sector, with $2.1 billion in revenue, representing 26 per cent of agricultural production. Pork production followed at $1.3 billion (15 per cent). There were 29,000 agricultural enterprises in Quebec in 2012.\n\nIndustry\n\nThe principal industries in Quebec are manufacturing, generation of electric power, mining, pulp and paper. The Quebec manufacturing sector represents 25 per cent of the Canadian total. Five groups of industries account for 65 per cent of the factories and over 50 per cent of the manufacturing jobs: clothing and textiles, food and beverages, paper and related products, metal products and wood products.\n\nCanada ranks fourth in the world in copper mining. This operation is located at Murdochville, Quebec (photo by Bob Anderson/Masterfile). Quebec harvests around 35 million cubic m of wood each year (Masterfile). PreviousNext\n\nForestry\n\nQuebec has the second-largest area of forest land in Canada after the Northwest Territories. Most of this land, 825 000 km2 of forests, is provincially owned, although many land claims by Aboriginal peoples are currently being contested in the courts. Accessible productive forests total 540 000 km2, three-quarters of which is located in the Saguenay\u2012Lac-Saint-Jean, Abitibi and North Shore regions. Around 33 million m3 of wood is cut each year, 80 per cent of which is conifer. Most of the cut wood is used for lumber and pulp manufacturing. For the last 20 years, a vast reforestation program has been underway. However, the number of trees planted annually has diminished since 1989 due to the adoption of new practices such as timber harvesting that protects advance regeneration. Consequently, in 2011, 140 million seedlings were planted, compared with 251 million in 1989. More than three quarters of these trees were planted in public forests and the majority were softwood.\n\nThe pulp and paper industry in Quebec is among the 10 leading producers in the world and the second-largest exporter of newsprint in Canada. Over 23,000 workers are employed in this sector, producing about 42 per cent of Canada's paper. Timber, wood pulp and newsprint together constitute 20 per cent of Quebec exports, 80 per cent of which goes to the US. The lumber industry is another active sector. There are over 1,300 lumber processing plants, and the wood industry alone employs over 36,000 people.\n\nFisheries\n\nQuebec has around 4,200 full-time fishermen located in several regions, notably in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, where industrial fishing is a major part of the local economy. By 1997, this number had been reduced to 1,200 fishermen. Most owned boats that are less than 10 m long. Quebec's annual catch is only a fraction of that taken by the Atlantic Provinces. The main catches are groundfish and various molluscs and crustaceans. The fishery now relies more on shellfish, which make up two-thirds of the catch. Groundfish now account for only 10 per cent of the catch and pelagic fish (e.g., herring and mackerel) make up the rest.\n\nEnergy\n\nQuebec is the largest producer of electricity in Canada. Its installed generating capacity is 36,068 MW, or more than 30 per cent of the Canadian total, more than 99 per cent of the production is hydraulic. In the 1970s, the province tried to reduce its dependency on petroleum products. In 1970 petroleum accounted for 74 per cent of all energy used in the province. In 1998, it was 31.9 per cent. The hydro main project of the 1970s was the James Bay project. It produces over 10,000 MW of electricity. A large portion of this electricity is exported to Ontario, New Brunswick and the northeastern United States. Quebec\u2019s energy production is expected to increase by 1,550 MW when the Romaine complex in the C\u00f4te-Nord region becomes active; this is scheduled for 2020.\n\nSince the 2000s, Quebec has explored the possibility of developing oil and gas resources (see Fracking), namely in Gasp\u00e9sie and \u00cele d\u2019Anticosti, where high-potential deposits have been discovered.\n\nTransportation\n\nFrench and English merchants dreamed of a commercial empire along the St. Lawrence River. Although the North American commercial empire never materialized, the St. Lawrence River and Montr\u00e9al played a fundamental role in the history of transportation in Canada. Head offices of many transportation companies, including Air Canada, are in Montr\u00e9al. At one point in the 1990s, 50 per cent of the head offices of the Canadian aeronautics and space industry were in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThe opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway was not beneficial to the Montr\u00e9al harbour as the harbour lost its privileged position. The opening of the seaway in 1954, while contributing to the development of North Shore ports, also led to the rapid growth of Ontario ports on the Great Lakes. Quebec has 28 ports, the most important of which are Montr\u00e9al-Contrecoeur, Qu\u00e9bec-L\u00e9vis and Port-Cartier and Sept-\u00celes-Pointe-Noire. In the mid-1990s, 73.7 million tons of cargo were being handled annually in these 28 ports.\n\nIn the 19th century, Montr\u00e9al was the base from which Canada's railway system was constructed. The Grand Trunk Railway in the 1850s, the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s and, in the 1910s, the Canadian National Railways, are all an important part of Quebec and Montr\u00e9al history. The railway network was mainly developed in southern Quebec, though the National Transcontinental Railway was an expensive, failed effort to open up frontiers in the north.\n\nThe construction of the Mirabel airport in the 1970s was very controversial. For 20 years, intercontinental flights were dispatched to Mirabel, while Dorval was the Montr\u00e9al airport for continental flights. Today, in retrospect, it seems that the detractors of the project were right: in 1997, international flights were all dispatched back to Dorval airport, leaving only air freight to Mirabel. In the 1990s, the two Montr\u00e9al airports handled about 11 per cent of Canadian passengers, compared to Toronto's 35 per cent, while 14 per cent of all air freight was handled in Montr\u00e9al and 38 per cent in Toronto. Almost 85 per cent of the 10 million passengers who annually used Quebec's airports passed through Dorval and Mirabel. With the announcement of Mirabel\u2019s official closing in 2004, all air traffic, passengers and cargo were directed through Dorval, newly renamed Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport. As of 2014, Quebec had two international airports : Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (Montr\u00e9al) and Jean Lesage International Airport (Quebec).\n\nThe province has 55,700 km of roads and 2,300 km of superhighways. More than 3.6 million vehicles are registered. Approximately 2,400 trucking firms employ more than 38,000 workers and share about $2 billion in annual revenue.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nThe political institutions of the province of Quebec have not fundamentally changed since 1867. Initially a French colony, Quebec was later administered directly by British authorities. In 1841 it became part of a legislative union, and in 1867 a member of the Canadian federation. In 1982 Quebec did not sign Canada's repatriated Constitution, although it did sign an accord in 1987 to enter into Canada's constitutional agreement (see Meech Lake Accord; Meech Lake Accord: Document) and another, the so-called Charlottetown Accord (see Charlottetown Accord: Document), in 1992. However, neither of these was ratified and the latter was overwhelmingly rejected in a national referendum. The evolution of Quebec's institutions has thus not been marked by any legal discontinuity. The most important institutions are the central political institutions.\n\nProvincial Government\n\nQuebec, like all constitutional regimes with a British tradition, has no rigid division of legislative and executive functions among its various agencies. Its political system is based on co-operation rather than on a separation of powers. The Legislative Assembly, renamed the Assembl\u00e9e nationale or National Assembly by the Maurice Duplessis government of the 1950s, represents Quebec citizens and is composed of 125 members representing the same number of ridings. In the 1960s, efforts were made to ensure an equal number of voters per riding (around 34,000 voters). The National Assembly has the power to pass laws in areas defined as provincial jurisdiction by section 92 of the British North America Act. The political party with a majority of seats in the National Assembly forms a government. The leader of the party becomes the premier of the province (see Quebec Premiers: Table).\n\nGovernment Structure\n\nThe Queen's representative in the province is the lieutenant-governor. He or she is appointed by federal authorities in consultation with the province. The role is mainly symbolic, but in some situations the lieutenant-governor may be called upon to settle a parliamentary issue. As the sovereign's direct and personal representative, the lieutenant-governor ensures the continuity of government. Although technically a federal public servant, the lieutenant-governor's actions are in fact governed by the directives of Qu\u00e9bec's conseil executif, also called the Conseil des ministres, which is composed of the premier ministre (premier) and his ministers. It is the Conseil executif that decides on the general orientation of government action. It expresses its will through draft bills and d\u00e9crets. The 27 or so Cabinet ministers are appointed by the premier and are bound by the principle of ministerial solidarity.\n\nSince the 1970s, major reforms have transformed the operations of these central bodies. The National Assembly's rules of procedure were modernized and adapted to Quebec's circumstances: a total of 11 parliamentary standing committees have been established and debates are now televised. The Conseil executif is operating more and more with the assistance of departmental standing committees, each headed by a minister of state. A priorities committee provides better planning, and a treasury board, headed by a minister, is responsible for formulating and implementing the government's financial policies.\n\nPolitics\n\nFrom the Conquest of 1760 and the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and basically until 1867, Quebec was a British colony. In 1791, with the Constitutional Act, the frontiers of the colony were reduced to what is essentially southern Quebec today. The colony was also granted an elected Assembly. But the territory, like any other British colony, was directly and undemocratically governed from the metropolis through a governor named by London and a body of Councils also composed of non-elected members. The Assembly had limited powers.\n\nBecause French-Canadians had developed a distinct identity by the end of the 18th century, the struggle for democracy became, at least for half a century, synonymous with nationalism. After the Rebellion of 1837-38, Quebec was amalgamated with Upper Canada (Ontario) in 1841 and became part of a legislative union. After the failure of that union, Quebec became in 1867 a province of the Canadian federation.\n\nFor many French-speaking Canadians who supported the British North America Act of 1867, Confederation was based on the principle of a federation of nations, namely the British and the French (both the French and the British excluded the First Nations.) But that interpretation of Confederation was never shared by a majority of English-speaking Canadians. They tended to see Canada as a homogeneous nation composed of different regions represented by the provinces. This unresolved debate about the nature of the federation has been at the core of every political and constitutional crisis in Canada and the province of Quebec since 1867.\n\nIn 1980 the first referendum on Quebec's independence was defeated with a majority of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois voting to remain within Canada. Two years later a major crisis in Quebec-Canada relations occurred when Quebec did not sign Canada's repatriated Constitution initiated by Pierre Elliott Trudeau government. The second crisis occurred between 1987 and 1990 during the debate about the Meech Lake Accord. In 1992 the Charlottetown was rejected, although for different reasons, by both Quebec and the rest of Canada. In 1995, a second referendum in Quebec on sovereignty was barely won by the federalist side (49.42 per cent in favour of sovereignty, 50.58 per cent against).\n\nAfter the Conquest and during the 19th century, the French referred to themselves as \"les Canadiens\" and described the \"others\" as \"les Anglais.\" The strong French-Canadian perception that the 1867 Act reflected a federation of nations was constantly refuted by a large component of English-speaking Canadians. This contributed to the emergence of a separatist movement and a \"Quebec only\" identity. The M\u00e9tis Rebellions of 1870 and 1885, the hanging of Louis Riel, the illegal and unconstitutional abolition of the French language in Manitoba in 1890, the conscription crises in 1917 and 1942, the constant marginalization of the French language at the federal level until the Official Languages legislation of 1969 \u2012 these events contributed to a negative perception of the Canadian federation.\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nThe history of political parties in Quebec reflects both the evolution of the identity of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and, as in all societies, contradictions in that identity. From 1867 to 1897 provincial politics were dominated by the Conservative Party. The conservatives ruled for all but five of those years, 1878-1879 and from 1887 to 1891. The power of the Conservative Party symbolized the alliance between the Church and business, and a commitment to a socially conservative society led by private enterprise. Wilfrid Laurier's victory at the federal level in 1896 propelled the provincial Liberals to power in 1897. They remained in power for half a century, except between 1936 and 1939, until 1944. The Liberals maintained the alliance between the Church and private enterprise. The Church was given a free hand in social affairs and education while the political and economical spheres were left to politicians and businesspeople.\n\nThe domination of the Liberals was interrupted in 1936 when Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale party took power. That party resulted from the 1935 merger of the provincial Conservative Party and a group of young Liberal dissidents active during the Depression. The name of the group was l'Action lib\u00e9rale nationale and among its aims was nationalization of the private hydroelectricity companies. Once in power, however, the leader of the former provincial Conservative Party, Maurice Duplessis, who became leader of the Union nationale coalition in 1936, did not implement any of the reforms proposed by the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale, ruling the province the same way the Liberals had.\n\nIt was the new leader of the provincial Liberal Party, Ad\u00e9lard Godbout, re-elected in 1939, who applied those reforms. The Godbout government was perhaps the most socially progressive provincial government of the century in Quebec. Among its reforms were the right to vote for women at the provincial level (1940), the formation of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and reforms in education. But its accomplishments were overshadowed by Second World War when the federal government used its special wartime powers to intervene in provincial affairs. In 1944 the domination of the Liberal Party since 1897 really came to an end. With only 35 per cent of the popular vote, Maurice Duplessis was re-elected and this time governed until 1959.\n\nThe Duplessis government was characteristic of the Cold War, right wing and vehemently anti-Communist. Opposition to his extremely conservative style of government in the 1950s prepared the field for the reforms of the 1960s. When a group of young liberals led by Jean Lesage took power in 1960 it was the beginning of a new era and the period of reforms known as the Quiet Revolution. The Church was replaced by the provincial state in social affairs and the state intervened in the economy to promote the interests of French-speaking business. The emphasis on the provincial state corresponded with a change in the self-identification of many French-Canadians in Quebec. Historians still debate the nature and effects of the Quiet Revolution. For some experts, the Quiet Revolution was a period of immense change that at last brought Quebec into the modern world. For others, the alliance of the Church and business, beginning from at least the second half of the 19th century, was a typical contradiction of modernity. To these observers, the changes of the 1960s, despite their magnitude, were simply a realignment of political and social forces in an already modern society.\n\nFormed in 1968, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) came to power only a few years later in 1976. Ironically, a few months before the 1976 provincial election in Quebec, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau had proclaimed the death of'separatism' in Quebec. When Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque became premier of Quebec in 1976, it was not only a wake-up call for Trudeau but also for the entire country.\n\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was elected in 1976 with a clear social-democratic platform. Indeed, between 1976 and 1980, the government of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois initiated many reforms, some of them very controversial, like the reform of the automobile insurance system and the Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise (the famous Bill 101) on the regulation of the French language in the province. In 1980, as promised by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois organized a referendum on the mandate to negotiate a new partnership with Canada referred to as \"sovereignty-association.\" Many commentators have argued that this new partnership was in fact a proposal for a new confederation, a system where the central state has very limited powers. Others have argued that it was a form of secession. Despite the fact that the question seemed moderate, the federalist No side won convincingly by almost 60 per cent to 40 per cent. However, in 1981, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was re-elected, mainly because the Quebec voters were in the majority satisfied with its performance as a responsible government. It was thus a government of the PQ in power in 1982 when Pierre Elliott Trudeau patriated the constitution from Britain.\n\nIn 1983, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois took a real switch to the right in its conflict with unions of the public sector and abandoned some of its social-democratic approach. That played a crucial role in the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois defeat in 1985. Robert Bourassa, who had patiently rebuilt his control over the provincial Liberal Party after his astonishing defeat in 1976, became once again the premier of Quebec in 1985. Caught in the debate and eventually the failure of the Meech Lake Accord between 1987 and 1990 and, in 1988-1989, the controversy of Bill 178 (Loi modifiant la Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise) on language regulation in Quebec (that Bill allowed the use of the French language and other languages for signs inside stores or public buildings but imposed the use of the French language only for signs outside buildings), Robert Bourassa managed his way to victory again in 1989. But this second mandate was also very controversial, with the Oka crisis in the summer of 1990, just after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, and the no less catastrophic failure of the Charlottetown Accord in 1992. Robert Bourassa was replaced by Daniel Johnson, and in 1994 the Liberal Party was defeated by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, now led by Jacques Parizeau. One year after this victory, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, in a second referendum on sovereignty, lost narrowly when the Yes side finished with a surprising score of 49 per cent. Parizeau resigned, and Lucien Bouchard was sworn in as leader. Bernard Landry became the province's leader in 2001.\n\nFormer Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Jacques Parizeau, September 1989. In 1994, he became the second leader of the separatist PQ to become premier (photo by Jim Merrithew).\n\nOn 14 April 2003, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was defeated and the Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest , was elected premier of Quebec. Charest remained in power for nine years and was re-elected twice. In the spring of 2012, a proposal to increase tuition fees was met with outrage by students, who took to the streets in protest. They were joined by other groups of citizens in a general expression of frustration with the government. On 4 September 2012, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won the general election and Pauline Marois became the first woman to serve as premier of Quebec. Her term, however, lasted only 18 months. Marois called an election in early March 2014, seeking to secure a majority mandate; instead, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois found itself ousted from power. On 7 April 2014, Philippe Couillard became the 31st premier of Quebec after 13 months as Liberal leader.\n\nIntergovernmental Relations\n\nQuebec has 75 representatives in the federal House of Commons and 24 members in the Senate. The federal and Quebec authorities coordinate their activities, not without difficulty, through about 100 joint committees and a number of federal-provincial conferences. It is in international relations, however, that Quebec has asserted itself. In 1871 Quebec opened two offices abroad and, in 1882, a trade officer was appointed to France. Later, in 1961, the first Ministry of Intergovernmental Affairs (now Relations internationales) was created. Since then Quebec delegations have been established in the US, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Cooperative agreements link Quebec to a number of countries, particularly France. Quebec is represented in many international francophone institutions, including the International Organisation of La Francophonie (Organisation internationale de la Francophonie) and UNESCO.\n\nLegal Institutions\n\nQuebec's legal and judicial system is based on the French Civil Code while the rest of Canada uses Common Law. Quebec's judicial system has two levels: lower court powers are shared by a number of courts, but there is only one Court of Appeal. Quebec courts interpret and apply Quebec law, and a large part of federal law. The federal Parliament has not fully exercised its constitutional right to create courts in order to ensure that its laws are implemented. The lower court hierarchy has four components:\n\n1) Municipal court, i.e, 86 courts whose jurisdiction is primarily limited to tax claims and offences under Quebec laws such as the Highway Safety Code;\n\n2) The Court of Qu\u00e9bec, composed of 270 judges in three divisions: the Civil Division, the Criminal and Penal Division, and the Youth Division;\n\n3) The Superior Court, composed of 144 judges, with jurisdiction namely over serious cases such as murders, as well as appeals on decisions delivered by the two lower courts;\n\n4) The Court of Appeal, which is, as its name suggests, a general appeal court for Quebec; it is the highest court in the province, composed of 20 judges.\n\nMunicipal Institutions\n\nThe BNA Act (subsection 8 of section 92) stipulates that each province may exclusively make laws in relation to matters such as municipal institutions. The Constitution Act of 1982 reiterated that the provinces have the authority to organize and administer their municipal institutions. In 2013 there were 1134 municipalities in Quebec. All municipalities fall under the Municipal Code and the Cities and Towns Act.\n\nMost of Quebec's municipalities are loosely organized into 100 regional county municipalities (municipalit\u00e9s r\u00e9gionales de comt\u00e9 \u2012 MRC); MRCs are administrative bodies encompassing all local municipalities within a given area. Two urban communities, Montr\u00e9al and Quebec City, enjoy additional powers. In 2002, the Act to reform the municipal territorial organization of the metropolitan regions of Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec and the Outaouais (Bill 170), amalgamated certain municipalities and changed the province\u2019s toponymy; Hull became Gatineau, while Chicoutimi and Jonqui\u00e8re amalgamated to become Saguenay. Rural county municipalities have been established to pool community services outside the larger urban centres.\n\nPublic Finance\n\nAll provinces, including Quebec, have two sources of revenues: provincial taxes and transfer payments from the federal government based on established programs. For fiscal year 2011-2012, the annual revenues of the province of Quebec were around $66 billion, of which 44 per cent came from income and corporate taxes, 22 per cent from various taxes on consumer goods (tobacco, retail sales, fuel), and around 7 per cent from transfers from Crown corporations. The annual transfer payments from the federal government roughly totalled $15 billion. Annual expenditures by the provincial state of Quebec for the same period averaged approximately $69 billion, with roughly half going to health, social services and education, and almost $625 million to culture.\n\nIn 1980, the accumulated deficit in Quebec was around $8 billion, rising dramatically to $67 billion by 1995. This was a serious problem that the government of Premier Lucien Bouchard tried to solve by following the example of other provinces, like Alberta, which drastically cut expenditures in order to reduce its deficits. Although the government regained fiscal balance in the 2000s, its debt continued to grow, and by 2013, it had reached $191 billion.\n\nSocial Institutions and Health\n\nQuebec has a provincial charter of human rights (Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne), a consumer protection act, a provincial automobile insurance system, and separate income security and family allowance systems. Quebec also has a complex network of more than 800 social institutions. Among them are hospitals, community centres and long-term care facilities for the elderly. Since 1965, an agency of the Quebec government has managed Quebec's social benefits programs. Several institutions such as R\u00e9gie des rentes du Qu\u00e9bec, R\u00e9gie de l'assurance-automobile and Commission \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et au bien-\u00eatre invest their funds in the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et de placement du Qu\u00e9bec. As of 31 December 2013, the Caisse had $200.1 billion in assets and a four-year annualized return of 10 per cent. The Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et de placement is arguably the most important achievement of the 1960s reforms that gave the Quebec government a greater role in the province's economy.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation in Quebec dates back to the mid-17th century with primary schools run by religious orders in major cities of New France, including Quebec City, Montr\u00e9al and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. Secondary education also began during the 17th century with the establishment of the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec (Seminary of Quebec) in 1635. After 1680 the S\u00e9minaire offered more advanced courses, notably in law, mathematics and surveying. With the arrival of the Loyalists and British immigrants in late 18th Century, a complete English-language school system, from nursery school to university, was gradually established. McGill University, for example, opened in 1843. Section 93 of the BNA Act stipulated that, in the province of Quebec, the school system would be organized on the principle of religion. The system for English-speaking Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was financed by the provincial state in the same way and according to the same criteria as the French-language system.\n\nUntil the 1960s the French-language education system was decentralized. Local school boards were responsible for day-to-day operations while the Roman Catholic Church and the provincial state, through their representatives and the office of the provincial secretary, decided on programs and curricula. In the 1960s a commission led by Bishop Parent recommended several changes. Education became a higher priority and a growing consensus arose about the need to increase the general level of education and provide better technical training for specific jobs. The educational reform based on the conclusion of the Parent report produced four major innovations:\n\n1) Universal access to secondary education through a better network of high schools and a better regional representation through regional school boards.\n\n2) Establishment of the CEGEP system (Coll\u00e8ges d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel). This is an intermediate level between secondary school and university that provides post-secondary students with a two-year preparation for university or three years of advanced, job-related technical training.\n\n3) Establishment of a new university, which became the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec system. The new university offers programs in all regions of Quebec.\n\n4) Establishment of a Department or Ministry of Education, which became the ultimate authority in education.\n\nIn 2007-08, Quebec school boards consisted of 60 francophone, 9 anglophone and 3 special-status boards. Of this last category, two school boards served children from Aboriginal communities (the James Bay Cree and the Inuit of Nunavik). The province\u2019s school boards represented a total of 2,362 schools, not including 300 private schools (351 in 2014). Adult Education services were also offered. The passage of Bill 107 in December 1988 reorganized school boards from denominational to linguistic lines. Because of opposition by Catholic groups, however, implementation of the bill was postponed until 1993 when a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the constitutionality of the law. Then, in 1997, after a very long process, Quebec and the federal state agreed to change section 93 of the former BNA Act in order to guarantee the constitutionality of linguistic boards and to remove the religious criteria. In the 1990s the annual enrolment in the primary and secondary system averaged a little more than a million students.\n\nAt the post-secondary level, there are 43 francophone colleges or CEGEPs and 5 anglophone colleges. The university system consists of 18 institutions, including 8 private universities and one public university network. Four universities are francophone (Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, with two affiliated institutions; Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, incorporating ten institutions; Universit\u00e9 Laval; and Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke) and three are anglophone (Bishop\u2019s University, Concordia University and McGill University). The largest campus is the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. At the beginning of the 2010s, enrolment stood at over 180,000 students at the college level and more than 200,000 at the university level.\n\nCultural Life\n\nTechnically, Quebec is a province. Others claim that Quebec is a nation in the sense that it is the home of the French-speaking nation in North America and other Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois of non-French origins. Others, although they are more and more a rarity, believe that Quebec is the territory in which the most important component of the French-Canadian nation resides.\n\nArts\n\nFrench-Canadian cultural roots can be traced to the beginning of the 19th century in literature, painting and sculpture. Debate about the significance of the arts in the francophone community has been passionate since the 19th century. In literature, Father Henri-Raymond Casgrain in the second half of the 19th century and Bishop Camille Roy in the first half of the 20th century both sought to create literature that would reflect what they defined as the essence of French-Canadian society. They were challenged by the universalists who wanted a universal literature. After the Quiet Revolution, many writers, despite their claims that they were expressing a new identity, were, like Casgrain and Roy, exploring the identity of the French-speaking society now referred to as Qu\u00e9bec society.\n\nOne of the paradoxes of the last three decades is that the complexity of French-Canadian society in Quebec, before and after the Quiet Revolution, has been understated to the point that it has become a cultural stereotype. One of the consequences is that great French-Canadian artists from the past are almost forgotten today. A century ago one of the greatest divas was Emma Lajeunesse, known as Emma Albani. Her fame was comparable to that of C\u00e9line Dion today.\n\nThe cultural infrastructure in Quebec is impressive. There are 150 theatre companies, nearly 100 summer theatres and at least five important theatre festivals. The province has a dynamic music scene with over 100 musical organizations, including the Club musical du Qu\u00e9bec and the Ladies' Morning Musical Club, which started their activities in the 19th century. The Orchestre symphonique de Montr\u00e9al is ranked among the top orchestras in the world while a large number of music schools, in universities and conservatories, provide musical training. In dance, Quebec enjoys an international reputation with companies like Les Grands Ballets canadiens and La La La Human Steps. There are 59 institutions or schools of dance in the province. Montr\u00e9al has around 230 commercial cinemas and is the host of the prestigious Montr\u00e9al Film Festival. Directors such as Denys Arcand, Denis Villeneuve and Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e have won a number of international awards. No wonder that even Mordecai Richler, the prominent English-language novelist, once described francophone Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as the most cultivated people in Canada.\n\nCommunications\n\nFrancophone television networks in Quebec include Radio-Canada, TVA, V T\u00e9l\u00e9 and T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec; its all-news channels include RDI and LCN; and its anglophone networks include CBC, CTV and Global. Additionally, there are some 40 specialized francophone channels and many (mostly American) anglophone channels. A high proportion of the television watched by francophone Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is French-language programming produced in Quebec. It is estimated that Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois spend 70 per cent of their total viewing hours watching made-in-Quebec television shows. Quebec has approximately 60 private FM radio stations that broadcast during peak hours, as well as the public stations Radio-Canada and CBC. The province has 10 French-language and 2 English-language daily newspapers, more than 200 weeklies, more than 300 periodicals and more than 30 publications in languages other than French and English.\n\nHistoric Sites\n\nQuebec is home to 190 of Canada\u2019s national historic sites, approximately 30 of which are managed by Parks Canada. Some of its best-known sites are Chambly Canal, Joly-de-Lotbini\u00e8re Estate, Forges Saint-Maurice, the Fortifications of Qu\u00e9bec, the L\u00e9vis Forts, Grosse \u00cele and the Irish Memorial, Jardins de M\u00e9tis, \u00c9tienne-Paschal-Tach\u00e9 House, Sir Wilfrid Laurier National Historic Site, Manoir Papineau, Pointe-du-Buisson (Mus\u00e9e qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie) and the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, Quebec\u2019s National Assembly enacted the Cultural Heritage Act to replace the Cultural Property Act (1972). This new legislation broadened the notion of heritage and the government\u2019s sphere of action in heritage protection. Like its predecessor, the Cultural Heritage Act promotes knowledge, protection, enhancement and transmission of cultural property (immovables, sites, documents and objects), but it also includes heritage cultural landscapes, intangible heritage, and historic figures, events and sites. Finally, the new Act grants more powers to municipalities and Aboriginal communities, including a greater role in ascribing legal status to cultural heritage elements located in their territory."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/trudeaus-death", "page_content": "Trudeau's Death\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau: 1919-2000\n\nFlamboyant and contradictory, as cerebral as he was physical, he enchanted, inspired - and at times enraged - Canadians with his vision and his passion for the country. He changed Canada forever, and in the process, he touched our souls.\n\nThroughout his nearly 81 years, Pierre Trudeau seemed to live by extremes: he either filled a room with his charisma and energy, or withdrew completely, making his boredom and lack of interest apparent to all. One such time came in the fall of 1979, when Trudeau agreed to meet visiting political-science students from Montreal's Concordia University. His Liberals had lost the election to Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives in the spring, and he was struggling with the unaccustomed role of leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Shortly before the scheduled 10 a.m. meeting on Parliament Hill, the 20-odd students were squirming nervously in their seats when, one later recalled, \"you could feel him enter before you saw or heard him.\"\n\nIn battered sports jacket and casual pants, Trudeau strode energetically to the front of the room and perched, half-sitting, on a table. Without a hello, he gestured at the group and said, \"What are your hopes? What are your dreams? Who are you, and what do you want to become?\" After a moment's stunned silence, a student asked Trudeau why, as prime minister, he had not used his constitutional power to disallow recent Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois legislation that declared French to be Quebec's only official language. Trudeau's face turned to stone. He gave a stiff, legalistic answer. Shortly after, he looked pointedly at his watch, mumbled an excuse - and left.\n\nFor Canadians, it always seemed that way with Trudeau - there were no half measures, and no telling what he might do or say next. But whether they were enchanted, enraged or rebuffed by the man who was their prime minister for 15 years and five months, they were never indifferent to him. On Sept. 7, when his sons Justin and Sacha issued a statement declaring that their father was \"not well\" and asking for privacy, Canadians instead turned their attention towards Trudeau again. Reporters camped outside his Montreal home, strangers delivered flowers and get-well wishes, and people across the country speculated about his health. Then, the initial fuss subsided - but the burst of media coverage, much of it nostalgic in tone, had once again put him at the forefront of Canadians' thoughts.\n\nIn all, it was the kind of attention once devoted to the passing of royalty. And when the news broke that Trudeau had died of prostate cancer - he had battled pneumonia, compounded by the onset of Parkinson's disease and, perhaps, the depression he felt ever since the 1998 death of his third son, Michel - the tributes came from Canadians of all backgrounds and political persuasions.\n\nShared sorrow - towards a politician whose legacy will still be debated decades from now. Trudeau's economic achievements were, at best, mixed. His other key accomplishments are easy enough to recount - but often draw vastly different reactions. He overhauled the Criminal Code as justice minister to legalize homosexual acts and abortion, and introduced the Official Languages Act. Add to that the decisive 1980 Quebec referendum victory, the patriation of the Constitution and the introduction of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms - along with such lesser initiatives as lowering the voting age to 18 from 21 and introducing television to Parliament. He also brought forward the 1980 legislation establishing the National Energy Program, which the Liberals said was aimed at safeguarding the country's oil supply from foreign domination.\n\nAlmost all of those initiatives have their detractors. Many westerners are still rankled by the memory of the NEP, which lasted until 1984 and was seen as a sign of both unwanted government intervention and, because it established a range of new taxes and price controls over domestically produced oil and natural gas, a symbol of the way in which Central Canada was prepared to siphon money from the West to prop up its own economy. As to the charter, some critics complain that it puts too much power in the hands of judges instead of elected representatives. Others say official bilingualism is artificial and overly expensive. (To that, Trudeau said memorably in 1968: \"Of course, a bilingual state is more expensive than a unilingual one, but it is a richer state.\")\n\nEven on the issue of Quebec, Trudeau may have done as much to stoke the flames of sovereignty in recent years as he once did to try to stamp out the movement. His strong opposition to the Meech Lake constitutional accord in 1990, for one, galvanized anti-Meech forces in English Canada - but the subsequent collapse of the accord gave a strong boost to sovereigntist fortunes. And the incident that drove his poll numbers to their highest levels ever - the October, 1970, imposition of the War Measures Act after the kidnapping of British diplomat James Cross and Quebec labour minister Pierre Laporte - is criticized by some historians as an unnecessary abuse of human rights.\n\nTrudeau, however, was no stranger to debate - or contradiction. Born to a millionaire family whose fortune was made from a chain of service stations, he was a notorious penny-pincher in private life who favoured left-leaning, big-spending policies in government. In 1963, he campaigned on behalf of the NDP, and called the Liberals \"idiots\" for allowing Lester Pearson to permit nuclear warheads in Canada. But two years later, he ran for the Liberals under Pearson, and within two months of his election, became Pearson's parliamentary secretary. And despite his professed disdain for the parish-pump side of elected politics, he eventually became a frequent and adept practitioner of patronage: his departing 1984 round of appointments to old supporters and cabinet colleagues stoked one of the controversies that helped sink successor John Turner.\n\nMuch of Trudeau's early appeal as prime minister came from his dashing, flamboyant style. During his 20s, as author Gordon Donaldson recounted in his 1994 book, The Prime Ministers of Canada, Trudeau \"drifted through occupied Germany on faked papers, was slung in jail for trying to enter Yugoslavia without a visa\" and, in Palestine, \"was arrested as a Zionist spy and thrown into a dungeon where Christ is supposed to have been held. After emerging, he was accosted by bandits, whom he scared off by feigning madness and raving in Montreal slang.\" As a politician, he had no less flair. He sported a green leather jacket, on occasion showed up in the House of Commons wearing sandals, and drove a funky Mercedes 300-SL sports convertible.\n\nSometimes, he walked to his office on Parliament Hill from 24 Sussex Drive. Accosted one day outside Parliament by a 17-year-old girl who asked for a kiss, he responded \"why not, it's spring\" - and bussed her. Although he affected disdain for the media, it never seemed a coincidence that his most colourful acts - such as performing a pirouette at Buckingham Palace - occurred with many cameras close by. And he was often keen to chat or lunch or dine with women reporters - even when he wasn't necessarily trying to date them. Those sessions sometimes evolved into policy discussions. When one young reporter told him how she had just visited a Cape Breton smelter and found that conditions there made it \"the worst place on earth,\" Trudeau, fascinated, launched a long series of questions as to whether that amounted to a good argument for nuclear power.\n\nBut his often flip behaviour masked a character of much greater complexity - although he kept his deeper inner thoughts largely to himself. Even acquaintances who had known him for decades said they found him hard to read emotionally. When Trudeau's old friend G\u00e9rard Pelletier died in 1997, Donald Macdonald, a former cabinet colleague of both men, said Pelletier was \"the last of a small circle of lifelong friends.\" A former aide to Trudeau in the Prime Minister's Office, who saw him on a daily basis for more than two years, remarked years later that \"I'm not sure Mr. Trudeau ever knew my full name.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Trudeau was at his most open with children. In the early 1980s, a senior civil servant working in the Privy Council Office happened to mention to Trudeau that his nine-year-old daughter was a great fan of the Canadian a cappella group the Nylons - who were scheduled to perform on Parliament Hill for Dominion (now Canada) Day festivities that year. On July 1, as the group was coming onstage, Trudeau, from his front-row seat, gestured to the girl to join him at his seat. He bounced her on his knees in time with the music, and at the end, leaped up to dance with her.\n\nTrudeau was capable of forming unlikely enthusiasms for political opponents. Despite their many differences, he was hugely fond of former Tory prime minister John Diefenbaker, and once declared: \"I just love that old guy.\" When the former prime minister fell ill just before Trudeau's departure for a European trip, Trudeau and then-aide Joyce Fairbairn devised a secret code - Daffodil - so he could receive updates on Diefenbaker's health. \"I would message what the weather was - and whether the daffodils were blooming,\" Fairbairn recalled several years ago.\n\nTrudeau's emotions ran deepest over the issue of his native Quebec. His contempt for the nationalist movement was open and undisguised - although it did not necessarily extend to some of its pro-sovereigntist practitioners. Many members of the first PQ government in 1976 were people Trudeau had worked alongside in early years, when progressive Quebecers were united against the authoritarian government of Maurice Duplessis. Once, in the late 1970s, Trudeau gave a news conference in Quebec City. When it was over, reporters were startled to see several PQ cabinet members, led by language hardliner Camille Laurin, rush up to greet Trudeau, who greeted them equally warmly. And while Trudeau fought the Yes side with sometimes scathing mockery during the 1980 referendum, his remarks immediately after the vote were respectful. \"To my fellow Quebecers who have been wounded by defeat,\" he said, \"I wish to say simply that we have all lost a little in this referendum.\"\n\nTrudeau was unapologetic about his preoccupation with Quebec. In 1973, he told CTV's W-Five that his reasons for getting into politics were twofold: \"One, to make sure that Quebec wouldn't leave Canada through separatism, and the other, to make sure that Canada wouldn't shove Quebec out through narrow-mindedness.\" That assertion makes it all the more ironic that, in recent years, Trudeau continued to rise in the esteem of English Canada, while in Quebec - where his Liberals won 74 of 75 seats in his last election - his popularity plummeted. The primary reason was his visceral opposition to the Meech accord, as well as the failed 1992 Charlottetown accord. On both occasions, he argued that any agreement that gave Quebec extra powers over other provinces was \"insulting\" because it implied Quebecers needed extra protection to thrive.\n\nThat argument was bitterly resented by both sovereigntists and many Quebec federalists; Trudeau was alternately described within the province as being out-of-date or anti-Quebec. Michel C. Auger, political columnist for Quebec's largest newspaper, Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, observed several years ago that \"for both federalists and sovereigntists, Trudeau has fallen off the radar screen. His ideas are seen as outdated.\" Still, the former prime minister continued to be treated with respect personally by both friends and opponents. On an international level, said Alain Gagnon, director of McGill University's Quebec studies program, \"francophone Quebecers were always very proud of having Mr. Trudeau as a statesman.\" But, Gagnon said, Trudeau's death caused less emotion among francophone Quebecers because many felt he was antagonistic towards them.\n\nEven within the federal Liberal party, feelings about Trudeau's legacy and policies are sometimes divided. Trudeau's opposition to Meech, something he shared with Jean Chr\u00e9tien, split the party sharply in 1990 because then-Leader Turner and others, including current Finance Minister Paul Martin, supported the accord. Those rifts are still evident - most clearly, some Liberals say, in the coolness that persists between Chr\u00e9tien and Martin. But Chr\u00e9tien's own relationship with his former boss has often been complicated. Although he has always made a point of publicly praising Trudeau, Chr\u00e9tien has many times, with mixed anger and sorrow, told the story of how, when he was finance minister in 1978, Trudeau blindsided him by announcing a $2-billion budget cut without telling him in advance.\n\nAnd Chr\u00e9tien has also struggled to get out from under Trudeau's giant shadow. When the Liberals came to power in 1993, Chr\u00e9tien would call Trudeau about once a month. After a while, the gap between those calls lengthened - and Trudeau, in the wake of the 1995 referendum, publicly complained at a news conference that he \"sat on my hands\" during the campaign because no one asked him to get involved.\n\nBut Trudeau has remained a strong force among rank-and-file Liberals. His name continues to evoke potent memories and images. They are many: the fearless Trudeau who sat unblinking while protesters threw stones during the 1968 St-Jean-Baptiste Day rally in Montreal; the romantic swashbuckler who dated Barbra Streisand, Margot Kidder and Liona Boyd and married Margaret; Trudeau the philosopher, the gunslinger and the devoted father. And, finally, the smooth and sophisticated leader who seemed at home on any stage around the world - so much so that former U.S. vice-president Walter Mondale once called him \"a priceless asset to the industrialized world.\"\n\nIn the end, it was never clear how many of those images were convenient creations he fashioned for himself, and how many reflected his real inner self. For all his time in public life, he was clearly happiest in private, testing his limits in treks and canoe trips either by himself, with his sons or a few friends. He gave a rare look into his thoughts on life in a 1944 essay called \"Exhaustion and Fulfilment: The Ascetic in a Canoe.\" At the age of 25, with the self-assurance of youth, he solemnly and rather ponderously outlined the joys to be had from a canoe trip that lasts \"for days, or weeks, or perhaps months on end.\"\n\nThe attraction, he said, is that \"you return not so much a man who reasons more, but a more reasonable man. For, throughout this time, your mind has learned to exercise itself in the working conditions that nature intended.\" There was something else, he concluded, about the outdoors. \"I know a man whose school could never teach him patriotism,\" Trudeau wrote, \"but who acquired that virtue when he felt in his bones the vastness of his land, and the greatness of those who founded it.\" Reason was Trudeau's watchword, along with passion for his country. Canadians will long remember - and revere - him for both.\n\nA Very Private Politician\n\nThe images are burned into the Canadian imagination. The naughty Pierre Trudeau pirouetting behind the back of the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the gunslinger, the playboy dancing with a fetching beauty half his age, the athletic Trudeau jackknifing into a pool. Despite his age - he was in his late 40s when he burst onto the public stage by winning the Liberal leadership in 1968 - there seemed to be a glow about him, as if pure energy was oozing from his pores. Yet years later, Trudeau would describe solitary nights spent with his three young sons as the source of true contentment. \"Every Saturday night, I would get away from my commitments and read to them,\" he told York University professor B. W. Powe for an essay contained in the 1998 book Trudeau's Shadow. \"It was one of the happiest periods of my life.\"\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau was a contradiction: a man who guarded his privacy jealously while choosing the most public of vocations, a reclusive figure who revelled in acting the showman. But above all, his longtime friend Senator Serge Joyal told Maclean's, he was a family man who doted on his children, Justin, Sacha and the ill-fated Michel, who was swept to his death by an avalanche in British Columbia's Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park two years ago at the age of 23. \"He told me immediately after leaving government in 1984 that the most important thing in his life now was his children and overseeing their education,\" recalls Joyal. Trudeau leaped to the task as single-mindedly as he took to politics, often eschewing social and political engagements so that he could spend time with his sons at the family's country home in the Laurentians, or taking them on experience-broadening trips to France, England, China and Siberia.\n\nTrudeau's devotion may have been partly an attempt to catch up after the years when he was too occupied with the affairs of state. He was 51 in 1971 and still in his first mandate as prime minister when he married Margaret Sinclair, a na\u00efve Vancouver flower child 29 years his junior. The children came in quick succession, and although he often took one or two on foreign trips with him, he lamented in his 1993 Memoirs that the hectic life of a politician necessitated leaving the kids behind with the young Margaret.\n\nShe would later describe the period in terms of claustrophobic torment. She felt abandoned, a prisoner in the gilded cage of 24 Sussex Drive. The fairy-tale marriage began unravelling and the couple separated in 1977. They finally divorced in 1984, three months before Trudeau stepped down as prime minister. He demanded and obtained sole custody of the children.\n\nAs Trudeau adapted to the role of single dad, never publicly speaking of his turbulent breakup, Margaret broke free in spectacular fashion. Even before their split, her escapades famously included drug use and partying with The Rolling Stones. Later, her dalliances included Jack Nicholson, Geraldo Rivera and parties at New York City's celebrated Studio 54 that made headlines around the world and became fodder for the two tell-all books she penned, 1979's Beyond Reason and Consequences in 1982. If Trudeau minded - and who wouldn't - or worried about the effect their mother's extravagant behaviour had on the sons, he never said so. In fact, Trudeau partly blamed himself, writing in Memoirs that he was ill-prepared for the many demands of his public and private life. \"I was a neophyte at both politics and family life,\" Trudeau wrote. \"I married late in life and I was learning about marriage and parenthood at the same time as I was learning about the workings of politics. So perhaps it was a little too much for me and, regrettably, I didn't succeed all that well.\"\n\nHe was determined to make amends to his children - and spend more time with them. It was something he missed with his own father, who died when Trudeau was 15 and was relatively absent during his formative years. Instead, it was his mother, Grace Elliott, who was the constant presence, instilling in him a love of learning and books. Friends say Trudeau was able to pass on to his children his own twin passions for the outdoors and for intellectual pursuits.\n\nMargaret, meanwhile, continued to visit the children regularly at Trudeau's Montreal home, even after she had married Ottawa businessman Fried Kemper and had two children with him. Recently, she still called Trudeau \"the love of my life,\" in spite of the rupture in their relationship. And she was with him when his failing health took a turn for the worse.\n\nPerhaps the strangest chapter of Trudeau's private life was the revelation that he had fathered the daughter of Deborah Coyne, a constitutional adviser to Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells during the Meech Lake saga. While the relationship cooled after the birth of Sarah on May 5, 1991, Trudeau continued to visit his daughter in Toronto, where Coyne lived for a time in the 1990s. According to friends, he also made sure his sons came to regard her as a sister. Typically, Trudeau has never publicly talked about the unconventional relationship.\n\nTrudeau's decline accelerated in 1997 with the death of his old friend G\u00e9rard Pelletier. Along with Trudeau, he was one of Quebec's \"Three Wise Men\" who came to Ottawa in the 1960s (the third, Jean Marchand, died in 1988). Seventeen months later, Michel died tragically. The first loss devastated Trudeau, the second appeared to crush him. He soon fell ill with pneumonia, with which he was hospitalized for 10 days last January. \"He's never really recovered,\" Joyal said.\n\nAt the funeral of Pelletier, Trudeau, a devout Roman Catholic, read a passage from Corinthians, adding his personal postscript: \"Part of my soul has left me - and he's waiting for me.\" The sentiment must have been doubly true with the loss of Michel - for a man who, throughout his life, hid his private pains as adamantly as he showcased his public flamboyance.\n\nThe Star of His Own Movie\n\nThere was Barbra Streisand and Jane Fonda. Liona Boyd and Maggie. Pierre Trudeau also dated actors Margot Kidder and Kim Cattrall, now one of the stars of HBO's sizzling series Sex and the City. Some were lovers, some just friends. But their combined numbers and beauty made one thing clear: Trudeau was more than Canada's Prime Minister - he was also our leading man.\n\nFollowing a generation of dutiful but dour postwar politicians like Lester Pearson, John Diefenbaker and Bob Stanfield, Trudeau arrived like a comet, entering the Canadian atmosphere adorned in black cape and fancy fedoras. Whether playing the role of urban dandy or buckskinned outdoorsman, he was always the star of his own movie, always the remote and rakish sex symbol who made women swoon. And what a range of characters he played. He moved from eligible bachelor to married man, doting dad and cuckolded husband without ever losing his appeal. \"There was a 1940s movie star quality about Trudeau,\" says Linda Griffiths, the Toronto actor and co-creator of the one-woman stage play Maggie and Pierre. \"He had that old-fashioned courtly, gentlemanly thing, where somebody was always on his arm.\"\n\nBut he also had a modern magnetism that the mass media both fed on and magnified. In June, 1968, during his first election campaign as leader of the Liberal party, the country was swept up in Trudeaumania. As if at a Beatles concert, young and not-so-young girls screamed and demanded kisses when the unpredictable 48-year-old politician whistle-stopped into their towns. Trudeau gloried in the adulation. But, according to Christina McCall, it also changed him.\n\nIn her book Grits, McCall says Trudeau was not always the dashing lothario. Before coming to power, he was socially shy and diffident. As an MP (he was first elected to Parliament in 1965), he would slip in and out of official gatherings without anyone noticing but his closest friends. His relationships with women - who were often half his age - were usually brief. But after 1968, McCall says, Trudeau's \"sweet reticence had vanished and was replaced by a display of overweening pride.\" Now, when he entered a room, \"women swarmed to him, mouths moist, eyes translucent.\"\n\nOne of them was Margaret Sinclair, a na\u00efve Vancouver flower child who first met Trudeau on a beach in Tahiti before he became prime minister. In 1971, after a clandestine courtship, they were married in a ceremony kept secret from the public. He was 51, she was 22. Together, they had three sons: Justin, Sacha and Michel (who was killed in 1998 at age 23 in an avalanche in British Columbia). By 1977, the marriage had collapsed when Margaret sought her freedom from what she described as the \"unbearable\" confines of her life with Trudeau at 24 Sussex Drive.\n\nMargaret was the only woman who ever lived with Trudeau. The rest of his celebrity dates seemed at times intended to be little more than glamorous appendages for photo ops, arm candy for this otherwise solitary man. What did these women really mean to Trudeau? We may never know. In his book Memoirs, Trudeau summed up the breakup of his marriage to Margaret briefly and tersely, concluding: \"Anyone who has gone through the breakdown of a marriage - perhaps without three small children, and perhaps not in the glare of the public spotlight - will understand why I choose to write no more about the matter.\" He has said nothing about other relationships. Perhaps for the impermeable Trudeau, silence was the best refuge.\n\nHe Inspired an Entire Generation\n\nWhen the history of our times is written, Pierre Trudeau will be acknowledged as the greatest public figure that Canada produced in the second half of the 20th century. This will not be in recognition of his accomplishments at home, which were considerable, or of his achievements on the international stage, which weren't. It will be because he did what no politician before or since has done: he touched the dreams of an entire generation of Canadians. He made them excited about politics and public affairs. He caused them to believe they could actually change the country and even the world. He inspired them to get personally involved. And many of the idealists who were inspired by Trudeau are still involved - in Parliament and provincial legislatures, the senior levels of the public service, the judiciary, the professions, broadcasting and the arts. He changed their lives. He set them off along paths they might not otherwise have taken. He made them, and the country, better.\n\nTrudeau was lucky, of course. Timing is everything in politics, and he caught the wave perfectly. He appeared on the scene just as the nation, emerging from the high of Expo 67 and the Centennial, was looking for ways to extend the excitement. It was a time of national confidence, when anything seemed possible. The year he won the Liberal leadership, 1968, was a year of turmoil in many parts of the world as students took to the streets in protest over, chiefly, the war in Vietnam. A similar ferment pervaded Canada but instead of resisting it, Trudeau tapped into it, distilled it, channelled the desire for change and reform into the established political process - and, instead of bloody clashes on the barricades, we had Trudeaumania.\n\nHis detractors maintained Trudeau was a creation of the mass media. If that were so, he would have crashed and burned within a year. He soared because he was what the country was ready for at that time - a leader who did not look or sound like a politician and who seemed not to care about personal popularity, a reformer who believed government could be changed, improved and made to serve the people better. He was also smart, very smart, not to mention articulate (in both official languages), athletic, dashing, glamorous, sexy and strong. We all wished we could be just like him.\n\nJournalists and others who travelled with him over the years - as I did to places like India, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia, Cuba and Venezuela - could not help but feel a small thrill of national pride at the interest and curiosity he provoked among the politicians and press in the countries we visited. For perhaps the first time ever, they were genuinely interested in a Canadian leader. He was a star and, because he was, Canada was something of a star, too.\n\nIt didn't last long. Trudeau's weaknesses were managing the domestic economy and foreign policy. True, he recognized Red China (as it was known then), but does anyone remember his \"Third Option\" and his much-vaunted \"contractual link\" with Europe? Stripped to its essentials, his foreign policy amounted to little more than a futile attempt to distance Canada from the United States, whether by cozying up to its enemies, like Fidel Castro, or by negotiating closer ties with Europeans or others.\n\nAt home, his achievements were real: the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, divorce and abortion reform, the Official Languages Act, patriation of the Constitution, and entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. These and other initiatives are Trudeau's legacy to the nation. But what makes him much more than just another prime minister with a superior legislative record who won a few elections and ultimately overstayed his welcome is the transforming effect he had on the generation of Canadians who propelled him into office. Singlehandedly, he increased the public's expectations of political leadership, in the process raising the bar for those who would come after him.\n\nCan you imagine young people today defying their parents to attend a Stockwell Day rally? Pushing and shoving to touch the garments of Joe Clark? Swooning at the sight of Paul Martin? Or girls (and their moms) clawing their way through police lines to plant a big kiss on the lips of Jean Chr\u00e9tien?\n\nYes, bring on the historians.\n\nFarewell to a Titan\n\nEven for Canada's most celebrated political warrior, some battles end in defeat. Last week, after months of failing health, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau succumbed to prostate cancer. The country responded with an outpouring of emotion, more muted perhaps than the tidal wave of Trudeaumania that began his prime ministerial career in 1968, but no less warm. And dignified, as befitted the man who had swashbuckled through Canada's often fractious political life and yet had somehow, always, risen above it.\n\nParliament stood still - tributes flowed even from longtime adversaries. One last time, Trudeau returned to the place he had dominated for 16 years, his body lying in state over the weekend in Parliament's Hall of Honour. Throughout two days and nights, Canadians from all corners came to pay their respects, many with children who were born after he left office. His Art Deco home in Montreal, where he died on Sept. 28 at age 80, surrounded by his ex-wife, Margaret, and their sons, Justin and Sacha, became an impromptu shrine for friends and admirers who laid red roses at the front door. And across Canada, ordinary Canadians - Anglo-Albertans who had been inspired to learn French because of him, immigrants who had come to Canada because of his reputation, matronly women who had once flirted briefly with him at some political function - remembered, and were inspired again.\n\nThe world, too, remembered. Trudeau's death was front-page news in The Times of London and The New York Times, which called him \"a dashing fighter for Canada.\" The United Nations Security Council observed a moment of silence. The Queen and other heads of state and government sent their condolences to the Trudeau family. Other prime ministers have left their mark on the world stage. Trudeau didn't just stride the world stage, he danced upon it, his insatiable curiosity and sophistication carrying the rest of us along in his wake.\n\nFew Canadians realized just how ill Trudeau had been. For at least two years, he suffered from Parkinson's disease, a debilitating nervous system disorder, and prostate cancer. Friends said the death of Michel, his youngest son, swept away by an avalanche while hiking in British Columbia in November, 1998, sent Trudeau into a profound depression. And earlier this summer, after a four-day retreat in rural New Brunswick with his son Sacha and old friend Rom\u00e9o LeBlanc, Trudeau, a celebrated outdoorsman, returned to his Montreal home and suffered a stroke on Aug. 5 that sent him to hospital. \"It was a wonderful four days,\" recalled former governor general LeBlanc, who had been Trudeau's press secretary from 1968 to 1971. \"He was so amazed by the world around him.\"\n\nAfter lying in state on Parliament Hill, Trudeau's body was to be transported to Montreal by train on Monday for last respects and a state funeral on Tuesday at Notre-Dame Basilica. The federal government has created a Web site for Canadians to pass along their memories and condolences, at www.trudeau.gc.ca. He will be buried in Montreal. His legacy will be rooted in the country at large.\n\nThe Fight of a Lifetime\n\nIt was the fight of his life, the upshot of what one biographer would later call Pierre Trudeau's \"magnificent obsession.\" But to achieve what he did in the spring of 1982 - patriation of the Constitution from Britain after 51 years of fruitless attempts, and with a wide-ranging Charter of Rights and Freedoms that entrenched his cherished goal of linguistic guarantees for French- and English-Canadians - required something more than obsession. It took political ruthlessness, a willingness to turn the country almost on its ear.\n\nWas this all about Quebec? Well, yes - and no. It started that way, of course. Trudeau was, after all, a product of the political and intellectual ferment there in the late 1950s and early 1960s, an upheaval that divided Quebec's best and brightest into bitterly opposed camps. Although he was an eager participant in some of the early causes, such as the wrenching strikes of asbestos and Radio-Canada workers, Trudeau would have no truck with the nationalists of Quebec. He saw Quebec nationalism, as he did Maurice Duplessis's repressive postwar regime, as backward and valuing the state above the individual. For Trudeau - \"Citizen of the world,\" said the badge he tacked to his door at Harvard in 1945 - this was definitely not the road to be travelled. What he wanted was a Canada and a Quebec constructed more in his own image: bilingual and bicultural, and above all else, with the freedom to choose. For Trudeau, language was a right, like free speech and individual choice - one of the \"counterweights,\" as he called them in his early essays, to the power of the state.\n\nAchieving these objectives would not be easy. And for Trudeau, his combative personality would set the tone. He was, after all, the rookie justice minister in Lester Pearson's government who made his mark by knocking heads publicly with Quebec premier Daniel Johnson in early 1968 at a federal-provincial conference. He was the fledgling Liberal leader who won the country's respect later that year by sitting, unflinching, in the review stand of Montreal's St-Jean-Baptiste Day parade while bottles thrown by separatist supporters shattered around him. He was the prime minister who invoked the War Measures Act in 1970 and refused to negotiate with terrorists - the strongman who kept his head while others panicked.\n\nBy the time of the first Quebec referendum on sovereignty in May, 1980, the Trudeau legend - French Power in Ottawa, standing up to nationalists in Quebec - was complete. For the first time, the country had a French-Canadian prime minister who was enormously popular in his home province (the federal Liberals had just won 74 of 75 seats in the 1980 election and would go on to win the referendum campaign three months later by 60 per cent to 40 per cent) and willing to take on a Quebec government in a high-stakes game of political poker. Five prime ministers before him had tried and failed to budge the stone sled of constitutional reform. Trudeau himself had spent the best part of 12 years trying to cajole agreement from the provinces. And now he was facing growing demands for more powers from the West, where burgeoning oil revenues were also fuelling provincial ambitions.\n\nTrudeau's home province had consistently refused to accept patriation, let alone linguistic guarantees that might affect education (a provincial jurisdiction) until its demands for greater autonomy were met. And language was proving to be a flash point. Language riots in the suburbs of Montreal contributed hugely to Bourassa's defeat by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque in 1976, and led directly to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois' Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language and the antithesis of everything Trudeau held sacred. And in L\u00e9vesque, Trudeau would confront a leader who was not only a fierce adversary but one who represented the nationalist flip side of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois coin.\n\nThe two men could not have been more different. Judging by his electoral success in the province, Trudeau was widely admired. He was the man who could dance on the broader Canadian and world stages and allow Quebecers to bask in his cosmopolitan glory. But L\u00e9vesque was the one they loved. A rumpled, rubber ball of a man, a former war correspondent who came to host one of the most popular TV shows in the province, L\u00e9vesque was just as engaging as Trudeau. But he also seemed to embody all of the sometimes frustrating, sometimes endearing insecurities of a people struggling to find their place in the sea of Anglo North America.\n\nThe two men had been butting heads since the early 1960s, when L\u00e9vesque was a popular, reform-minded minister in Jean Lesage's Liberal government and Trudeau a sardonic law professor and a member of L\u00e9vesque's informal circle of advisers. L\u00e9vesque was one of only a handful of prominent Quebecers who opposed Trudeau's implementation of the War Measures Act. He paid a price for it at the polls three years later when his upstart PQ was nearly wiped out by Bourassa's Liberals. But by 1979, when Joe Clark's Tories surprised the federal Liberals and won a minority government, L\u00e9vesque thought he would have the last laugh. With Trudeau sidelined, L\u00e9vesque called his long-awaited referendum on sovereignty-association for the spring of 1980. But Clark's government self-destructed after only nine months in power, allowing Trudeau's Liberals to come roaring back with the enthusiasm of the born-again.\n\nIn typical Trudeau fashion, he took the referendum battle right to the enemy's heartland, the Paul Sauv\u00e9 Arena in east-end Montreal, where L\u00e9vesque had celebrated his 1976 election victory, and pledged to change the constitutional order to accommodate Quebec. \"Even I was impressed at the time,\" allowed the PQ's veteran strategist Claude Morin. But this was to be more than a strict Quebec-Ottawa round. The rejuvenated Liberal government took on the West and the growing autonomy of premiers like Alberta's Peter Lougheed by creating the despised National Energy Program. It cut back on transfer payments to the provinces - to howls of protest. Trudeau also hinted that, in the area of constitutional reform, Ottawa might go it alone. And after a desultory meeting of first ministers in September, 1980, he made good on his threat to try to patriate the Constitution unilaterally with a charter of rights - including the minority language rights that were certain to antagonize the West.\n\nTwo decades later, it is difficult to recall the intensity of that period. But for nearly 18 long months, from the emotion-ridden sovereignty referendum to the patriation agreement in November, 1981 - with an angry Quebec on the sidelines - the battle raged with a fierceness that only the fight over conscription in 1942 and, later, free trade in 1988, would match. Court challenges were mounted. Only two provinces, Ontario and New Brunswick, backed Ottawa's initiative. The charter of rights was created by a special parliamentary committee - the first to have its hearings televised - in an extraordinary conclave of one-upmanship and partisan bickering. By the time the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on the legality of the unilateral initiative - it was legal, the court found, but broke with convention, a serious rebuke to Trudeau - the country was exhausted. Only Trudeau seemed calm as he convened what he called \"the one last time\" constitutional conference for Nov. 2, 1981. It almost lived up to its billing.\n\nFor three days, the two sides offered up only half-hearted compromises. The dissident premiers in the so-called Gang of Eight provinces showed some cracks - Saskatchewan's Allan Blakeney, especially, tried to hold out an olive branch to Trudeau. But the coalition seemed to be holding. In fact, on the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 4, after the third day of steadily deteriorating talks, L\u00e9vesque sat in his Hull, Que., hotel room, sipping cognac with close colleagues, confident that he had beaten back all the federal initiatives.\n\nLittle did L\u00e9vesque know that across the river in Ottawa's Ch%teau Laurier Hotel the three most westerly provinces and Newfoundland were cobbling together one final offer. Nor did he realize that, earlier in the day, his flirtation with Trudeau's suggestion of a referendum to decide the fate of the charter had driven a wedge through the dissident coalition. The premiers were fighting arrogance and abuse of process - but did not want to take on the popular charter of rights. The next morning, L\u00e9vesque came face-to-face with the sweaty opportunism of Canadian politics - and with the slightly messy reality that was to become Pierre Trudeau's Canada. \"We have a new proposal, Ren\u00e9,\" Newfoundland's Brian Peckford announced laconically at the regular breakfast meeting of the Gang of Eight. \"It's there by your plate.\"\n\nIt is tempting to say that the formal arrangement reached later that day was a classic Canadian compromise. The dissident provinces, with the exception of Quebec, would accept Trudeau's charter of rights (with a few modifications). Trudeau, in turn, would incorporate their preferred amending formula. But that interpretation would not take into account Trudeau's exercise of an enormous amount of raw prime ministerial willpower. He outfoxed L\u00e9vesque by challenging him mano a mano, playing on their long-standing rivalry. He outmanoeuvred the West by daring its premiers to be the populists they claimed they were and accept the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, language guarantees and all, on the grounds that it reflected the desires of the people. And he left a legacy that is still being debated.\n\nQuebec's anger at being left behind by its allies - \"It's the Canadian way,\" L\u00e9vesque hissed that fateful morning, \"to abandon Quebec at the moment of crisis\" - has reverberated through the decades: Meech Lake, the Charlottetown accord, Lucien Bouchard's sovereignty referendum of 1995. The West's appetite for reform, and its resolve to never again be taken for granted, is unabated. Add to those the welter of new charter-inspired rights and challenges that Canadian courts are constantly grappling with. All of these are part of Trudeau's legacy. They may not have been the counterweights he once wrote about with such enthusiasm. But they have become the true counterweights in the Canada of today, competing passions that propel a society forward and keep it in check at the same time, passions that he fanned with so much style and perhaps even purpose.\n\nNo time for 'weak-kneed people'\n\nJust after 8 o'clock on Monday, Oct. 5, 1970, a brilliant fall morning in Montreal, four members of the so-called Liberation Cell of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec abducted British trade commissioner James Cross from his home. In exchange for Cross's release, the men made seven demands, among them: $500,000 in gold bullion and the release of 23 \"political prisoners\" - fellow FLQ members in jail for terrorist acts. This was to be the first real test of Canada's new prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, at 50, just two years on the job, and, equally important, of his 37-year-old Quebec counterpart, Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa. The Quebec government wanted to appease the kidnappers by releasing at least some prisoners, but Trudeau convinced Bourassa to offer only safe passage out of the country. Within an hour of the announcement of that offer, on Saturday Oct. 10, provincial labour minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped while playing touch football outside his home on Montreal's South Shore by members of another FLQ cell.\n\nThe kidnappings sparked the implementation of the federal War Measures Act, which sent the police and army into the streets of Montreal to arrest, interrogate and detain more than 400 separatist sympathizers. Two days after its proclamation, Laporte was dead, strangled with his own gold neck chain and stuffed into the trunk of an old car. His murder sparked revulsion against political terrorism in Quebec and across the country. Laporte's murderers were eventually found and convicted. Cross's abductors gave up in December, releasing him and going into exile in Cuba and later France; some of them eventually returned to Quebec. The October Crisis transformed Pierre Trudeau, cementing his reputation for all time as a tough leader who would not back down. \"All I can say is, 'go on and bleed,' \" he told a CBC reporter in a famous interview on Parliament Hill in the midst of the crisis. \"But it is more important to keep law and order in society than to be worried about weak-kneed people.\"\n\nDallying With the Economy\n\nIn the spring of 1984, during his final wistful months as prime minister, Pierre Trudeau had to choose between two strikingly different policies that he could champion. He could continue his quixotic campaign for peace in a Cold War world during his final appearance at the annual meeting of the Western world's seven industrial powers, scheduled for June. Or he could urge his fellow leaders at the lavish London gathering to launch a global trading initiative to lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to secure Canada's future as a trading nation. As pre-summit briefings commenced, Trudeau listened carefully as deputy trade minister Sylvia Ostry warned that protectionism was rising dangerously in industrialized nations because Western manufacturers could not compete with the low prices of Third World imports. Ostry argued that Canada should find ways to counter that protectionist trend while helping its own hard-hit domestic sectors to adjust. The prime minister posed expert questions, nodding thoughtfully. Then, to the frustration of his civil servants and the consternation of his fellow leaders, he flew to the United Kingdom - and talked about disarmament.\n\nIt was always that way. It was not as if Trudeau did not understand economic theories. He did. It was not as though he did not care about the ever-deteriorating condition of the nation's finances. He did. But he lacked the patience to wade through the conflicting economic theories, develop a coherent plan - and stick with it.\n\nInstead, he dallied with one approach after another, reversing his own positions with breathtaking ease. One of those abrupt switches - the controversial decision to impose wage-and-price controls in October, 1975 - provoked the resignation of his respected finance minister, John Turner. Breaking his 25-year silence on Trudeau's most dramatic economic initiative, Turner told Maclean's that he vehemently objected to the imposition of controls - largely because the federal Liberals had romped to a majority government with the promise that they would not impose them. As well, Turner believed that the world was becoming too interconnected to invoke controls: Ottawa might be able to curb wages - but it could do little about the price of imports.\n\nAccording to Turner, Trudeau was far more optimistic about the possibility that controls might succeed. Shortly after the Liberals' July, 1974, election victory, Trudeau began lobbying his finance minister to shift gears. Recalled Turner: \"Trudeau said, 'We are going to put in wage-and-price controls.' I said, 'Not with me around. I campaigned against them.' The unions trusted me. Business trusted me. No. We told people that we wouldn't do it. And we were going to reverse that in three or four months after the election?\"\n\nToday, Turner is still rueful about the private discussion with Trudeau that provoked his September, 1975, resignation. \"The real problem was the issue of wage-and-price controls,\" he told Maclean's on the understanding that the interview would not be published until after Trudeau's death. \"I should have been more explicit when I resigned as to why I resigned. But because of my loyalty to Mr. Trudeau, I went quietly.\"\n\nFor Trudeau, the economy usually took second place to causes, such as national unity, that were dearer to his heart. Ostry's push for freer trade was doomed: those domestic sectors that could not compete against cheaper imports - textiles, footwear and clothing - were largely located in Quebec. Why, in the final months of more than 15 years in power, would Trudeau disrupt the Quebec economy and risk a resurgence of separatist strength? \"He was highly intelligent and intellectual: he read all of his briefing documents, including the footnotes,\" reflected Ostry. \"He just wasn't interested in economics. He listened to everything and understood it. But, in the end, he had one priority: national unity.\"\n\nThe nation paid a steep price for Trudeau's distracted approach to its long-term economic health. It took much of the 1990s to eliminate the breathtaking deficits that first appeared during his tenure. Federal cash transfers to the provinces were slashed - so programs in health, medical services and social assistance were pared to the bone. With public debt charges still consuming more than 25 cents out of every revenue dollar, Ottawa's spending power has been eroded. As a direct consequence, it has lost clout in provincial capitals. Ironically, the strong central government Trudeau fought so valiantly to maintain was undermined by his handling of the economy.\n\nIn 1968, when he swept triumphantly to power, the economy was vibrant - and the traditional economic remedies easily worked. Small shortfalls were the norm: 1968-1969 revenues were $12 billion and the deficit was $670 million. The economy was booming, generating the cash that Ottawa required to fund its ever-expanding social safety net. By 1984, the economic picture was far, far bleaker. The nation was painfully emerging from the worst downturn since the 1930s. Ottawa's annual shortfall was more than half the size of its revenues: in 1983-1984, the deficit was a staggering $33 billion on revenues of $64 billion. Inflation was relatively high, 5.3 per cent in January, 1984, and unemployment soaring at 11.2 per cent. The nation was reeling.\n\nIt was not all Trudeau's fault. It was his ill luck that, during most of his tenure, the global economy was in upheaval. By the early 1970s, the first traces of globalization were apparent: the economies of individual nations were becoming so interwoven that governments could not insulate their citizenry from outside forces. In 1973 and 1979, world oil prices shot up, fuelling inflation and imposing crippling costs on oil-dependent industries and consumers.\n\nWorse, as Trudeau eventually discovered, in this grave new world the old economic remedies didn't work. In the 1950s and 1960s, governments could spend freely when times were tough to curb unemployment - and pare spending when times were good to control inflation. By the mid-1970s, however, Canada was struggling with the new phenomenon of stagflation: high inflation and high unemployment. Economists and politicians groped for solutions. Turner recalled that Trudeau was so desperate for answers that he could be captivated by any persuasive theorist, including the Canadian-born Harvard University economist John Kenneth Galbraith. \"Galbraith used to sneak into 24 Sussex,\" Turner said. \"I would hear about it - and I would tell Galbraith, 'Look, don't feed him this crap.' Galbraith was pretty left of centre. We would hear these theories the next week.\" Turner paused, contemplating Trudeau's record. \"The economy,\" he added sadly, \"was not his main thing.\"\n\nEventually, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that nations should tackle inflation first. Trudeau rejected that approach: he was unwilling to curb inflation by slashing spending as long as unemployment remained high. He did not want to risk further national distress, especially in Quebec. And he was reluctant to pay the price of unpopularity at the polls.\n\nInstead, he kept looking for a made-in-Canada solution. From 1975 to 1984, in his bid to \"wrestle inflation to the ground,\" he tried everything from wage-and-price controls to gimmicks such as the Six & Five campaign of 1982-1984, which created ceilings of six per cent and then five per cent for wage and price rises. Inflation ebbed, but it was only licked in the early 1990s - after industrialized nations, in a concerted attack, curbed their spending and raised interest rates. The price of that onslaught was a deep recession. \"How can you be an inflation fighter and be in favour of social justice?\" mused Trudeau's former principal secretary Tom Axworthy. \"We tried a billion different ways to deal with inflation without necessarily putting millions of people out of work. In the end, there had to be a recession to get out of it. It's really too bad that there isn't another way.\"\n\nWithout firm economic leadership, the crises were endless. Trudeau would occasionally fix his enormous powers of concentration on a problem - and opt for a course. But he rarely followed through. In 1978, after a stern lecture from German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Trudeau abruptly announced immediate spending cuts of $2 billion out of program spending of $43 billion. There was a flurry of paperwork. But program spending kept increasing - and the deficits kept accumulating.\n\nIronically, Trudeau had a frugal personality. \"He would say, 'Where are you going to find the money for that?' \" recalled former cabinet minister David Smith. \"In many ways, he was very conservative.\" But that fiscal rectitude could never withstand other priorities. In 1972, anxious to shore up support for his minority government with the New Democratic Party, he increased spending by 50 per cent over two years: from $18.8 billion to $28.2 billion.\n\nWorse, Trudeau never could accept the central fact of today's economic life: Canada is unable to isolate itself from world forces. He probably should not have tried to protect inefficient industries. He should have worked with global leaders to find a solution to inflation. \"It's easy to say in retrospect,\" says Axworthy, \"but it would have been better to spend a lot more time using organizations such as the Group of Seven rather than looking for a domestic solution, which got less relevant with each succeeding year. We were on the wrong side of history.\"\n\nIn the end, it was the economy that wrestled Pierre Trudeau to the ground. But he bequeathed the solutions to his successors. In 1982, exasperated by problems within the economic union, he appointed a royal commission chaired by former Liberal finance minister Donald Macdonald. That influential report, released in 1985, called for free trade with the United States, greater reliance on market mechanisms - and rapid adjustment to global change.\n\nSo, almost inadvertently, Trudeau did begin the search for a better way. \"In effect, when Trudeau appointed me, he launched a new way of thinking about the Canadian economy,\" Macdonald recalled years later. \"True, that way was despite his instincts. But we had to get out into the world.\" Ironically, Pierre Trudeau's finest economic legacy was to begin the dismantlement of his own policies.\n\nMaclean's October 9, 2000"}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Laurier_L%C3%A9vesque", "page_content": "Canadian politician\n\nLaurier L\u00e9vesque (October 13, 1929 \u2013 September 7, 2005) was a Canadian educator and a politician in the Province of New Brunswick.\n\nA graduate of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook and the New Brunswick Teachers' College in Fredericton, Laurier L\u00e9vesque taught school before entering political life.

Six decades later, constitutional reform became one of several major Liberal initiatives. It was also the federal government\u2019s immediate response to the ongoing Quebec referendum campaign.\n\nTwo key factors predated the patriation battle of 1980\u201381. First, the failings of a half-century of diplomacy between the federal and provincial governments made negotiations between them tense and difficult. (See also Federal-Provincial Relations.) Second, the unexpected victory by Pierre Trudeau and the Liberal Party in the federal election of February 1980 ensured that a committed federalist would be leading the charge on patriating the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nIn the campaign leading up to the Quebec referendum on 20 May 1980, Trudeau\u2019s Justice Minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, lobbied against the wishes of Quebec separatists. He made campaign stops in small towns across the province. Meanwhile, Trudeau gave four major speeches, promising Quebecers that, \u201cWe will immediately take action to renew the Constitution and we will not stop until we have done that.\u201d His statements were vague enough to defy definition, yet inspiring enough to help swing the tide in favour of federalism.\n\nAfter conceding defeat in the referendum, Quebec Premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque immediately demanded that Trudeau fulfil his constitutional promise. Trudeau quickly dispatched Chr\u00e9tien to arrange a meeting with all the premiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharter of Rights\n\nAt this point, it was unclear how much provincial support Trudeau needed to patriate and amend the Constitution. Legally, any change required the approval of the British Parliament. By political custom and convention, however, the more the provincial governments supported the federal patriation process, the better.\n\nTrudeau assembled a group of constitutional advisers. He also drafted a set of federal demands for new, centralized powers over the economy. He wanted what he called a \u201cpeople\u2019s package\u201d added to the Constitution; it would include a new Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Trudeau also called on the premiers not to use the constitutional talks to bargain for new provincial powers; he said the talks and the Charter itself were not matters for tawdry political trade-offs.\n\nThe premiers, however, wanted to preserve or even expand provincial powers. (See Distribution of Powers.) They responded angrily to Trudeau\u2019s tactics. Still, they agreed to set in motion a uniquely Canadian event \u2014 a summer constitutional roadshow. A series of meetings were held across Canada between Cabinet ministers, senior officials and political aides. They explored the 12 agreed-upon agenda items. A formal First Ministers\u2019 conference was then held in early September.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Ultimatum\n\nThe First Ministers conference began on 8 September 1980. It was the 10th round of negotiations on the reform of Canada\u2019s Constitution since 1927. By the time it started, the battle lines had already begun to harden. On the eve of the conference, L\u00e9vesque quietly gave the premiers a leaked copy of Ottawa\u2019s 64-page, top-secret negotiating strategy. It was known as the Kirby Memorandum, after its chief compiler, Michael Kirby, secretary to the Cabinet for federal-provincial relations. The document was leaked to the press on the second day of the conference. This further soured an already bitter mood of distrust.\n\nDuring four days under hot television lights, the premiers and the prime minister expressed (at times impressively) widely different visions of Canada. These were also discussed in private meetings. However, their intractable views led to the inevitable failure of the conference. On 2 October, following consultations with his caucus and Cabinet, Trudeau announced, to little surprise, that Ottawa would make a unilateral request to the British Parliament. Trudeau would recall Parliament early and press the resolution through by Christmas before significant opposition could be mounted.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, under leader Ed Broadbent, gave tentative approval to the plan, though it split his caucus essentially along east-west lines. The federal Conservatives, under leader Joe Clark, strongly opposed the plan. They used every procedural device at their disposal to halt the resolution; it finally went before the Supreme Court in late spring 1981. When the Liberals invoked \u201cclosure\u201d on the resolution to move it into the committee stage in Parliament, a handful of Tories rushed the Speaker\u2019s chair with fists waving, demanding to be heard.\n\nThe constitution fight offered Clark an explosive issue around which to rally his flagging leadership. It also gave him the chance to advance his view of the country as a \u201ccommunity of communities.\u201d But his position underscored a rift between the federal Tories and their influential Ontario cousins. Ontario Premier Bill Davis and New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield, both Conservatives, backed the prime minister\u2019s plan.\n\nPrime Minister Pierre Trudeau speaks for the federalist side, during the campaign for the 1980 Quebec Referendum on sovereignty.\n\nGang of Eight\n\nThe constitutional resolution, with the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms as its centerpiece, was offered to a special joint parliamentary committee for study. It was harshly criticized. The first parliamentary committee to have its sittings televised, it was petitioned by 914 individuals and 294 groups. It sat for more than 65 days. Largely because of its deliberations, the first Charter was significantly redrafted five times. The revisions included adding provisions on Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights; sexual equality; and equal rights for the disabled. The Conservative Party called for the addition of property rights. The Liberals rejected this proposal because of the opposition to it by their allies, the NDP.\n\nThe six provinces most strongly opposed to the plan \u2014 Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and British Columbia \u2014 united to form a common front. The group was led by the strong-willed premiers of Quebec (Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque), Alberta (Peter Lougheed) and Manitoba (Sterling Lyon). The group eventually was joined by Saskatchewan (Allan Blakeney) and Nova Scotia (John Buchanan). This Gang of Eight mounted challenges against the resolution in provincial courts of appeal in Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland. They also launched a public-relations campaign against it both in Canada and in Great Britain, where they strenuously lobbied Members of Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Courts Weigh In\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriation Reference case was weaving its way through the Supreme Court. In February 1981, the Manitoba Court of Appeal decided 3\u20132 in favour of Ottawa. In April, the Quebec Superior Court of Appeal also supported Ottawa in a 4\u20131 decision. Both courts decided that the federal government had the legal right to patriate and amend the Constitution, without provincial consent.\n\nHowever, just weeks earlier, the three justices of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland had voted unanimously against the federal procedure. The Newfoundland judgement was handed down as the House of Commons was tied in procedural knots by the Conservative opposition. At the same time, the Gang of Eight were preparing for their own conference to sign an alternative constitutional accord. Promoted largely by Lougheed, it would limit the request to Britain to simple patriation with a different amending formula.\n\nTrudeau suddenly agreed to submit his resolution to the Supreme Court for judicial settlement. But he would not meet the Gang of Eight when they arrived in Ottawa on 16 April 1981. Trudeau ridiculed their \u201cApril Accord,\u201d in which Quebec\u2019s L\u00e9vesque had agreed to an amending formula that did not provide a specific veto for his province.\n\nSupreme Court Decision\n\nOn 28 September 1981, the Supreme Court brought down its judgement. (See Patriation Reference.) It found that Ottawa was legally allowed to make this request of the British Parliament. The justices decided that the resolution offended the constitutional conventions developed in Canada over the years, but that it was not legally enforceable to prevent Ottawa from acting unilaterally. The court held by a 7\u20132 majority that no legal limit \u201cto the power of the Houses [the House of Commons and the Senate] to pass resolutions\u201d existed.\n\nHowever, the court also ruled by a 6-3 majority that any proposed amendments that would reduce provincial powers would require a \u201cconsensus\u201d of the provinces. To do otherwise would be a breach of constitutional convention. Although such practice was a matter of convention rather than law, the court argued that such conventions are of great significance. In the words of the court, \u201cConstitutional convention plus constitutional law equal the total constitution of the country.\u201d\n\nThis split decision was interpreted as a messy win for both sides. It sparked a final round of hurried negotiations and what the prime minister came to call \u201cthe one last time\u201d conference. It began in Ottawa on 2 November 1981.\n\nThe statue Justicia in front of the Supreme Court of Canada building, overlooking the Peace Tower of Parliament in Ottawa.\n\nFour Dramatic Days\n\nOn the first day of the four-day conference, the federalist side appeared to take the initiative. Premiers Bill Davis (Ontario) and Richard Hatfield (New Brunswick) offered compromise proposals. Davis proposed foregoing Ontario\u2019s traditional veto over constitutional change. Hatfield proposed holding off on implementing parts of the Charter of Rights in New Brunswick for two years. After an opening round of public statements, the first ministers and their key lieutenants continued their discussions in a private room on the top floor of the conference centre. The rancour returned on the second day; the formal conference broke up at noon. It reconvened the following day.\n\nThe Gang of Eight were in their suite at the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier hotel, across the street from the conference center. They debated a vague compromise plan put together by British Columbia Premier Bill Bennett. The plan suggested waiting to adopt much of the Charter of Rights until it could be examined by a commission. The commission would report back with recommendations at a later date. Bennett, Lougheed and Buchanan took the scheme to Trudeau. He rejected it in an angry confrontation.\n\n\u201cThe proposal by the Gang of Eight would not fly,\u201d wrote Howard Leeson, an advisor to Saskatchewan Premier Allan Blakeney. \u201cIt was general discouragement at this point that anything would ever be agreed to.\u201d\n\nA glum mood settled over some of the provincial delegations. Premiers Davis and Blakeney and their officials ran into each other that night at an Ottawa restaurant; they continued private discussions through the evening. The two groups \u2014 Ontario allied with Trudeau; Saskatchewan allied with the Gang of Eight \u2014 at least agreed, wrote Leeson, \u201cthat we must find some way to prolong the talks in order that they might succeed, but there were very few ideas.\u201d\n\nOn the third day, Manitoba Premier Sterling Lyon left the conference for the campaign trail. L\u00e9vesque also talked of leaving to attend Quebec\u2019s National Assembly. That same day, Blakeney put forth his own proposal. It was discussed around the conference table but made no real progress. Meanwhile, an off-the-cuff remark by Trudeau that perhaps only a referendum could resolve the stalemate was well received by L\u00e9vesque. This surprised the other Gang of Eight premiers. Nearly all day was then devoted to discussing a possible referendum. Trudeau emerged in the afternoon to announce to the press somewhat facetiously that there was a new Quebec\u2013Ottawa alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Kitchen Accord\"\n\nIn the meantime, various ministers and advisors from the different provinces had been meeting privately to discuss other options. By the end of the third day, the broad lines of a possible compromise agreement were emerging. What followed was a complex series of manoeuvres. Several individuals played key roles at crucial points.\n\nThe first step was a private meeting between three attorneys general \u2014 federal Justice Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Saskatchewan\u2019s Roy Romanow and Ontario\u2019s Roy McMurtry. They had traded notes earlier that morning. In the mid-afternoon, Chr\u00e9tien and Romanow slipped away to an unused kitchen pantry in the Ottawa conference center to examine some ideas. They pulled McMurtry into the room partway through the discussion. The resulting \u201ckitchen accord,\u201d as it became known, was not recorded in a formal written agreement; it was scratched by the men in rough notes on two pieces of paper.\n\nMost of the other provinces did not know about it. The accord was significant in that it shaped the expectations of the governments of Canada, Ontario and Saskatchewan. It also helped bridge the divide between the Gang of Eight and the federal government. Chr\u00e9tien, the principal federal negotiator, committed to a compromise that included a \u201cnotwithstanding clause.\u201d This would limit the force of a new Charter of Rights by allowing provinces to exempt their laws from certain Charter rights. This became a crucial element in winning enough provincial consent to forge a deal.\n\nBlakeney learned about the accord from his attorney general, Roy Romanow, on Wednesday. When the formal conference adjourned that day, Blakeney invited his Gang of Eight colleagues to meet privately later that night to discuss the matter and flesh out a more complete package. At the same time, Ontario Premier Bill Davis offered to discuss aspects of the accord, as well as various other points, with Trudeau.\n\nPage 1 of the \"Kitchen Accord,\" drafted in the kitchen of the National Conference Centre in Ottawa on 4 November 1981 by Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Roy Romanow and Roy McMurtry.\n\nPage 2 of the \"Kitchen Accord,\" drafted in the kitchen of the National Conference Centre in Ottawa on 4 November 1981 by Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Roy Romanow and Roy McMurtry.\n\nThe \u201cNight of the Long Knives\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford and his officials had prepared a draft proposal. It contained some of the ideas already floated at the conference. (See Editorial: Newfoundland\u2019s Contribution to the Patriation of the Constitution.) That night, 4 November, officials from six provinces (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, PEI, Saskatchewan, Alberta and BC, including at times some of the premiers themselves) worked in Saskatchewan\u2019s hotel suite to refine a proposal based on the Peckford document. Items from the kitchen accord were added to make the proposal acceptable to Ontario and Ottawa. Ontario and the federal government were at this point unaware of the Newfoundland draft. At the same time, many members of the Gang of Eight did not yet know about the kitchen accord or the origins of its compromises. Despite that, vital clauses from each were melded into a single proposal.\n\nProvincial delegations that weren\u2019t represented at the meeting, including Manitoba and Ontario, were notified about the draft late that night. Ontario Premier Bill Davis was even pulled from his bed after midnight by Blakeney, who called Davis to get his support for the package.\n\nL\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nCrucially, the Quebec delegation, staying at a hotel across the Ottawa River in Quebec, was not notified during the night. It\u2019s unclear whether an attempt was made to reach L\u00e9vesque or his advisors by phone. Peckford says attempts were made, but that calls were not answered. Others say no attempt was made. \u201cThe general conclusion,\u201d according to Howard Leeson\u2019s notes, \u201cwas that Quebec could never agree with anything, and specifically would not agree to this package\u2026 Nevertheless, it was agreed that the proposal must be put to Quebec at the already scheduled 8 a.m. meeting of the Gang of Eight.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe failure to reach L\u00e9vesque that night \u2014 and instead, to present him with the completed package at a breakfast meeting on the final day of the conference \u2014 prompted L\u00e9vesque to claim that he was betrayed by the English-speaking premiers. L\u00e9vesque said they plotted against him on what became known in Quebec nationalist circles as the \u201cnight of the long knives.\u201d That portrayal would be used to fuel separatist sentiment in Quebec for years to come.\n\nPeckford presented the draft agreement to the Gang of Eight premiers at breakfast, and later to the prime minister and the other premiers at the formal conference table. After some minor adjustments, the federal government, Ontario and New Brunswick signed on, and the deed was done. L\u00e9vesque complained bitterly. He was ultimately the only premier who did not sign the deal. He tried in vain to press Trudeau to embrace the earlier referendum option.\n\nConstitution Act, 1982\n\nBy 5 November 1981, the constitutional fight was essentially over. In the next few weeks, Indigenous peoples and women\u2019s groups lobbied successfully to reinstate certain clauses that had been dropped in the late-night compromise. The resolution was sent to England for relatively quick approval through the British Parliament. Queen Elizabeth II came to Canada to proclaim the new Constitution Act at a rainy ceremony on Parliament Hill on 17 April 1982.\n\nEarlier, L\u00e9vesque had left the conference in Ottawa predicting dire consequences for Confederation. \u201c\u2019The Canadian Way,\u2019\u201d he said, mocking the phrase his fellow premiers had used to trumpet their compromise, was \u201cto abandon Quebec at the moment of crisis.\u201d\n\nIt was another five years before an agreement was reached to bring Quebec into the constitutional accord. By then the players had changed \u2014 including Quebec\u2019s premier, now Robert Bourassa and Canada\u2019s prime minister, now Brian Mulroney. However, their deal to put a Quebec premier\u2019s signature on the Constitution ultimately failed.

He was knighted in 1897.\n\nEarly life and education Laurier was born of French Canadian parents and studied at the college at l\u2019Assomption, where he received literary training under Catholic priests. He then studied law at McGill University in Montreal and was called to the bar in 1864. His bicultural education, most unusual at the time, may have played a part in his lifelong dedication to Canadian unity. While at McGill, he became a leading member of the Institut Canadien, a political club of advanced liberals (Les Rouges) with anticlerical and republican views. Later he joined the law offices of one of the leading Rouge politicians and contributed a number of articles to radical newspapers, one of which he edited for a few months in the mid-1860s. In 1866, for reasons of health, Laurier moved to Athabaska, where he opened his own law practice. In 1868 he married Zo\u00eb Lafontaine of Montreal, and, despite a long relationship with Emilie Lavergne, his law partner\u2019s wife, his childless marriage seems to have been a happy one. In 1871 he was elected to the opposition benches of the provincial legislature of Quebec, where his first speech, an eloquent plea for educational reform, attracted much attention. In 1874 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, of which he was to be a member until his death.\n\nRise to leadership As Laurier gradually rose to become minister of internal revenue (1877\u201378) and eventually to leadership of the opposition Liberal Party in 1887, he persistently sought to bring together his countrymen on the issues that have since been recognized as the dominant themes of modern Canadian politics: the relations of church and state, the bicultural entente between French- and English-speaking Canadians, and the country\u2019s association with the British Empire and relations with the United States. One of the political highlights of these years for Laurier was his famous speech on Liberalism delivered in 1877 in the city of Quebec. In that speech he set himself against both the Quebec politicians who attempted to form a Catholic party and the extremist elements in his own group who sought to exclude the clergy from all political activity. Because of his skillful statesmanship, the cold antagonism between conservative churchmen and liberal politicians gradually began to thaw; after 1896 no anticlerical ever attained important public office and no cleric officially interfered in politics. In 1885 Laurier became a national figure when he delivered a moving plea of clemency for Louis Riel, who had led a rebellion of the M\u00e9tis (people of mixed French and Indian extraction) in Manitoba and whose death sentence provoked violent outbursts between the French Catholic nationalists in Quebec and the Britannic groups in Ontario. Showing great courage, Laurier, though not condoning Riel\u2019s actions, charged the government with mishandling the rebellion. Although he did not succeed in saving Riel, he established his reputation as a man of principle and high ideals. Throughout his political life, he emphasized moderation and compromise and gradually became recognized as the only leader able to effect a national reconciliation. At the same time, he was turning his personal magnetism into a valuable political weapon. Between 1887 and 1896 he perfected his party\u2019s organization, refined Liberal strategy, made political alliances, assessed local partisans, and judiciously applied his personal charm to winning over Conservative adversaries and dissident Liberals. He infused new life into his party, for instance, by campaigning vigorously for unrestricted reciprocity, the grant of mutual commercial privileges, with the United States. After the policy had served its purpose, however, he dropped it from his platform in 1893. Between 1895 and 1896 he spoke at between 200 and 300 meetings, thus personally reaching some 200,000 voters. In mid-1896, with the Conservative government divided and disorganized, he easily carried the Liberal Party to victory in the general election.

PreviousNext\n\nFounding\n\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) was founded on 13 October 1968 through the merger of the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association (MSA), led by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, and the Ralliement national (RN), led by Gilles Gr\u00e9goire, a former Cr\u00e9ditiste Member of Parliament.\n\nThe MSA was founded in November 1967, following a Quebec Liberal Party policy convention where Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque (then minister of Natural Resources in the Liberal provincial government of Jean Lesage) and other party members who were also Quebec nationalists tried to gain acceptance for a program entitled Pour un Qu\u00e9bec souverain dans une f\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne (\u201cFor a sovereign Quebec in a Canadian federation\u201d). Failing at this effort, they decided to quit the Liberal Party and form their own movement.\n\nIn 1968, the MSA negotiated a merger with the Ralliement national (RN). The RN, founded in March 1966, was itself the result of the merger of the provincial wing of the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste with the Regroupement national. The RN claimed to be inspired by Pierre B\u00e9dard\u2019s Parti canadien, Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine\u2019s Parti canadien-fran\u00e7ais, l\u2019Action lib\u00e9rale nationale and the Bloc populaire canadien. The RN received only 3.2 per cent of the votes in the Quebec general election of 5 June 1966. Gilles Gr\u00e9goire became its president on 21 August 1966.\n\nThe militant base of a third party, the Rassemblement pour l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance nationale (RIN), also contributed to the founding of the PQ. The RIN had begun as a citizen movement in 1960, and in 1963 it became the first pro-independence political party in Quebec\u2019s history. Pierre Bourgault became its leader in May 1964, and it took 5.6 per cent of the votes in the provincial election of 1966. But Bourgault did not endorse the idea of sovereignty-association promoted by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque \u2014 for the RIN, unilaterally declared independence (see Separatism) was the only acceptable option. Hence the negotiations between the RIN and L\u00e9vesque\u2019s MSA failed. The RIN did not merge with the MSA and the RN, but instead was dissolved in 1968, and its supporters were invited to join the PQ.\n\nThis new pro-independence party thus became the rallying point for almost all Quebec nationalist movements and associations. It established a national executive council, developed its infrastructure, and built a rapidly growing network of party members. Other major Quebec nationalist organizations that supported the PQ included the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste and the Mouvement national des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nFirst election victory\n\nIn the first two elections in which it participated, the PQ achieved very limited success. In 1970, it won 23.5 per cent of the popular vote, but only seven seats in the National Assembly. The first seven PQ members of the National Assembly and the ridings that they represented were as follows: Camille Laurin (Bourget), Guy Joron (Gouin), Marcel L\u00e9ger (Lafontaine), Robert Burns (Maisonneuve), Lucien Lessard (Saguenay), Charles-Henri Tremblay (Mercier et Sainte-Marie), and Claude Charron (Saint-Jacques).\n\nIn Quebec\u2019s 1973 provincial general election, the results were even more disappointing for the PQ: only six PQ candidates were elected, even though the party took 30.2 per cent of the popular vote, while the Liberals, led by Robert Bourassa, took 102 seats out of 110. But in 1976, the PQ finally emerged victorious, trouncing the Liberals while capturing 41.4 per cent of the vote and 71 seats. The PQ victory was attributable largely to an electoral strategy nimbly executed by Claude Morin, in which the party promised to hold a referendum on sovereignty-association during its first term in office.\n\nThe PQ passed many important pieces of legislation during this first term. Bill 101, the Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise (Charter of the French Language), made French the sole official language of Quebec (see Quebec Language Policy). The Act Respecting the Preservation of Agricultural Land and Agricultural Activities was passed in 1978, and the complementary Act Respecting Land use Planning and Development was passed in 1979. In 1978, the Automobile Insurance Act was passed, creating a government-managed system of no-fault compensation and property damage insurance for automobile owners. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government also passed Bill 89, establishing a new Civil Code and reforming family law (1980).\n\nReferendum of 1980\n\nThe referendum on sovereignty-association that the PQ had promised during the 1976 election campaign was held in May 1980 (see Quebec Referendum (1980)). After a televised debate on the subject in the National Assembly, numerous public meetings were held. The opponents of Quebec\u2019s negotiating sovereignty-association with the rest of Canada \u2014 the \u201cNo\u201d side \u2014 took 60 per cent of the votes, beating the \u201cYes\u201d side handily by a 20-point margin. Despite this failure, the PQ was returned to power in the 1981 elections, with 80 seats and 49.2 per cent of the votes.\n\nIn a consultative referendum of PQ members, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque won support for the party to set the question of sovereignty-association aside temporarily, but lost the support of a group of dissidents who refused to accept this result. In November 1984, the PQ government was shaken by the resignation of a group of pro-independence ministers including Jacques Parizeau. Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque resigned the leadership of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in June 1985 and was replaced as PQ leader and Premier of Quebec by Pierre-Marc Johnson in October 1985.\n\nIn the December 1985 elections, the PQ experienced a shattering defeat at the hands of Bourassa\u2019s resurgent Liberals, receiving only 38.7 per cent of the vote and retaining only 23 seats in the National Assembly. In November 1987, one week after the death of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, Pierre-Marc Johnson resigned as PQ leader. Jacques Parizeau, a stauncher champion of independence, was the main contender to replace him and became party leader on 19 March 1988.\n\nYears in Official Opposition\n\nBoth in government and as Official Opposition from 1985 to 1994, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois took an ambiguous posture, attacking the federal system from which it hoped to separate, while also trying to take advantage of it as much as possible. The party\u2019s position during the Fall 1981 federal-provincial constitutional negotiations on the patriation of the Constitution was a good example. Quebec joined seven other provinces in opposing the Pierre Elliott Trudeau government\u2019s plan to patriate the Constitution first and reach a new agreement about it with them second. But the other dissident provinces ended up accepting a new constitutional agreement, leaving Quebec isolated. Even after Robert Bourassa\u2019s Liberals were returned to power in Quebec\u2019s 1985 elections, the province refused to ratify the constitutional agreement unless it received new concessions.\n\nIn the Quebec general election of 1989, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois proposed to hold a series of \u201csectoral referendums\u201d on individual constitutional jurisdictions such as language if it took power, but lost to Bourassa\u2019s Liberals again, carrying only 29 seats and receiving 40 per cent of the vote. Polls showed support for the sovereignist option rising once more, however, in the wake of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord on 22 June 1990. Jacques Parizeau\u2019s troops played a leading role in organizing the \u201cNo\u201d camp for the October 1992 referendum on a proposed new constitutional agreement, the Charlottetown Accord, which a large majority of Quebecers rejected. In the Quebec general election of September 1994, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was returned to power with 44.7 per cent of the votes and 77 seats in the National Assembly \u2014 a strong majority.\n\nThe 1995 Referendum and the Bouchard years\n\nOn 12 June 1995, three political parties \u2014 Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec (ADQ), the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (a new sovereignist party on the federal scene, serving as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons) \u2014 signed an agreement by which they formed the \u201cYes\u201d Committee and collaborated on formulating the question for a new referendum on Quebec sovereignty (see Quebec Referendum (1995)). This referendum was held on 30 October 1995. With a voter-participation rate of 93.5 per cent, the Yes camp was defeated by a hair-thin margin, receiving 49.42 per cent of the vote to the No side\u2019s 50.58 per cent. Jacques Parizeau resigned as PQ leader the next day, and Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in Ottawa, became PQ leader and Quebec premier of on 29 January 1996.\n\nBelieving that any new referendum held too soon after this last one would be doomed to failure, Bouchard focused on building Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s economy and eliminating the province\u2019s budget deficit by imposing massive cutbacks on health and social spending. On the whole, the PQ\u2019s fiscal policies did help to right the Qu\u00e9bec economy, and the party was re-elected in 1998 with 76 out of the 125 seats in the National Assembly. Bouchard remained premier for three more years but, disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm for the sovereignist cause during his term in office, he resigned in 2001.\n\nQu\u00e9bec finance minister Bernard Landry succeeded Bouchard as PQ party leader and premier of Qu\u00e9bec on 8 March 2001. In 2002, surveys showed a major decline in the PQ\u2019s popularity, to the benefit of the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Charest, and the ADQ, led by Mario Dumont. The passage of additional progressive legislation, such as the Act to Combat Poverty and Social Exclusion (2002), helped the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to climb back in the polls somewhat, but not enough, and the party was defeated by the Liberals in the general election of 14 April 2003.\n\nInternal strife\n\nIn the wake of this political reversal, some PQ members questioned Bernard Landry\u2019s leadership, and at the party convention in June 2005, he announced his intention to resign if he did not receive the support of at least 80 per cent of the delegates in the leadership vote to be held there. He received only 76.2 per cent of the votes, made good on his word, and bowed out. On 6 June 2005, Louise Harel became acting leader of the PQ.\n\nOn 15 November 2005, Andr\u00e9 Boisclair, a former minister in the Bouchard and Landry cabinets, became the sixth leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, edging out Pauline Marois and Richard Legendre. Boisclair pushed the party\u2019s position on Qu\u00e9bec independence further by denouncing Bill C-20 (the federal Clarity Act on referendums for Qu\u00e9bec secession). Boisclair asserted that sovereignty was a political issue, not a legal one, and stated that in the next Qu\u00e9bec election, he would seek a mandate to hold a referendum on sovereignty. In August 2006, when Boisclair won a by-election in the riding of Pointe-aux-Trembles and took his seat in the National Assembly, surveys showed the PQ ahead of the Liberals. But the following months proved hard on the party, which lost ground in the polls, especially to the ADQ.\n\nThe general election of 26 March 2007 confirmed this rise in the fortunes of the ADQ, which had been founded in 1994 on a moderate conservative platform and had, over the years, gained favour with a growing number of Quebecers who did not want another referendum. Thus, in the 2007 general election, while the PQ took only 36 seats, the ADQ took 41. For the first time in 30 years, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois formed neither the government nor the Official Opposition in the National Assembly. Two months later, Andr\u00e9 Boisclair announced his resignation as party leader.\n\nOn 27 June 2007, Pauline Marois was elected PQ party leader by acclamation, thus becoming the first woman to hold this position. Under her leadership, the PQ supported the Bouchard\u2013Taylor Commission hearings on reasonable accommodation and tabled two private members\u2019 bills of note: Bill 195, the Qu\u00e9bec Identity Act, which would have established Quebec citizenship; and Bill 196, the Qu\u00e9bec Constitution, which would have established a Quebec constitution. Neither of these bills was ever passed by the National Assembly, because they were unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the December 2008 general election, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois returned to the National Assembly as the Official Opposition, winning 51 seats while the Liberals took 66, thus securing only a weak majority.\n\nIn June 2011, five PQ members of the National Assembly, including Louise Beaudoin, Pierre Curzi, and Lisette Lapointe (the wife of Jacques Parizeau) decided to quit the PQ caucus and sit as independents. They did so in protest against Bill 204, a private member\u2019s bill tabled by Agn\u00e8s Maltais, a PQ MNA from Quebec City, which was designed to provide protection against lawsuits for the agreement between Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cor Inc. and Quebec City on the management of the city\u2019s new multi-functional amphitheatre, the Colis\u00e9e (see also Qu\u00e9bec Nordiques). In the following months, several PQ MNAs called Marois\u2019s leadership into question. One of them, Jean-Martin Aussant, called for her resignation and even went so far as to create a new sovereignist party, Option Nationale, in September 2011. (Since 2006, the sovereignist vote had already been divided by the emergence of another sovereignist party, Qu\u00e9bec solidaire.)\n\nBrief return to power\n\nOn 4 September 2012, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won the provincial election, defeating the Liberal government of Jean Charest, which had been in power for nine years. The PQ was called on to form a minority government, and Pauline Marois became the first female premier in the history of Quebec.\n\nDuring her first year in power, Marois enjoyed growing popularity, in particular because of the leadership she showed after the tragic trainwreck that claimed 47 lives in Lac-M\u00e9gantic on 6 July 2013. But her government stirred up controversy throughout Canada when it announced plans to adopt a Quebec Values Charter. Tabled in November 2013, this charter (Bill 60) affirmed the values of State secularism and religious neutrality; one of its provisions would have banned the wearing of religious symbols by government employees, including staff of daycare centres and hospitals.\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest against Quebec's proposed Values Charter in Montreal on Saturday Sept. 14, 2013 Supporters of a proposed Quebec Values Charter march in Montreal, Sunday, September 22, 2013 PreviousNext\n\nBelieving that she now had the chance to secure a majority mandate, Marois called a general election on 5 March 2014, only 18 months after the election that had brought her to power with a minority. But she lost her bet: on 7 April 2014, the Liberal Party, under its new leader, Philippe Couillard, won 70 out of 125 seats, leaving its main opponents trailing far behind. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won only 30 seats (24 fewer than in the preceding election) and was invited to form the Official Opposition. The Qu\u00e9bec solidaire party, led by Fran\u00e7oise David, took three seats, while the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (led by former PQ minister Fran\u00e7ois Legault and participating in its second election since its founding in 2011) won 22. As a result of the defeat, Marois resigned as PQ leader and left politics.\n\nIn May 2015, Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau became the eighth leader in the history of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. However, on 2 May 2016 \u2014 less than a year after being named head of the PQ \u2014 P\u00e9ladeau announced his resignation as party leader, leader of the official opposition and member of the National Assembly (MNA), citing family reasons. The party\u2019s caucus chose Sylvain Gaudreault to serve as interim leader. A new leadership lace was launched which Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e won. In October 2016, he became the ninth leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and leader of the official opposition.\n\nThe 2018 election reshaped Quebec\u2019s electoral landscape. Defeating the Liberal Party (31 seats) and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (10 seats), the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec formed government with 74 seats and 37.47 per cent of votes. This result shattered the two-party system which existed between the QLP and the PQ since the 1970s. The PQ was reduced to third place alongside Qu\u00e9bec solidaire who also won 10 seats. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e was himself defeated in his borough of Rosemont and resigned as leader. Pascal B\u00e9rub\u00e9 acted as interim leader until October 2020 when Paul St-Pierre Plamondon was elected leader.\n\nThe 2022 election was marked by the decisive victory of the CAQ, led by Fran\u00e7ois Legault. The CAQ won nearly 41 per cent of the vote and elected 90 members of the National Assembly out of 125. Despite an election campaign considered by many the best, the number of seats won by the PQ in the legislature was reduced to three. This is the worst result of the party since its foundation. With 14.6 per cent of the vote, the PQ finished in third place, but came fourth in terms of the number of seats taken in the National Assembly, behind the Liberal Party (21 seats) and Qu\u00e9bec solidaire (11 seats).\n\nSocial and political heritage\n\nIn the course of its history, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been elected five times as Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s governing party, for a total of nearly 20 years in power: from November 1976 to December 1985, from September 1994 to April 2003, and from September 2012 to April 2014. Under its stewardship, Qu\u00e9bec has acquired some important tools for promoting economic development and social equity.\n\nWorth mentioning among the PQ\u2019s many achievements are the adoption of the Charter of the French Language (1977), the prohibition against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the Qu\u00e9bec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (1978), the passage of the Act Respecting the Preservation of Agricultural Land and Agricultural Activities (1978), the creation of a Qu\u00e9bec environment ministry (1979) and labour standards commission (1980), the addition of pregnancy as one of the grounds of discrimination recognized by the Qu\u00e9bec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (1982), the adoption of the Pay Equity Act (1996) and the Act Respecting the Elimination of the Deficit and a Balanced Budget (1996), the creation of early-childhood centres (1997), the introduction of the Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Public Prescription Drug Insurance Plan (1997) and the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan (2001), the signing of an agreement with the Cree Nation of Qu\u00e9bec (the \u201cPaix des Braves,\u201d 2002), and the closing of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant (2012)."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rene-levesque", "page_content": "\\u00a9 Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hudon.

L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, premier of Qu\u00e9bec 1976-85, politician, journalist, nationalist (born 24 Aug 1922 in Campbellton, NB; died 1 November 1987 in Montr\u00e9al, QC). A prominent member of Jean Lesage's Liberal Cabinet during the Quiet Revolution, L\u00e9vesque later founded the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ), eventually bringing it to power in 1976. The PQ's main objective was Qu\u00e9bec independence, and for 15 years L\u00e9vesque was the leading champion of that ideal \u2014 holding and losing the province's first referendum on sovereignty in 1980.\n\nGasp\u00e9 Childhood\n\nL\u00e9vesque grew up in the remote, coastal town of New Carlisle, among the fishermen and farmers of the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula. Because there was no hospital there in 1922, he was born in nearby Campbellton, New Brunswick, the eldest child of Dominique L\u00e9vesque, a prominent lawyer, and Diane Dionne. Although the L\u00e9vesques were well-to-do, poverty was dire in the Gasp\u00e9 at that time. Ren\u00e9 became aware at a young age that most of the French Canadians were poorer, with smaller homes and more wretched schools, than the English Canadian families \u2014 descendants of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution \u2014 who were the self-appointed elites of the region.\n\nA bright student who impressed his Jesuit teachers, L\u00e9vesque resolved early on at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 that he was destined to be a leader. He idolized his father, who introduced him to politics, and to French and English literature \u2014 giving the boy a bilingual upbringing. When L\u00e9vesque was 14, however, his father died in hospital at the age of 48. His mother quickly remarried, the family relocated to Qu\u00e9bec City, and L\u00e9vesque drifted away from both his family and his studies.\n\nExpelled from the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier for low marks, he finished his formal schooling at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec and enrolled in the law school at Universit\u00e9 Laval, but gave up on his studies before obtaining a degree.\n\nJournalism\n\nL\u00e9vesque had discovered radio journalism in 1938, his last summer in New Carlisle. In Qu\u00e9bec City he worked at CBV, a regional Radio-Canada station. When the Second World War broke out, he was keen to get into the action, not as a soldier but as a war correspondent. Radio-Canada refused to send him, so in 1944 L\u00e9vesque found a position in London with the French section of the United States government service, Voice of America \u2014 thereby avoiding conscription by the Canadian military. He didn't get to the front lines until February 1945, joining the American armies as they crossed the Rhine and swept through the devastated remains of Germany. He was among the first US correspondents to see the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp following its liberation.\n\nThe war instilled in L\u00e9vesque a fondness for Americans (versus English Canadians), and a deep awareness of the barbarism that can flow from the extremes of nationalism. It wasn't enough to erase his own nationalist impulses, but it did temper them; he was committed throughout his life to democracy.\n\nAfter the war L\u00e9vesque returned to Radio-Canada, becoming an announcer for La voix du Canada, a news program broadcast out of Montr\u00e9al to French-speaking countries around the world. He quickly established himself as an engaging and widely-followed foreign newsman, reporting from the Korean War in 1951 and the Soviet Union in 1955. From 1956 he hosted the television series \"Point de mire\" (Focal Point) and became one of Qu\u00e9bec's most influential TV commentators. Short, balding and chain-smoking, L\u00e9vesque lacked the good looks for this emerging visual medium, but his intelligence and wit, and his ability to explain world events to a domestic audience, enabled him to become one of Qu\u00e9bec's first TV stars.\n\nIn 1947, L\u00e9vesque married Louise L'Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e from before the war, with whom he wouldhave two sons and a daughter. Surrounded by admirers in the broadcasting world, L\u00e9vesque wasn't a faithful husband, and the couple would divorce in 1978.\n\nIn 1959, L\u00e9vesque became actively involved in a strike by Radio-Canada producers, who wanted to form a union. He was dismayed by the indifference of the Diefenbaker government in Ottawa, and of his English CBC colleagues, towards the strikers' goals, which only hardened his views towards English Canada and fuelled his political aspirations. He decided journalism wasn't enough \u2014 it was time to stop covering the world, and start changing it instead.\n\nLesage Cabinet\n\nL\u00e9vesque joined Jean Lesage's Liberals in the provincial election of 1960, becoming a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Montr\u00e9al and helping to defeat the old Union nationale government. It was the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, and L\u00e9vesque became one Lesage's most popular and energetic Cabinet ministers \u2014 helping to modernize Qu\u00e9bec, to encourage its French-speaking majority to become \"masters in our own house,\" and to help ease the province away from the oppressive influence of the Roman Catholic clergy.\n\nAfter a brief stint as minister of water resources and public works, in which he fought corruption in the civil service, L\u00e9vesque was appointed minister of natural resources in 1961. He became point-man for the controversial but ultimately successful effort to nationalize the province's private electric utilities and fold them into what became the energy colossus of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. If Francophone Qu\u00e9becers didn't own or control big business interests in their province, L\u00e9vesque insisted, they would at least control its vast natural resources, via their government.\n\nParti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\n\nIn 1966, the Lesage government was defeated and L\u00e9vesque \u2014 increasingly nationalistic, and critical of his party's relations with the federal government \u2014 quit the Liberals the following year to found the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, which in October 1968 became the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The move was hardly surprising. Through the 1960s, even as a Liberal minister, L\u00e9vesque had made his views on independence increasingly clear, telling the Anglophone media in Canada that he wouldn't be upset if Qu\u00e9bec separated. At the 1967 Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party convention he had even tabled an incendiary resolution, largely unsupported by other delegates, titled \"A sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union.\" Meanwhile, he grew increasingly antagonistic with Pierre Trudeau, who entered federal politics in 1965 advocating a very different vision.\n\nHaving managed to unite the various groups promoting independence and a new political status for Qu\u00e9bec, L\u00e9vesque's party won 23 % of the vote in the 1970 provincial elections \u2014 although he himself failed to win a seat. Then the October Crisis erupted, and Trudeau, now prime minister, invoked the War Measures Act. L\u00e9vesque joined a coalition of prominent Qu\u00e9becers in condemning what they saw as Ottawa's anti-democratic response to the crisis. At the same time, L\u00e9vesque and his friends failed to unequivocally condemn the terror kidnappings of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) and the group's subsequent murder of Pierre Laporte. This allowed the PQ's critics to publicly equate the party with the FLQ, costing the PQ considerable support.\n\nIn the 1973 provincial election the Liberals won a landslide victory, and L\u00e9vesque once again failed to win himself a seat. The PQ, however, managed to become the official Opposition.\n\nPQ Comes to Power\n\nIn the next election, in 1976, L\u00e9vesque and his party faced off against the now-unpopular Liberal regime of Robert Bourassa, weary after years in power and beset by scandal and accusations of nepotism. L\u00e9vesque promised good government. He also downplayed the PQ's essential goal \u2014 sovereignty \u2014 while reassuring Qu\u00e9becers that a PQ government would commit to holding a referendum on the issue first, rather than declaring sovereignty unilaterally. The PQ won a majority of 71 seats, including one for L\u00e9vesque, who became the province's 23rd premier. He headed the first Qu\u00e9bec government committed to breaking up Confederation. The rest of Canada was stunned.\n\nDuring its first term, the new government passed several progressive measures concerning automobile insurance, rezoning of agricultural lands and the abolition of secret electoral funding. One of the most important and controversial pieces of legislation was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which formalized the status of French as the official language of Qu\u00e9bec. Proclaimed lawin 1977, Bill 101 excluded English from the provincial legislature and courts, and restricted access to English schools to anyone other than children whose parents had attended English schools in Qu\u00e9bec. French schooling became compulsory for English-speaking immigrants, even those from other Canadian provinces.\n\nAlthough strongly supported by the public and the PQ, the law triggered an exodus of more than 130,000 Anglophones from the province between 1976 and 1981 . As well, a number of Montr\u00e9al-based companies, including Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, relocated their head offices to Toronto. In the ensuing years, court rulings would strike down many of the law's measures as contrary to the Constitution, including the ban on English in the legislature and courts. Eventually, children whose parents had attended English schools elsewhere in Canada, were allowed into English schools in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n1980 Referendum\n\nIn the fall of 1979, as time was running out on his government's mandate, L\u00e9vesque finally introduced in the National Assembly a plan for sovereignty-association \u2014 a politically independent Qu\u00e9bec, still economically tied to Canada. A referendum on the question was scheduled for 20 May 1980, only months after the defeat of Joe Clark's Conservatives in Ottawa, and the return to power of L\u00e9vesque's nemesis Pierre Trudeau.\n\nAfter an emotional campaign led on the \"non\" side by Liberal Opposition leader Claude Ryan and federal Cabinet minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien (with key support from Trudeau), and on the \"oui\" side by L\u00e9vesque and his ministers, the sovereigntists won only 40 percent of the vote, failing to capture even a majority of the Francophone vote. It was the hardest defeat of L\u00e9vesque's career. If there was any consolation, L\u00e9vesque believed the vote had at least legitimized the right of Qu\u00e9becers to determine their own future regarding Confederation. Ottawa had recognized that fact through its active participation in the campaign.\n\nConstitution Battle\n\nAgainst all expectations, the PQ was re-elected in 1981, with L\u00e9vesque heading his second majority government. The party may have been helped at the polls by the emergence of new battle lines pitting L\u00e9vesque and other provincial premiers against Trudeau, who had announced his intention to repatriate the Constitution from Britain and to proceed unilaterally if the provinces opposed him.\n\nTrudeau had made the vague promise, during the 1980 referendum campaign, of \"renewing\" the Constitution. Now his government was proposing new, centralized federal powers over the economy, a constitutionally-entrenched Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and a new constitutional amending formula. After months of political debate and grandstanding among Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque and the other premiers, the First Ministers, as they were called, assembled in Ottawa in November, 1981, in a final bid to settle their differences.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was one of several powerful and strong-willed premiers (along with Alberta's Peter Lougheed) \u2014 together comprising eight provinces, or the Gang of Eight \u2014 who opposed Trudeau's plans and had fought them through the courts. But huddled together in Ottawa that November, the seven English-speaking premiers in the coalition were won-over by the promise of a \"notwithstanding clause\" in the new Charter \u2014 limiting its power over provincial authority. The compromise was not enough for L\u00e9vesque, who had also insisted on constitutional recognition of Qu\u00e9bec as a \"distinct society,\" and on a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec. He accused his fellow premiers of abandoning \"Qu\u00e9bec at the moment of crisis.\"\n\nWith the agreement of nine provinces, Trudeau pressed ahead. The repatriated Constitution was signed by Queen Elizabeth in the spring of 1982 \u2014 with the support of all the premiers except L\u00e9vesque, whose government represented the second-most populous province in the country. It was a detail that would bedevil the country and its First Ministers for years to come.\n\nFinal Years in Office\n\nL\u00e9vesque returned to the National Assembly to face the hard task of governing. Confronted with economic recession and spiralling provincial deficits, his government met with considerable opposition and public disapproval, including illegal public-sector union strikes, when it attempted to reduce spending to solve its grave financial problems.\n\nThere was also turmoil inside the PQ and growing doubts about L\u00e9vesque's leadership. In 1984, a party crisis erupted when L\u00e9vesque announced his intention of not fighting the next election on the issue of independence, while maintaining sovereignty-association as the party's official raison d'\u00eatre. Several important ministers resigned in protest, but the party reaffirmed L\u00e9vesque's leadership at a special convention in January 1985. Still, exhausted by years of struggle \u2014 and the defeat of his fondest political goals \u2014 L\u00e9vesque, at 62, fell into depression and was even hospitalized against his will. In June 1985 he resigned as premier.\n\nLegacy\n\nL\u00e9vesque enjoyed two years of retirement, before his heart gave out on 1 November, 1987. In that time he wrote his memoirs, which proved hugely popular. Upon his death, he was remembered across the country, by friends and foes alike, as a giant of Canadian politics.\n\nL\u00e9vesque's mark on Qu\u00e9bec, and Canada, is as indelible as any leader that province has produced: as a journalist he opened the minds of Francophone Qu\u00e9becers and awakened them to the wider world; he was a central figure of the Quiet Revolution; a creator of the energy powerhouse that became Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec; founder of the PQ and leader of Qu\u00e9bec's first openly separatist government; the angry, intransigent torch-bearer of the \"distinct society\" ideal, who refused to endorse the 1982 Constitution, leaving an open wound in the federation that festers still.\n\nThrough it all, L\u00e9vesque acknowledged that whatever injustices Qu\u00e9becers suffered inside Confederation, Canada was still a free and decent country. \"Canada's federal system,\" he once said, \"is not excessively oppressive or anything like a gulag.\" He was never the most ardent nationalist or separatist of his time, yet he fanned the flames of nationalist sentiment in pursuit of his aims. His insistence on wanting to break up the nation, in spite of the Canadian virtues he admired, are what made him such a perplexing \u2014 and often hated \u2014 figure in the minds of English-speaking Canadians, both inside Qu\u00e9bec, and elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/robert-bourassa", "page_content": "Robert Bourassa\n\nRobert Bourassa (1933-1996) was Premier of the province of Quebec for two terms, 1970-1976 and 1985-1993. Bourassa's support for both nationalism and federalism made him an ambiguous leader. He coined the phrase distinct society to specifically identify Quebec's French bourgeois citizenry.\n\nRobert Bourassa was born on July 14, 1933, to a lower middle-class family in Montreal's east end. His father, a federal civil servant, worked for the Montreal port authorities. From the age of 12, Bourassa knew he wanted to be a politician. He confided to a classmate, Jacques Godbout (now a well-known author and film director), that \"one day, I'll be premier of Quebec.\" Bourassa served as premier of Quebec from 1970-76 and also from 1985-93. He died of cancer at age 63 on October 2, 1996, after battling the disease for six years.\n\nBourassa graduated from Quebec's prestigious Jesuit college, Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, in 1953. He earned his law degree, along with the Governor General's medal, from the University of Montreal (1956). A Royal Society of Canada scholarship led to a Master of Laws (LLM) in political economy from Oxford University (1959) and a Ford Foundation Scholarship from Harvard (1960) enabled him to earn a Masters degree in public finance and financial law. From 1960-63, Bourassa worked as an economic advisor and fiscal advisor to the Federal Ministry of Revenue and taught economics at the University of Ottawa.\n\nBourassa married Andr\u00e9e Simard, daughter of the wealthy Simard shipbuilding family, in 1958. The marriage cemented his ties with the Liberal party and gave him crucial contacts in the business community. The Bourassa's had two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nBourassa served as secretary and director of research for the Quebec Royal Commission of Inquiry on Fiscal Policy from 1964-65. During this time he gained confidence and encouragement from Premier Jean Lesage and was elected as the Liberal member for the Mercier riding. He returned to Ottawa as advisor to the Ministry of Finance from 1965-66.\n\nAs a novice member of the Quebec National Assembly, Bourassa struggled in the wake of the Liberal party's 1966 electoral defeat to convince Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque not to leave the party. Bourassa, who believed that Quebec should be independent, was convinced that effective political independence for Quebec could only be achieved through monetary and fiscal independence. However, L\u00e9vesque left the Liberal party in 1968 to become the founding leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ). L\u00e9vesque's coalition movement dedicated itself to achieving political independence for Quebec while continuing economic association with the rest of Canada. Bourassa and L\u00e9vesque remained political rivals for the rest of their careers.\n\nThe Liberal party, using the theme \"Quebec au Travail, \" won the 1970 provincial election and Bourassa became Quebec's youngest premier. After only six months in office, Bourassa faced a major crisis when the Front du Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) terrorists kidnapped the British trade commissioner, James Richard Cross, and the minister of immigration and labour, Pierre Laporte. The FLQ cited the government's refusal to negotiate release of FLQ members who had been jailed for acts of terrorism as the reason for the kidnappings. Premier Bourassa called upon the federal government's Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, to declare a state of apprehended insurrection and to invoke the War Measures Act. In response to the government's sending in military forces, the terrorists murdered Pierre Laporte. By the end of the October Crisis, the FLQ terrorists had been arrested and deported. Both the Bourassa and Trudeau governments suffered considerable political damage when it became known that nearly four hundred alleged separatists had been jailed by the Quebec provincial police without charges ever being made.\n\nBourassa's well-known and long-standing ambiguity between nationalism and federalism and between cultural/social sovereignity and economic feudalism surfaced during his first administration. When the Victoria Charter came up for ratification in 1971, Bourassa, in response to pressure from the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois neo-nationalists, refused to allow the Quebec government to ratify the charter. (The Victoria Charter entailed the patriation of the 1867 British North American Act, a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and an amending formula that granted Quebec a veto over all future constitutional reforms. However, it did not entail any additional distribution of powers. The PQ and other francophones considered Quebec's independence in areas of immigration and communications essential for their \"distinct society\" and were staunchly opposed to ratification of the Charter.) Constitutional wrangling grew increasingly intense and bitter over the next two decades.\n\nBourassa's main achievements during his first two administrations resulted from his social, judicial, and economic policies. His government joined the national medicare plan and turned the provincial health and welfare system into the most progressive in North America. An Office of Consumer Protection, a Council on the Status of Women, and a Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms were created. Low-income groups were given access to a system of legal aid. The development of hydroelectric power along the rivers running into northwestern Quebec's James Bay provided economic growth for the entire province. Bourassa's achievements were rewarded by an overwhelming victory in the 1973 election with the Liberal party winning 102 of 110 seats.\n\nDespite these achievements, the Bourassa government soon found itself facing a series of crises. Critics pointed to questionable patronage practices including support for government services and contracts which benefited friends of the Liberal party, mishandling of negotiations with militant, nationalistic public and para-public union centrals, massive cost overruns and scandals associated with the Montreal Olympics of 1976, and legislation which made French the official language of Quebec and streamed all immigrant children into French-language schools (Bill 22). When Bourassa called for an election in November of 1976, the Liberal party was out-maneuvered by the PQ. Consequently, Bourassa lost his seat in the Mercier riding and his party was reduced to 26 seats.\n\nWithin weeks, Bourassa resigned as leader of the Liberal party. He returned to teaching (Institut d'\u00e9tudes europ\u00e9ennes de Bruxells, Institut europ\u00e9en d'administration des affaires de Fontaineau, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and Laval University in Quebec City) and made speeches on the economy, the flaws of sovereignity-association, and the European economic and political community. He contended that Quebec had all the powers it required under the federal system to ensure \"the pursuit of social progress, economic development and the cultural affirmation of Quebecers.\"\n\nWhen Claude Ryan, Bourassa's successor in the Liberal party, lost the 1981 provincial election to PQ's Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, he resigned as leader of the Liberal party. This opened the door for Bourassa's return. He returned to politics as a more confident, mature leader, believing that his \"most serious mistake in the 1970's was to have been too compromising\" with his adversaries.\n\nIndeed, Bourassa's timing could not have been better. The economy was just emerging from a very serious recession and voters related well to Bourassa's job-creating megaprojects. His promise to seek a constitutional reconciliation with Ottawa attracted many moderate nationalists away from the politically declining PQ. The Liberal party won five by-elections in 1983 and another four in 1984. With widespread popular support behind him, Bourassa refused to seek a seat in the National Assembly. Instead, he preferred to rebuild the Liberal party and prepare for the 1985 provincial election.\n\nThe 1985 election catapulted Bourassa and the Liberal party back into power with 99 of the Assembly's 122 seats and 56 percent of the popular vote. Bourassa, defeated in his own Mercier riding but secured a membership with the St. Laurent riding, had pulled off a remarkable comeback. The Liberal party established a powerful but fragile coalition of francophone, anglophone, and allophone business interests, middle-class and upper-class professionals, the farming community, and the working class.\n\nBy early 1986, Bourassa had set forth his government's five minimum conditions for Quebec's signing the Constitution Act of 1982: explicit recognition of Quebec as a \"distinct society, \" a provincial veto over all major constitutional changes, the entrenchment and extension of Quebec's control over immigration, severe curtailment of the national government's spending powers in areas of provincial jurisdiction, and the guarantee that Quebec could name three judges to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1987 Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a long-time friend and ally of Bourassa, met with all eleven provincial premiers at Meech Lake. The purpose of the meeting was to grant unanimous approval to the 1987 Constitutional Accord, better known as the Meech Lake Accord. Working closely with Bourassa, Mulroney was at first able to gain support from all other ten premiers. After Bourassa steadfastly refused any and all proposed amendments and declared that the accord's failure would be interpreted as a rejection of Quebec, Mulroney postponed a first minister's meeting until early June. It was too late to get the unamended accord past the Manitoba legislature.\n\nThe predicted outcry of nationalist and separatist resentment in Quebec materialized immediately. However, a widespread public opposition to the Meech Lake Accord developed throughout English-speaking Canada, galvanized by Bill 178. Bourassa had promised to ease the most discriminatory aspects of Quebec's Charter of the French Language (Bill 101), but instead brought in Bill 178 which denied businesses the right to use exterior bilingual signage and severely restricted the nature and amount of interior bilingual signage. The Bill also invoked the \"Notwithstanding clause\" of the national charter to prevent the legislation from being contested in the courts.\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadians did not like the attack on the charter or Quebec's arrogant dismissal of the Supreme Court ruling. Rather than becoming the much vaunted symbol of national reconciliation, the Meech Accord was used by nationalist extremists in both linguistic communities to propagate their respective separatist agendas for the colleague of Canada.\n\nEven with nationalist sentiments running at an all-time high, Bourassa and the Labor party had a relatively easy 1989 re-election. Partly in response to pressure from the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (with Jacques Parizeau as its party leader), Bourassa created the Allaire committee and gave it a mandate to identify and define \"traditional demands\" to be presented after agreement was reached on the Meech Lake Accord. The Allaire Report, published in 1991, demanded the transfer of extensive federal powers just to Quebec, but the report was set aside by Bourassa at the Liberal party's policy convention in 1992.\n\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois capitalized on this situation by forcing an ailing Bourassa, who had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 1990, to call a 1992 referendum on Quebec's constitutional future. Bourassa endorsed the Charlottetown constitutional accord which failed. At the time of his 1976 defeat to Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, Bourassa was described by a Liberal party colleague as \"the most hated man in Quebec.\" He resigned as premier in 1993.\n\nAlthough Bourassa's early political career was marked by ambiguity, by the end of his career Bourassa had clearly established his credentials as a federalist. In one of his final speeches Bourassa declared, \"I have never been able to conceive how Quebec could profit by dividing Canada into three parts.\"\n\nBourassa's only book, Gouverner le Quibec, was released at a press conference in August, 1995. His book, which includes a transcription of four of his lectures given at the University de Montreal, traces highlights of his political career and provides a self-analysis of his strategies and decisions as Premier of Quebec. Bourassa died from malignant melanoma, a type of cancer, in 1996 at the age of 63.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAdditional information on Robert Bourassa can be found in R\u00e9al Bertrand, Robert Bourassa (Outremont, Qu\u00e9bec: 1983); Andrew Cohen, A Deal Undone.

Already a part-time journalist while still a student, he broke off his law studies to serve in Europe (1944\u201345) as a reporter and correspondent attached to the U.S. forces. Back in Quebec after the war, he joined the international service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1946, became a war correspondent in Korea in 1952, and from 1956 to 1959 was commentator on a popular TV news program.\n\nL\u00e9vesque entered politics in 1960 and was elected to the Quebec National Assembly as a Liberal member for Gouin, joining Jean Lesage\u2019s government as minister of public works and hydraulic resources (1960\u201361). He then held the newly created portfolio of natural resources (1961\u201365), and in 1966, during the last months of the Lesage government, he was minister of family and social welfare. Meanwhile he had been reelected in the constituency of Laurier in the 1962 and 1966 legislative elections.\n\nIn October 1967 L\u00e9vesque, with others, founded the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association, which the following year combined with other separatist groups to form the left-wing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, with L\u00e9vesque as its first president. He was unsuccessful in the elections of 1970 and 1973 and returned in part to journalism, writing daily political articles in the Journal de Montr\u00e9al and the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec, until 1976, when his party won control of the provincial National Assembly and he became the premier of Quebec. He was reelected premier in April 1981.\n\nThe goal of L\u00e9vesque and his Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government was the independence option termed \u201csovereignty-association.\u201d The concept envisaged Quebec enacting its own laws, collecting taxes from its people, and establishing relations with foreign countries. Simultaneously, it would form an economic union with the rest of Canada based on a common currency.\n\nThis plan was rejected by 59.6 percent of the Quebec electorate in a popular-referendum vote on May 20, 1980, amid one of the highest voter turnouts in Quebec\u2019s history.

He was the founder of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and before that, a Liberal minister in the Lesage government from 1960 to 1966.Early lifeL\u00e9vesque was born in the H\u00f4tel Dieu Hospital in Campbellton, New Brunswick, on August 24, 1922. He was raised in New Carlisle, Quebec, on the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, by his parents, Diane (n\u00e9e Dionne) and Dominic L\u00e9vesque, a lawyer. He had three siblings, Andr\u00e9, Fernand and Alice. His father died when L\u00e9vesque was 14 years old.JournalistL\u00e9vesque attended the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 and the Saint-Charles-Garnier College in Quebec City, both of which were run by the Jesuits. He studied for a law degree at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City, but left the university in 1943 without having completed the degree. One of his classmates at Laval later recounted that L\u00e9vesque had been smoking in class, and refused to apologize to the professor, Louis-Philippe Pigeon, who refused to allow him back to class. L\u00e9vesque left, saying he really only wanted to write, not practise law. He worked as an announcer and news writer at the radio station CHNC in New Carlisle, as a substitute announcer for CHRC during 1941 and 1942, and then at CBV in Quebec City.During 1944\u20131945, he served as a liaison officer and war correspondent for the U.S. Army in Europe. He reported from London while it was under regular bombardment by the Luftwaffe, and advanced with the Allied troops as they pushed back the German army through France and Germany. Throughout the war, he made regular journalistic reports on the airwaves and in print. He was with the first unit of Americans to reach Dachau concentration camp.In 1947, he married Louise L'Heureux, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. L\u00e9vesque worked as a reporter for the CBC's French language section in the international service. He again served as a war correspondent for the CBC in the Korean War in 1952. After that, he was offered a career in journalism in the United States, but decided to stay in Canada.From 1956 to 1959, L\u00e9vesque became famous in Quebec for hosting a weekly television news program on Radio-Canada called Point de Mire.L\u00e9vesque covered international events and major labour struggles between workers and corporations that dogged the Union Nationale government of Premier Maurice Duplessis culminating with a great strike in 1957 at the Gasp\u00e9 Copper Mine in Murdochville. The Murdochville strike was a milestone for organized labour in Quebec as it resulted in changes to the province's labour laws.While working for the public television network, he became personally involved in the broadcasters' strike that lasted 68 tumultuous days beginning in late 1958. L\u00e9vesque was arrested during a demonstration in 1959, along with union leader Jean Marchand and 24 other demonstrators.Early political careerLib\u00e9ral cabinet ministerIn 1960, L\u00e9vesque entered politics as a star candidate and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1960 election as a Liberal Party member in the riding of Montr\u00e9al-Laurier. In the government of Jean Lesage, he served as minister of hydroelectric resources and public works from 1960 to 1961, and minister of natural resources from 1961 to 1965. While in office, he played a pivotal role in the nationalization of hydroelectric companies, greatly expanding Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, one of the reforms that was part of the Quiet Revolution.From 1965 to 1966, he served as minister of family and welfare. L\u00e9vesque, with his friend Eric Kierans, the Quebec minister of health, was heavily involved in negotiations with the Government of Canada to fund both Quebec and federal mandates for social programs.In a surprise, the Liberals lost the 1966 election to the Union Nationale but L\u00e9vesque retained his own seat of Laurier. Believing that the Canadian federation was doomed to fail, L\u00e9vesque began to openly champion separation from Canada as part of the Liberal platform at the upcoming party conference. Kierans, who had been elected party president, led the movement against the motion, with future premier Robert Bourassa attempting to mediate the dispute before siding with Kierans. The resolution was handily defeated, and L\u00e9vesque walked out with his followers.Founding of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coisAfter leaving the Liberal Party, he founded the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association (MSA). In contrast to more militant nationalist movements, such as Pierre Bourgault's Rassemblement pour l'Ind\u00e9pendance Nationale (RIN), the party eschewed direct action and protest and attempted instead to appeal to the broader electorate, whom L\u00e9vesque called \"normal people\". The main contention in the first party conference was the proposed policy toward Quebec's Anglophone minority; L\u00e9vesque faced down heavy opposition to his insistence that English schools and language rights be protected.The election of hardline federalist Pierre Elliott Trudeau as Prime Minister, and the politically damaging riot instigated by the RIN when he appeared at the St. Jean Baptiste Day parade of 1968, led to the sovereignty movement coming together. The MSA merged with another party in the Quebec sovereignty movement, the Ralliement National of Gilles Gr\u00e9goire, to create the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) in 1968. At L\u00e9vesque's insistence, RIN members were permitted to join but not accepted as a group.The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois gained 25 per cent of the vote in the 1970 election, running on a platform of declaring independence if government was formed. The PQ only won six seats, and L\u00e9vesque continued to run the party from Montreal by communicating with the caucus in Quebec City.The 1973 election saw a large Liberal victory, and created major tensions within the party, especially after L\u00e9vesque was unable to gain a seat. A quarrel with House Leader Robert Burns almost ended L\u00e9vesque's leadership shortly thereafter.Premier of Quebec (1976\u20131985)L\u00e9vesque and his party won a landslide victory at the 1976 election, with L\u00e9vesque finally re-entering the Assembly as the member for Taillon in downtown Longueuil. His party assumed power with 41.1 per cent of the popular vote and 71 seats out of 110, and even managed to unseat Bourassa in his own riding. L\u00e9vesque became premier of Quebec ten days later. The night of L\u00e9vesque's acceptance speech included one of his most famous quotations: \"I never thought that I could be so proud to be Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\"French languageHis government's signature achievement was the Quebec Charter of the French Language (introduced in the legislature and still colloquially known as Bill 101), whose stated goal was to make French \"the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business\". In its first enactment, it reserved access to English-language public schools to children whose parents had attended English school in Quebec. All other children were required to attend French schools in order to encourage immigrants to integrate themselves into the majority francophone culture (L\u00e9vesque was more moderate on language than some of the PQ, including the language minister, Camille Laurin. He would have resigned as leader rather than eliminate English-language public schools, as some party members proposed). Bill 101 also made it illegal for businesses to put up exterior commercial signs in a language other than French at a time when English dominated as a commercial and business language in Quebec.Quebec nationalismL\u00e9vesque was disappointed with the cold response by the American economic elite to his first speech in New York City as Premier of Quebec, in which he compared Quebec's march towards sovereignty to the American Revolution. His first speech in France was, however, more successful, leading him to a better appreciation of the French intelligentsia and of French culture.On May 20, 1980, the PQ held, as promised before the elections, the 1980 Quebec referendum on its sovereignty-association plan. The result of the vote was 40 per cent in favour and 60 per cent opposed (with 86 per cent turnout). L\u00e9vesque conceded defeat in the referendum by announcing that, as he had understood the verdict, he had been told \"until next time\".L\u00e9vesque led the PQ to victory in the 1981 election, increasing the party's majority in the National Assembly and increasing its share of the popular vote from 41 to 49 per cent.A major focus of his second mandate was the patriation of the Canadian constitution. L\u00e9vesque was criticized by some in Quebec who said he had been tricked by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the English-Canadian provincial premiers. To this day, no Quebec premier of any political side has endorsed the 1982 constitutional amendment.Other policies and eventsOn February 6, 1977, L\u00e9vesque accidentally killed Edgar Trottier, a homeless man who had been lying on the road, while driving his car. Trottier had in the past repeatedly used the maneuver to secure a hospital bed for the night. Police officers at the scene did not administer the breathalyzer test to L\u00e9vesque, because they did not suspect that he was impaired. L\u00e9vesque was later fined $25 for failing to wear his glasses while driving a car on the night in question. The incident gained further notoriety when it was revealed that the female companion in the vehicle was not his wife, but his longtime secretary, Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. L\u00e9vesque's marriage ended in divorce soon thereafter (the couple had already been estranged for some time), and in April 1979, he married C\u00f4t\u00e9.L\u00e9vesque's government completed the nationalization of hydroelectricity through Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. He also created the Quebec Charter of the French Language, the political party financing law, and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois itself. His government was the first in Canada to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the province's Charte des droits de la personne in 1977. He also continued the work of the Lesage government in improving social services, in which social needs were taken care of by the state, instead of the Catholic Church (as in the Duplessis era) or the individual. L\u00e9vesque is still regarded by many as a symbol of democracy and tolerance.The PQ government's response to the recession of the early 1980s by cutting the provincial budget to reduce growing deficits that resulted from the recession angered labour union members, a core part of the constituency of the PQ and the sovereignty movement.L\u00e9vesque's Act to govern the financing of political parties banned corporate donations and limited individual contributions to political parties to $3,000. This key legislation was meant to prevent wealthy citizens and organizations from having a disproportionate influence on the electoral process. A Referendum Act was passed to allow for a province-wide vote on issues presented in a referendum, giving a \"yes\" and \"no\" side equal funding and legal footing.ResignationL\u00e9vesque had argued that the party should not make sovereignty the object of the 1985 election and instead opt for the \"Beau risque\" strategy of seeking an understanding with the federal government of Brian Mulroney, which angered the strongest supporters of sovereignty within the party. He said the issue in the upcoming election would not be sovereignty. Instead, he expressed hope, \"that we can finally find government leaders in Ottawa who will discuss Qu\u00e9bec's demands seriously and work with us for the greater good of Qu\u00e9becers\". His new stance weakened his position within the party. Some senior members resigned; there were by-election defeats. L\u00e9vesque resigned as leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois on June 20, 1985, and as premier of Qu\u00e9bec on October 3, 1985.Retirement and deathL\u00e9vesque, a constant smoker, was hosting a dinner party in his Nuns' Island (Montreal) apartment on the evening of November 1, 1987, when he experienced chest pains; he died of a heart attack that night at Montreal General Hospital. A brief resurgence of separatist sentiment followed. Over 100,000 viewed his body lying in state in Montreal and Quebec City, over 10,000 went to his funeral in the latter city, and hundreds wept daily at his grave for months.L\u00e9vesque was made a grand officer of the French Legion of Honour. He was posthumously made a grand officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2008.LegacyDespite a perceived weakening of his sovereigntist resolve in the last years of his government, he reaffirmed his belief to friends and, notably, to a crowd of Universit\u00e9 Laval students months before his death, of the necessity of independence.His state funeral and funeral procession was reportedly attended by 100,000 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. During the carrying out of his coffin from the church, the crowd spontaneously began to applaud and sing Quebec's unofficial national anthem \"Gens du pays\", replacing the first verse with Mon cher Ren\u00e9 (My dear Ren\u00e9), as is the custom when this song is adapted to celebrate someone's birthday. Two major boulevards now bear his name, one in Montreal and one in Quebec City. In Montreal, the \u00c9difice Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the Maison Radio-Canada are both located on Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard, fittingly as L\u00e9vesque once worked for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the CBC, respectively. On June 22, 2010, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the government of Quebec commemorated L\u00e9vesque's role in Quebec's Quiet Revolution and his tenure as premier by renaming the 1244-megawatt Manic-3 generating station in his honour.On June 3, 1999, a monument in his honour was unveiled on boulevard Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque outside the Parliament Building in Quebec City. The statue is popular with tourists, who snuggle up to it, to have their pictures taken \"avec Ren\u00e9\" (with Ren\u00e9), despite repeated attempts by officials to keep people from touching the monument or getting too close to it. The statue had been the source of an improvised, comical and affectionately touching tribute to L\u00e9vesque. The fingers of his extended right hand are slightly parted, just enough so that tourists and the faithful could insert a cigarette, giving the statue an unusually realistic appearance.This practice is less often seen now, however, as the statue was moved to New Carlisle and replaced by a similar, but bigger one. This change resulted from considerable controversy. Some believed that the life-sized statue was not appropriate for conveying his importance in the history of Quebec. Others noted that a trademark of L\u00e9vesque was his relatively small stature.L\u00e9vesque today remains an important figure of the Quebec nationalist movement, and is considered sovereigntism's spiritual father. After his death, even people in disagreement with some of those convictions now generally recognize his importance to the history of Quebec. Many in Quebec regard him as the father of the modern Quebec nation. According to a study made in 2006 by Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and L\u00e9ger Marketing, L\u00e9vesque was considered by far, according to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the best premier to run the province over the last 50 years.L\u00e9vesque was notably portrayed in 1994 in the television series Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. In 2006, an additional television miniseries, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, was aired on the CBC. He was also portrayed in an episode of Kevin Spencer, a Canadian cartoon show. In it, his ghost attempted a camaraderie with Kevin because of their similarities in political beliefs, as well as the fact that the title character, like Ren\u00e9's ghost, claims to smoke \"five packs a day\".A song by Les Cowboys Fringants named \"Lettre \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque\" on the album La Grand-Messe was dedicated to him. They also mention the street bearing his name in the song called \"La Manifestation\".He was the co-subject, along with Pierre Trudeau, of the Donald Brittain-directed documentary miniseries The Champions.PersonalityL\u00e9vesque was a man capable of great tact and charm, but who could also be abrupt and choleric when defending beliefs, ideals, or morals essential to him, or when lack of respect was perceived, for example, when he was famously snubbed by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand at their first meeting. He was also a proud Gasp\u00e9sien (hailing from the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula), and had hints of the local accent.Considered a major defender of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, L\u00e9vesque was, before the 1960s, more interested in international affairs than Quebec matters. The popular image of L\u00e9vesque was his ever-present cigarette and his small physical stature, as well as his unique comb over that earned him the nickname of Ti-Poil, literally, \"Li'l Hair\", but more accurately translated as \"Baldy\". L\u00e9vesque was a passionate and emotional public speaker. Those close to L\u00e9vesque have described him as having difficulty expressing his emotions in private, saying that he was more comfortable in front of a crowd of thousands than with one person.While many Quebec intellectuals are inspired by French philosophy and high culture, L\u00e9vesque favoured the United States. Speaking fluent English, he was a faithful reader of The New York Times, and took his vacations in New England every year. He also stated that, if there had to be one role model for him, it would be US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. While in London during the Second World War, his admiration for Britons grew when he witnessed their courage in the face of the German bombardments.WorksMy Qu\u00e9bec, 1979, Methuen, 191 pages, ISBN 0-458-93980-3Quotations from Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, 1977, \u00c9ditions H\u00e9ritage, 105 pages ISBN 0-7773-3942-0An Option for Quebec, 1968, McClelland and Stewart, 128 pages\"For an Independent Quebec\", in Foreign Affairs, July 1976) [1]Option Qu\u00e9bec (1968)La passion du Qu\u00e9bec (1978)Oui (1980)Attendez que je me rappelle (1986) (although the title is literally translated as Wait While I Remember, the title of the English-language version was Memoirs.)See alsoList of Gasp\u00e9siensList of premiers of QuebecList of Quebec general electionsPolitician nicknaming in QuebecPolitics of QuebecSeparatismReferencesFurther readingDesbarats, Peter (1976).

In 1994, he became the second leader of the separatist PQ to become premier (photo by Jim Merrithew). PreviousNext\n\nJacques Parizeau, GOQ, economist, professor, senior public servant, politician and premier of Qu\u00e9bec (born 9 August 1930 in Montr\u00e9al, QC; died 1 June 2015 in Montr\u00e9al, QC). Jacques Parizeau was one of the most prominent leaders of modern-day Qu\u00e9bec and a steadfast champion of the Qu\u00e9bec sovereigntist movement.\n\nEducation and Early Career\n\nJacques Parizeau was born into an upper-class family in Montr\u00e9al, the son of insurer, businessman and historian G\u00e9rard Parizeau and his wife Germaine Biron. Parizeau studied at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Outremont and at the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales (HEC Montr\u00e9al), from which he graduated in 1950. He continued his studies in Paris at the Institut d\u2019\u00e9tudes politiques and at the Facult\u00e9 de droit de Paris (1952). In 1955, at the age of 24, he received a PhD in economics from the London School of Economics.\n\nUpon returning to Qu\u00e9bec, Parizeau taught at HEC Montr\u00e9al from 1955 to 1976, and served as head of the Department of Applied Economics from 1973 to 1975. He was consulted by various Qu\u00e9bec ministers and was one of the architects of the Quiet Revolution of the early 1960s. From 1961 to 1969, he was the economic and investment advisor to the premier of Qu\u00e9bec and the Cabinet. He helped nationalize hydroelectricity and establish a new bargaining system in the Qu\u00e9bec public service. He also helped to create the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, a key contribution to the modernization of the province\u2019s economy.\n\nParliamentarian and Minister in the L\u00e9vesque Government\n\nParizeau officially joined the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) in 1969. He explained his choice to support the party by stating his conviction that strong Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian governments could not both operate in the same country. He never deviated from his separatist aim for the duration of his political career. He was Minister of Finance from 1976 to 1984 under Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque\u2019s successive governments, but resigned because he was critical of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s federalist sentiments. L\u00e9vesque favoured an attempt at reworking Qu\u00e9bec-Canada relations under the beau risque strategy (see Sovereignty-Association; Constitutional History).\n\nL\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nIn 1988, Jacques Parizeau replaced Pierre Marc Johnson as leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a sign that his views were gaining ground within the party. He made independence a top priority for the party again, and in so doing set his party up for an arduous period of being in the opposition. The following year, Robert Bourassa and Brian Mulroney negotiated a new constitutional agreement between Canada and Qu\u00e9bec, known as the Meech Lake Accord. When Jacques Parizeau was appointed leader of the PQ, as the accord was reaching its final ratification, influential beau risque supporters joined the Conservative party in Ottawa (notably Lucien Bouchard), and the federalist movement seemed to be gaining momentum in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nMartin Brian Mulroney (\\u00a9 Yousuf Karsh/Comstock Images & Agency/\\r\n\nNational Archives of Canada/PA-164231). Lucien Bouchard, shortly after leaving the Brian Mulroney cabinet, 1990. PreviousNext\n\nIn the 1989 provincial elections, despite winning 40 per cent of the vote, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won only 29 seats and was once again relegated to opposition status. In June 1990, the Meech Lake Accord failed, and the alliance between beau risque supporters and Canadian federalists was broken. Lucien Bouchard left the Mulroney government to create a federal separatist party, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Robert Bourassa refused to take part in the First Ministers Conferences and threatened to hold a referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty if the rest of Canada could not propose an acceptable constitutional amendment before the summer of 1992. The first ministers came to an agreement in August of that year with a new constitutional amendment, the Charlottetown Accord. The accord was rejected following a national referendum held on 26 October 1992. Jacques Parizeau led the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u201cNo\u201d vote to victory, joining five other provinces that opposed the accord.\n\nElection as Premier of Qu\u00e9bec and the 1995 Referendum\n\nIn 1994, Jacques Parizeau was elected Premier of Qu\u00e9bec, receiving 45 per cent of the vote and winning out over Robert Bourassa\u2019s successor, Daniel Johnson (younger). Although the vote count was close, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly. The federal sovereigntists of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, led by Lucien Bouchard, had won seats in over two thirds of Qu\u00e9bec ridings the previous year. Jacques Parizeau proclaimed that the conditions were right for him to carry out his promise of holding a referendum in the year following his election. But the momentum that the sovereigntist movement had gathered following the failure of the Meech Lake Accord had begun to dwindle. At the beginning of the referendum campaign, the Yes vote was more than 10 points behind the No vote. Midway through the campaign, in a last effort to reverse this trend, Jacques Parizeau agreed to step down and allow Lucien Bouchard, who was very popular among Qu\u00e9bec voters, to take over managing the Yes campaign.\n\nOn 30 October 1995, the Yes vote won 49 per cent of the vote, falling a few tens of thousands of votes short of a majority. The night of the referendum, a visibly bitter Jacques Parizeau stated that he had been defeated by the financial influence of the opposing side and a strong mobilization of ethnic communities against the Yes vote, a statement for which he was severely criticized. He resigned the next day.\n\nControversy\n\nFollowing his resignation, Jacques Parizeau took on the role of leader of the sovereigntist movement, attempting to breathe new life into the effort, in particular by leading a think tank on the subject within the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. He regularly commented on Qu\u00e9bec current affairs and criticized the Bouchard government\u2019s obsession with a zero deficit and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u2019 ambiguous stance on the referendum issue. He was even critical of his successors, and his commentary earned him the nickname belle-m\u00e8re, literally \u201cmother-in-law.\u201d A devoted democrat, Jacques Parizeau believed so deeply in the importance of debate that he would even criticize his own party. A few months before he died, he declared that sovereigntists were faced with \u201cun champ de ruines\u201d (a field of ruins) following the defeat of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois led by Pauline Marois in the election on 7 April 2014. Just before the 2012 election he openly supported the new Option nationale party, led by Jean-Martin Aussant, over his old party.\n\nImage: Simon Villeneuve/Wikicommons.\\r\n\n\n\nJacques Parizeau never apologized for the controversial remark he made the night of the 1995 referendum. The following day in his resignation speech he did, however, acknowledge that he had not expressed his disappointment well. However, if his statement could be interpreted as a reference to a nationalist identity, it goes against the vision of civic nationalism that he always spoke in favour of for a sovereign Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 namely, a society that is modern, secular, pluralist and open to the world (see Francophone Nationalism in Qu\u00e9bec). He was also one of the strongest critics of the Qu\u00e9bec values charter proposed by PQ minister Bernard Drainville, because he deemed that the charter was too prohibitive and that it should have instead been limited to the recommendations given in the Bouchard-Taylor report.\n\nLegacy\n\nJacques Parizeau was an important architect of modern-day Qu\u00e9bec who gave the province some of its most powerful economic engines. Although his contributions to economic development, nation building and political debate are widely acknowledged in Qu\u00e9bec, he is remembered in the rest of Canada for a period of political divisiveness and constitutional disruption.\n\nHe has received numerous awards and honours in recognition of his academic and political careers. In 2004, filmmaker Francine Pelletier produced a documentary about him titled Monsieur. The day after his death, the National Assembly announced that a state funeral would be held in his honour and that the main building for the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec would be named \u00c9difice Jacques-Parizeau.\n\nJacques Parizeau married Polish writer Alice Parizeau (n\u00e9e Alicia Poznanska) in 1956. He remarried in 1992. His second wife, Lisette Lapointe, was a member of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois from 2002 to 2012 and became mayor of Saint-Adolphe d\u2019Howard in 2013.

Upon completing his primary education in New Carlisle, he pursued his classical education at the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge de Gasp\u00e9 and the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Charles-Garnier in Quebec City. In the fall of 1941 he began studies in law at Laval University, which he did not complete.\n\nHe pursued a career in radio journalism and acted as a liaison agent and war correspondent for the U. S. armed forces in 1944 and 1945. Between 1946 and 1951 he worked for the French-language section of the International Service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After serving as correspondent in Korea in 1951-1952, he created Radio-Canada's news service system and co-produced the program Carrefour (Crossroads). Between 1956 and 1959 he produced and served as animator for a television news program entitled Point de mire (Target). During 1959 he led a bitter campaign for the creation of a union for Radio-Canada's producers. When that goal was accomplished he left Radio-Canada a committed neo-nationalist in search of a new career and a new country.\n\nAttracted by the neo-nationalist platform of the Quebec Liberal Party of Jean Lesage, L\u00e9vesque accepted an invitation to join the party. He quickly became one of the leading forces in Quebec's \"Quiet Revolution\" once the party defeated the longstanding Union Nationale Party in June 1960. As minister of natural resources from March 1961 to January 1966 he was responsible for the campaign which brought about the nationalization of Quebec's private hydro-electric companies by 1964. This development allowed Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, which employs thousands of highly skilled French-speaking Quebe\u00e7ois, to become North America's largest and most successful producer and distributor of electricity.\n\nL\u00e9vesque became one of the strongest proponents of a powerful, neo-nationalist Quebec state, both politically and economically. He was the government's most vociferous critic of the existing Canadian constitution. He advocated, as a minimum, \"special status\" for Quebec which entailed much greater taxing powers, exclusive control over all health and social welfare programs, and significant powers for Quebec in international affairs. When negotiations with Ottawa encountered serious opposition after 1965, he started promoting the concept of associate-state status for Quebec. His views were considered far too radical for the majority in the Liberal Party. After the party's defeat in 1966 he left and created the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association (MSA) in November 1967 which became the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois (PQ) in October 1968.\n\nAs president of the PQ from its formation into the 1980s Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque pursued the party's central goal of achieving a new constitutional arrangement with the rest of Canada; that is, political independence with continued economic association. When L\u00e9vesque and the party agreed to postpone the constitutional question for a referendum, the PQ achieved power in November 1976. The PQ's most significant legislative measure was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which confirmed French as the only official language of the province and set out tough provisions to make French the language of work for all Quebe\u00e7ois.\n\nThe L\u00e9vesque government prepared for the referendum by trying to assure American investors that a politically independent Quebec would remain a friendly ally of the United States and by seeking to assure Quebec citizens that sovereignty and association would be achieved simultaneously, thereby minimizing the socio-economic risks. During the historic 1980 referendum campaign, the Canadian prime minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, declared that the rest of Canada would never agree to political independence with the continued benefit of economic association for Quebec. He also promised to begin the process of reforming the century-old British North America Act to give Canada a renewed federal system. As a result of this dramatic intervention, 60 percent of the voters rejected the PQ's request for a mandate to negotiate sovereignty-association. The PQ strategy of achieving independence democratically and by stages had failed.\n\nUnder L\u00e9vesque's leadership the PQ won the 1981 provincial election, but the disintegration of the independence movement and its political expression, the PQ, set in immediately. Reduced to a mere premier caught in the dilemma of administering a debt ridden province faced with a serious recession and rising unemployment, and confronted with a humiliating defeat on the constitution which was voted down along with an amendment formula in 1982, L\u00e9vesque had to abandon long cherished plans for wide-ranging socio-economic reforms. In fact, he introduced deep cuts in the salaries as well as the quantity of public and para-public employees. The unlimited growth of the Quebec state was over.\n\nThe results were predictable. The PQ lost quite dramatically the widespread public support that had brought it to power in 1976. When L\u00e9vesque decided not to hold the forthcoming election on the issue of independence as promised, he precipitated a major schism in the party. All the leading independentists resigned, leaving his government in a precarious position.\n\nWhile Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque was responsible for many of the socio-economic reforms after 1960, the central goal of the Quiet Revolution\u2014political independence for Quebec\u2014 had been thwarted. The neo-nationalist movement, led with great vigor and sincerity by L\u00e9vesque, would have to await a new leader and a more opportune time in order to re-emerge as a significant force in Quebec society. In 1985 L\u00e9vesque, one of Quebec's most sincere politicians, stepped down as party leader and was replaced by Pierre Marc Johnson, a Montreal lawyer and physician.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThere are two biographies of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque which deal with his career prior to his becoming premier in 1976: Peter Desbarats, Ren\u00e9: A Canadian in Search of Country (1976) and Jean Provencher, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque: Portrait of a Quebecer (1975). On the rise of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois there is Pierre Dupont, How L\u00e9vesque Won: The Story of the PQ's Stunning Election Victory (1977) and Vera Murray, Le Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois: de la fondation \u00e0 la prise du pouvoir (1976). By far the best treatment of L\u00e9vesque is the study by a journalist, Graham Fraser, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque & the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois in Power (1984). Solid background for understanding the historical context in which L\u00e9vesque operated after World War II can be found in Michael D. Behiels, Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution: Liberalism versus Neo-nationalism, 1945-1960 (1985) and Kenneth McRoberts and Dale Posgate, Quebec: Social and Political Crisis (1980).\n\nAdditional Sources\n\nL\u00e9vesque, Ren\u00e9, Memoirs, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1995. \u25a1"}, {"url": "https://english.republiquelibre.org/Leaders_of_the_Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois", "page_content": "This is the list of all leaders of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois:\n\nPauline Marois (2007-)\n\nPauline Marois, leader of the opposition\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Pauline Marois\n\n\n\n\n\nAndr\u00e9 Boisclair (2005-2007)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Boisclair, leader of the opposition\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Andr\u00e9 Boisclair\n\n\n\n\n\nBernard Landry (1996-2005)\n\nBernard Landry, lawyer, professor and Premier of Quebec from March 2001 to June 2003\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Bernard Landry\n\n\n\n\n\nLucien Bouchard (1996-2001)\n\nLucien Bouchard, lawyer, Premier of Qu\u00e9bec from 1996 to 2001\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Lucien Bouchard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacques Parizeau (1988-1995)\n\nJacques Parizeau, economist, Premier of Quebec from Sept. 1994 to Jan. 1996.\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Jacques Parizeau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPierre-Marc Johnson (1984-1988)\n\nPierre-Marc Johnson, lawyer, Premier of Quebec from Oct. to Dec. 1985\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Pierre-Marc Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks by Pierre-Marc Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque (1968-1984)\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, founder of the PQ, Premier of Quebec from 1976 to 1985\n\nBiography in Wikipedia: Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque"}]}
