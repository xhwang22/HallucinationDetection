{"Philip of France was King of France from 1180 to 1223.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-France", "page_content": "Philip II , byname Philip Augustus, French Philippe Auguste , (born August 21, 1165, Paris , France\u2014died July 14, 1223, Mantes), the first of the great Capetian kings of medieval France (reigned 1180\u20131223), who gradually reconquered the French territories held by the kings of England and also furthered the royal domains northward into Flanders and southward into Languedoc. He was a major figure in the Third Crusade to the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhen the count of Flanders allied himself with the Champagne faction , there followed a serious revolt against the king. In the Peace of Boves, in July 1185 (confirmed by the Treaty of Gisors in May 1186), the king and the count of Flanders composed their differences (which had been chiefly over possession of Vermandois, in Picardy) so that the disputed territory was partitioned, Amiens and numerous other places passing to the king and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace. Thenceforward the king was free to run against Henry II of England.\n\nWhen Henry II of England arrived in Normandy, perhaps with the intention of responding to an appeal by the house of Champagne, Philip II entered into negotiations with him and, at Gisors on June 28, 1180, renewed an understanding that Louis VII had reached with him in 1177. As a result, the house of Champagne was politically isolated, and Philip II was making all decisions for himself and acting as he saw fit when his father died, on September 18, 1180, leaving him sole king in name as well as in fact.\n\nPhilip was the son of Louis VII of France and Adela of Champagne. In order to be associated as king with his father, who had fallen mortally ill, he was crowned at Reims on November 1, 1179. His uncles of the house of Champagne\u2014Henry I, count of Champagne; Guillaume, archbishop of Reims; and Thibaut V, count of Blois and Chartres\u2014hoped to use the youthful king to control France. To escape from their tutelage , Philip on April 28, 1180, married Isabella, the daughter of Baldwin V of Hainaut and the niece (through her mother) of Philip of Alsace, the count of Flanders, who promised to give the king the territory of Artois as her dowry.\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nHenry\u2019s French possessions\u2014the so-called Angevin empire, consisting of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, with Aquitaine in the hands of his son, the future Richard I the Lion-Heart of England, and Brittany ruled by another son, Geoffrey (died 1186)\u2014all were a constant menace to the French royal domain. Furthermore, there were long-standing disputes over the Vexin (between Normandy and the \u00cele-de-France), Berry, and Auvergne.\n\nPhilip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau, or of Colombi\u00e8res (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Before his departure, he made the so-called Testament of 1190 to provide for the government of his kingdom in his absence. On his way to Palestine, he met Richard in Sicily, where they promptly found themselves at variance, though they made a treaty at Messina in March 1191. Arriving in Palestine, they cooperated against the Muslims at Acre, until Philip fell ill and made his illness a pretext for returning to France, quite determined to settle the succession to Flanders (Philip of Alsace had just died on the Crusade) while Richard was still absent. Thus, by the end of 1191, Philip II was back in France.\n\nIn spite of promises he had made in the Holy Land, Philip at once prepared to attack the Plantagenet possessions in France. Informed of this, Richard also left the Crusade but was taken prisoner while on his way back by the duke of Austria, Leopold V of Babenberg. Philip did everything he could to prolong his rival\u2019s captivity, but Richard was at last set free (1194) and went to war against Philip. The French king suffered a number of defeats (from that at Fr\u00e9teval in July 1194 to that at Courcelles in September 1198) in a series of campaigns that were occasionally punctuated by negotiations. It was fortuitous for Philip, however, when Richard was killed in April 1199.\n\nRichard\u2019s brother John was by no means as formidable a fighter. Moreover, his right to Richard\u2019s succession could be contested by Arthur of Brittany, whose father had been senior to John. To secure the succession, therefore, John came to terms with Philip: by the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 22, 1200), in return for Philip\u2019s recognition of him as Richard\u2019s heir, he ceded \u00c9vreux and the Norman Vexin to Philip; agreed that Issoudun and Gra\u00e7ay should be the dowry of his niece Blanche of Castile, who was to marry the future Louis VIII (Philip\u2019s son by Isabella of Hainaut); and renounced any claim to suzerainty over Berry and Auvergne.\n\nShortly afterward, however, John entered into conflict with the Lusignan family of Poitou (in Aquitaine), who appealed to Philip as overlord. When he was summoned to appear before the royal court as a vassal of the French crown, John did not present himself, and Philip, in April 1202, pronounced John\u2019s French fiefs forfeit and undertook to carry out the sentence himself. He invaded Normandy, overran the northeast, and laid siege to Arques, while Arthur of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey, who died some years before, campaigned against John\u2019s supporters in Poitou; but John, marching south from Maine, captured Arthur at Mirebeau (August 1). In fury, Philip abandoned the siege of Arques and marched southwestward to Tours, ravaging John\u2019s territory on his way before returning to Paris. Guillaume des Roches, the powerful seneschal of Anjou, who had taken John\u2019s side, came to terms with Philip in March 1203.\n\nResuming operations against Normandy, Philip occupied the towns around the great fortress of Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard, to which he laid siege in September 1203, having overruled Pope Innocent III\u2019s attempts to mediate. John, who is reported to have murdered Arthur of Brittany in April, retired to England in December, and Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard fell to Philip in March 1204. Rouen, the Norman capital, surrendered in June, after 40 days\u2019 resistance.\n\nAfter his conquest of Normandy, Philip subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou with less difficulty (1204\u201305), though the castles of Loches and Chinon held out for a year. He sought to secure his conquests by lavishing privileges on the towns and on the religious houses but otherwise left the local barons in power. Unrest, however, was endemic in Poitou, and in June 1206 John landed at La Rochelle. After a campaign in the south, he turned north toward the Loire. At Thouars in October 1206, he and Philip made a two-year truce, leaving John in possession of the reconquered Poitevin lands. In the following year, however, Philip invaded Poitou again; and, after a further campaign in 1208, only the south and part of the west of Poitou remained loyal to John (with Saintonge, Guyenne, and Gascony).\n\nPhilip next hoped to exploit the dispute between John and Pope Innocent III. While Innocent was threatening to declare John unfit to reign (1212), plans were being made for a French landing in England and for the accession of Philip\u2019s son Louis to the English throne. The plans had to be dropped when John made his submission to the pope (1213). Throwing himself into schemes for revenge, John formed a coalition against France: the Holy Roman emperor Otto IV, the count of Flanders (Ferrand, or Ferdinand, of Portugal), and the count of Boulogne (Raynald, or Renaud, of Dammartin) were to invade the Capetian territory from the northeast while John attacked from the west, with the help of his Poitevin barons.\n\nJohn landed at La Rochelle in February 1214 and advanced into Anjou but was put to flight by Louis at La Roche-aux-Moines on July 2; his confederates were completely defeated by Philip in the decisive Battle of Bouvines on July 27. The Anglo-Angevin power in France and the coalition had both been broken in one month. Thus Philip, who, in 1213, had transferred Brittany to his cousin Peter of Dreux, was left without any significant opposition to his rule in France.\n\nIt was not only at the Plantagenets\u2019 expense that Philip enlarged the royal domain. His claim to Artois through his first marriage and his gains by the settlement of 1185\u201386 have been mentioned above, and he subsequently proceeded, step by step, to acquire the rest of Vermandois and Valois. His insistence on his suzerainty over vacant fiefs and on his tutelage over minors and heiresses was particularly effective with regard to Flanders, where two successive Flemish counts, Philip of Alsace (died 1191) and Baldwin IX (died c. 1205) had left no male issue.\n\nThough he did not personally take part in the Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III against a Cathari religious sect in Languedoc, Philip allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out. Simon de Montfort\u2019s capture of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne (1209) and his victory at Muret over Raymond VI of Toulouse and Peter II of Aragon (1213) prepared the way for the eventual annexation of eastern Languedoc to the royal domain six years after Philip\u2019s death and for the union of northern and southern France under Capetian rule."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/France/France-1180-to-c-1490", "page_content": "The age of Gothic cathedrals and Scholastic theology was also an age of splendour for the French monarchy. Royal authority was greatly strengthened by Louis VII\u2019s successor, Philip II (Augustus; reigned 1180\u20131223), who could claim descent from Charlemagne through his mother. Philip proved to be the ablest Capetian yet to reign. He was practical and clear-sighted in his political objectives; the extension of territorial power and the improvement of mechanisms with which to govern an expanded realm were his consistent policies. Perhaps it was not accidental that royal documents began to refer to the \u201cking of France\u201d (rex Franciae) instead of using the customary formula \u201cking of the Franks\u201d (rex Francorum) within a year or two of Philip\u2019s accession.\n\nPhilip Augustus\n\nPhilip\u2019s outstanding achievement was to wrest control from the Plantagenets of most of the domains they held in France. Intervening in struggles between Henry II of England and his sons, Philip won preliminary concessions in 1187 and 1189. He acquired strategic lands on the Norman borders following wars with Henry\u2019s sons, King Richard and King John (1196 and 1200). And, when in 1202 John failed to answer a summons to the vassalic court of his lord, Philip Augustus confiscated his fiefs. Normandy fell to the Capetian in 1204. Maine, Anjou, and Touraine fell rapidly (1204\u201306), leaving only Aquitaine and a few peripheral domains in the contested possession of England. By the Truce of Chinon (September 18, 1214), John recognized the conquests of Philip Augustus and renounced the suzerainty of Brittany, although the complete submission of Poitou and Saintonge was to take another generation.\n\nPhilip\u2019s other acquisitions of territory, if less spectacular, were no less important for consolidating the realm. In the north he pressed the royal authority to the border of Flanders. Artois, which came under his control as a dowry with his first wife, was fully secured in 1212. Vermandois and Valois (1213) and the counties of Beaumont-sur-Oise and Clermont-en-Beauvais were annexed during his last years. On the southern limits of the \u00cele-de-France Philip rounded out prior possessions in G\u00e2tinais and Berry. Much of Auvergne, whose suzerainty had been ceded by Henry II in 1189, passed to royal control in 1214, while in the more distant south Philip extended his influence by gaining lordship over Tournon, Cahors, Gourdon, and Montlaur in Vivarais. As the reign ended, only Brittany, Flanders, Champagne, Burgundy, and Toulouse, among principalities later annexed, lay outside the royal domain. At the end of Philip\u2019s reign, rising concern about the heretical stance of the Albigenses set the stage for the Albigensian Crusade and later conquest of southern lands.\n\nBecause the territorial expansion was accomplished through traditional means\u2014dynastic, feudal, and military\u2014the curial administration was, outwardly, little changed. Household officers such as the butler and the constable continued to function as in the past. But Philip Augustus was even more suspicious of the seneschalship and chancellorship than his father had been; he allowed both offices to fall vacant early in his reign, entrusting their operations to lesser nobles or to clerics of the entourage. Although their activity is obscure, some of these men were beginning to specialize in justice or finance. The curia as such, however, remained undifferentiated; characteristically, the committee of regents, appointed in 1190 to hold three courts yearly while the king was absent on Crusade, was expected to concern itself with both justice and the administration of the kingdom on those occasions. Prelates and nobles of the curia also served as counselors; enlarged councils convened, at the king\u2019s summons, on festivals or when major political or military issues were contemplated.\n\nPhilip Augustus acted vigorously to improve the efficiency of his lordship. He was, indeed, practically the founder of royal administration in France. His chancery began to keep better records of royal activities. Documents were copied into registers before being sent out, and lists of churches, vassals, and towns were drawn up to inform the king of his military and fiscal rights. These lists replaced others lost on the battlefield of Fr\u00e9teval (1194), a disaster that may have hastened the adoption of a new form of fiscal accountancy. One may draw this conclusion because it is unlikely that the Capetians had previously troubled to record the balances of revenues and expenses in the form first revealed by a record of the year 1202. Its central audit was connected with other efforts to improve control of the domains dominated directly by the king. From early in his reign Philip appointed members of his court to hold periodic local sessions, to collect extraordinary revenues, to lead military contingents, and to supervise the provosts. The new officers, called bailiffs (baillis), at first had no determined districts in which to serve (they resembled the circuit commissioners of Angevin government, whose office may have been the model for the Capetian institution). From the outset the bailiffs were paid salaries; they were more reliable than the provosts, who by the later 12th century generally farmed the revenues. In the newly acquired lands of the west and south, Philip and his successors instituted seneschals\u2014functionaries similar to the bailiffs but with recognized territorial jurisdiction from the start.\n\nPhilip Augustus\u2019s policy toward his conquered domains was shrewd. He retained the deep-rooted customs and administrative institutions of such flourishing provinces as Anjou and Normandy; indeed, the superior fiscal procedures of Normandy soon exercised perceptible influence on Capetian accounting elsewhere. On the other hand, to secure the loyal operation of provincial institutions, Philip appointed men of his own court, typically natives of the \u00cele-de-France. It was a compromise that was to work well for generations to come.\n\nThe character of Philip\u2019s rule may likewise be deduced from his relations with the main classes of the population. A devoted son of the church, if not unswervingly faithful, he favoured the higher clergy in many of their interests. He opposed the infidels, heretics, and blasphemers; he supported the bishops of Laon, Beauvais, Sens, and Le Puy (among others) in their disputes with townspeople; and he granted and confirmed charters to monasteries and churches. Yet he was more insistent on his rights over the clergy than his predecessors had been. He required professions of fidelity and military service from bishops and abbots, summoned prelates to his court, and sought to limit the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts. He supported papal policies or submitted to papal directives only to the extent that these were consistent with his temporal interests. Cases in point were his reserved support of Crusades and his notorious rejection of Queen Ingeborg, whom he married, abandoned, and then, in response to the pope\u2019s censure, feigned to reconcile.\n\nToward the lay aristocracy, Philip Augustus acted energetically as suzerain and protector. Indeed, no Capetian was more fully the \u201cfeudal monarch.\u201d His war with John resulted from John\u2019s refusal to appear at court as a vassal of the French king to answer for his mistreatment of the count of La Marche. He regarded Flanders and Toulouse as well as Normandy as fiefs held by the crown. As with ecclesiastical vassals, Philip insisted upon the service due from fiefs, and he required his vassals to reserve their fealty for him alone. He extended his influence by entering into treaties (pariages) with minor lords, often distant ones; and, by confirming the acts of nobles in unprecedented numbers, he recovered the force of the royal guarantee.\n\nThe policy toward the lesser rural and urban populations was to increase their loyalty and contribution to the crown without significantly reducing their dependence on the king and other lords. Philip offered his protection to exploited villages, and, especially during his early years, he confirmed existing \u201cnew towns,\u201d extended their privileges to other villages, and otherwise favoured peasant communities. Townsmen, notably those in semiautonomous communes, gained confirmation of their charters; and the king created some new communes. Most of the latter were located in strategic proximity to the northern frontiers of the expanded royal domain; this fact, together with the obligations of service and payment specified in the charters, suggests that military motives were paramount in these foundations. More generally evident in these charters, as in others, was the desire to gain the political fidelity of a prospering class. At Paris Philip Augustus acted as did no other local lord to promote the civic interest, improving sanitation, paving streets, and building a new wall. Parisian burghers financed and administered these projects; they were associated in the fiscal supervision of the realm when the king went on Crusade, but they were not favoured with a communal charter."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Philip-II-Augustus-king-of-France/6000000000425008069", "page_content": "About Philip II Augustus, king of France\n\nPHILIP II OF FRANCE\n\nFrom Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France\n\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Auguste\n\nAnd in French: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_II_de_France\n\nhttps://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filips_II_van_Frankrijk (in Dutch)\n\nPhilip II Augustus (French: Philippe Auguste) (21 August 1165 \u2013 14 July 1223) was the King of France from 1180 until his death. A member of the House of Capet, Philip Augustus was born at Gonesse in the Val-d'Oise, the son of Louis VII and his third wife, Adela of Champagne. He was originally nicknamed Dieudonn\u00e9 \u2014 the God-given \u2014 as he was the first son of Louis VII late in his father's life.\n\nPhilip was one of the most successful medieval French monarchs in expanding the royal demesne and the influence of the monarchy. He broke up the great Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. He reorganized the government, bringing financial stability to the country and thus making possible a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class.\n\nIn declining health, Louis VII had him crowned and anointed at Rheims by the Archbishop William Whitehands on 1 November 1179. He was married on 28 April 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut, who brought the County of Artois as her dowry. His father died on 18 September.\n\nWhile the royal demesne had increased under Philip I and Louis VI, under Louis VII it had diminished slightly. In April 1182, Philip expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods.\n\nPhilip's eldest son, Louis, was born on 5 September 1187 and inherited Artois in 1190, when Isabelle, his mother, died.\n\nIn 1181, Philip began a war with the Count of Flanders, Philip of Alsace. Philip managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Henry I, Duke of Brabant, and Philip of Heinsberg, Archbishop of Cologne. In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves confirmed to the king the possession of the Vermandois, Artois, and Ami\u00e9nois.\n\nIn 1184, Stephen I of Sancerre and his Braban\u00e7on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00e9anais. Philip defeated him with the aid of the Confr\u00e8res de la Paix.\n\nPhilip also began to war with the Henry II of England, who was also Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine in France. Two years of combat (1186\u20131188) followed, but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons, Richard and John, who were in rebellion against their father. However, news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin, followed quickly by the death of Henry, diverted attention from the Franco-English war.\n\nPhilip was close friends with all of Henry's sons and he used them to foment rebellion against their father, but turned against both Richard and John after their respective accessions to the throne. With Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany he maintained friendship until their deaths. Indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave.\n\nIn May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor John. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of the boundaries of the duchy and the terms of John's vassalage for it and Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. John agreed to heavy terms, but Philip in turn recognised John as king, formally abandoning Arthur I of Brittany, whom he had thitherto supported, and recognised John's suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. To seal the treaty, a marriage between Blanche of Castile, John's niece, and Louis the Lion, Philip's son, was contracted.\n\nThis did not stop the war, however. In 1202, disaffected barons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges and, when the English king refused, Philip dispossessed him of his French lands. Within two years, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of Aquitaine, had been conquered. The war, called the \"War of Bouvines,\" continued for the next decade until Philip won a decisive victory at Bouvines (1214) over a coalition of forces that included the Emperor Otto IV and Ferdinand, Count of Flanders.\n\nPhilip went on the Third Crusade with Richard I of England (1189\u201399) and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa (1189\u20131192). His army left V\u00e9zelay on July 1, 1190. At first the French and English crusaders traveled together, but the armies split at Lyons, as King Richard I decided to go by sea, and Philip took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On March 30, 1191 the French set sail for the Holy Land, where they launched several assaults on Acre before King Richard I arrived. By the time Acre surrendered on July 12, Philip was severely ill with dysentery and had little more interest in further crusading. He decided to return to France, a decision that displeased King Richard I, who said, \"It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done.\" So on July 31, 1191 the French army of 10,000 men (along with 5,000 silver marks to pay the soldiers) remained in Outremer under the command of Hugh III, duke of Burgundy. Philip and his cousin Peter of Courtenay, count of Nevers, made their way to Genoa and from there returned to France. This decision to return was also fuelled by the realization that with Richard campaigning in the Holy Land, English possessions in northern France (Normandy) would be open for attack. After Richard's delayed return home after the Third Crusade, war between England and France would ensue over possession of English-controlled territories in modern-day France.\n\nAfter Isabelle's early death in childbirth, in 1190, Philip decided to marry again. On August 15, 1193 he married Ingeborg (1175\u20131236), daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark (1157\u201382). She was renamed Isambour, and Stephan of Dornik described her as \"very kind, young of age but old of wisdom.\" For some unknown reason, Philip was repelled by her, and he refused to allow her to be crowned Queen. Ingeborg protested at this treatment; his response was to confine her to a convent. He then asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful Queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of Paris intervened on the side of Ingeborg, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity.\n\nIn the meantime Philip had sought a new bride. Initially agreement had been reached for him to marry Marguerite, daughter of William I, Count of Geneva, but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas I of Savoy, who kidnapped Philip's intended new queen and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage Philip finally achieved a third marriage, on May 7, 1196, to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia (c. 1180 \u2013 July 29, 1201). Their children were:\n\nMarie (1198 \u2013 October 15, 1224) Philippe Hurepel (1200\u20131234), Count of Clermont and eventually, by marriage, Count of Boulogne Pope Innocent III (1198\u20131216) declared Philip #Augustus's marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, as he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the King to part from Agn\u00e8s; when he did not, the Pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until September 7, 1200. Due to pressure from the Pope and from Ingeborg's brother, King Valdemar II of Denmark (1202\u201341), Philip finally took Ingeborg back as his Queen in 1213.\n\nUnderstandably, he turned a deaf ear when the Pope asked him to do something about the heretics in the Languedoc. When Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians or Cathars, in 1208, Philip did nothing to support it, but neither did he hinder it. The war against the Cathars [in which more than a million people were killed] did not end until 1244, when finally their last strongholds were captured. The fruits of it, namely the submission of the south of France to the crown, were to be reaped by Philip's son, Louis VIII, and grandson, Louis IX.\n\nPhilip II Augustus would play a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and in education. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, constructed the Louvre as a fortress and gave a charter to the University of Paris in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world had known. In 1224, the French poet Henry d'Andeli wrote of the great wine tasting competition that Philip II Augustus commissioned The Battle of the Wines.\n\nPhilip II Augustus died July 14, 1223 at Mantes and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. Philip's son by Isabelle de Hainaut, Louis VIII, was his successor.\n\nPhilip is a character in James Goldman's historical play The Lion in Winter. The play maintains the historical theory that he and Richard the Lionhearted had previously had a homosexual relationship In the 1968 film of The Lion in Winter, which downplayed the homosexual aspect present in the stage play, Philip was played by Timothy Dalton. Jonathan Rhys Meyers played Philip in a 2003 television version which somewhat resurrected the matter.\n\nKing Philippe II AUGUSTE de France was born on AUG 21 1165 in Gonesse, Kingdom of France. He was a King of France from SEP 18 1180 to JUL 14 1223. From father King Louis VII's death. His reign was characterized by a gigantic advance of the French monarchy. Before his time the King of France reigned only over the Ile de France and Berri, and had no communication with the sea. To this patrimony Philip II added Artois, Amienois, Valois, Vernandois, a large portion of Beauvaisis, Normandy, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and a part of Poitou and Saintonge. His bailiffs and seneschals established the royal power firmly in those countries. Paris became a fortified city and attracted to its university students from different countries. Thanks to the possession of Dieppe, Rouen, and certain parts of Saintonge, the French monarchy became a maritime and commercial power, and Philip invited foreign merchants to France. Flanders, Ponthieu, and Auvergne became subject fiefs, supervised by agents of the king. He exercised a sort of protectorate over Champagne and Burgundy. Brittany was in the hands of Pierre de Dreux, a Capetian of the younger branch. \"History\", writes M. Luchaire, \"does not present so many, such rapid, and such complete changes in the fortune of a State\". Philip Augustus did not interfere in episcopal elections. In Normandy, where the Plantagenets had assumed the custom of directly nominating the bishops, he did not follow their example. Guillaume Le Breton, in his poem the \"Philippide\", makes him say: \"I leave to the men of God the things that pertain to the service of God.\" He favoured the emancipation of communes, desiring to be liked by the middle classes of the districts he annexed. He often exacted a tax in exchange for the communal charter. But he did not allow the communes to infringe on the property of clerics or the episcopal right of jurisdiction. At Noyen he intervened formally in behalf of the bishop, who was threatened by the commune. He undertook a campaign in defence of the bishops and abbots against certain feudal lords whom he himself desired to humiliate or weaken. In 1180, before he was king, he undertook an expedition into Berri to punish the Lord of Charenton, the enemy of the monks, and into Burgundy where the Count of Chalon and the Lord of Beaujeu were persecuting the Church. In 1186, on the complaint of the monks, he took possession of Chatillon-sur-Seine, in the Duchy of Burgundy, and forced the duke to repair the wrongs he had committed against the Church. In 1210 he sent troops to protect the Bishop of Clermont, who was threatened by the Count of Auvergne. But on the other hand, in virtue of the preponderance which he wished royalty to have over feudalism, he exacted of the bishops and abbots the performance of all their feudal duties, including military service; although for certain territories he was the vassal of the bishops of Picardy, he refused to pay them homage. Moreover, he declared with regard to Manasses, bishop of Orl\u00e9ans, that the royal court was entitled to judge at the trials of bishops, and he made common cause with lay feudalism in the endless discussions regarding the province of ecclesiastical tribunals, which at the beginning of the thirteenth century were disposed to extend their jurisdiction. An ordinance issued about 1205 at the instance of the king, executed in Normandy and perhaps elsewhere, stipulated that in certain cases lay judges might arrest and try guilty clerics, that the right of asylum of religious buildings should be limited, that the Church might not excommunicate those who did business on Sunday or held intercourse with Jews, and that a citizen having several children should not give more than half of his estate to that one of his sons who was a cleric. Finally he imposed on the clergy heavy financial exactions. He was the first king who endeavoured to compel clerics to pay the king a tenth of their income. In 1188 the archdeacon Peter of Blois defeated this claim, but in 1215 and 1218 Philip renewed it, and by degrees the resistance of the clergy gave way. Philip, however, was pious in his own way, and in the advice which St. Louis gave to his son he said that Philip, because of \"God's goodness and mercy would rather lose his throne than dispute with the servants of Holy Church\". Thus the reputation left by Philip II was quite different from that of Philip IV, or Frederick II of Germany. He never carried out towards the Church a policy of trickery or petty vexations, on the contrary he regarded it as his collaborator in the foundation of French unity. He died on JUL 14 1223 in Mantes, Kingdom of France. (643) He has Ancestral File number 94480798. Was saved from a serious illness after a pilgrimage made by his father to the tomb of Thomas \u00e0 Becket. His strife with Henry II of England in concert with the sons of that monarch, Henry, Richard, and John, resulted in 1189 in the Treaty of Azay-sur-Cher, which enhanced the royal power in the centre of France. The struggle with the Plantagenets was the ruling idea of Philip II's whole policy. Richard Coeur de Lion having become King of England, 6 July 1189, was at first on amicable terms with Philip. Together they undertook the Third Crusade, but quarreled in Palestine, and on his return Philip II accused Richard of having attempted to poison him. As Richard had supported in Sicily the claims of Tancred of Lecce against those of the Emperor Henry VI, the latter resolved to be avenged. Richard, having been taken captive on his return from the Crusade by the Duke of Austria, was delivered to Henry VI, who held him prisoner. Philip II sent William, Archbishop of Reims, to Henry VI to request that Richard should remain the captive of Germany or that he should be delivered to Philip as his prisoner. Without loss of time Philip reached an agreement with John Lackland, Richard's brother. Normandy was delivered up by a secret treaty and John acknowledged himself Philip's vassal. But, when in February 1194, Richard was set free by Henry VI, John Lackland became reconciled with him and endless conflict followed between Richard and Philip. On 13 January 1199, Pope Innocent III imposed on them a truce of five years. Shortly after this Richard died. Subsequently Philip defended against John, Richard's successor, the claims of the young Arthur of Brittany, and then those of Hugh de Lusignan, Count of La Marche, whose betrothed had been abducted by John. The war between Philip and John, interrupted by the truces imposed by the papal legates, became a national war; and in 1206 John lost his possessions in central France. Philip was sometimes displeased with the pontifical intervention between France and the Plantagenets, but the prestige of Innocent III forced him to accept it. Protracted difficulties took place between him and the pope owing to the tenacity with which Innocent III compelled respect for the indissolubility of even royal marriages. Another question which at first caused discord between Philip II and Innocent III, and regarding which they had later a common policy, was the question of Germany. Otto of Brunswick, who was Innocent III's candidate for the dignity of emperor, was the nephew of Richard and John Lackland. This was sufficient to cause Philip to interfere in favour of Philip of Suabia. They formed an alliance in June, 1198, and when Philip of Suabia was assassinated in 1208 Philip put forward the candidacy of Henry of Brabant. However, the whole of Germany rallied to Otto of Brunswick, who became emperor as Otto IV, and in 1209 Philip feared that the new emperor would invade France. But Otto IV quarrelled with Innocent III and was excommunicated and the pope by an unexpected move called upon Philip for subsidies and troops to aid him against Otto. They agreed to proclaim as emperor Frederick of Hohenstaufen, the future Frederick II, Philip giving Frederick 20,000 \"marcs\" to defray the cost of his election (November 1212). Thus was inaugurated the policy by which France meddled in the affairs of Germany and for the first time the French king claimed, like the pope, to have a voice in the imperial election. The accord established between Innocent and Philip with regard to the affairs of Germany subsequently extended to those of England. Throughout his reign Philip dreamed of a landing in England. As early as 1209 he had negotiated with the English barons who were hostile to John Lackland, and in 1212 with the Irish and the Welsh. When John lackland subjected to cruel persecution the English bishops who, in spite of him, recognized Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury. Innocent III in 1212 placed England under interdict, and the legate, Pandulphus, declared that John Lackland had forfeited his throne. Then Philip, who received at his court all the exiles from England, consented to go to England in the name of Innocent III to take away the crown from John Lackland. It was to be given to his son, the future Louis VIII. On 22 May, 1213, the French expedition was to embark at Gravelines, when it was learned that John Lackland had become reconciled with Rome, and some months later he became a vassal of the pope. Thus failed, on the eve of its realization, the project of the French invasion of England. But the legate of Innocent III induced Philip to punish Ferrand, Count of Flanders, who was the ally of all the enemies of the king. At the battle of Bouvines (27 July 1214) Ferrand, who supported Otto IV, was taken prisoner. This battle is regarded as the first French national victory. Philip II, asserting that he had on both sides two great and terrible lions, Otto and John, excused himself from taking part in the Crusade against the Albigenses. He permitted his son Louis to make two expeditions into Languedoc to support Simon de Montfort in 1215, and Amaury de Montfort in 1219, and again in 1222 he sent Amaury de Montfort two hundred knights and ten thousand foot soldiers under the Archbishop of Bourges and the Count of La Marche. He foresaw that the French monarchy would profit by the defeat of the Albigenses. Parents: King Louis VII CAPET de France, the Young and Ad\u00e8le DE BLOIS de Champagne.\n\nHe was married to Queen Isabelle de Hainaut in 1180 in The Kingdom of France. (64) His marriage with her, the niece of the Count of Flanders, the conflicts which he afterwards sustained against the latter, and the deaths of the Countess (1182) and Count of Flanders (1185), increased the royal power in the north of France. He married her in order to inherit Artois. Children were: King Louis CAPET VIII le Lion.\n\nHe was married to Queen Ingeburga in 1193. (248) She was the sister of Canute VI, King of Denmark. As he immediately desired to repudiate her, an assembly of complaisant barons and bishops pronounced the divorce, but Ingeburga appealed to Rome. Even after the death of his wife Agnes, Philip persisted that Rome should pronounce his divorce from Ingeburga, whom he held prisoner at Etampes. Rome refused and Philip dismissed the papal legate (1209). In 1210 he thought of marrying a princess of Thuringia, and in 1212 renewed his importunities for the divorce with the legate, Robert de Cour\u00e7on. Then, in 1213, having need of the aid of the pope and the King of Denmark, he suddenly restored Ingeburga to her station as queen.\n\nHe was married to Queen Agn\u00e8s D'ANDECHS de M\u00e9ranie in JUN 1196 in The Kingdom of France.(243) He married her despite the remonstrances of Pope Celestine III, and having imprisoned Ingeburga. She was the daughter of a Bavarian nobleman. Pope Innocent III, recently elected, called upon him to repudiate Agnes and take back Ingeburga, and on the king's refusal the legate, Peter of Capua, placed the kingdom under an interdict (1198). Most of the bishops refused to publish the sentence. The Bishops of Paris and Senlis, who published it, were punished by having their goods confiscated. At the end of nine months Philip appeared to yield; he feigned reconciliation with Ingeburga, first before the legate, Octavian, and then before the Council of Soissons (May 1201), but he did not dismiss Agnes de M\u00e9ran. She died in August 1201, and Innocent III consented to legitimize the two children she had borne the king. Children were: Marie DE FRANCE , Count Philip AUGUSTE of Boulogne.\n\ninfo taken from:\n\nhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~chatweb/d38.htm#P...\n\nPhilip II (Augustus)\n\nKing of France, born 22 or 25 August, 1165; died at Mantes, 14 July, 1223, son of Louis VII and Alix de Champagne.\n\nHe was saved from a serious illness after a pilgrimage made by his father to the tomb of Thomas \u00e0 Becket; he succeeded to the throne 18 September, 1180.

He foresaw that the French monarchy would profit by the defeat of the Albigenses.\n\nPhilip's reign was characterized by a gigantic advance of the French monarchy. Before his time the King of France reigned only over the Ile de France and Berri, and had no communication with the sea. To this patrimony Philip II added Artois, Amienois, Valois, Vernandois, a large portion of Beauvaisis, Normandy, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and a part of Poitou and Saintonge. His bailiffs and seneschals established the royal power firmly in those countries. Paris became a fortified city and attracted to its university students from different countries. Thanks to the possession of Dieppe, Rouen, and certain parts of Saintonge, the French monarchy became a maritime and commercial power, and Philip invited foreign merchants to France. Flanders, Ponthieu, and Auvergne became subject fiefs, supervised by agents of the king. He exercised a sort of protectorate over Champagne and Burgundy. Brittany was in the hands of Pierre de Dreux, a Capetian of the younger branch. \"History\", writes M. Luchaire, \"does not present so many, such rapid, and such complete changes in the fortune of a State\".\n\nPhilip Augustus did not interfere in episcopal elections. In Normandy, where the Plantagenets had assumed the custom of directly nominating the bishops, he did not follow their example. Guillaume Le Breton, in his poem the \"Philippide\", makes him say: \"I leave to the men of God the things that pertain to the service of God.\" He favoured the emancipation of communes, desiring to be liked by the middle classes of the districts he annexed. He often exacted a tax in exchange for the communal charter. But he did not allow the communes to infringe on the property of clerics or the episcopal right of jurisdiction. At Noyen he intervened formally in behalf of the bishop, who was threatened by the commune. He undertook a campaign in defence of the bishops and abbots against certain feudal lords whom he himself desired to humiliate or weaken. In 1180, before he was king, he undertook an expedition into Berri to punish the Lord of Charenton, the enemy of the monks, and into Burgundy where the Count of Chalon and the Lord of Beaujeu were persecuting the Church. In 1186, on the complaint of the monks, he took possession of Chatillon-sur-Seine, in the Duchy of Burgundy, and forced the duke to repair the wrongs he had committed against the Church. In 1210 he sent troops to protect the Bishop of Clermont, who was threatened by the Count of Auvergne.\n\nBut on the other hand, in virtue of the preponderance which he wished royalty to have over feudalism, he exacted of the bishops and abbots the performance of all their feudal duties, including military service; although for certain territories he was the vassal of the bishops of Picardy, he refused to pay them homage.

Finally he imposed on the clergy heavy financial exactions. He was the first king who endeavoured to compel clerics to pay the king a tenth of their income. In 1188 the archdeacon Peter of Blois defeated this claim, but in 1215 and 1218 Philip renewed it, and by degrees the resistance of the clergy gave way. Philip, however, was pious in his own way, and in the advice which St. Louis gave to his son he said that Philip, because of \"God's goodness and mercy would rather lose his throne than dispute with the servants of Holy Church\". Thus the reputation left by Philip II was quite different from that of Philip IV, or Frederick II of Germany. He never carried out towards the Church a policy of trickery or petty vexations, on the contrary he regarded it as his collaborator in the foundation of French unity.\n\nPhilip II of France\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nPhilip II Augustus (French: Philippe Auguste) (21 August 1165 \u2013 14 July 1223) was the King of France from 1180 until his death. A member of the House of Capet, Philip Augustus was born at Gonesse in the Val-d'Oise, the son of Louis VII and his third wife, Adela of Champagne. He was originally nicknamed Dieudonn\u00e9 \u2014 the God-given \u2014 as he was the first son of Louis VII late in his father's life.\n\nPhilip was one of the most successful medieval French monarchs in expanding the royal demesne and the influence of the monarchy. He broke up the great Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. He reorganized the government, bringing financial stability to the country and thus making possible a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class.\n\nEarly years\n\nIn declining health, Louis VII had him crowned and anointed at Rheims by the Archbishop William Whitehands on 1 November 1179. He was married on 28 April 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut, who brought the County of Artois as her dowry. His father died on 18 September.\n\nConsolidation of royal demesne\n\nWhile the royal demesne had increased under Philip I and Louis VI, under Louis VII it had diminished slightly. In April 1182, Philip expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods.\n\nPhilip's eldest son, Louis, was born on 5 September 1187 and inherited Artois in 1190, when Isabelle, his mother, died.\n\nWars with his vassals\n\nIn 1181, Philip began a war with the Count of Flanders, Philip of Alsace. Philip managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Henry I, Duke of Brabant, and Philip of Heinsberg, Archbishop of Cologne. In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves confirmed to the king the possession of the Vermandois, Artois, and Ami\u00e9nois.\n\nIn 1184, Stephen I of Sancerre and his Braban\u00e7on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00e9anais. Philip defeated him with the aid of the Confr\u00e8res de la Paix.\n\nWar with Henry II\n\nPhilip also began to war with the Henry II of England, who was also Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine in France. Two years of combat (1186\u20131188) followed, but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons, Richard and John, who were in rebellion against their father. However, news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin, followed quickly by the death of Henry, diverted attention from the Franco-English war.\n\nPhilip was close friends with all of Henry's sons and he used them to foment rebellion against their father, but turned against both Richard and John after their respective accessions to the throne. With Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany he maintained friendship until their deaths. Indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave.\n\nWar with John Lackland\n\nIn May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor John. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of the boundaries of the duchy and the terms of John's vassalage for it and Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. John agreed to heavy terms, but Philip in turn recognised John as king, formally abandoning Arthur I of Brittany, whom he had thitherto supported, and recognised John's suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. To seal the treaty, a marriage between Blanche of Castile, John's niece, and Louis the Lion, Philip's son, was contracted.\n\nThis did not stop the war, however. In 1202, disaffected barons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges and, when the English king refused, Philip dispossessed him of his French lands. Within two years, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of Aquitaine, had been conquered. The war, called the \"War of Bouvines,\" continued for the next decade until Philip won a decisive victory at Bouvines (1214) over a coalition of forces that included the Emperor Otto IV and Ferdinand, Count of Flanders.\n\nThird Crusade\n\nPhilip went on the Third Crusade with Richard I of England (1189\u201399) and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa (1189\u20131192). His army left V\u00e9zelay on July 1, 1190. At first the French and English crusaders traveled together, but the armies split at Lyons, as King Richard I decided to go by sea, and Philip took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On March 30, 1191 the French set sail for the Holy Land, where they launched several assaults on Acre before King Richard I arrived (see Siege of Acre). By the time Acre surrendered on July 12, Philip was severely ill with dysentery and had little more interest in further crusading. He decided to return to France, a decision that displeased King Richard I, who said, \"It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done.\" So on July 31, 1191 the French army of 10,000 men (along with 5,000 silver marks to pay the soldiers) remained in Outremer under the command of Hugh III, duke of Burgundy. Philip and his cousin Peter of Courtenay, count of Nevers, made their way to Genoa and from there returned to France. This decision to return was also fuelled by the realization that with Richard campaigning in the Holy Land, English possessions in northern France (Normandy) would be open for attack. After Richard's delayed return home after the Third Crusade, war between England and France would ensue over possession of English-controlled territories in modern-day France.\n\nMarital problems\n\nAfter Isabelle's early death in childbirth, in 1190, Philip decided to marry again. On August 15, 1193 he married Ingeborg (1175\u20131236), daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark (1157\u201382). She was renamed Isambour, and Stephan of Dornik described her as \"very kind, young of age but old of wisdom.\" For some unknown reason, Philip was repelled by her, and he refused to allow her to be crowned Queen. Ingeborg protested at this treatment; his response was to confine her to a convent. He then asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful Queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of Paris intervened on the side of Ingeborg, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity.\n\nIn the meantime Philip had sought a new bride. Initially agreement had been reached for him to marry Marguerite, daughter of William I, Count of Geneva, but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas I of Savoy, who kidnapped Philip's intended new queen and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage. Philip finally achieved a third marriage, on May 7, 1196, to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia (c. 1180 \u2013 July 29, 1201). Their children were:\n\nMarie (1198 \u2013 October 15, 1224)\n\nPhilippe Hurepel (1200\u20131234), Count of Clermont and eventually, by marriage, Count of Boulogne\n\nPope Innocent III (1198\u20131216) declared Philip Augustus's marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, as he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the King to part from Agn\u00e8s; when he did not, the Pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until September 7, 1200. Due to pressure from the Pope and from Ingeborg's brother, King Valdemar II of Denmark (1202\u201341), Philip finally took Ingeborg back as his Queen in 1213.\n\nLast years\n\nUnderstandably, he turned a deaf ear when the Pope asked him to do something about the heretics in the Languedoc. When Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians or Cathars, in 1208, Philip did nothing to support it, but neither did he hinder it. The war against the Cathars did not end until 1244, when finally their last strongholds were captured. The fruits of it, namely the submission of the south of France to the crown, were to be reaped by Philip's son, Louis VIII, and grandson, Louis IX.\n\nPhilip II Augustus would play a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and in education. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, constructed the Louvre as a fortress and gave a charter to the University of Paris in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world had known. In 1224, the French poet Henry d'Andeli wrote of the great wine tasting competition that Philip II Augustus commissioned The Battle of the Wines.\n\nPhilip II Augustus died July 14, 1223 at Mantes and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. Philip's son by Isabelle de Hainaut, Louis VIII, was his successor.\n\nPortrayal in fiction\n\nPhilip is a character in James Goldman's historical play The Lion in Winter. The play maintains the historical theory that he and Richard the Lionhearted had previously had a homosexual relationship. In the 1968 film of The Lion in Winter, which downplayed the homosexual aspect present in the stage play, Philip was played by Timothy Dalton. Jonathan Rhys Meyers played Philip in a 2003 television version which somewhat resurrected the matter.\n\nSources\n\nPayne, Robert. The Dream and the Tomb. 1984.\n\nBaldwin, John W.

He broke up the great Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals (German, Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. He reorganized the government, bringing financial stability to the country and thus making possible a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class.\n\nIn declining health, Louis VII had him crowned and anointed at Rheims by the Archbishop William Whitehands on 1 November 1179. He was married on 28 April 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut, who brought the County of Artois as her dowry. His father died on 20 September.\n\nWhile the royal demesne had increased under Philip I and Louis VI, under Louis VII it had diminished slightly. In April 1182, Philip expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods.\n\nPhilip's eldest son, Louis, was born on 5 September 1187 and inherited Artois in 1190, when Isabelle, his mother, died.\n\nIn 1181, Philip began a war with the Count of Flanders, Philip of Alsace. Philip managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Henry I, Duke of Brabant, and Philip of Heinsberg, Archbishop of Cologne. In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves confirmed to the king the possession of the Vermandois, Artois, and Ami\u00e9nois.\n\nIn 1184, Stephen I of Sancerre and his Braban\u00e7on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00e9anais. Philip defeated him with the aid of the Confr\u00e8res de la Paix.\n\nPhilip also began to war with the Henry II of England, who was also Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine in France. Two years of combat (1186\u20131188) followed, but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons, Richard and John, who were in rebellion against their father. However, news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin, followed quickly by the death of Henry, diverted attention from the Franco-English war.\n\nPhilip was close friends with all of Henry's sons and he used them to foment rebellion against their father, but turned against both Richard and John after their respective accessions to the throne. With Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany he maintained friendship until their deaths. Indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave.\n\nIn May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor John. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of the boundaries of the duchy and the terms of John's vassalage for it and Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. John agreed to heavy terms, but Philip in turn recognised John as king, formally abandoning Arthur I of Brittany, whom he had thitherto supported, and recognised John's suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. To seal the treaty, a marriage between Blanche of Castile, John's niece, and Louis the Lion, Philip's son, was contracted.\n\nThis did not stop the war, however. In 1202, disaffected patrons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges and, when the English king refused, Philip dispossessed him of his French lands. Within two years, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of Aquitaine, had been conquered. The war, called the \"War of Bouvines,\" continued for the next decade until Philip won a decisive victory at Bouvines (1214) over a coalition of forces that included the Emperor Otto IV and Ferdinand, Count of Flanders.\n\nPhilip went on the Third Crusade (1189\u20131192) with Richard I of England (1189\u201399) and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa (1155\u201390). His army left V\u00e9zelay on July 1, 1190. At first the French and English crusaders traveled together, but the armies split at Lyons, as Richard decided to go by sea, and Philip took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On March 30, 1191 the French set sail for the Holy Land and Philip arrived on May 20. He then marched up to Acre which was already besieged by a lesser contingent of crusaders and started to construct large siege equipments before Richard arrived in June 8 (see Siege of Acre). By the time Acre surrendered on July 12, Philip was severely ill with dysentery which reduced his crusading zeal. Ties with Richard were further strained after the latter acted in a haughty manner after Acre had fallen. More importantly, the siege resulted in the death of Philip of Alsace, who held the county of Vermandois proper; an event that threatened to derail the Treaty of Gisors which Philip had orchestrated to isolate the powerful Blois-Champagne faction. Philip decided to return to France to settle the issue of succession in Flanders, a decision that displeased Richard, who said, \"It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done.\" So on July 31, 1191 the French army of 10,000 men (along with 5,000 silver marks to pay the soldiers) remained in Outremer under the command of Hugh III, duke of Burgundy. Philip and his cousin Peter of Courtenay, count of Nevers, made their way to Genoa and from there returned to France. This decision to return was also fuelled by the realization that with Richard campaigning in the Holy Land, English possessions in northern France (Normandy) would be open for attack. After Richard's delayed return home after the Third Crusade, war between England and France would ensue over possession of English-controlled territories in modern-day France.\n\nAfter Isabelle's early death in childbirth, in 1190, Philip decided to marry again. On August 15, 1193 he married Ingeborg (1175\u20131236), daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark (1157\u201382). She was renamed Isambour, and Stephan of Dornik described her as \"very kind, young of age but old of wisdom.\" For some unknown reason, Philip was repelled by her, and he refused to allow her to be crowned Queen. Ingeborg protested at this treatment; his response was to confine her to a convent. He then asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful Queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of Paris intervened on the side of Ingeborg, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity.\n\nIn the meantime Philip had sought a new bride. Initially agreement had been reached for him to marry Marguerite of Geneva, daughter of William I, Count of Geneva, but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas I of Savoy, who kidnapped Philip's intended new queen and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage. Philip finally achieved a third marriage, on May 7, 1196, to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia (c. 1180 \u2013 July 29, 1201).\n\nPope Innocent III (1198\u20131216) declared Philip Augustus's marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, as he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the King to part from Agn\u00e8s; when he did not, the Pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until September 7, 1200. Due to pressure from the Pope and from Ingeborg's brother, King Valdemar II of Denmark (1202\u201341), Philip finally took Ingeborg back as his Queen in 1213.\n\nUnderstandably, he turned a deaf ear when the Pope asked him to do something about the heretics in the Languedoc. When Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians or Cathars, in 1208, Philip did nothing to support it, but neither did he hinder it. The war against the Cathars did not end until 1244, when finally their last strongholds were captured. The fruits of it, namely the submission of the south of France to the crown, were to be reaped by Philip's son, Louis VIII, and grandson, Louis IX.\n\nPhilip II Augustus would play a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and in education. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, constructed the Louvre as a fortress and gave a charter to the University of Paris in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world had known. In 1224, the French poet Henry d'Andeli wrote of the great wine tasting competition that Philip II Augustus commissioned The Battle of the Wines.\n\nPhilip II Augustus died July 14, 1223 at Mantes and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. Philip's son by Isabelle de Hainaut, Louis VIII, was his successor.\n\nPhilip II Augustus (French: Philippe Auguste; 21 August 1165 \u2013 14 July 1223) was the King of France from 1180 until his death. A member of the House of Capet, Philip Augustus was born at Gonesse in the Val-d'Oise, the son of Louis VII and his third wife, Adela of Champagne. He was originally nicknamed Dieudonn\u00e9\u2014the God-given\u2014as he was the first son of Louis VII late in his father's life.\n\nPhilip was one of the most successful medieval French monarchs in expanding the royal demesne and the influence of the monarchy. He broke up the great Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals (German, Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. He reorganized the government, bringing financial stability to the country and thus making possible a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class.\n\nContents\n\n[hide]\n\n* 1 Early years\n\no 1.1 Consolidation of royal demesne\n\no 1.2 Wars with his vassals\n\no 1.3 War with Henry II\n\n* 2 Third Crusade\n\n* 3 Conflict with England, Flanders and the Holy Roman Empire\n\no 3.1 Conflict with King Richard 1192-1199\n\no 3.2 Conflict with King John 1200-1206\n\no 3.3 Alliances against Philip 1208-1213\n\no 3.4 War of Bouvines 1213-1214\n\n* 4 Marital problems\n\n* 5 Last years\n\n* 6 Portrayal in fiction\n\n* 7 Ancestry\n\n* 8 References\n\n* 9 Notes\n\n[edit] Early years\n\nIsabelle, Philip's first wife.\n\nPhilip, born in Gonesse on August 21, 1165, was surnamed Augustus in honor of the month he was born.[1] As soon as he was able, Louis planned to associate Philip with him on the throne, but it was delayed when Philip, at the age of thirteen, was separated from his companions during a royal hunt and became lost in the Forest of Compiegne. He spent much of the following night attempting to find his way out, but to no avail. Exhausted by cold, hunger and fatigue, he was eventually discovered by a peasant carrying a charcoal burner, but his exposure to the elements meant he soon succumbed to a dangerously high fever.[2] His father went on pilgrimage to the Shrine of Thomas Becket to pray for Philip\u2019s recovery, and was told that his son had indeed recovered. However, on his way back to Paris, he suffered a stroke.\n\nIn declining health, Louis VII had him crowned and anointed at Rheims by the Archbishop William Whitehands on 1st of November in 1179. He was married on 28 April 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut, who brought the County of Artois as her dowry. From his inauguration, all real power was transferred to Philip, as his father slowly descended into senility.[2] The great nobles were discontented with Philip\u2019s advantageous marriage, while his mother and four uncles, all of whom exercised enormous influence over Louis, were extremely unhappy with his association to the throne, causing a diminishment in their power.[3] Eventually, Louis died on 18 September 1180.\n\n[edit] Consolidation of royal demesne\n\nWhile the royal demesne had increased under Philip I and Louis VI, under Louis VII it had diminished slightly. In April 1182, Philip expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods.\n\nPhilip's eldest son, Louis, was born on the 5th of September in 1187 and inherited Artois in 1190, when Isabelle, his mother, died.\n\nRemains of the wall of Philippe Auguste built around Paris before going to the Crusades. Today in rue des Jardins-Saint-Paul, Paris\n\n[edit] Wars with his vassals\n\nIn 1181, Philip began a war with Philip of Alsace, Count of Flanders over the Vermandois, which King Philip claimed as his Queen\u2019s dowry, which the Count was unwilling to give up. Finally the Count of Flanders invaded France, ravaging the whole district between the Somme and the Oise, before penetrating as far as Dammartin.[4] Notified of Philip\u2019s impending approach, he turned around and headed back to Flanders. Philip chased him, and the two armies confronted each other near Amiens. By this stage, Philip had managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Henry I, Duke of Brabant, and Philip of Heinsberg, Archbishop of Cologne. This together with an uncertain outcome were he to engage the French in battle forced the Count to conclude a peace.[4] In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves left the disputed territory partitioned, with Ami\u00e9nois, Artois and numerous other places passing to the King and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace.[5]\n\nMeanwhile in 1184, Stephen I of Sancerre and his Braban\u00e7on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00e9anais. Philip defeated him with the aid of the Confr\u00e8res de la Paix.\n\n[edit] War with Henry II\n\nPhilip also began to wage war with Henry II of England, who was also Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine in France. The death of Henry\u2019s eldest son, Henry the Young King in June of 1183 began a dispute over the dower of the widowed Margaret, who was Philip\u2019s sister, who insisted that it should be returned to France as the marriage did not produce any children, as per the betrothal agreement.[6] The two kings would hold conferences at the foot of an elm tree near Gisors, which was so positioned that it would overshadow each monarch\u2019s territory, but to no avail. Philip pushed the case further when King B\u00e9la III of Hungary asked for the widow\u2019s hand in marriage, and thus her dowry had to be returned, to which Henry finally agreed.\n\nThe death of Henry\u2019s fourth son, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany in 1186 the began a new round of disputes, as Henry insisted that he retain the guardianship of the duchy for his unborn grandson Arthur I, Duke of Brittany.[6] Philip, as Henry\u2019s liege lord, objected, stating that he should be the rightful guardian until the birth of the child. Philip then raised the issue of his other sister, Alys, Countess of the Vexin, and her delayed betrothal to Richard the Lionheart.\n\nWith these grievances, two years of combat (1186\u20131188) followed, but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons, Richard the Lionheart and John Lackland, who were in rebellion against their father. Philip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois.[5] Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188.[5]\n\nThen in 1189 Richard openly joined forces with Philip to drive Henry into abject submission. They chased him from Le Mans to Saumur, losing Tours in the process,[6] before forcing him to acknowledge Richard as his heir. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne.[5] Henry died two days later. His death, and the news of the of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin, diverted attention from the Franco-English war.\n\nPhilip was close friends with all of Henry's sons and he used them to foment rebellion against their father, but turned against both Richard and John after their respective accessions to the throne. With Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany he maintained friendship until their deaths. Indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave.\n\nPhilip (right) and Richard accepting the keys to Acre; from the Grandes Chroniques de France.\n\n[edit] Third Crusade\n\nPhilip went on the Third Crusade (1189 \u2013 1192) with Richard I of England and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa. His army left V\u00e9zelay on 1 July 1190. At first the French and English crusaders traveled together, but the armies split at Lyon, as Richard decided to go by sea, and Philip took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On 30 March 1191 the French set sail for the Holy Land and Philip arrived on 20 May. He then marched up to Acre which was already besieged by a lesser contingent of crusaders and started to construct large siege equipments before Richard arrived in 8 June (see Siege of Acre). By the time Acre surrendered on 12 July, Philip was severely ill with dysentery which reduced his crusading zeal. Ties with Richard were further strained after the latter acted in a haughty manner after Acre had fallen.\n\nPtolemais (Acre) given to Philip Augustus 1191\n\nMore importantly, the siege resulted in the death of Philip of Alsace, who held the county of Vermandois proper; an event that threatened to derail the Treaty of Gisors which Philip had orchestrated to isolate the powerful Blois-Champagne faction. Philip decided to return to France to settle the issue of succession in Flanders, a decision that displeased Richard, who said, \"It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done.\" So on 31 July 1191 the French army of 10,000 men (along with 5,000 silver marks to pay the soldiers) remained in Outremer under the command of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy. Philip and his cousin Peter of Courtenay, count of Nevers, made their way to Genoa and from there returned to France. This decision to return was also fuelled by the realization that with Richard campaigning in the Holy Land, English possessions in northern France (Normandy) would be open for attack. After Richard's delayed return home after the Third Crusade, war between England and France would ensue over possession of English-controlled territories in modern-day France.\n\n[edit] Conflict with England, Flanders and the Holy Roman Empire\n\n[edit] Conflict with King Richard 1192-1199\n\nThe immediate cause of the conflict with Richard stemmed from Richard\u2019s decision to break his betrothal with Philip\u2019s sister Alice at Messina in 1191.[7] Part of Alice\u2019s dowry that had been given over to Richard during their engagement was the territory of the Vexin which included the strategic fortress of Gisors. This should have reverted to Philip upon the end of the betrothal, but Philip, to prevent the collapse of the Crusade, agreed that this territory was to remain in Richard\u2019s hands, and would be inherited by his male descendents. Should Richard die without an heir, the territory would return to Philip, and if Philip died without an heir, those lands would be considered a part of Normandy.[7]\n\nReturning to France in late 1191, he began plotting to find a way to have those territories restored to him. He was in a difficult situation, as he had taken an oath to Richard not to attack his lands while he was away,[8] and as Richard was still on Crusade, his territory was under the protection of the Church in any event. He had unsuccessfully asked Pope Celestine III to release him from his oath,[9] and so Philip was forced to build a causus belli from scratch.\n\nOn January 20, 1192, Philip met with William of FitzRalph, Richard\u2019s seneschal of Normandy. Presenting some documents purporting to be from Richard, Philip claimed that Richard had agreed at Messina to hand back the disputed lands to Philip. Not having heard anything directly from their sovereign, FitzRalph and the Norman barons rejected Philip\u2019s claim to the Vexin.[7] Philip at this time also began spreading rumors about Richard\u2019s action in the east to discredit the English king in the eyes of his subjects. Among the stories Philip invented included Richard was involved in treacherous communication with Saladin, that he had conspired to cause the fall of Gaza, Jaffa and Ashkelon, and that he had participated in the murder of Conrad of Montferrat.[9] Finally, Philip made contact with Prince John, Richard\u2019s brother, whom he convinced to join him and overthrow his brother.[9]\n\nAt the start of 1193, John paid a visit to Philip in Paris where he paid homage for Richard\u2019s French lands. When word reached Philip that Richard had finished crusading and had been captured on his way back from Holy Land, he promptly invaded the Vexin. His first target was the fortress of Gisors, commanded by Gilbert de Vascoeuil, which surrendered without putting up a struggle.[10] Philip then penetrated deep into Normandy, reaching as far as Dieppe. To keep the duplicitous John on side, Philip entrusted the defense of the town of Evreux over to him.[11] Meanwhile, Philip was joined by Count Baldwin of Flanders, and together they laid siege to the ducal capital of Normandy, Rouen. Here, Philip\u2019s advance was halted by a defense led by Earl Robert of Leicester.[10] Unable to penetrate their defenses, Philip moved on.\n\nAt Mantes on July 9, 1193, Philip came to terms with Richard\u2019s ministers who agreed that Philip could keep his gains and would be given some extra territories if he ceased all further aggressive actions in Normandy, along with the condition that Philip would hand back the captured territory if Richard would pay homage to Philip.[10] To prevent Richard from spoiling their plans, Philip and John attempted to bribe the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI to keep the English king captive for a little while longer. He refused, and Richard was released from captivity on February 4, 1194. By March 13, Richard had returned to England, and by May 12, he had set sail for Normandy with some 300 ships, eager to take the war to Philip.[10]\n\nPhilip had spent this time consolidating his territorial gains, and by now was controlling much of Normandy east of the Seine, and remaining within striking distance of Rouen. His next objective was the castle of Verneuil,[12], which had withstood an earlier siege. Once Richard arrived had at Barfleur, he was soon marching towards Verneuil. As his forces neared the castle, Philip, who had been unable to break through, decided to strike camp. Leaving a large force behind to prosecute the siege, he moved off towards Evreux, which Prince John had handed over to his brother to prove his loyalty.[12] Philip retook the town and sacked it, but during this time, his forces besieging Verneuil abandoned the siege, and Richard entered the castle unopposed on May 30. Throughout June, while Philip\u2019s campaign ground to a halt in the north, Richard was taking a number of important fortresses to the south. Philip, eager to relieve the pressure off his allies in the south, marched to confront Richard\u2019s forces at Vend\u00f4me. Refusing to risk everything in a major battle, Philip retreated, only to have his rear guard caught at Fr\u00e9teval on July 4, which turned into a general encounter during which Philip only managed to avoid capture, as his army was put to flight.[12] Fleeing back to Normandy, Philip revenged himself on the English by attacking the forces of Prince John and the Earl of Arundel, seizing their baggage train.[12] By now both sides were tiring, and they agreed to the temporary Truce of Tilli\u00e8res.\n\nWar continued in 1195 with Philip once again besieging Verneuil. Richard arrived to discuss the situation face to face. During negotiations, Philip secretly continued his operations against Verneuil, and when Richard discovered it, he left, swearing revenge.[12] Philip now pressed his advantage in northeastern Normandy, where he conducted a raid at Dieppe, during which he burnt the English ships in the harbor, repulsing an attack by Richard at the same time. Philip now marched southward into the Berry region, and his primary objective was the fortress of Issoudun, which had just been captured by Richard\u2019s mercenary commander, Mercadier. The French king took the town and was besieging the castle when Richard stormed through French lines and made his way in to reinforce the garrison, while at the same time another army was approaching Philip\u2019s supply lines. Philip called off his attack, and another truce was agreed to.[12]\n\nThe war slowly turned against Philip over the course of the next three years. Though things looked promising at the start of 1196 when Arthur of Brittany ended up in Philip\u2019s hands, and he won the Siege of Aumale, it would not last. Richard won over a key ally, Baldwin of Flanders in 1197. Then in 1198, Henry the Holy Roman Emperor died, and his successor was to be Otto IV, Richard\u2019s nephew, who in turn put additional pressure on Philip.[13] Finally, many Norman lords were switching sides, and returning to Richard\u2019s camp. This was the state of affairs when Philip launched his 1198 campaign with an attack on the Vexin. He was pushed back before then having to deal with the Flemish invasion of Artois.\n\nOn September 27, Richard entered the Vexin, taking Courcelles-Chaussy and Boury-en-Vexin before returning to Dangu. Philip, believing that Courcelles-Chaussy was still holding out, went to its relief. Discovering what was happening, Richard decided to attack the French king\u2019s forces, catching Philip by surprise.[13] Philip\u2019s forces fled and attempted to reach the fortress of Gisors. Bunched together, the French knights and Philip attempted to cross the Epte River on a bridge that promptly collapsed under their weight, almost drowning Philip in the process. He was dragged out of the river and shut himself up in Gisors.[13]\n\nPhilip soon began a new offensive, launching raids into Normandy and again targeting Evreux. Richard countered Philip\u2019s offensive with a counterattack in the Vexin, while Mercadier led a raid on Abbeville. The upshot was that by the fall of 1198, Richard had regained almost all that had been lost in 1193.[13] Philip, now in desperate circumstances, offered a truce so that discussions could begin towards a more permanent peace, with the offer that he would return all of the territories except for Gisors.\n\nIn mid-January 1199, the two kings met for a final meeting, Richard, standing on the deck of a boat, Philip, standing on the banks of the Seine River.[14] Shouting terms at each other, they could not reach agreement on the terms of a permanent truce, but did agree to further mediation, which resulted in a five year truce. The truce held and later that year, Richard was killed during a siege involving one of Richard\u2019s vassals.\n\n[edit] Conflict with King John 1200-1206\n\nIn May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor king John of England, as youngest son of Henry called the Lackland, now also Duke of Normandy. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of the boundaries of the much reduced duchy and the terms of John's vassalage for it and Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. John agreed to heavy terms, including the abandonment of all the English possession in Berry and 20,000 Marks of Silver, but Philip in turn recognised John as king, formally abandoning Arthur I of Brittany, whom he had thitherto supported, and recognised John's suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. To seal the treaty, a marriage between Blanche of Castile, John's niece, and Louis the Lion, Philip's son, was contracted.\n\nMap of Philip's conquests\n\nThis did not stop the war, however. John\u2019s mismanagement of Aquitaine saw that province erupt in rebellion later that year, which Philip secretly encouraged.[15] To disguise his ambitions, he invited John to a conference at Andely, and then entertained him at Paris, and both times he committed to complying with the Treaty.[15] Then in 1202, disaffected patrons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges in his capacity as John\u2019s feudal lord, and, when the English king refused to appear, Philip again took up the claims of Arthur, to whom he betrothed his six-year-old daughter, Marie. John crossed over into Normandy and his forces soon captured Arthur, and in 1203, the young man disappeared, with most people believing that John had Arthur murdered.\n\nThe outcry over Arthur\u2019s fate saw an increase in local opposition to John which Philip used to his advantage.[15] He took the offensive and, apart from a five month siege of Andely, he swept all before him. On the fall of Andely, John fled to England, and by the end of 1204, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of Aquitaine had fallen into Philip\u2019s hands.[15]\n\nWhat Philip had gained through victory in war, he then sought to confirm by legal means. Philip, again acting as John\u2019s liege lord, summoned his vassal to appear before the Court of the Twelve Peers of France, to answer for the murder of Arthur of Brittany.[16] John\u2019s request for safe conduct only saw Philip agree to allow him to come in peace, but that his return would only occur if it were allowed after the judgment of his peers. Not willing to risk his life on such a guarantee, he refused to appear, so Philip summarily dispossessed him of his French lands.[16] Pushed by his barons, John eventually launched an invasion in 1206, disembarking with his army at La Rochelle during one of Philip\u2019s absences, but the campaign was a disaster.[16] After backing out of a conference that he himself had demanded, John eventually bargained at Thouars for a two year truce, the price of which was his agreement to the chief provisions of the judgment of the Court of Peers, including the loss of his patrimony.[16]\n\n[edit] Alliances against Philip 1208-1213\n\nIn 1208, Philip of Swabia, the successful candidate for becoming the next emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was assassinated, meaning that the imperial crown was given to his rival, Otto IV, the nephew of King John. Otto, prior to his accession, had promised to help John to recover his lost European possessions, but circumstances prevented them from making good their claims.[17] By 1212, both John and Otto were engaged in power struggles against Pope Innocent III, John over his refusal to accept the papal nomination for the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Otto over his attempt to strip Frederick II of his Sicilian crown. Philip decided to take advantage of this situation, firstly in Germany where he supported the rebellion of the German nobility in support of the young Frederick.[17] John immediately threw his support behind Otto, and Philip now saw his chance to launch a successful invasion of England.\n\nIn order to secure the cooperation of all his vassals in his plans for the invasion, Philip denounced John as an enemy of the Church, thereby justifying his attack against him as being solely for religious reasons. He summoned an assembly of French barons at Soissons, which was well attended with the exception of Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. He refused to attend, still angry over the loss of the towns of Aire and Saint-Omer which had been captured by Philip\u2019s son, Louis the Lion, and he would not participate in any campaign until they had been restored to him.[17]\n\nIn the meantime, Philip, eager to prove his loyalty to Rome and thus secure Papal support for his planned invasion, announced at Soissons his reconciliation with his estranged wife Ingeborg of Denmark which the Popes had been pushing.[17] The Barons fully supported his plan, and they all gathered their forces and prepared to join with Philip at the agreed rendezvous. In all this, Philip remained in constant communication with Pandolfo, the Papal Legate, who was encouraging Philip to pursue his objective. Pandolfo however was also holding secret discussions with King John. Advising the English king of his precarious predicament, he persuaded John to abandon his opposition to Papal investiture and agreed to accept the Papal Legate\u2019s decision in any ecclesiastical disputes as final.[18] In return, the Pope agreed to accept the Kingdom of England and the Lordship of Ireland as Papal fiefs, which John would rule as the Pope\u2019s vassal, and for which John would do homage to the Pope.[18]\n\nNo sooner had the treaty been ratified in May 1213 than Pandolfo announced to Philip that he would have to abandon his expedition against John, since to attack a faithful vassal of the Holy See would constitute a mortal sin. In vain did Philip argue that his plans had been drawn up with the consent of Rome, that his expedition was in support of papal authority which he only undertook on the understanding that he would gain a Plenary Indulgence, or that he had spent a fortune preparing for the expedition. The Papal Legate remained unmoved.[18] But Pandolfo did suggest an alternative. The Count of Flanders had denied Philip\u2019s right to declare war on England while King John was still excommunicated, and that his disobedience needed to be punished.[18] Philip eagerly accepted the advice, and quickly marched at the head of his troops into the territory of Flanders.\n\n[edit] War of Bouvines 1213-1214\n\nThe French fleet, reportedly numbering some 1,700 ships[19] proceeded first to Gravelines and then to the port of Dam. Meanwhile the army marched by Cassel, Ypres and Bruges, before laying siege to Ghent.[19] Hardly had the siege begun when Philip learned that the English fleet had captured a number of his ships at Dam, and that the rest were so closely blockaded in its harbor, that it was impossible for them to escape. After having obtained 30,000 Marks as a ransom for the hostages he had taken from the Flemish cities he had captured, Philip quickly retraced his steps in order to reach Dam. It took him two days, and he arrived in time to relieve the French garrison.[19] But he discovered that he could not rescue his fleet, and in order to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, he ordered it to be burnt before also commanding that the town of Dam also be burned to the ground. Determined to make the Flemish pay for his retreat, every district he passed through he ordered that all towns be razed and burned, and that the peasantry were either killed or sold as slaves.[19]\n\nBut the destruction of the French fleet had once again raised John\u2019s hopes up, and so he began preparing for an invasion of France and a reconquest of his lost provinces. Initially his barons were unenthusiastic about the expedition, which delayed his departure, and so it was not until February 1214 that he was able to disembark at La Rochelle.[19] John was to advance from the Loire (river), while his ally Otto IV made a simultaneous attack from Flanders, together with the Count of Flanders. Unfortunately, the three armies could not coordinate their efforts effectively. It was not until John, who had been disappointed in his hope for an easy victory after being driven from Roche-au-Moine and had retreated to his transports that the Imperial Army, with Otto at its head, assembled in the Low Countries.[19]\n\nOn July 27, 1214, the opposing armies suddenly discovered they were in close proximity to each other, on the banks of a little tributary of the River Lys, near the Bridge of Bouvines. Philip\u2019s army numbered some 15,000, while the allied forces possessed around 25,000 troops, and the armies clashed at the Battle of Bouvines. It was a tight battle; Philip was unhorsed by the Flemish pikemen in the heat of battle, and were it not for his plate mail armour in which he was encased, he would probably have been killed.[20] When Otto was carried off the field by his wounded and terrified horse,[20] and Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, severely wounded, was captured by the French, the Flemish and Imperial troops saw that the battle was lost, turned and fled from the battlefield. The French troop began pursuing them but with night approaching, and with the prisoners they already had being too many and, more importantly, too valuable to risk in a risky pursuit, Philip ordered a recall before his troops had moved little more than a mile from the battlefield.[20] Philip returned to Paris triumphant, marching his captive prisoners behind him in a long procession, as his grateful subjects came out to greet the victorious king. In the aftermath of the battle, Otto retreated to his castle of Harzburg and was soon overthrown as Holy Roman Emperor, and replaced by Frederick II. Count Ferdinand remained imprisoned following his defeat, while King John obtained a five year truce, on very lenient terms given the circumstances.[20]\n\nPhilip\u2019s decisive victory was crucial in ordering Western European politics in both England and France. In the former, so weakened was the defeated King John of England that he soon needed to submit to his barons demands and sign the Magna Carta, limiting the power of the crown and establishing the basis for common law. In the latter, the battle was instrumental in forming the strong central monarchy that would characterize France until the first French Revolution. It was also the first battle in the Middle Ages in which the full value of infantry was realised.[20]\n\n[edit] Marital problems\n\nAfter Isabelle's early death in childbirth, in 1190, Philip decided to marry again. On the 15th of August in 1193 he married Ingeborg (1175\u20131236), daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark (1157\u201382). She was renamed Isambour, and Stephan of Dornik described her as \"very kind, young of age but old of wisdom.\" For some unknown reason, Philip was repelled by her, and he refused to allow her to be crowned Queen. Ingeborg protested at this treatment; his response was to confine her to a convent. He then asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful Queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of Paris intervened on the side of Ingeborg, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity.\n\nIn the meantime Philip had sought a new bride. Initially agreement had been reached for him to marry Margaret of Geneva, daughter of William I, Count of Geneva, but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas I of Savoy, who kidnapped Philip's intended new queen and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage. Philip finally achieved a third marriage, on the 7th of May in 1196, to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia (c. 1180 \u2013 29th of July in 1201). Their children were Marie (1198 \u2013 15th of October in 1224) and Philippe Hurepel (1200\u20131234), Count of Clermont and eventually, by marriage, Count of Boulogne.\n\nPope Innocent III (1198\u20131216) declared Philip Augustus's marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, as he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the King to part from Agn\u00e8s; when he did not, the Pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until the 7th of September in 1200. Due to pressure from the Pope and from Ingeborg's brother, King Valdemar II of Denmark (1202\u201341), Philip finally took Ingeborg back as his Queen in 1213.\n\nPhilip II, King of France, in a non-contemporary portrait\n\n[edit] Last years\n\nUnderstandably, he turned a deaf ear when the Pope asked him to do something about the heretics in the Languedoc. When Pope Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians or Cathars, in 1208, Philip did nothing to support it, but neither did he hinder it. The war against the Cathars did not end until 1244, when finally their last strongholds were captured. The fruits of it, namely the submission of the south of France to the crown, were to be reaped by Philip's son, Louis VIII, and grandson, Louis IX. From 1216 to 1222 Philip also arbitrated in the War of Succession in Champagne and finally helped the military efforts of Eudes III, Duke of Burgundy and Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor to bring it to an end.\n\nPhilip II Augustus would play a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and in education. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, constructed the Louvre as a fortress and gave a charter to the University of Paris in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world had known. In 1224, the French poet Henry d'Andeli wrote of the great wine tasting competition that Philip II Augustus commissioned The Battle of the Wines.\n\nPhilip II Augustus died 14 July 1223 at Mantes-la-Jolie, and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. Philip's son by Isabelle de Hainaut, Louis VIII, was his successor.\n\n[edit] Portrayal in fiction\n\nKing Philip appears in William Shakespeare's historical play King John. He is also a character in James Goldman's historical play The Lion in Winter, which maintains the historical theory that he and Richard the Lionhearted had previously had a homosexual relationship. In the 1968 film of Goldman's play, which downplayed the homosexual aspect present in the stage play, Philip was played by Timothy Dalton. Jonathan Rhys Meyers played Philip in a 2003 television version which somewhat resurrected the matter.\n\n[edit] Ancestry\n\n[show]\n\nv \u2022 d \u2022 e\n\nAncestors of Philip II of France\n\n16.

A member of the House of Capet, Philip Augustus was born at Gonesse in the Val-d'Oise, the son of Louis VII and his third wife, Adela of Champagne. He was originally nicknamed Dieudonn\u00e9 \u2014 the God-given \u2014 as he was the first son of Louis VII late in his father's life.\n\nPhilip was one of the most successful medieval French monarchs in expanding the royal demesne and the influence of the monarchy. He broke up the great Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals (Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. He reorganized the government, bringing financial stability to the country and thus making possible a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class.In May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor John. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of the boundaries of the duchy and the terms of John's vassalage for it and Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. John agreed to heavy terms, but Philip in turn recognised John as king, formally abandoning Arthur I of Brittany, whom he had thitherto supported, and recognised John's suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. To seal the treaty, a marriage between Blanche of Castile, John's niece, and Louis the Lion, Philip's son, was contracted.\n\nThis did not stop the war, however. In 1202, disaffected patrons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges and, when the English king refused, Philip dispossessed him of his French lands. Within two years, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of Aquitaine, had been conquered. The war, called the \"War of Bouvines,\" continued for the next decade until Philip won a decisive victory at Bouvines (1214) over a coalition of forces that included the Emperor Otto IV and Ferdinand, Count of Flanders.\n\nPhilip II Augustus (French: Philippe Auguste; b. in Gonesse 21 August 1165 \u2013 14 July 1223 in Mantes-la-Jolie) was the King of France from 1180 until his death.

His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class.\n\nEarly years\n\nIn declining health, Louis VII had him crowned and anointed at Rheims by the Archbishop William Whitehands on 1 November 1179. He was married on 28 April 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut, who brought the County of Artois as her dowry. His father died on 20 September.\n\n[edit]Consolidation of royal demesne\n\nWhile the royal demesne had increased under Philip I and Louis VI, under Louis VII it had diminished slightly. In April 1182, Philip expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods.\n\nPhilip's eldest son, Louis, was born on 5 September 1187 and inherited Artois in 1190, when Isabelle, his mother, died.\n\n[edit]Wars with his vassals\n\nIn 1181, Philip began a war with the Count of Flanders, Philip of Alsace. Philip managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Henry I, Duke of Brabant, and Philip of Heinsberg, Archbishop of Cologne. In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves confirmed to the king the possession of the Vermandois, Artois, and Ami\u00e9nois.\n\nIn 1184, Stephen I of Sancerre and his Braban\u00e7on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00e9anais. Philip defeated him with the aid of the Confr\u00e8res de la Paix.\n\n[edit]War with Henry II\n\nPhilip also began to war with the Henry II of England, who was also Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine in France. Two years of combat (1186\u20131188) followed, but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons, Richard and John, who were in rebellion against their father. However, news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin, followed quickly by the death of Henry, diverted attention from the Franco-English war.\n\nPhilip was close friends with all of Henry's sons and he used them to foment rebellion against their father, but turned against both Richard and John after their respective accessions to the throne. With Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany he maintained friendship until their deaths. Indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave.\n\n[edit]War with John Lackland\n\nIn May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor John. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of the boundaries of the duchy and the terms of John's vassalage for it and Anjou, Maine, and Touraine.

Paris, Aug. 21, 1165; d. Mantes. As king he first overcame attempts by the houses of Champagne and Flanders to control his policies, and then in the late 1180s blunted the greater threat posed by henry ii's Angevin Empire by inciting Henry's sons to rebellion. When the Angevin died in 1189, Philip's position was so secure that he willingly joined Richard I, the Lion Heart, in the Third crusade.\n\nHome again in 1191, Philip attacked Normandy soon after, hoping for gains during Richard's imprisonment in Austria. Richard's release led to reverses for Philip, but victory ensued after john's accession in 1199. Condemned by Philip for contumacy in 1202, John was easily driven from Normandy; the conquest of his other northern French lands quickly followed; and at Bouvines in 1214 Philip Augustus ensured his supremacy by defeating the forces of John, Otto IV, and Ferrand of Flanders.\n\nGovernmental reforms helped to consolidate these gains. Salaried bailiffs were appointed for local administration while the king's council became more competent and professional. The semi-feudalized great offices of the crown were suppressed, bourgeois support was gained, and attempts to introduce legislation and taxation were made. Philip emphasized his royal position by refusing to do homage to anyone, and his conscious distinction between his powers as a private and a public person led to more modern concepts of political authority.\n\nPhilip's relations with the Church were mixed, and his religious policy was often dictated by political considerations. He left the Holy Land purely to add to his domains, and refused innocent iii's appeals to head the Albigensian Crusade (see albigenses). Only an interdict forced him to renounce his third wife in favor of his second; and while his 1213 plan to depose John had been drawn up at Innocent's request, it took threats of excommunication to stop his invasion after John submitted to the pope. Marital problems aside, his personal life showed religious devotion, and he both encouraged the building of Notre Dame and in 1200 granted clerical status to the students of the University of Paris.\n\nBibliography: l delisle, Catalogue des actes de Philippe-Auguste (Paris 1856). h. f. delaborde, Recueil des actes de Philippe-Auguste (Paris 1916). a. luchaire, Les Premiers Cap\u00e9tiens, in Histoire de France, ed. e. lavisse, 9 v.

The motherless Philip and his three brothers saw little of their father, who, stricken by Isabella\u2019s death, threw himself into campaigning and administrative affairs. His troubled childhood and the series of blows he suffered explain in some measure the conflicting elements in his adult personality. In 1274 his father married Marie de Brabant, a beautiful and cultivated woman, and, with her arrival at court, intrigue began to flourish. In the same year, the two-year-old Joan, heiress of Champagne and Navarre, was welcomed as a refugee. Reared with the royal children, she would, when she was 12, become the bride of Philip the Fair.\n\nIn 1276 Philip\u2019s elder brother, Louis, died, and the shock of this event, which suddenly made Philip heir to the kingdom, was compounded by persistent rumours of poisoning and suspicions that Philip\u2019s stepmother intended to see Isabella\u2019s remaining sons destroyed. Vague allegations were circulated that Louis\u2019s death was linked with certain unspecified \u201cunnatural acts\u201d of his father. These rumours, never satisfactorily put to rest, together with the unexpected change in Philip\u2019s fortunes, apparently served to arouse in him feelings of insecurity and mistrust.\n\nConsequently, Philip turned elsewhere in search of a model for his own conduct. He found it in Louis IX, whose memory was increasingly venerated as the number of miracles attributed to him mounted. Reports of Louis\u2019s exacting standards of rulership and his saintly virtues were reinforced by the precepts of the religious advisers who surrounded the adolescent Philip. A more self-confident person might have been able to discriminate realistically among the sometimes artificially exaggerated stories and the utopian ideals. Philip, however, became convinced that it was his God-given duty to attain the lofty goals of his grandfather.\n\nBritannica Quiz Medieval History Quiz: Part Four\n\nWhen Philip was 16, he was knighted and married to Joan of Navarre. In 1285 he accompanied his father to the south on a campaign to install Philip\u2019s brother Charles on the throne of Aragon.

His marriage with Isabella of Hainault, niece of the Count of Flanders, the conflicts which he afterwards sustained against the latter, and the deaths of the Countess (1182) and Count of Flanders (1185), increased the royal power in the north of France. His strife with Henry II of England in concert with the sons of that monarch, Henry, Richard, and John, resulted in 1189 in the Treaty of Azay-sur-Cher, which enhanced the royal power in the centre of France. The struggle with the Plantagenets was the ruling idea of Philip II's whole policy. Richard C\u00e6ur de Lion having become King of England, 6 July, 1189, was at first on amicable terms with Philip. Together they undertook the Third Crusade, but quarreled in Palestine, and on his return Philip II accused Richard of having attempted to poison him. As Richard had supported in Sicily the claims of Tancred of Lecce against those of the Emperor Henry VI, the latter resolved to be avenged. Richard, having been taken captive on his return from the Crusade by the Duke of Austria, was delivered to Henry VI, who held him prisoner. Philip II sent William, Archbishop of Reims, to Henry VI to request that Richard should remain the captive of Germany or that he should be delivered to Philip as his prisoner. Without loss of time Philip reached an agreement with John Lackland, Richard's brother. Normandy was delivered up by a secret treaty and John acknowledged himself Philip's vassal. But, when in February, 1194, Richard was set free by Henry VI, John Lackland became reconciled with him and endless conflict followed between Richard and Philip. On 13 January, 1199, Innocent III imposed on them a truce of five years. Shortly after this Richard died. Subsequently Philip defended against John, Richard's successor, the claims of the young Arthur of Brittany, and then those of Hugh de Lusignan, Count of La Marche, whose betrothed had been abducted by John. The war between Philip and John, interrupted by the truces imposed by the papal legates, became a national war; and in 1206 John lost his possessions in central France. Philip was sometimes displeased with the pontifical intervention between France and the Plantagenets, but the prestige of Innocent III forced him to accept it. Protracted difficulties took place between him and the pope owing to the tenacity with which Innocent III compelled respect for the indissolubility of even royal marriages.\n\nIn 1190 Philip lost his wife, Isabella of Hainault, whom he had married in order to inherit Artois, and in 1193 he married Ingeburga, sister of Canute VI, King of Denmark. As he immediately desired to repudiate her, an assembly of complaisant barons and bishops pronounced the divorce, but Ingeburga appealed to Rome. Despite the remonstrances of Celestine III, Philip, having imprisoned Ingeburga, married Agnes de M\u00e9ran, daughter of a Bavarian nobleman. Innocent III, recently elected, called upon him to repudiate Agnes and take back Ingeburga, and on the king's refusal the legate, Peter of Capua, placed the kingdom under an interdict (1198). Most of the bishops refused to publish the sentence. The Bishops of Paris and Senlis, who published it, were punished by having their goods confiscated. At the end of nine months Philip appeared to yield; he feigned reconciliation with Ingeburga, first before the legate, Octavian, and then before the Council of Soissons (May, 1201), but he did not dismiss Agnes de M\u00e9ran. She died in August, 1201, and Innocent III consented to legitimize the two children she had borne the king, but Philip persisted that Rome should pronounce his divorce from Ingeburga, whom he held prisoner at Etampes. Rome refused and Philip dismissed the papal legate (1209). In 1210 he thought of marrying a princess of Thuringia, and in 1212 renewed his importunities for the divorce with the legate, Robert de Cour\u00e7on. Then, in 1213, having need of the aid of the pope and the King of Denmark, he suddenly restored Ingeburga to her station as queen.\n\nAnother question which at first caused discord between Philip II and Innocent III, and regarding which they had later a common policy, was the question of Germany. Otto of Brunswick, who was Innocent III's candidate for the dignity of emperor, was the nephew of Richard and John Lackland. This was sufficient to cause Philip to interfere in favour of Philip of Suabia. They formed an alliance in June, 1198, and when Philip of Suabia was assassinated in 1208 Philip put forward the candidacy of Henry of Brabant. However, the whole of Germany rallied to Otto of Brunswick, who became emperor as Otto IV, and in 1209 Philip feared that the new emperor would invade France. But Otto IV quarrelled with Innocent III and was excommunicated and the pope by an unexpected move called upon Philip for subsidies and troops to aid him against Otto. They agreed to proclaim as emperor Frederick of Hohenstaufen, the future Frederick II, Philip giving Frederick 20,000 \"marcs\" to defray the cost of his election (November, 1212). Thus was inaugurated the policy by which France meddled in the affairs of Germany and for the first time the French king claimed, like the pope, to have a voice in the imperial election.\n\nThe accord established between Innocent and Philip with regard to the affairs of Germany subsequently extended to those of England. Throughout his reign Philip dreamed of a landing in England. As early as 1209 he had negotiated with the English barons who were hostile to John Lackland, and in 1212 with the Irish and the Welsh. When John lackland subjected to cruel persecution the English bishops who, in spite of him, recognized Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury. Innocent III in 1212 placed England under interdict, and the legate, Pandulphus, declared that John Lackland had forfeited his throne. Then Philip, who received at his court all the exiles from England, consented to go to England in the name of Innocent III to take away the crown from John Lackland. It was to be given to his son, the future Louis VIII. On 22 May, 1213, the French expedition was to embark at Gravelines, when it was learned that John Lackland had become reconciled with Rome, and some months later he became a vassal of the pope. Thus failed, on the eve of its realization, the project of the French invasion of England. But the legate of Innocent III induced Philip to punish Ferrand, Count of Flanders, who was the ally of all the enemies of the king. At the battle of Bouvines (27 July, 1214) Ferrand, who supported Otto IV, was taken prisoner. This battle is regarded as the first French national victory. Philip II, asserting that he had on both sides two great and terrible lions, Otto and John, excused himself from taking part in the Crusade against the Albigenses. He permitted his son Louis to make two expeditions into Languedoc to support Simon de Montfort in 1215, and Amaury de Montfort in 1219, and again in 1222 he sent Amaury de Montfort two hundred knights and ten thousand foot soldiers under the Archbishop of Bourges and the Count of La Marche. He foresaw that the French monarchy would profit by the defeat of the Albigenses.\n\nPhilip's reign was characterized by a gigantic advance of the French monarchy. Before his time the King of France reigned only over the Ile de France and Berri, and had no communication with the sea. To this patrimony Philip II added Artois, Amienois, Valois, Vernandois, a large portion of Beauvaisis, Normandy, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and a part of Poitou and Saintonge. His bailiffs and seneschals established the royal power firmly in those countries. Paris became a fortified city and attracted to its university students from different countries. Thanks to the possession of Dieppe, Rouen, and certain parts of Saintonge, the French monarchy became a maritime and commercial power, and Philip invited foreign merchants to France. Flanders, Ponthieu, and Auvergne became subject fiefs, supervised by agents of the king. He exercised a sort of protectorate over Champagne and Burgundy. Brittany was in the hands of Pierre de Dreux, a Capetian of the younger branch. \"History\", writes M. Luchaire, \"does not present so many, such rapid, and such complete changes in the fortune of a State\".\n\nPhilip Augustus did not interfere in episcopal elections. In Normandy, where the Plantagenets had assumed the custom of directly nominating the bishops, he did not follow their example. Guillaume Le Breton, in his poem the \"Philippide\", makes him say: \"I leave to the men of God the things that pertain to the service of God.\" He favoured the emancipation of communes, desiring to be liked by the middle classes of the districts he annexed. He often exacted a tax in exchange for the communal charter. But he did not allow the communes to infringe on the property of clerics or the episcopal right of jurisdiction. At Noyen he intervened formally in behalf of the bishop, who was threatened by the commune. He undertook a campaign in defence of the bishops and abbots against certain feudal lords whom he himself desired to humiliate or weaken. In 1180, before he was king, he undertook an expedition into Berri to punish the Lord of Charenton, the enemy of the monks, and into Burgundy where the Count of Chalon and the Lord of Beaujeu were persecuting the Church. In 1186, on the complaint of the monks, he took possession of Chatillon-sur-Seine, in the Duchy of Burgundy, and forced the duke to repair the wrongs he had committed against the Church. In 1210 he sent troops to protect the Bishop of Clermont, who was threatened by the Count of Auvergne.\n\nBut on the other hand, in virtue of the preponderance which he wished royalty to have over feudalism, he exacted of the bishops and abbots the performance of all their feudal duties, including military service; although for certain territories he was the vassal of the bishops of Picardy, he refused to pay them homage. Moreover, he declared with regard to Manasses, bishop of Orl\u00e9ans, that the royal court was entitled to judge at the trials of bishops, and he made common cause with lay feudalism in the endless discussions regarding the province of ecclesiastical tribunals, which at the beginning of the thirteenth century were disposed to extend their jurisdiction. An ordinance issued about 1205 at the instance of the king, executed in Normandy and perhaps elsewhere, stipulated that in certain cases lay judges might arrest and try guilty clerics, that the right of asylum of religious buildings should be limited, that the Church might not excommunicate those who did business on Sunday or held intercourse with Jews, and that a citizen having several children should not give more than half of his estate to that one of his sons who was a cleric. Finally he imposed on the clergy heavy financial exactions. He was the first king who endeavoured to compel clerics to pay the king a tenth of their income. In 1188 the archdeacon Peter of Blois defeated this claim, but in 1215 and 1218 Philip renewed it, and by degrees the resistance of the clergy gave way. Philip, however, was pious in his own way, and in the advice which St. Louis gave to his son he said that Philip, because of \"God's goodness and mercy would rather lose his throne than dispute with the servants of Holy Church\". Thus the reputation left by Philip II was quite different from that of Philip IV, or Frederick II of Germany. He never carried out towards the Church a policy of trickery or petty vexations, on the contrary he regarded it as his collaborator in the foundation of French unity.\n\nBirth\n\nBirth: 21 AUG 1165 Gonesse, Val-d'Oise, Ile-de-France, France Christening: Paris, Seine, France\n\nMarriages and Children\n\nIsabella of Hainault\n\nIn 1190 Philip lost his wife, Isabella of Hainault, whom he had married in order to inherit Artois,\n\nIssue by Isabella of Hainaut [2]\n\nLouis (3 September 1187 \u2013 8 November 1226), King of France as Louis VIII (1223-1226); married Blanche of Castile and had issue.

July 14, 1223), was King of France from 1180 to 1223. A member of the Capetian dynasty, Philip Augustus was born on August 21, 1165 at Gonesse, Val-d'Oise, France, the son of Louis VII of France and his third wife, Ad\u00cble of Champagne. He was originally nicknamed Dieudonn\u00c8: God-given. Philip II was a younger half-brother of Marie, countess palatine of Champagne, Alix, countess of Blois, Marguerite, queen of Hungary and Alys, Countess of the Vexin. He was an older full brother of Agnes of France, Empress of Constantinople. In declining health, his father had him crowned at Rheims in 1179. He was married on April 28, 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut, who brought the County of Artois as her dowry. His father and co-ruler died on September 18, 1180. Philip's eldest son Louis (later King Louis VIII), was born on September 5, 1187 and became Count of Artois in 1190, when Isabelle, his mother, died. As King, Philip II would become one of the most successful in consolidating northern France into one royal domain, but he never had more than limited influence in southern France. He seized the territories of Maine, Touraine, Anjou, Brittany and all of Normandy from King John of England (1199?1216). His decisive victory at the Battle of Bouvines over King John and a coalition of forces that included Otto IV of Germany ended the immediate threat of challenges to this expansion (1214) and left Philip II Augustus as the most powerful monarch in all of Europe. He reorganized the government, bringing financial stability to the country and thus making possible a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people because he checked the power of the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class that his reign had created. His relationships with the sons of his rival Henry II of England were particularly notable - close friends with all of them, he used them to foment rebellion against their father, notably turning against both Richard and John after their respective accessions to their inheritance. With Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany he maintained friendship until their deaths - indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave. Contents [hide] 1 Early years 2 Third Crusade 3 Marital problems 4 Last years 5 Portrayal in fiction 6 Sources [edit] Early years In 1179, Louis VII, in the tradition of his forefathers going back to Hugh Capet, had his son Philip crowned king to assure his smooth succession. On 1 November, Guillaume aux Blanches Mains, Archbishop of Rheims, crowned and anointed the fourteen year-old prince in the cathedral there. His father died on 18 September of the next year. While the royal power had been increased under Philip I and Louis VI, under Louis VII it had diminished slightly. In April 1182, Philip expelled Jews from the Royal domain (the part of France controlled directly by the King rather than by a vassal) and confiscated their goods. In 1184, Stephen I of Sancerre and his Braban\u00c1on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00c8anais. Philip, aided by the Confr\u00cbres de la Paix, defeated him and established order. Since 1181, conflict had been ongoing with the count of Flanders, Philippe of Alsace. Philip managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Henry I, Duke of Brabant, and Philipp von Heinsberg, Archbishop of Cologne. In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves confirmed to the king the possession of the Vermandois, Artois, and Ami\u00c8nois. Philip also began to war with the King Henry of England who was also count of Anjou and duke of Aquitaine in France; two years of combat (1186-1188) followed, but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied and worked with the young sons of Henry, Richard and John, who were in rebellion against their father. The death of Henry and the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 diverted attention from the Franco-English war. [edit] Third Crusade Philip (right) and Richard accepting the keys to Acre.Philip went on the Third Crusade with Richard I of England (1189?99) and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa (1189?1192). His army left V\u00c8zelay on July 1, 1190. At first the French and English crusaders traveled together, but the armies split at Lyons, as King Richard I decided to go by sea, and Philip took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On March 30, 1191 the French set sail for the Holy Land, where they launched several assaults on Acre before King Richard I arrived (see Siege of Acre). By the time Acre surrendered on July 12, Philip was severely ill with dysentery and had little more interest in further crusading. He decided to return to France, a decision that displeased King Richard I, who said, \"It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done.\" So on July 31, 1191 the French army remained in Outremer under the command of Hugues III, duke of Burgundy. Philip and his cousin Peter of Courtenay, count of Nevers, made their way to Genoa and from there returned to France. [edit] Marital problems After Isabelle's early death in childbirth, in 1190, Philip decided to marry again. On August 15, 1193 he married Ingeborg (1175?1236), daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark (1157?82). She was renamed Isambour, and Stephan of Dornik described her as \"very kind, young of age but old of wisdom.\" For some unknown reason, Philip was repelled by her, and he refused to allow her to be crowned Queen. Ingeborg protested at this treatment; his response was to confine her to a convent. He then asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful Queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of Paris intervened on the side of Ingeborg, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity. Philip Augustus' seal, note the fleur de lis in his right hand.In the meantime Philip had sought a new bride. Initially agreement had been reached for him to marry Marguerite, daughter of William I, Count of Geneva, but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas I of Savoy, who kidnapped Philip's intended new queen and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage. Philip finally achieved a third marriage, on May 7, 1196, to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia (c. 1180 ? July 29, 1201). Their children were: Marie (1198 ? October 15, 1224) Philippe Hurepel (1200?1234), Count of Clermont and eventually, by marriage, Count of Boulogne Pope Innocent III (1198?1216) declared Philip Augustus's marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, since he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the King to part from Agn\u00cbs; when he did not, the Pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until September 7, 1200. Due to pressure from the Pope and from Ingeborg's brother, King Valdemar II of Denmark (1202?41), Philip finally took Ingeborg back as his Queen in 1213. [edit] Last years Understandably, he turned a deaf ear when the Pope asked him to do something about the heretics in the Languedoc. When Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians or Cathars, in 1208, Philip did nothing to support it, but neither did he hinder it. The war against the Cathars did not end until 1244, when finally their last strongholds were captured. The fruits of it, namely the submission of the south of France to the crown, were to be reaped by Philip's son, Louis VIII, and grandson, Louis IX. Philip II Augustus would play a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and in education. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, constructed the Louvre as a fortress and gave a charter to the University of Paris in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world had known. In 1224, the French poet Henry d'Andeli wrote of the great wine tasting competition that Philip II Augustus commissioned The Battle of the Wines. Philip II Augustus died July 14, 1223 at Mantes and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son by Isabelle of Hainaut, Louis VIII (1223?26). [edit] Portrayal in fiction Philip is a character in James Goldman's historical play The Lion in Winter. The play maintains the historical theory that he and Richard the Lionhearted had previously had a homosexual relationship. In the 1968 film of The Lion in Winter, which downplayed the homosexual aspect present in the stage play, Philip was played by Timothy Dalton. Jonathan Rhys Meyers played Philip in a 2003 television version. [edit] Sources Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Philip II of FrancePayne, Robert. The Dream and the Tomb, 1984 Baldwin, John W.

Instead, it existed under different names and empires, and it overlapped with other kingdoms throughout the Middle Ages. During this time, it was predominantly known as the \"Kingdom of the Franks.\" To get a clear picture of the History of the French Monarchy, it is important to establish a timeline of its most important rulers.\n\nClovis I\n\nAfter the collapse of the Roman Empire, Gaul, that is to say, ancient France, became divided into a mass of Frankish tribes warring dominance. Through battle and bloodshed, Clovis I united the lands of modern-day France, Belgium, and parts of Germany. He was born in 466 CE and began his rule of a small kingdom or tribe of Salian Franks at age 15 in 481. He founded what is known as the Merovingian Dynasty, named after his grandfather Merovech. His notable triumph came at the Battle of Soissons, where he ended the Western Roman influence outside Italy. From there, he was ruthless in pursuit of conquest. Through battle with enemies, assassinating his rivals, and aligning with the Catholic Church upon his baptism in 496, Clovis I became the first King of the Franks. The Merovingian Dynasty ruled the Franks until Charlemagne's father, Pepin I overthrew them in 741. Clovis I is seen as the first king of what would become France. His name, which would later translate into Louis, would be the namesake of 18 kings of France, including the Sun King, Louis XIV, and Louis XVI, who lost his crown in the French Revolution.\n\nClovis I\n\nGregory of Tours, a historian who lived in the 6th century, depicts Clovis I as a hero and noble Christian warrior who conquered the tribes of Gaul in the name of Christ. Historians today consider that to be more literary fiction than actual history, and his reputation amongst them is not as kind. John Julius Norwich in his, A History of France, goes as far as to call him a monster. Whether hero or monster, one thing is certain Clovis I was the first Frankish king, the first Monarch in French history. He would die in 511 CE, ending his reign.\n\nHugh Capet\n\nFive hundred years later, the focus is on Hugh Capet, born in 939, who ruled from 987 until his death in 996. The last 500 years since Clovis saw France go through many iterations after the fall of the Merovingian Dynasty as Charlemagne's descendants squabbled over most of Europe. The year 987 would bring the end of the Carolingian Empire with the death of Louis V, the Lazy. A decision was to be made after Louis's death: who would be made the new King of the Franks? The two contenders were Duke Charles of Lower Lorraine and Hugh Capet, great-grandson of Robert the Strong. Charles had a greater claim to the throne by blood, but ultimately, the crown would go to Hugh through an election process. The Archbishop of Rouen justifies the decision by saying:\n\n\"The throne is not acquired by hereditary right; he who is elected to it should be distinguished not merely by the nobility of his birth, but by the wisdom of his mind.\"\n\nHugh Capet\n\nThe choice the electors made proved to be a sound one. When he was elected to the Frankish throne, Hugh was not given an easy task; enemies who thought they deserved to be king surrounded him. In some areas of his kingdom, the local duke had more authority among the people, and a common language had yet to spread across France. The one powerful advantage Hugh had was the complete backing of the Catholic Church. Through their support, he was able to unite his kingdom and expand into much of what is now France. He would end the elective monarchy, adopting primogeniture succession, where everything goes to the eldest son. His heirs would rule until the end of monarchy in France under the banner of the Capetian Dynasty. This dynasty is arguably the greatest and most powerful in European history. Members of this dynasty would rule France for its entirety after Hugh, and some would spend time as rulers of Spain, Sicily, Portugal, Hungary, Naples, Poland, and many more. Eventually, in France, the Capetian Dynasty would break up into what is known as cadet branches. Cadet branches are the lines of the younger sons of the main dynasty. The most notable Capetian cadet branches are the House of Valois, which ruled over France from 1328-1529, and the House of Bourbon, which ruled from 1589 to 1792 and then again from 1815-1830.\n\nHugh worked his entire life to unite the Franks into one nation but ultimately left the job unfinished. His heirs who followed would succeed where he left off.\n\nPhillip II\n\nPhillip II was the first to formally take on the title \"King of France,\" leaving behind the former moniker the \"King of the Franks.\" A member of the Capetian Dynasty, Phillip II was the great-great-great-great grandson of Hugh Capet. Born in 1165, he became King of the Franks in 1180 but would shed that title, becoming King of France in 1190. He ruled until his death in 1223.

This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while the English King John was forced by his barons to assent to Magna Carta and deal with a rebellion against him aided by Philip's son Louis, the First Barons' War. The military actions surrounding the Albigensian Crusade helped prepare the expansion of France southward. Philip did not participate directly in these actions, but he allowed his vassals and knights to help carry them out.\n\nPhilip transformed France into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns free themselves from seigneurial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent bourgeoisie. He built a great wall around Paris (\"the Wall of Philip II Augustus\"), re-organized the French government, and brought financial stability to his country."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/french-history-biographies/philip-ii-france", "page_content": "Philip II\n\nPhilip II (1165-1223), sometimes called Philip Augustus, ruled France from 1180 to 1223. He made the Crown more powerful than any feudal lord, more than tripled the royal domain, and turned the balance of power between France and England in favor of France.\n\nBorn in Paris on Aug. 21, 1165, Philip became the seventh Capetian king of France in 1180, when his father, Louis VII, died. As he grew to manhood, he became distrustful, cynical, and crafty, but physically sickly and tense. He had a practical intelligence but was not particularly interested in study.\n\nWars with England\n\nPhilip inherited from his father the difficult problem of trying to defend the small royal domain centering on Paris and Orl\u00e9ans against the much more extensive holdings of Henry II of England. By inheritance, marriage, and war, Henry had acquired lands extending from Normandy on the English Channel through Maine, Anjou, and Aquitaine to the Pyrenees. Although young Philip faced seemingly hopeless odds, he exploited the jealousy of Henry's sons, and when Henry invested his favored youngest son, John, with all the King's Continental holdings except Normandy, John's older brother Richard became an ally of Philip and fought his aging father. In 1189 Henry was forced to recognize Richard as heir to all his lands and Philip as his feudal lord for his lands in France. Shortly afterward, Henry II died.\n\nThe power struggle had been interrupted by the preparations for the Third Crusade following the fall of Jerusalem in 1187. Now Philip reluctantly joined Frederick I (Frederick Barbarossa) and Richard I, who had become king of England on the death of Henry II. Philip and Richard went to the East together but soon began to quarrel. When the Anglo-French forces recaptured Acre, Philip felt that he had done enough crusading and returned to France to take advantage of Richard's absence in the East.\n\nRichard, unable to capture Jerusalem from Saladin, returned home through Austria but was taken prisoner there and held for ransom. He did not reach the West until May 1194, and in his absence Philip had joined forces with John to recover Normandy. The ensuing warfare between Philip and Richard ended when Richard was killed (1199) in a minor skirmish in central France and John became king of England.\n\nPhilip now became John's enemy and used feudal law to dispossess him of his Continental holdings. In 1202 he summoned John to his court to answer a charge made against him, but John refused to come, and Philip therefore declared John's holdings in France forfeit, occupying Normandy and all English lands north of the Loire River. With the occupation of Normandy, the Capetians now had access to the English Channel and deprived John of easy access to his Continental fiefs.\n\nRelationship with the Pope\n\nAlthough preoccupied with defending his kingdom against England, Philip was not unmindful of the opportunities for acquisitions in southern France. In 1207 Pope Innocent III invited Philip to lead a crusade there against the spread of heresy, but Philip declined to take part unless the Pope made John stop fighting in Poitou\u2014something Innocent III could not do. A decade later Philip was still avoiding direct participation in the crusade, but he did permit his son, Louis of France, to lead a French army into Toulouse.\n\nIn January 1213, John was excommunicated and deposed for his spoliation of the Church. His troubles with his own English barons encouraged Pope Innocent III to urge Philip to invade England, seize John, and put Louis of France, now married to a niece of John's, on the English throne. But when John turned over England to the Pope and received it back as a papal fief, Innocent ordered Philip to give up the invasion.\n\nJohn, restored to power with papal protection, then organized an Anglo-Flemish-German coalition to recover his French fiefs. In 1214 Philip met the challenge by sending his son Louis of France as leader of a French army against John, who had led an attack from southwestern France. But John fled rather than fight. Meanwhile, Philip led another French army northeastward from Paris to meet John's ally, Otto IV of Germany, who was about to invade France with an army of English, German, and Flemish knights. Philip crushed this army at Bouvines on July 27, 1214. The students in Paris celebrated the French victory for 7 days and 7 nights.\n\nBouvines was one of the decisive battles of European history because it led to the ruin of John, upset the balance of power in Europe in favor of France for over a century, and marked the end of the German Empire as the dominant political power in the Christian West. After Bouvines, John returned to England, where he died in 1216. Philip was able to live out his life in peace, certain of Capetian ascendancy.\n\nInternal Reforms\n\nWhile Philip was enlarging his kingdom, he was also developing and instituting a plan of civil service whereby men were given high office on the basis of competence rather than hereditary right. To assure obedience in the outlying provinces, where distance encouraged independence, Philip instituted salaried bailiffs responsible for the administrative, military, and judicial supervision of the areas assigned to them.\n\nPhilip encouraged the growth of town governments by selling charters and privileges to them, and thus he won the support of town bourgeoisie against the restless nobility. Most of the towns granted new charters were on the frontiers of the royal domain. For Philip they were defensive posts with military obligations. Incomes from this source, from the fees levied on foreign merchants and fairs for protection, and from the profits of justice gave the King the money needed to finance a professional army and government bureaucracy. By the time Philip died, he had become the richest and most powerful lord in the realm.\n\nPhilip loved Paris, which during his reign became the religious, political, and academic capital of France. It was Philip who gave the first charter to the University of Paris. Written after a town-and-gown riot, it recognized the right of students to enjoy clerical status and autonomy. Philip also built a wall around Paris for its defense and, in 1186, ordered the streets paved with stone to overcome the air pollution and stench caused by garbage and other household waste thrown into the streets and the effluvia of the pigs and other animals that roamed about.\n\nIll since September 1222, Philip died at Mantes on July 14, 1223, while on his way to Paris. He left France prosperous and at peace, and the strongest power in western Europe. He was called Augustus by his biographer, Rigord, who compared him to the Roman caesars because he had enlarged the realm and increased its income.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe most thorough study of Philip II is in German. In English, Philip is discussed in more general works on his time: Achille Luchaive, Social France at the Time of Philip Augustus (1912); Charles Petit-Dutaillis, The Feudal Monarchy in France and England from the Tenth to the Thirteenth Century (1936); Robert Fawtier, The Capetian Kings of France: Monarchy and Nation, 987-1328 (1962); and Kenneth Setton, A History of the Crusades (2 vols., 1962), which includes a discussion of the Third Crusade. \u25a1"}], "Philip of France was born in 1116.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-France", "page_content": "Philip II , byname Philip Augustus, French Philippe Auguste , (born August 21, 1165, Paris , France\u2014died July 14, 1223, Mantes), the first of the great Capetian kings of medieval France (reigned 1180\u20131223), who gradually reconquered the French territories held by the kings of England and also furthered the royal domains northward into Flanders and southward into Languedoc. He was a major figure in the Third Crusade to the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhen the count of Flanders allied himself with the Champagne faction , there followed a serious revolt against the king. In the Peace of Boves, in July 1185 (confirmed by the Treaty of Gisors in May 1186), the king and the count of Flanders composed their differences (which had been chiefly over possession of Vermandois, in Picardy) so that the disputed territory was partitioned, Amiens and numerous other places passing to the king and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace. Thenceforward the king was free to run against Henry II of England.\n\nWhen Henry II of England arrived in Normandy, perhaps with the intention of responding to an appeal by the house of Champagne, Philip II entered into negotiations with him and, at Gisors on June 28, 1180, renewed an understanding that Louis VII had reached with him in 1177. As a result, the house of Champagne was politically isolated, and Philip II was making all decisions for himself and acting as he saw fit when his father died, on September 18, 1180, leaving him sole king in name as well as in fact.\n\nPhilip was the son of Louis VII of France and Adela of Champagne. In order to be associated as king with his father, who had fallen mortally ill, he was crowned at Reims on November 1, 1179. His uncles of the house of Champagne\u2014Henry I, count of Champagne; Guillaume, archbishop of Reims; and Thibaut V, count of Blois and Chartres\u2014hoped to use the youthful king to control France. To escape from their tutelage , Philip on April 28, 1180, married Isabella, the daughter of Baldwin V of Hainaut and the niece (through her mother) of Philip of Alsace, the count of Flanders, who promised to give the king the territory of Artois as her dowry.\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nHenry\u2019s French possessions\u2014the so-called Angevin empire, consisting of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, with Aquitaine in the hands of his son, the future Richard I the Lion-Heart of England, and Brittany ruled by another son, Geoffrey (died 1186)\u2014all were a constant menace to the French royal domain. Furthermore, there were long-standing disputes over the Vexin (between Normandy and the \u00cele-de-France), Berry, and Auvergne.\n\nPhilip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau, or of Colombi\u00e8res (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Before his departure, he made the so-called Testament of 1190 to provide for the government of his kingdom in his absence. On his way to Palestine, he met Richard in Sicily, where they promptly found themselves at variance, though they made a treaty at Messina in March 1191. Arriving in Palestine, they cooperated against the Muslims at Acre, until Philip fell ill and made his illness a pretext for returning to France, quite determined to settle the succession to Flanders (Philip of Alsace had just died on the Crusade) while Richard was still absent. Thus, by the end of 1191, Philip II was back in France.\n\nIn spite of promises he had made in the Holy Land, Philip at once prepared to attack the Plantagenet possessions in France. Informed of this, Richard also left the Crusade but was taken prisoner while on his way back by the duke of Austria, Leopold V of Babenberg. Philip did everything he could to prolong his rival\u2019s captivity, but Richard was at last set free (1194) and went to war against Philip. The French king suffered a number of defeats (from that at Fr\u00e9teval in July 1194 to that at Courcelles in September 1198) in a series of campaigns that were occasionally punctuated by negotiations. It was fortuitous for Philip, however, when Richard was killed in April 1199.\n\nRichard\u2019s brother John was by no means as formidable a fighter. Moreover, his right to Richard\u2019s succession could be contested by Arthur of Brittany, whose father had been senior to John. To secure the succession, therefore, John came to terms with Philip: by the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 22, 1200), in return for Philip\u2019s recognition of him as Richard\u2019s heir, he ceded \u00c9vreux and the Norman Vexin to Philip; agreed that Issoudun and Gra\u00e7ay should be the dowry of his niece Blanche of Castile, who was to marry the future Louis VIII (Philip\u2019s son by Isabella of Hainaut); and renounced any claim to suzerainty over Berry and Auvergne.\n\nShortly afterward, however, John entered into conflict with the Lusignan family of Poitou (in Aquitaine), who appealed to Philip as overlord. When he was summoned to appear before the royal court as a vassal of the French crown, John did not present himself, and Philip, in April 1202, pronounced John\u2019s French fiefs forfeit and undertook to carry out the sentence himself. He invaded Normandy, overran the northeast, and laid siege to Arques, while Arthur of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey, who died some years before, campaigned against John\u2019s supporters in Poitou; but John, marching south from Maine, captured Arthur at Mirebeau (August 1). In fury, Philip abandoned the siege of Arques and marched southwestward to Tours, ravaging John\u2019s territory on his way before returning to Paris. Guillaume des Roches, the powerful seneschal of Anjou, who had taken John\u2019s side, came to terms with Philip in March 1203.\n\nResuming operations against Normandy, Philip occupied the towns around the great fortress of Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard, to which he laid siege in September 1203, having overruled Pope Innocent III\u2019s attempts to mediate. John, who is reported to have murdered Arthur of Brittany in April, retired to England in December, and Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard fell to Philip in March 1204. Rouen, the Norman capital, surrendered in June, after 40 days\u2019 resistance.\n\nAfter his conquest of Normandy, Philip subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou with less difficulty (1204\u201305), though the castles of Loches and Chinon held out for a year. He sought to secure his conquests by lavishing privileges on the towns and on the religious houses but otherwise left the local barons in power. Unrest, however, was endemic in Poitou, and in June 1206 John landed at La Rochelle. After a campaign in the south, he turned north toward the Loire. At Thouars in October 1206, he and Philip made a two-year truce, leaving John in possession of the reconquered Poitevin lands. In the following year, however, Philip invaded Poitou again; and, after a further campaign in 1208, only the south and part of the west of Poitou remained loyal to John (with Saintonge, Guyenne, and Gascony).\n\nPhilip next hoped to exploit the dispute between John and Pope Innocent III. While Innocent was threatening to declare John unfit to reign (1212), plans were being made for a French landing in England and for the accession of Philip\u2019s son Louis to the English throne. The plans had to be dropped when John made his submission to the pope (1213). Throwing himself into schemes for revenge, John formed a coalition against France: the Holy Roman emperor Otto IV, the count of Flanders (Ferrand, or Ferdinand, of Portugal), and the count of Boulogne (Raynald, or Renaud, of Dammartin) were to invade the Capetian territory from the northeast while John attacked from the west, with the help of his Poitevin barons.\n\nJohn landed at La Rochelle in February 1214 and advanced into Anjou but was put to flight by Louis at La Roche-aux-Moines on July 2; his confederates were completely defeated by Philip in the decisive Battle of Bouvines on July 27. The Anglo-Angevin power in France and the coalition had both been broken in one month. Thus Philip, who, in 1213, had transferred Brittany to his cousin Peter of Dreux, was left without any significant opposition to his rule in France.\n\nIt was not only at the Plantagenets\u2019 expense that Philip enlarged the royal domain. His claim to Artois through his first marriage and his gains by the settlement of 1185\u201386 have been mentioned above, and he subsequently proceeded, step by step, to acquire the rest of Vermandois and Valois. His insistence on his suzerainty over vacant fiefs and on his tutelage over minors and heiresses was particularly effective with regard to Flanders, where two successive Flemish counts, Philip of Alsace (died 1191) and Baldwin IX (died c. 1205) had left no male issue.\n\nThough he did not personally take part in the Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III against a Cathari religious sect in Languedoc, Philip allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out. Simon de Montfort\u2019s capture of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne (1209) and his victory at Muret over Raymond VI of Toulouse and Peter II of Aragon (1213) prepared the way for the eventual annexation of eastern Languedoc to the royal domain six years after Philip\u2019s death and for the union of northern and southern France under Capetian rule."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Philippe-de-France-roi-associ%C3%A9-de-France/6000000003232579377", "page_content": "About Philippe de France, roi associ\u00e9 de France\n\nPLEASE DO NOT MERGE WITH HIS BROTHER, PHILLIPE ARCHDEACON OF PARIS (1125-1161)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_of_France_%281116%E2%80%931131%29\n\nand in French: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_de_France_%281116-1131%29\n\nPhilip (II) of France (29 August 1116 \u2013 13 October 1131) was the first son of Louis VI of France and his second wife Ad\u00e9laide de Maurienne.\n\nThe favourite son of his father whilst a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint-king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king, or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\"[1]\n\nPhilip's brief period as King was ended two years after his sacring. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness.[2] He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-King, by his meek-mannered brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade, and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem \u2013 the Crusade bringing many deaths on both sides, the abandonment of Antioch proving a strategic failure and a cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nBecause he was co-King rather than senior King, he is not generally given an ordinal as King of France.\n\nPhilip (II)\n\nKing of the Franks\n\nCo-reign 14 April 1129 \u2013 13 October 1131\n\nCoronation 14 April 1129\n\nFather Louis VI of France\n\nMother Ad\u00e9laide of Maurienne\n\nBorn 29 August 1116(1116-08-29)\n\nDied 13 October 1131 (aged 15)\n\nParis\n\nBurial Saint Denis Basilica\n\nHis brother, Louis, took over the throne after Philip died.\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'"}, {"url": "https://www.creativehistorian.co.uk/blog/read_201266/almost-kings-philip-of-france.html", "page_content": "The death of an heir is always a tragedy. But when you\u2019ve been so focused on your eldest that the younger son isn\u2019t kept as a proper back up it can make things even more difficult.\n\nPhilip of France was born in August 1116. His father, King Louis VI (also known as \u201cLouis the Fat\u201d for obvious reasons) was on his second marriage. He had first married Lucienne de Rochefort but after three years he had repudiated her and had the marriage annulled. His second wife, Philip\u2019s mother Adelaide of Maurienne, had fallen pregnant a few months after the wedding. Over the years she would give Louis eight children; seven sons (of which one died in infancy) and one daughter.\n\nAs the first born of this hefty brood of healthy males Philip was named after his paternal grandfather. He is believed to have been his father\u2019s favourite child (not always a guarantee for the eldest, there are plenty of instances in history where the father preferred the spare), at least in childhood.\n\nBut a growing son who is groomed to be king will inevitably want to get some regal experience before his time. Following French tradition Louis had Philip crowned as his co-king in 1129 when the boy was thirteen. This tradition was used to show the direct line of inheritance and reduce the risk of a younger sibling stepping forward on the father\u2019s death to claim the crown and start a civil war.\n\nUnfortunately it could also go to a prince\u2019s head. After he was crowned Philip appears to have gone through a teenage rebellious phase. He reportedly refused to listen to his father scolding him and rejected any attempts to discipline him. As a prince his household would have included other young noblemen his age and it\u2019s possible that this group egged him on to reject his father\u2019s discipline and attempts to mould him into a future king. Louis certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first King, or the last, to have problems with his eldest son.\n\nHaving survived the worst perils of childhood there was no doubt every expectation that Philip would go on to greater things. Like many young men the idea of travel appealed to him, and like many young men of his time he talked about visiting the Holy Land, perhaps as a pilgrimage or even a crusade. He was still too young but no doubt in a few years he would be able to persuade his father to let him go, if only to stop him causing trouble at home.\n\nOne day in October 1131 the fifteen year old prince was riding along with a group of friends when his horse stumbled and threw him off. The story says that a black pig ran in front of the party and the horse tripped on it. But there were plenty of obstacles on the unclean streets that could cause a nasty accident.\n\nWhether they were travelling back home or just out for a ride, the party were probably going at some speed. Philip was thrown off so viciously that he broke several bones when he landed on the ground, which almost certainly included his neck or spine. He was knocked out instantly and although he was brought home as quickly as possible, he died the next day without regaining consciousness.\n\nHis \u201cspare\u201d had been his younger brother Louis. But Philip had been so healthy and so full of promise that Louis had never been intended for kingship. Instead he had been raised among a community of monks, with a monk as a tutor and the glory of a committed religious life dinned into his head on a daily basis. This unprepossessing boy was plucked out of religious contemplation by his father and rushed back to court to be crowned as co-king.\n\nThis prince would become King Louis VII. As the husband of Eleanor of Aquitaine he proved to be a less than adequate lover. One wonders if Eleanor would have had a better time of things if she had been married to Philip. Would Aquitaine have ever been part of England\u2019s Angevin empire? But Louis did do one thing for his dead brother. He remembered Philip\u2019s desire to visit the Holy Land. In time he would declare and lead the Second Crusade to honour his brother\u2019s wish. It would not go well.\n\nLast months Almost King was Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias."}, {"url": "https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/family-tree-roldan-hamilton/P8399.php", "page_content": "search for your ancestors and publish your family tree\n\nFamily Tree Roldan Hamilton Philip of France (1116-1131)\n\nDo you have supplementary information, corrections or questions with regards to Philip of France?\n\nThe author of this publication would love to hear from you!\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline Philip of France\n\nThis functionality is only available in Javascript supporting browsers.\n\nClick on the names for more info.

The motherless Philip and his three brothers saw little of their father, who, stricken by Isabella\u2019s death, threw himself into campaigning and administrative affairs. His troubled childhood and the series of blows he suffered explain in some measure the conflicting elements in his adult personality. In 1274 his father married Marie de Brabant, a beautiful and cultivated woman, and, with her arrival at court, intrigue began to flourish. In the same year, the two-year-old Joan, heiress of Champagne and Navarre, was welcomed as a refugee. Reared with the royal children, she would, when she was 12, become the bride of Philip the Fair.\n\nIn 1276 Philip\u2019s elder brother, Louis, died, and the shock of this event, which suddenly made Philip heir to the kingdom, was compounded by persistent rumours of poisoning and suspicions that Philip\u2019s stepmother intended to see Isabella\u2019s remaining sons destroyed. Vague allegations were circulated that Louis\u2019s death was linked with certain unspecified \u201cunnatural acts\u201d of his father. These rumours, never satisfactorily put to rest, together with the unexpected change in Philip\u2019s fortunes, apparently served to arouse in him feelings of insecurity and mistrust.\n\nConsequently, Philip turned elsewhere in search of a model for his own conduct. He found it in Louis IX, whose memory was increasingly venerated as the number of miracles attributed to him mounted. Reports of Louis\u2019s exacting standards of rulership and his saintly virtues were reinforced by the precepts of the religious advisers who surrounded the adolescent Philip. A more self-confident person might have been able to discriminate realistically among the sometimes artificially exaggerated stories and the utopian ideals. Philip, however, became convinced that it was his God-given duty to attain the lofty goals of his grandfather.\n\nBritannica Quiz Medieval History Quiz: Part Four\n\nWhen Philip was 16, he was knighted and married to Joan of Navarre. In 1285 he accompanied his father to the south on a campaign to install Philip\u2019s brother Charles on the throne of Aragon. He had no sympathy with the enterprise, however, which was backed by his stepmother and aimed against the king of Aragon, his late mother\u2019s brother. When his father died in October 1285, Philip immediately abandoned the venture."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/philip-of-france-1116-1131", "page_content": "Philip of France\n\nPhilip of France is a 15 years old from .

Reigning at the outbreak of the Hundred Years\u2019 War (1337\u20131453), he had no means of imposing on his country the measures necessary for the maintenance of his monarchical power, though he continued the efforts of the 13th-century Capetians toward the centralization of the administration in Paris. To raise taxes for war, he was obliged to make concessions to the nobility, the clergy, and the bourgeoisie; hence his reign witnessed the important development of the political power of the estates. The bourgeoisie, profiting from the king\u2019s power, proved grateful and loyal; among the clergy and nobility, however, a movement for reform of finances took root.\n\nThe elder son of Charles of Valois, Philip was first cousin to the brothers Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, the last Capetian kings of the direct line. On the death of Charles IV in 1328, Philip, in the face of opposition from the partisans of the claim of Edward III of England, assumed the regency until the end of the pregnancy of Charles IV\u2019s widow. When the widow produced a daughter, who therefore could not succeed to the throne, Philip became king and was crowned at Reims in May 1328.\n\nMore From Britannica France: Philip VI\n\nAfter the outbreak of a revolt in Flanders in August of that year, the count of Flanders appealed to Philip, whose knights butchered thousands of rebellious Flemings at the Battle of Cassel. When shortly thereafter Robert of Artois, who had helped Philip to win the crown, claimed the countship of Artois against a member of the royal family, Philip was forced to institute judicial proceedings against Robert, who became his bitter enemy. In 1334 Robert went to England and began to foment trouble between Edward III and Philip, hastening the deterioration of Anglo-French relations, which in 1337 led to the outbreak of the Hundred Years\u2019 War. Military operations were at first restricted. In 1340, however, France suffered a grave defeat in the naval Battle of Sluys. Meanwhile, the internal situation had worsened, as a result of resentment over the preponderant influence of the nominees of the powerful Duke of Burgundy in the king\u2019s council. A serious crisis resulted in 1343 and forced Philip to summon to Paris the estates of the kingdom, which took some measures to appease public opinion and to relieve the burdens of administration. France\u2019s devastating defeat by the English at Cr\u00e9cy (1346) gave rise to another crisis. To conciliate opponents, the government was obliged to entrust finances to three abbots. A new meeting of the estates in November 1347 again forced the King to recast his council. The spread of the Black Death in 1348 and 1349, however, overshadowed all political questions. When Philip died, he left France divided by war and plague, although by purchase he had made some important additions to the territory of the kingdom."}, {"url": "https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/karens-family-tree/I71074.php", "page_content": "search for your ancestors and publish your family tree\n\nMore like a forest than a tree!

However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king, or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\"[1]\n\nPhilip's brief period as King was ended two years after his sacring. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness.[2] He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-King, by his meek-mannered brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade, and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem \u2013 the Crusade bringing many deaths on both sides, the abandonment of Antioch proving a strategic failure and a cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nBecause he was co-King rather than senior King, he is not generally given an ordinal as King of France.\n\nPhilip (II)\n\nKing of the Franks\n\nCo-reign 14 April 1129 \u2013 13 October 1131\n\nCoronation 14 April 1129\n\nFather Louis VI of France\n\nMother Ad\u00e9laide of Maurienne\n\nBorn 29 August 1116(1116-08-29)\n\nDied 13 October 1131 (aged 15)\n\nParis\n\nBurial Saint Denis Basilica\n\nHis brother, Louis, took over the throne after Philip died.\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-France", "page_content": "Philip II , byname Philip Augustus, French Philippe Auguste , (born August 21, 1165, Paris , France\u2014died July 14, 1223, Mantes), the first of the great Capetian kings of medieval France (reigned 1180\u20131223), who gradually reconquered the French territories held by the kings of England and also furthered the royal domains northward into Flanders and southward into Languedoc. He was a major figure in the Third Crusade to the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhen the count of Flanders allied himself with the Champagne faction , there followed a serious revolt against the king. In the Peace of Boves, in July 1185 (confirmed by the Treaty of Gisors in May 1186), the king and the count of Flanders composed their differences (which had been chiefly over possession of Vermandois, in Picardy) so that the disputed territory was partitioned, Amiens and numerous other places passing to the king and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace. Thenceforward the king was free to run against Henry II of England.\n\nWhen Henry II of England arrived in Normandy, perhaps with the intention of responding to an appeal by the house of Champagne, Philip II entered into negotiations with him and, at Gisors on June 28, 1180, renewed an understanding that Louis VII had reached with him in 1177. As a result, the house of Champagne was politically isolated, and Philip II was making all decisions for himself and acting as he saw fit when his father died, on September 18, 1180, leaving him sole king in name as well as in fact.\n\nPhilip was the son of Louis VII of France and Adela of Champagne. In order to be associated as king with his father, who had fallen mortally ill, he was crowned at Reims on November 1, 1179. His uncles of the house of Champagne\u2014Henry I, count of Champagne; Guillaume, archbishop of Reims; and Thibaut V, count of Blois and Chartres\u2014hoped to use the youthful king to control France. To escape from their tutelage , Philip on April 28, 1180, married Isabella, the daughter of Baldwin V of Hainaut and the niece (through her mother) of Philip of Alsace, the count of Flanders, who promised to give the king the territory of Artois as her dowry.\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nHenry\u2019s French possessions\u2014the so-called Angevin empire, consisting of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, with Aquitaine in the hands of his son, the future Richard I the Lion-Heart of England, and Brittany ruled by another son, Geoffrey (died 1186)\u2014all were a constant menace to the French royal domain. Furthermore, there were long-standing disputes over the Vexin (between Normandy and the \u00cele-de-France), Berry, and Auvergne.\n\nPhilip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau, or of Colombi\u00e8res (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Before his departure, he made the so-called Testament of 1190 to provide for the government of his kingdom in his absence. On his way to Palestine, he met Richard in Sicily, where they promptly found themselves at variance, though they made a treaty at Messina in March 1191. Arriving in Palestine, they cooperated against the Muslims at Acre, until Philip fell ill and made his illness a pretext for returning to France, quite determined to settle the succession to Flanders (Philip of Alsace had just died on the Crusade) while Richard was still absent. Thus, by the end of 1191, Philip II was back in France.\n\nIn spite of promises he had made in the Holy Land, Philip at once prepared to attack the Plantagenet possessions in France. Informed of this, Richard also left the Crusade but was taken prisoner while on his way back by the duke of Austria, Leopold V of Babenberg. Philip did everything he could to prolong his rival\u2019s captivity, but Richard was at last set free (1194) and went to war against Philip. The French king suffered a number of defeats (from that at Fr\u00e9teval in July 1194 to that at Courcelles in September 1198) in a series of campaigns that were occasionally punctuated by negotiations. It was fortuitous for Philip, however, when Richard was killed in April 1199.\n\nRichard\u2019s brother John was by no means as formidable a fighter. Moreover, his right to Richard\u2019s succession could be contested by Arthur of Brittany, whose father had been senior to John. To secure the succession, therefore, John came to terms with Philip: by the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 22, 1200), in return for Philip\u2019s recognition of him as Richard\u2019s heir, he ceded \u00c9vreux and the Norman Vexin to Philip; agreed that Issoudun and Gra\u00e7ay should be the dowry of his niece Blanche of Castile, who was to marry the future Louis VIII (Philip\u2019s son by Isabella of Hainaut); and renounced any claim to suzerainty over Berry and Auvergne.\n\nShortly afterward, however, John entered into conflict with the Lusignan family of Poitou (in Aquitaine), who appealed to Philip as overlord. When he was summoned to appear before the royal court as a vassal of the French crown, John did not present himself, and Philip, in April 1202, pronounced John\u2019s French fiefs forfeit and undertook to carry out the sentence himself. He invaded Normandy, overran the northeast, and laid siege to Arques, while Arthur of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey, who died some years before, campaigned against John\u2019s supporters in Poitou; but John, marching south from Maine, captured Arthur at Mirebeau (August 1). In fury, Philip abandoned the siege of Arques and marched southwestward to Tours, ravaging John\u2019s territory on his way before returning to Paris. Guillaume des Roches, the powerful seneschal of Anjou, who had taken John\u2019s side, came to terms with Philip in March 1203.\n\nResuming operations against Normandy, Philip occupied the towns around the great fortress of Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard, to which he laid siege in September 1203, having overruled Pope Innocent III\u2019s attempts to mediate. John, who is reported to have murdered Arthur of Brittany in April, retired to England in December, and Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard fell to Philip in March 1204. Rouen, the Norman capital, surrendered in June, after 40 days\u2019 resistance.\n\nAfter his conquest of Normandy, Philip subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou with less difficulty (1204\u201305), though the castles of Loches and Chinon held out for a year. He sought to secure his conquests by lavishing privileges on the towns and on the religious houses but otherwise left the local barons in power. Unrest, however, was endemic in Poitou, and in June 1206 John landed at La Rochelle. After a campaign in the south, he turned north toward the Loire. At Thouars in October 1206, he and Philip made a two-year truce, leaving John in possession of the reconquered Poitevin lands. In the following year, however, Philip invaded Poitou again; and, after a further campaign in 1208, only the south and part of the west of Poitou remained loyal to John (with Saintonge, Guyenne, and Gascony).\n\nPhilip next hoped to exploit the dispute between John and Pope Innocent III. While Innocent was threatening to declare John unfit to reign (1212), plans were being made for a French landing in England and for the accession of Philip\u2019s son Louis to the English throne. The plans had to be dropped when John made his submission to the pope (1213). Throwing himself into schemes for revenge, John formed a coalition against France: the Holy Roman emperor Otto IV, the count of Flanders (Ferrand, or Ferdinand, of Portugal), and the count of Boulogne (Raynald, or Renaud, of Dammartin) were to invade the Capetian territory from the northeast while John attacked from the west, with the help of his Poitevin barons.\n\nJohn landed at La Rochelle in February 1214 and advanced into Anjou but was put to flight by Louis at La Roche-aux-Moines on July 2; his confederates were completely defeated by Philip in the decisive Battle of Bouvines on July 27. The Anglo-Angevin power in France and the coalition had both been broken in one month. Thus Philip, who, in 1213, had transferred Brittany to his cousin Peter of Dreux, was left without any significant opposition to his rule in France.\n\nIt was not only at the Plantagenets\u2019 expense that Philip enlarged the royal domain. His claim to Artois through his first marriage and his gains by the settlement of 1185\u201386 have been mentioned above, and he subsequently proceeded, step by step, to acquire the rest of Vermandois and Valois. His insistence on his suzerainty over vacant fiefs and on his tutelage over minors and heiresses was particularly effective with regard to Flanders, where two successive Flemish counts, Philip of Alsace (died 1191) and Baldwin IX (died c. 1205) had left no male issue.\n\nThough he did not personally take part in the Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III against a Cathari religious sect in Languedoc, Philip allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out. Simon de Montfort\u2019s capture of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne (1209) and his victory at Muret over Raymond VI of Toulouse and Peter II of Aragon (1213) prepared the way for the eventual annexation of eastern Languedoc to the royal domain six years after Philip\u2019s death and for the union of northern and southern France under Capetian rule."}, {"url": "https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/family-tree-fountaine-fontaine-fountain-lafontaine/P9085.php", "page_content": "search for your ancestors and publish your family tree\n\nFamily tree Fountaine/Fontaine/Fountain/Lafontaine Philip of France (1116-1131)\n\nDo you have supplementary information, corrections or questions with regards to Philip of France?\n\nThe author of this publication would love to hear from you!\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline Philip of France\n\nThis functionality is only available in Javascript supporting browsers.\n\nClick on the names for more info.

The motherless Philip and his three brothers saw little of their father, who, stricken by Isabella\u2019s death, threw himself into campaigning and administrative affairs. His troubled childhood and the series of blows he suffered explain in some measure the conflicting elements in his adult personality. In 1274 his father married Marie de Brabant, a beautiful and cultivated woman, and, with her arrival at court, intrigue began to flourish. In the same year, the two-year-old Joan, heiress of Champagne and Navarre, was welcomed as a refugee. Reared with the royal children, she would, when she was 12, become the bride of Philip the Fair.\n\nIn 1276 Philip\u2019s elder brother, Louis, died, and the shock of this event, which suddenly made Philip heir to the kingdom, was compounded by persistent rumours of poisoning and suspicions that Philip\u2019s stepmother intended to see Isabella\u2019s remaining sons destroyed. Vague allegations were circulated that Louis\u2019s death was linked with certain unspecified \u201cunnatural acts\u201d of his father. These rumours, never satisfactorily put to rest, together with the unexpected change in Philip\u2019s fortunes, apparently served to arouse in him feelings of insecurity and mistrust.\n\nConsequently, Philip turned elsewhere in search of a model for his own conduct. He found it in Louis IX, whose memory was increasingly venerated as the number of miracles attributed to him mounted. Reports of Louis\u2019s exacting standards of rulership and his saintly virtues were reinforced by the precepts of the religious advisers who surrounded the adolescent Philip. A more self-confident person might have been able to discriminate realistically among the sometimes artificially exaggerated stories and the utopian ideals. Philip, however, became convinced that it was his God-given duty to attain the lofty goals of his grandfather.\n\nBritannica Quiz Religion, Violence, and War Quiz\n\nWhen Philip was 16, he was knighted and married to Joan of Navarre. In 1285 he accompanied his father to the south on a campaign to install Philip\u2019s brother Charles on the throne of Aragon. He had no sympathy with the enterprise, however, which was backed by his stepmother and aimed against the king of Aragon, his late mother\u2019s brother. When his father died in October 1285, Philip immediately abandoned the venture."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/philip-of-france-1116-1131", "page_content": "Philip of France\n\nPhilip of France is a 15 years old from .

Accompanying his father\u2019s crusade against Tunis in 1270, he was in Africa when Louis IX died. He was anointed king at Reims in 1271.\n\nPhilip continued his father\u2019s highly successful administration by keeping in office his able and experienced household clerks. Mathieu de Vend\u00f4me, abbot of Saint-Denis, whom Louis IX had left as regent in France, remained in control of the government. The death in 1271 of Alphonse of Poitiers and his wife, heiress of Toulouse, enabled Philip early in his reign to annex their vast holdings to the royal demesne. Nevertheless, in 1279 he was obliged to cede the county of Agenais to Edward I of England. The marriage in 1284 of Philip\u2019s son, the future Philip IV, to Joan, the heiress of the crown of Navarre and the countships of Champagne and Brie, brought these important areas also under Capetian control. In addition Philip over the years made numerous small territorial acquisitions.\n\nPhilip was less successful militarily. In 1276 he declared war to support the claims of his nephews as heirs in Castile but soon abandoned the venture. In 1284, at the instigation of Pope Martin IV, Philip launched a campaign against Peter III of Aragon, as part of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, in which the Aragonese opposed the Angevin rulers of Sicily. Philip crossed the Pyrenees with his army in May 1285, but the atrocities perpetrated by his forces provoked a guerrilla uprising. After a meaningless victory at Gerona and the destruction of his fleet at Las Hormigas, Philip was forced to retreat. He died of fever on the way home."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21107/philippe_de_france", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

He was 46 and rumours circulated that his sudden death was God\u2019s revenge on his destruction of the Knights Templar. The leaders of the Templars had been burnt at the stake the previous March by his command and it was said both he and the Pope were cursed by the Grand Master Jacques de Molay as he died. Here at The National Archives we have several records relating to Philip IV of France, and books in our Library which can help you to understand more about the period.\n\nPhilip IV of France was an enigma. He was tall, blonde and handsome (hence the nickname \u2018Fair\u2019) but aloof. He was born in Fontainebleau in 1268, the second son of Philip III. His childhood was not the happiest. His mother died when he was three and his stepmother, Marie de Brabant, allegedly preferred her own children to Philip and his brothers. When Louis (Philip\u2019s elder brother) died in 1276 his step-mother was accused of poisoning him but was acquitted. This episode is explored in Elizabeth A. R. Brown\u2019s article The Prince is father of the King: the character and childhood of Philip the Fair of France. When Philip became King there was little contact between them.\n\nPhilip the Fair\u2019s character is elusive as smoke. There is limited evidence about his personality but I found a celebrated biography The reign of Philip the Fair by Joseph R. Strayer helped illuminate how his enemies thought of him. One, Bishop Saisset compared him to an owl who simply stared at people but couldn\u2019t speak to them and was controlled by his ministers\u2019 decisions. Yet Philip was also said to be good at getting his own way and could be terrifying to those who crossed him. For example the brutal treatment he meted out to the Templars and to his daughter-in\u2013laws\u2019 lovers, whose adulterous relationships were exposed shortly after the \u2018curse\u2019 had been sworn. Their fates could only have been sanctioned by the King.\n\nEdward I as Duke of Aquitaine was a vassal of the French King. A raid by Gascon sailors in 1294 gave Philip the opportunity to go to war with England. Edward I sent his brother to dissuade Philip from war. Philip deceived the English over the terms for peace, one of which was he would send a token army to Aquitaine. In fact Philip sent a large army to the Duchy and would not give Edward safe conduct to go to Gascony and defend his interests. Edward renounced his allegiance to the French King and war broke out between both countries.\n\nNo-one is sure why Philip provoked this war with Edward I. Was it a way for the youthful King (still in his twenties) to try to bring his greatest vassal and elder statesman to heel? Edward was about 55 years old at the time. It was rash act for a supposedly cold blooded King.\n\nEventually a peace treaty of 1303 ended hostilities (E 368/69m.54). It had unforeseen ramifications. Part of the treaty involved Philip\u2019s daughter Isabella marrying Edward\u2019s son and heir, the future Edward II. This led to a period of peace between the two countries but also gave their son Edward III a claim to the French throne, one of the major causes of the Hundred Years\u2019 War.\n\nPhilip is best remembered for his conflict with Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templars. In 1296 Boniface issued a Papal Bull which prohibited taxation of the clergy without the Pope\u2019s approval. He had to retract this under pressure from Philip and Edward I. Gossip began to circulate that Boniface was guilty of heresy, simony and even murder. Philip lapped up these stories. The Pope in 1301 prohibited the French King from taxing the clergy and tried to summon the French clergy to Rome to discuss the French church. Philip responded by calling nationwide assemblies which promised to have the Pope tried for heresy. This culminated in the Pope being arrested in Anagni (Italy) by agents of the King of France. After two days Boniface was freed but the elderly man was shaken by the experience and died a month later.\n\nAnother Pope Benedict briefly ruled after Boniface and then Clement V became pontiff in 1305. He was pro-French. He even moved the Papacy to Avignon.\n\nPhilip, because of his wars with England and Flanders, was chronically short of money. This led him to look at the Templars who were a very wealthy order in France and who pledged their allegiance to the Pope above the King. Again alleged heresies began to circulate about the order for example; they worshipped an idol and spat on the crucifix. I found much interesting detail on the alleged heresies the Templars were said to follow in the book, The trial of the Templars. Clement V at first tried to fight these charges but eventually succumbed to pressure from a determined Philip (SC 7/10/40). The Templars in France, unlike the ones in England, were subjected to torture and so often confessed to these heresies. There was shock throughout Europe when all Templars were arrested in France on the same day in 1307. By March 1314 the last of the Templars were burnt at the stake, supposedly cursing the Pope and Philip IV that they would both die within the year.\n\nThe Pope died in April 1314. According to the book, The Knights Templars the Pope\u2019s body was placed in a church overnight and the church caught fire and the body turned to ashes. Philip\u2019s last year was troublesome. He found out two of his daughters-in-law were committing adultery. Their lovers were brutally put to death in the market square at Pontoise and the women were thrown into prison. His rigid morality could not cover up the scandal. In November Philip suffered a stroke while out hunting and died soon after at Fontainebleau.\n\nHis reign helped to enhance the borders and governmental structures of France but his three sons followed him in quick succession as Kings in their own right and his Capetian line died out in 1328.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about the subject, I\u2019d also recommend these books from our library:\n\nArchives nationales, Grands Documents De L\u2019Histoire de France (Paris, 2007). 944ARC\n\nAlan Forey, The military orders from the twelfth to the early fourteenth centuries(London, 1992). 271.791FOR\n\nThomas M.
