{"Cicero Hunt Lewis was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention.": [{"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/election-of-1860", "page_content": "The election of 1860 was one of the most pivotal presidential elections in American history. It pitted Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln against Democratic Party nominee Senator Stephen Douglas, Southern Democratic Party nominee John Breckinridge and Constitutional Union Party nominee John Bell. The main issue of the election was slavery and states\u2019 rights. Lincoln emerged victorious and became the 16th President of the United States during a national crisis that would tear states and families apart and test Lincoln\u2019s leadership and resolve: The Civil War.\n\nLincoln\u2019s Political History\n\nAbraham Lincoln\u2019s political ambitions began in 1832 when he was just 23 years old and ran for the Illinois House of Representatives. While he lost that election, two years later, he was elected to the state legislature as a member of the Whig party, where he publicly announced his disdain for slavery.\n\nIn 1847, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where, on January 10, 1849, he introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. The bill didn\u2019t pass, but it opened the door for later anti-slavery legislation.\n\nIn 1858, Lincoln ran for the Senate, this time as a Republican against Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas. He lost the election but gained prominence for himself and the newly established Republican Party.\n\n1860 Republican National Convention\n\nThe Republican Party held its second national convention on May 16, 1860, in Chicago, Illinois. It adopted a moderate stance on slavery and was against its expansion, although some delegates wanted the institution abolished altogether.\n\nThe two frontrunners for the Republican presidential nomination were Lincoln and New York Senator William Seward. After three votes, Lincoln was nominated with Hannibal Hamlin as his running mate.\n\nDemocrats Split Over Slavery\n\nThe Democratic Party was in shambles in 1860. They should have been the party of unity, but instead were divided on the issue of slavery. Southern Democrats thought slavery should be expanded but Northern Democrats opposed the idea.\n\nStates\u2019 rights were also hotly debated. Southern Democrats felt states had the right to govern themselves while Northern Democrats supported the Union and a national government.\n\nWith such confusion among the ranks, it was unclear how the Democratic Party would ever nominate a candidate for the 1860 election. But on April 23, 1860, they met in Charleston, South Carolina to decide their platform and identify a nominee.\n\nStephen Douglas was the frontrunner, but Southern Democrats refused to support him because he wouldn\u2019t adopt a pro-slavery platform. Many walked out in protest, leaving the remaining delates without the majority needed to nominate Douglas; the convention ended without a nominee.\n\nThe Democrats met again two months later in Baltimore. Once again, many Southern delegates left in disgust, but enough remained to nominate Douglas as their presidential nominee and his running mate, former Georgia governor Herschel Johnson.\n\nSouthern Democrats nominated John Breckinridge, a supporter of slavery and states\u2019 rights, to represent them in the election. Oregon senator Joseph Lane was his running mate.\n\nConstitutional Union Party\n\nThe Constitutional Union Party was mainly made up of disgruntled Democrats, Unionists and former Whigs. On May 9, 1860, they held their first convention and nominated Tennessee slaveholder John Bell as their presidential nominee and former Harvard University President Edward Everett as his running mate.\n\nThe Constitutional Union party claimed to be the party of law. They took no official position on slavery or states\u2019 rights, but promised to defend the Constitution and the Union.\n\nStill, Bell wanted to offer a compromise on the topic of slavery by extending the Missouri Compromise line across the United States and make slavery legal in new states to the south of the line and illegal in new states north of the line. They hoped to sway voters who were upset with the divisiveness of the Democratic Party.\n\n1860 Presidential Campaign\n\nNone of the 1860 presidential candidates did anywhere near the level of campaigning seen in modern-day elections. In fact, except for Douglas, they mostly kept to themselves and let well-known party members and citizens campaign for them at rallies and parades. Much of the campaigning, however, was devoted to getting voters to the ballot box on Election Day.\n\nLincoln\u2019s political experience and speeches spoke for themselves, but one of his main campaign goals was to keep the Republican party unified. He didn\u2019t want his party to reveal any of the discord of the Democrats and hoped to divide the Democratic votes.\n\nDouglas campaigned in the North and South to hopefully make up for the divided voter base in the South, and gave a series of campaign speeches in favor of the Union.\n\n1860 Election Results: The South Reacts\n\nOn November 6, 1860, voters went to the ballot box to cast their vote for President of the United States. Lincoln won the election in an electoral college landslide with 180 electoral votes, although he secured less than 40 percent of the popular vote.\n\nThe North had many more people than the South and therefore control of the Electoral College. Lincoln dominated the Northern states but didn\u2019t carry a single Southern state.\n\nDouglas received some Northern support\u201412 electoral votes\u2014but not nearly enough to offer a serious challenge to Lincoln. The Southern vote was split between Breckenridge who won 72 electoral votes and Bell who won 39 electoral votes. The split prevented either candidate from gaining enough votes to win the election.\n\nThe election of 1860 firmly established the Democratic and Republican parties as the majority parties in the United States. It also confirmed deep-seated views on slavery and states\u2019 rights between the North and South.\n\nBefore Lincoln\u2019s inauguration, seven Southern states had seceded from the Union. Weeks after his swearing-in, the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter and started the Civil War.\n\nHISTORY Vault: Abraham Lincoln A definitive biography of the 16th U.S. president, the man who led the country during its bloodiest war and greatest crisis.

The Republican Party was formed two years earlier in response to the increasing importance of the slavery issue and its opposition to slavery\u2019s expansion. This new party nominated John C. Fremont of California for president. Fremont was a national hero who had won California from Mexico during the Mexican-American War and had crossed the Rocky Mountains five times.\n\n\n\nAt the convention, Abraham Lincoln lost his bid as a vice presidential candidate to William L. Dayton, a former senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n\nFremont, known more as an explorer than for his brief time as a U.S. senator, became the frontrunner after two major contenders withdrew from the race before the balloting began: Salmon P. Chase of Ohio and William H. Seward of New York. The 600 voting delegates at the convention represented the Northern states and the border slave states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky and the District of Columbia. The symbolically important Territory of Kansas was treated as a full state.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform advocated, like the Democrats\u2019 platform, construction of a transcontinental railroad and welcomed improvements of river and harbor systems. The most compelling issue on the platform, however, was opposition to the expansion of slavery in the free territories and urgency for the admission of Kansas as a free state, calling upon \u201cCongress to prohibit in the Territories those twin relics of barbarism -- Polygamy and Slavery.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1860 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe Republicans convened in Chicago on May 16 - 18, 1860 amid lively and buoyant crowds. The opposition had become fractured and the Republicans expanded their call beyond party faithful to those unhappy with the Democratic administration of James Buchanan. Abraham Lincoln won the presidential candidacy on the third ballot and was joined on the ticket by vice presidential candidate Hannibal Hamlin of Maine.\n\n\n\nThe debates between Lincoln and Democrat Stephen Douglas during their 1858 Illinois Senate race launched Lincoln\u2019s stature on the national scene. With widespread news coverage providing the opportunity to read the entire text of the debates, these forums on slavery, race and the nature of freedom caught the attention of the entire nation.The Republican platform opposed the expansion of slavery, but accepted it as a local institution in slaveholding states. As in 1856, Republicans encouraged congressional improvement of rivers and harbors and advocated a\n\ntranscontinental railway. They condemned discussion of disunion of the states, encouraged financial accountability in the government and demanded homestead measures for those settling in the West. Top of Page Home\n\n1864 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1864 National Union Party convention met on June 7 - 8, in Baltimore, Maryland, in the midst of the Civil War. The \u201cNational Union\u201d party name was an acknowledgement by the Republicans of the Democrats who had supported President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s war policy. Democrats were also urged to attend the convention. All Northern states sent delegates to the convention, along with a limited number of Southern slave states. The credentials committee recommended that all the Southern states except South Carolina be admitted, but denied the right to vote. Ultimately, the recommendation that Florida and Virginia be denied voting rights and that South Carolina be excluded entirely, was accepted by voice vote.\n\n\n\nAlthough there was some dissatisfaction among party leaders with the renomination of President Lincoln, there was no serious competition for the presidential nomination. Some Republicans felt that as Lincoln had not been able to end the war, he could not win the election. However, Lincoln was still popular with rank-and-file Republicans and won easily on the first ballot. The only other name on the ballot was General Ulysses S. Grant.\n\n\n\nPresident Lincoln left the decision on the vice presidential candidate to the convention. The names of incumbent vice president Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, former senator Daniel S. Dickinson of New York, and former senator and military governor of Tennessee, Democrat Andrew Johnson were all on the ballot. Andrew Johnson led on the first ballot and, after a switch by the Kentucky delegation, won the nomination.\n\n\n\nThe National Union Party platform was approved without debate. The platform called for a forceful campaign to win the war with an unconditional surrender by the South. In addition, the platform stated that the elimination of slavery should be ratified in a constitutional amendment. Top of Page Home\n\n1868 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION The first postwar convention of the Republican Party, termed the \u201cNational Union Republican Party\u201d in the platform, met in Chicago, Illinois on May 20 - 21. Delegates to the convention included representatives from the old Confederate states. Several African-Americans also participated as delegates.\n\n\n\nUlysses S. Grant\u2019s name was the sole one placed in nomination, and the roll call vote was unanimous with Grant receiving all 650 votes. The vice presidential nomination, however, saw a total of eleven candidates. The four top contenders were Senator Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio, Governor Reuben E. Fenton of New York, Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, and Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts. On the sixth ballot, Speaker of the House Colfax secured the nomination with 541 votes.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform enthusiastically endorsed the radical reconstruction plan that had been passed by the Congress. This included support for voting rights for African-American men in the South, but stated that the decision on this issue was one to be made by each individual state. Language in the platform labeled President Andrew Johnson as \u201ctreacherous\u201d and advocated his impeachment. Top of Page Home\n\n1872 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe Republican Party, minus the reform wing which had formed their own party named the Liberal Republican Party, gathered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 5 - 6. Incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant was renominated without opposition, receiving all 752 votes. Four African-American delegates gave speeches at this convention \u0096 William H. Grey (Arkansas delegate), Robert B. Elliott (South Carolina delegate), James H. Harris (North Carolina delegate), and James Lynch (Mississippi delegate).\n\n\n\nNominees for the vice presidency included the incumbent vice president Schuyler Colfax of Indiana and Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts. With Colfax having been implicated in a major scandal involving bribery, of both members of Congress and of the Grant administration, in the building of the transcontinental railroad, Senator Wilson was able to secure the nomination with 399 \u00bd votes.\n\n\n\nThe platform was a progressive one which called for women\u2019s rights, the abolition of the franking privilege, a duty on imports to raise revenue and protect American business, and a hard-money policy. In relation to women, the platform stated, \u201cTheir admission to wider fields of usefulness is viewed with satisfaction, and the honest demand of any class of citizens for additional rights should be treated with respectful consideration.\u201d In addition, a plank in the platform called for federal and state legislation that would ensure equal rights for all citizens regardless of \u201crace, creed, color, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiberal Republican Party\n\n\n\nThis reform minded element of the Republican Party had broken from the national party and established their own party, the Liberal Republican Party. Corruption within the Grant administration, and dissatisfaction with the \u201ccarpetbag\u201d Reconstruction governments in the South were the major issues of concern to the Liberal Republicans. Their convention was held in May in Cincinnati, Ohio, amidst confusion over credentialed delegates and a fight by three factions each wanting control over the new party.\n\n\n\nFour candidates\u2019 names were placed on the ballot, Charles Francis Adams of Massachusetts, Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, Supreme Court Justice David Davis of Illinois, and newspaper founder and editor Horace Greeley of New York. On the sixth ballot, Greeley secured enough votes to win the nomination. The vice presidential nominee was Greeley supporter, Governor B. Gratz Brown of Missouri, who won on the second ballot.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Republican platform called for an end to Reconstruction and its \u201ccarpetbag\u201d governments, with a grant of universal amnesty to Southern citizens and a return of home rule to the South. The platform called for reforms in the civil service, sharply criticizing the corruption of the Grant administration and advocating a one-term limit on the presidency. On the tariff issue, the Liberal Republic plank stated that the matter should be left to local jurisdictions to decide. Top of Page Home\n\n1876 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe Republican convention was held in Cincinnati June 14 - 16, 1876. The clear front-runner for the nomination was James G. Blaine of Maine, a fine debater and able politician. He was defeated in the seventh ballot round, however, by a combination of factors, including a lingering association with a Union Pacific Railroad scandal during the Grant administration and efforts by anti-Blaine forces, which rallied behind the lesser-known Rutherford B. Hayes. Hayes\u2019s reputation for honesty, heroism in war and inoffensiveness made him acceptable to the major Republican factions. New York Representative William A. Wheeler easily won the vice presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nFeatured speaker at the convention was the abolitionist Frederick Douglass. His eloquent address admonished the Republican Party for its emancipation of slaves, which provided freedom \u201cby the letter of your law\u201d without the ability to exercise that freedom physically or financially in society. Twenty-four African-American delegates attended the convention.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform denounced the Democrats and called for civil rights for all citizens, a fulfillment of pledges to veterans, tariffs as revenue and for the benefit of the U.S. labor force and distribution of public lands to homesteaders. Top of Page Home\n\n1880 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nChicago, Illinois, was the site of the 1880 Republican convention held from June 2 - 8. The Republican Party was split between the conservative Stalwart faction, led by the powerful political boss Roscoe Conkling, Senator from New York, and the moderate Half-breed faction. The candidate supported by the Stalwart faction was former president Ulysses S. Grant, while the Half-breed faction\u2019s candidates were the Senator from Maine, James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio. Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio was the head of the Ohio delegation, chairman of the Rules Committee, and a supporter of Treasury Secretary Sherman.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Garfield, who had earlier in the year been elected to the Senate but had not yet taken his seat, was instrumental in getting the convention Rules Committee to vote down the use of the controversial \u201cunit rule.\u201d The unit rule bound all delegates from a state convention to vote as one with the majority block of their state delegates. This defeat severely hurt the chances of the Stalwart faction and their candidate former president Grant. Garfield gave a moving nominating speech for John Sherman that convinced many delegates that Garfield might be an excellent compromise candidate.\n\n\n\nAs balloting began, Garfield began to accumulate votes and was under increasing pressure to declare himself as a candidate. He refused to do so. On the thirty-seventh ballot, Garfield received 399 votes, securing the nomination. It was said that he was astonished by the outcome. To placate the Stalwart faction, Chester A. Arthur of New York was nominated and won the vice presidential half of the ticket. Arthur was the former collector of the port of New York. Another name on the vice presidential ballot was Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce of Mississippi, who received eight votes. Senator Bruce was the first African-American to serve a full term in the Senate and to win any votes at a major party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform was non-controversial and passed by voice vote. Most notable was the plank language calling for the exercise of strong federal power, which stated that \u201cThe Constitution of the United States is a supreme law, and not a mere contract.\u201d Additional planks called for a revenue tariff that would protect American industry, and the reform of the civil service. Top of Page Home\n\n1884 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nOn June 3- 6, the Republican convention met in Chicago, Illinois. The incumbent president Chester A. Arthur, who had assumed the office three years earlier upon the assassination of President James A. Garfield, was a candidate, but challengers for the nomination emerged. Arthur had angered his Stalwart faction supporters by advocating investigations into political corruption during his presidency. His challenger, supported by the moderate wing of the Party the Half-breeds, was former representative, speaker of the House, and senator, James G. Blaine of Maine.\n\n\n\nPresident Arthur\u2019s forces won the first battle of the convention which involved the selection of a temporary chairman. John R. Lynch, an African-American delegate from Mississippi, was chosen as temporary chairman by a vote of 424 to 384. However, once the balloting for the presidential nomination began, former Senator Blaine took the lead winning on the fourth ballot. Senator John A. Logan of Illinois was the only name placed in nomination for vice president.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform called for regulation of the railroads, support for an eight-hour work day, restrictions on Chinese immigration, civil service reform, the creation of a bureau of labor, and an increase in the availability of public lands for settlers. On the tariff issue, the platform supported a high tariff \u201cnot for revenue only, but\u2026to afford security to our diversified industries and protection to the rights and wages of the laborers.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1888 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1888 Republican convention was held in Chicago on June 19 - 25. Former senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana won the nomination for president and former U.S. representative Levi Parsons Morton of New York won the nomination for vice president. Harrison would go on to win the presidency, defeating President Grover Cleveland.\n\n\n\nSeventeen African-American delegates attended the convention, during which Frederick Douglass became the first African-American to win a vote in presidential balloting at a major party convention. He received one vote.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included support for protective tariffs, repeal of taxes on tobacco, support for the use of gold and silver as currency and support for pensions for veterans. The party also expressed its opposition to polygamy. Top of Page Home\n\n1892 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, was the site of the 1892 Republic Convention on June 7 - 11 in a new convention hall dedicated and opened on June 6.\n\n\n\nThe incumbent president, Benjamin Harrison, won easily on the first ballot over William McKinley of Ohio and James G. Blaine of Maine. Blaine served in Harrison\u2019s cabinet as Secretary of State until his surprise resignation just a few days before the convention. Neither Blaine nor McKinley ever publicly announced as candidates for the presidency, though both were popular at the convention and McKinley presided over the convention as permanent chairman. The incumbent vice president, Levi P. Morton, was dropped in favor of Whitelaw Reid, ambassador to France and former editor of the New York Tribune. Reid was nominated by acclamation, the first time this procedure was used at a Republican Convention instead of the customary roll call vote to select the national ticket.\n\n\n\nThe platform was adopted by a voice vote and was similar to that of the Democratic Party on many issues, including support for constructing a canal in Nicaragua, bi-metallic currency with gold and silver valued equally, and sympathy for Ireland\u2019s struggle for home rule. The Republican platform differed from that of the Democrats in its clear support for a protective tariff and sympathy for the prohibition efforts. A foreign policy plank reaffirmed the Monroe doctrine and \"achievement of the manifest destiny of the Republic in its broadest sense.\" Top of Page Home\n\n1896 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 11th Republican convention was held in St. Louis on June 16 - 18, 1896. William McKinley of Ohio won the nomination for president and Garrett A. Hobart of New Jersey won the nomination for vice president.\n\n\n\nCandidates in contention for the nomination for president were Senator Matthew Stanley Quay from Pennsylvania, Governor Levi Morton of New York, Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed of Maine and Senator William B. Allison from Iowa.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included support for the gold standard and high protective tariffs. Twenty-four Western delegates, led by Senator Henry Teller of Colorado, walked out of the convention when their minority plank calling for the unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the ratio of 16-to-1 was defeated. During this convention the Republican platform denounced the practice of lynching. Top of Page Home\n\n1900 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, was the meeting place for the 1900 Republican convention, which was held on June 19 - 21. The Party was united in support of the renomination of President William McKinley. With no opposition, he won all 926 votes on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nThe focus of the convention was on the selection of a vice presidential candidate. Vice President Garret Augustus Hobart of New Jersey had died in office in 1899. Privately, President McKinley supported Senator William B. Allison of Iowa, but when Allison withdrew his name for consideration, McKinley left the decision to the convention. The popular New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt, at the time forty-one years old, secured the nomination on the first ballot, receiving every vote but one. Roosevelt\u2019s rise to the vice presidential nomination was aided by the support of New York political boss Tom Platt, who was eager to eliminate the reform-minded Roosevelt from New York politics. As the vice presidential candidate, Roosevelt traveled 21,000 miles, visited twenty-four states, and gave approximately 700 speeches.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform lauded the accomplishments of President McKinley, crediting him with improving business conditions and winning the Spanish-American War. Other planks in the platform defended postwar expansionism, called for the creation of a department of commerce, condemned southern laws designed to keep African-Americans from the polls, supported raising the age limit for child labor, and favoring the construction of a canal in Panama. Top of Page Home\n\n1904 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION The 1904 Republican convention was held in Chicago on June 21 - 23. Incumbent President Theodore Roosevelt of New York won the nomination for president and Senator Charles W. Fairbanks from Indiana won the nomination for vice president. President Roosevelt went on to win a landslide victory over Democrat Alton B. Parker, an American jurist of New York.\n\n\n\nThere were twelve African-American delegates and four women who served as alternates at the convention.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included supporting protective tariffs, an increase in foreign trade, maintaining the gold standard and favoring legislation that would support the U.S. merchant marine. Top of Page Home\n\n1908 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1908 Republican convention was held in the Chicago Coliseum on June 16 - 19. William Howard Taft and James S. Sherman were nominated as the presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\n\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt had pledged in 1904 that he would not accept the Republican nomination for the presidency in 1908. Roosevelt worked to influence the choice of the party, however, and supported Secretary of War Taft as his preference. The party was split over Taft, with some feeling he was too conservative and cut from the same cloth as Roosevelt, while others felt he was too progressive in financial matters. Roosevelt\u2019s endorsement of Taft virtually guaranteed him the nomination. Taft overwhelmingly won the nomination on the first ballot, beating out such contenders as Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks, Speaker of the House Joseph G. Cannon and Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe 1908 Republican convention was significant for several reasons. For the first time women served as full delegates. Two female delegates from Utah, Lucy Clark and Susa Young Gates attended the convention. The convention was also noteworthy in that the primary system of selecting state-at-large delegates was used by some states for the first time. Prior to this, delegates had been selected by congressional district. This convention allowed for both selection processes.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the Republican platform included greater protections for railroad and government employees through enactment of employer liability laws, safety appliance statutes, shorter work hours and compensation to injured workers; and, establishment of an eight-hour work day for those in public works. The party also demanded equal justice for all and the enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution. Top of Page Home\n\n1912 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION The 1912 Republican convention was one of the most divisive political gatherings in U.S. history, held in Chicago on June 18 - 22. Three men were in contention for the party\u2019s nomination: incumbent President William Howard Taft, \u201cFighting Bob\u201d Robert M. La Follette and Theodore Roosevelt, running for an unprecedented third term. Although Roosevelt dominated the earlier primaries, Taft\u2019s control over the party machinery allowed him to withstand delegate challenges brought by Roosevelt, which ensured that only two names were placed in nomination for the ticket: Taft and La Follette. Taft won easily on the first ballot with 556 votes, although 348 delegates present at the convention abstained from voting in protest. Many of those who abstained joined Roosevelt in the new Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d Party.\n\n\n\nVice President James S. Sherman was easily renominated. Sherman, however, was in failing health and died a few days before the election in which Democrats Woodrow Wilson and Thomas R. Marshall won in an electoral vote landslide. The Republican Party platform included stipulations favoring judicial reform as well as legislation outlawing corporate contributions to presidential, vice presidential and congressional campaigns. A record number sixty-five African-American delegates attended the 1912 convention.\n\n\n\nHaving stated that he would accept the nomination of the \u201chonestly elected majority,\u201d the Progressive Party nominated Theodore Roosevelt for president during a convention held in August 1912. Women held leadership positions in the Bull Moose Party, which endorsed women\u2019s suffrage. In the general election Roosevelt received 27 percent of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes; no third-party candidate has fared so well since the election of 1912. Top of Page Home\n\n1916 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\n\n\nTo heal the rift between the Republican and Progressive parties caused by the 1912 party convention, both factions met concurrently in Chicago beginning on June 7 to come to a consensus on a candidate and party platform. Despite initial disagreement at the Republican convention, 17 candidates were nominated, and Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who had not yet agreed to serve, held the lead through the first two votes, but did not carry a majority. Although the Progressive Party then nominated Roosevelt, he refused the nomination and Hughes won a majority for the Republican ticket on the third vote. Charles W. Fairbanks was nominated as vice president, easily winning the nomination on the first vote.\n\n\n\nDue to a new apportionment scheme, the Southern states lost 78 delegate seats, which amounted to more than one-third of their total in 1912. Thirty-five African-American delegates and five women delegates were present at the Republican convention. Many women attended as delegates to the Progressive Party convention.\n\n\n\nEqual rights for women was a separate plank in the Republican Party platform, which was influenced by Progressive Party politics from 1912 to1916. The Republican platform also called for a stronger national defense, creation of a tariff commission and the conservation of natural resources. In addition, the platform also condemned the Wilson administration for interference in Mexico and a lack of involvement in the Philippines. The convention adjourned on June 10. Top of Page\n\nHome\n\n1920 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe Republican convention was held in Chicago for the fifth consecutive time, on June 8 - 12. The postwar convention addressed the nation\u2019s place as a world power and debated formation of the League of Nations. The 19th amendment giving women the right to vote had passed in the Senate three days earlier, and women were represented in significant numbers for the first time with 27 delegates and 129 alternates. More than nine million women voted for the first time in the 1920 presidential election. Thirty-nine African-Americans attended as delegates. The widespread use of photography and film footage also affected the 1920 conventions and campaigns.\n\n\n\nAs the convention began, eleven men were nominated but no clear front-runner emerged. After four ballots, three candidates topped the list; Governor Frank Lowden of Illinois, Major General Leonard Wood of New Hampshire and Senator Hiram Johnson of California. Legend has it that party leaders working overnight in a \u201csmoke-filled room\u201d selected Warren G. Harding as a compromise candidate. During the next day\u2019s balloting, Harding\u2019s numbers slowly increased and he captured the nomination on the 10th ballot with 692 \u00bd votes. Calvin Coolidge easily defeated Irvine L. Lenroot of Oregon for the vice presidential ballot.\n\n\n\nWorld War I figured prominently in the party platform with allegations that the Democratic administration had exhibited unpreparedness for both war and peace. The platform also supported an end to lynching and for all states to ratify the women\u2019s suffrage amendment. Regarding foreign policy, the platform stated \u201cthat after a period of unexampled sacrifice, our motives are suspected, our moral influence impaired and our Government stands discredited and friendless among the nations of the world.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1924 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nCleveland, Ohio was the setting for the 1924 Republican convention, which met on June 10 - 12. There are two notable facts about this convention. This was the first national party convention to be broadcast on radio, and the convention rules were changed to elect women to the national committee. One man and one woman were chosen from each state and territory.\n\n\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge, who had assumed the office upon the death of President Warren G. Harding in August of 1923, was assured of the nomination with his primary wins and his work to eliminate the corruption of the Harding administration. Coolidge won on the first ballot with a total of 1,065 votes, with Senator Robert M. LaFollette of Wisconsin coming in second with thirty four votes.\n\n\n\nThe vice presidential nomination provided the excitement at the convention. President Coolidge\u2019s choice was Senator William E. Borah of Idaho, but he declined. Eight names were nominated and on the ballot. Former Illinois governor Frank O. Lowden led after the first and second ballots. Lowden astounded the convention delegates by refusing the nomination just as he was receiving the majority of the vote. Former budget bureau director Charles G. Dawes won on the third roll call vote.\n\n\n\nPlanks included in the Republic platform called for tax reduction, United States participation in the World Court but not in the League of Nations, the creation of a cabinet-level department of education and relief, aid to farmers by broadening export markets, federal encouragement of commercial aviation, and a federal anti-lynching law. Top of Page Home\n\n1928 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1928 Republican convention was held from June 12th through June 15th, in Kansas City, Missouri. With the announcement a year before by President Calvin Coolidge that he would not run for reelection, the front-runner for the nomination was Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Hoover entered the convention with 450 votes that he had won during the spring primaries. He was supported by women\u2019s groups and the former Progressive supporters of Theodore Roosevelt. Hoover won on the first ballot with 837 votes. Former governor Frank Lowden of Illinois was second with seventy two votes, and sixty four votes were cast for Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas.\n\n\n\nSenator Curtis was nominated for the vice presidential half of the ticket, and was virtually unopposed.\n\n\n\nThe delegates adopted the Republican platform as originally written by voice vote. The platform called for lower taxes, maintaining the protective tariff, the \u201cobservance and vigorous enforcement\u201d of Prohibition, the creation of a Federal Farm Board, and disclosure of campaign finances. Also in the platform was a plank expressing the Republican Party\u2019s belief in self-reliance and strong local government. The so-called \u201chome rule\u201d plank stated:\n\n\n\nThere is a real need of restoring the individual and local sense of responsibility and self-reliance; there is a real need for the people once more to grasp the fundamental fact that under our system of government they are expected to solve many problems themselves through their municipal and State governments, and to combat the tendency that is all too common to turn to the Federal Government as the easiest and least burdensome method of lightening their own responsibilities. Top of Page\n\nHome\n\n1932 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe delegates to the 1932 Republican convention held in Chicago on June 14 - 16 nominated Herbert Hoover for a second term as president. The mood of the convention was solemn because of the poor economy caused by the great Depression. Hoover\u2019s supporters claimed that the country\u2019s problems were the result of worldwide economic affairs and not the policies of the Hoover administration. Vice President Charles Curtis had stiff opposition in his bid for renomination. He was challenged by Major General James G. Harbord of Iowa. After failing to get a majority on the first ballot, Curtis rallied his forces and won on the second. Curtis is the only person with non-European ancestry to serve as vice president of the United States.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform of 1932 asserted that the economic crisis had been mitigated by the timely actions of Hoover. Negotiations with industry leaders prevented drastic cuts in wages. The National Credit Association was created and saved scores of banks from failure. Legislation was passed by Congress enabling the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to make loans to public institutions and private corporations. A Federal Farm Board was established to help farmers affected by falling prices.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform of 1932 also made the following proposals. The national, state and local governments should balance their budgets and curtail spending to levels that could be maintained without raising taxes. The United States should sponsor an international conference to discuss monetary policies, commodity prices and trade problems. Cooperative agricultural organizations should be strengthened. The United States should limit its military production and actively participate in disarmament programs. Government should promote a shorter work week. Foreign immigration to the United States should be limited by quotas. Improved regulation of interstate utilities and interstate commerce should be carried out by the Federal Power Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission. Prohibition should be continued. Top of Page Home\n\n1936 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nIn 1936 the Republican National Convention was held in Cleveland from June 9 - 12. Kansas Governor Alfred M. Landon was the runaway choice for President. Landon was one of a small number of Republicans who had managed to get reelected during the Depression. Landon did not attend the convention, but he sent a telegram that expressed his thoughts on these issues. He wanted a constitutional amendment to ensure safe working conditions for women and children. Landon proposed extending the civil service in federal departments to include all employees below the rank of assistant secretary. Landon defined \u201csound currency\u201d as currency that could be exchanged for gold. Landon was nominated on the first ballot with 984 votes out of 1,003. Landon\u2019s choice for a running mate was Frank Knox, the publisher of the Chicago Daily News. Knox won the unanimous support of the delegates on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform criticized the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Democrats as a threat to constitutional democracy. According to the Republicans, Roosevelt had usurped the powers of Congress, undermined the authority of the Supreme Court, and assumed under federal control operations that should have remained with the states. The Republicans called for unemployment relief to be returned to non-political local agencies. They pledged to reduce government spending, undertaking federal public works projects only on their merits and separate from the administration of unemployment relief. The platform called for balancing the budget and assuring the solvency of the currency. On foreign policy, the Republicans favored keeping the United States out of foreign entanglements. Top of Page Home\n\n1940 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe Republicans came to Philadelphia for their national convention June 24 - 28, 1940 determined to take the presidency away from the Democrats. In speeches before the nomination of a Republican candidate, Franklin Roosevelt was criticized for \u201cmarching toward one-man government.\u201d In the beginning, none of the 10 nominees for president had substantial control over the delegates. It was an open convention and this led to one of the most spectacular upsets in the history of the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nWhen the voting began, Thomas E. Dewey, a prominent attorney from New York, held the lead, with Senator Robert A. Taft finishing second and Wendell L. Willkie finishing third. Dewey had only 360 of the 501 votes needed to win. Willkie, who had never before run for public office, had built a reputation as a tough opponent to Roosevelt\u2019s public power projects. As the voting progressed through the first three ballots, Dewey lost support and a two-man race developed between Taft and Willkie. The shift of Michigan\u2019s votes to Willkie on the sixth ballot started a bandwagon for his nomination that resulted in his victory.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform adopted at the convention criticized the extension of federal power at the expense of private enterprise. For example, the Republicans approved of the unemployment relief and social security programs of the Roosevelt administration but called for the delegation of these responsibilities to the states. The platform firmly opposed involving the United States in the growing wars in Europe and the Far East. There were also proposals for amendments to the Constitution to limit the president to two terms in office and to promote equal rights for men and women. Top of Page Home\n\n1944 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nIn 1944 the Republican convention was held in Chicago from June 26 - 28. In the primaries the three major Republican candidates for president were New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, Ohio Governor John W. Bricker, and former Minnesota Governor Harold E. Stassen. Bricker and Stassen withdrew from the race before the convention. On the first ballot Dewey received all but one of the 1,057 votes cast. The one dissenting vote by a delegate from Wisconsin was for General Douglas MacArthur. Governor Bricker was the unanimous choice on the first ballot for vice president. Dewey came to Chicago to accept the nomination.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform in 1944 denounced Democratic rule since 1933 for centralizing power in the federal executive, increasing deficit spending, and failing to adequately promote private enterprise. The Republicans spoke in favor of continuing to strengthen and expand the armed forces until Germany and Japan were defeated. They supported the creation of a United Nations organization in the postwar period. The platform favored the establishment of a Fair Employment Practice Commission. The Republicans supported setting prices for agricultural products that would assure farmers an income comparable to those earned in business and industry. Top of Page Home\n\n1948 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nPhiladelphia was the venue for the 24th Republican convention; it met June 21 - 25 and was the first to be televised (as was the Democratic convention). The convention resulted in the nomination of Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York for president and Governor Earl Warren of California for vice president.\n\n\n\nThe Republicans adopted an extensive bipartisan foreign policy platform. It called for the strengthening of the United Nations and \u201cprimary recognition of America\u2019s self-interest in the liberty of other peoples,\u201d favored the unity of Western Europe, pressed for recognition of Israel and pledged friendship with China. The domestic component of the platform advocated the reduction of public debt, opposed racial segregation in the armed services, favored prompt enactment of legislation to end lynching, favored the abolition of the poll tax as a requisite to voting, pledged \u201cvigorous enforcement of existing laws against Communists,\u201d advocated the submission of a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for women and recommended \u201ceventual statehood for Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico, and self-government for the District of Columbia.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1952 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION The Republican convention of 1952, held July 7 - 11 in Chicago, led to the nomination of the popular war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower of Kansas for president and the nomination of Senator Richard M. Nixon of California for vice president. A very unpopular war was being fought in Korea, and the Republicans pledged to end it. They also promised to end \u201ccommunist subversion.\u201d\n\n\n\nCandidates in contention for the presidential nomination were such well-known names as Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, Governor Earl Warren of California, University of Pennsylvania President Harold Stassen and Army General Douglas MacArthur. Warren would go on to become the 14th chief justice of the Supreme Court (1953-1969) and one of the most influential justices in history.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included condemning the Roosevelt and Truman administrations and continued support for the Taft-Hartley Act, which severely restricted the activities of labor unions. Women delegates numbered 128 of the 1,206 delegates and 252 of the 1,206 alternates at the convention. Top of Page Home\n\n1956 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1956 Republican National Convention was held at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California, August 20 - 23, 1956. It was the 26th Convention and the 100th anniversary of the Republican Party. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice-President Richard M. Nixon were unanimously renominated in separate roll calls on August 22. The keynote speaker was Governor Arthur B. Langlie of Washington. The chairman of the convention was Joseph William Martin, Speaker of the House, 1947-49 and 1953-55 and House Minority Leader 19391959 (when not Speaker). Martin served as chairman of every Republican National Convention from 1940-1956.\n\n\n\nThe 1956 convention was a seemingly placid gathering with most of the drama occurring behind the scenes. Harold E. Stassen, President Eisenhower\u2019s special cabinet assistant on disarmament, believed that nominating someone other than Nixon for the vice presidential spot would make for a stronger ticket. (Stassen became famous for repeatedly running for president. He was a candidate for the Republican nomination in 1948, 1952, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980.) His choice for vice president was Christian A. Herter, Governor of Massachusetts. Stassen had taken a four-week leave of absence in the weeks leading up to the convention to campaign for Herter and tried to persuade convention delegates to support Herter. The only other strong opponent of Nixon at the convention was California Governor Goodwin J. Knight. At mid-day on August 22, however, after Herter had rejected Stassen\u2019s plan and Stassen had realized that most delegates supported Nixon, Stassen advised President Eisenhower that he was abandoning his effort to have Herter\u2019s name placed in nomination and asked to give a seconding speech for Nixon\u2019s nomination. That night, Eisenhower was placed in nomination in a speech by Representative Charles A Hallack of Indiana and Nixon was placed in nomination by Herter with Stassen making the seconding speech. Other speakers of note included former President Herbert C. Hoover and former New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey.\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party platform was adopted on August 21. It contained declarations of faith \u201cin the merciful providence of God\u201d and of determination in such areas as the economy\u2014both urban and rural, human welfare, integrity of the federal government , civil rights, immigration, human freedom and peace, national defense, aid to veterans, national defense, conservation of natural resources, and atomic energy. Eisenhower\u2019s acceptance speech on August 23 echoed many of these issues stressing that the Republican Party as the party of the future, because it is concerned with \u201clong-range principle, not short-term expedience\u201d and because it is \u201cdedicated to peace.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1960 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION The 1960 Republican convention was held in Chicago on July 25 - 28. Vice President Richard\n\nM. Nixon of California won the nomination for president and former senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. of Massachusetts won the nomination for vice president. Nixon was defeated by Sen. John F. Kennedy in the general election.\n\n\n\nBefore the convention, Nixon and Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York met secretly and forged a 14-point agreement on the major issues to be contained in the Republican platform. The meeting was dubbed the \u201ccompact of Fifth Avenue\u201d because it was hammered out in Rockefeller\u2019s Manhattan apartment.\n\n\n\nThere were twenty-two African-American delegates at this convention.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights called for a strong national defense, vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws to guarantee the right to vote and advocacy of an early agreement by all nations to forgo nuclear tests in the atmosphere. Top of Page Home\n\n1964 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1964 Republication National Convention met from July 13 - 16 in San Francisco, California and selected as its candidate Senator Barry M. Goldwater from Arizona. Although there were signs of tension between \u201cGoldwater conservatives\u201d and the moderate and liberal wings of the Republican party who preferred Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania or Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Senator Goldwater easily won the nomination on the first ballot. Goldwater selected as his vice presidential running mate the Republican national chairman, Representative William E. Miller of New York, who was the first Roman Catholic to appear on the Republican national ticket.\n\n\n\nParticularly noteworthy in Goldwater\u2019s acceptance speech was his dramatic assertion that \u201cextremism in the defense of liberty is no vice\u201d and that \u201cmoderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\u201d The Republican platform promised a strong stance against Communist regimes, a smaller role for the federal government, and support for individual rights. Top of Page Home\n\n1968 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1968 Republican convention convened in Miami Beach on August 5 - 8. Former vice president Richard Nixon of New York won the nomination for president on the first ballot and Governor Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland of won the nomination for vice president. Nixon went on to defeat Vice President Hubert H, Humphrey of Minnesota for the presidency.\n\n\n\nDuring this convention, Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, the first African-American elected to the Senate by popular vote, was elected as temporary chairman of the convention. There were also twenty-six African-American delegates in attendance.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights emphasized an honorable negotiated peace in Vietnam, vigorous efforts to resolve the \u201ccrisis in the cities\u201d and reduced taxes.\n\n\n\nThe Poor People\u2019s Campaign led by the Reverend Ralph D. Abernathy, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, held demonstrations outside the convention hall. Top of Page Home\n\n1972 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nIn 1972, the Republican National Convention was held in Miami Beach, Florida from August 21-23. President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew were renominated on their first ballots. The convention was carefully organized to take advantage of television coverage. Its five sessions took place over seventeen hours as compared to the Democrat\u2019s thirty hours. There was one debate on the floor concerning the 1976 apportionment of delegates. One plan proposed by Texas Senator John G. Tower and New York Representative Jack F. Kemp favored awarding bonus delegates based on a state\u2019s presidential vote. The other plan presented by Wisconsin Representative William A. Steiger tied the award of bonus delegates to congressional and gubernatorial elections. The Tower and Kemp plan was approved by the convention in a 910 to 434 roll call vote.\n\n\n\nThe Republican platform emphasized bringing the Vietnam War to a close with United States support for promoting a democratic government in the south to continue under a settlement that would allow all of the people of Southeast Asia to live in peace under political arrangements of their own choosing. The Republicans opposed granting amnesty to anyone who had evaded military service. They accused the Democrats of proposing tax reform intended to raise the taxes of the rich which would also significantly increase the taxes of the middle class. The Republican platform called for health care reform that would increase the coverage of Americans for catastrophic illnesses and accidents. Top of Page Home\n\n1976 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1976 Republican convention was held in Kansas City, Missouri on August 16 - 19. Incumbent President Gerald R. Ford won the nomination for president and Senator Robert J. Dole from Kansas won the nomination for vice president. Ford narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan, former governor of California, to win the nomination. Jimmy Carter would later defeat Ford to win the presidency.\n\n\n\nA rule that required a presidential candidate to name his vice presidential choice before the balloting began was voted on and defeated.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included supporting ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, commitment to a foreign policy in which secret agreements were banned, and opposition to federalizing the welfare system. Top of Page Home\n\n1980 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe Republican convention was held in Detroit on July 14 - 17. Former governor Ronald Reagan of California won the nomination for president and former U.S. representative George H.W. Bush of Texas won the nomination for vice president. After efforts to persuade former president Gerald Ford to join the ticket as vice president failed, Bush was chosen as Reagan\u2019s running mate. Reagan would go on to win the presidency in a landslide victory over incumbent President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\n\n1980 was a time of unease in the United States, both domestically as well as internationally. The economy was at a low point, and the Iran hostage crisis left many Americans feeling helpless and confused about the future of the country. Reagan promised to \u201cmake American great again.\u201d\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included promises of lower taxes, reductions in the welfare rolls and increased attention to national security. Top of Page Home\n\n1984 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1984 Republican convention met in Dallas on August 20 - 23 with 2,235 delegates in attendance. With President Reagan\u2019s renomination certain and his popularity high, the mood was jubilant. The nation\u2019s economy was recovering from the recession experienced in the early 1980s, inflation had subsided and employment levels were rebounding.\n\n\n\nGiven widespread approval of President Reagan\u2019s performance in his first term, the business of the 1984 Republican convention was straightforward. Reagan\u2019s 1984 nomination was the first uncontested Republican nomination since that of Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. The convention\u2019s program stressed the general themes of patriotism, economic prosperity and the personal popularity of Ronald Reagan. Speakers at the convention included several prominent Republican women to highlight the role of women in the party. The convention\u2019s keynote speaker was Treasurer of the United States Katherine Davalos Ortega.\n\n\n\nAs his running mate, Reagan again selected George H.W. Bush, his first-term vice president. The Republican platform, adopted without debate on August 21, promised to lower taxes further, support passage of a balanced budget amendment, oppose the use of quotas to remedy discrimination, support a constitutional amendment banning abortion and affirm a strong defensive posture against the Soviet Union. Reagan accepted the convention\u2019s nomination with a promise to complete the \u201cunfinished agenda\u201d of his first administration. Top of Page Home\n\n1988 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, was the site of the 1988 Republican Convention on August 15 - 18. The convention began with a farewell address to the delegates from President Ronald Reagan, who solidly praised his Vice President George H.W. Bush, stating that \u201cGeorge played a major role in everything that we have accomplished in these eight years.\u201d Bush had placed third in the Iowa caucuses behind Senator Robert Dole of Kansas and the Reverend Pat Robertson, but came back and won the New Hampshire primary gaining strength as his opponents dropped out of the race one by one. George H.W. Bush was nominated without opposition and won on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nBush\u2019s selection of Indiana Senator James Danforth (Dan) Quayle as his running mate was the surprise element at the convention. Quayle, a junior senator, was praised by Bush as being \u201ca man of the future.\u201d However, critics considered Quayle to be ill-equipped to handle the job, and the press immediately began to question his suitability for the position of vice president. Despite these concerns, Quayle was nominated by acclamation.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the Republican platform included opposition to increasing taxes, a call for child-care tax credits and catastrophic health insurance for children, a reduction in the capital gains tax, opposition to abortion, and support for constitutional amendments requiring a balanced budget and term limits for members of Congress. Top of Page Home\n\n1992 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 1992 Republican convention was convened in Houston on August 17 - 20. Incumbent Vice President George H.W. Bush of Texas won the nomination for president and Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana won the nomination for vice president.\n\n\n\nDuring the convention President Bush issued an apology and admitted he had made a mistake in failing to keep his famous 1988 \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge. Former President Reagan delivered the \u201clast chapter\u201d of his political career.\n\nThere were107 African-American delegates and 102 alternates at this convention.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party platform highlights included opposition to increased taxes, strengthening families and offering parental choice in their children\u2019s schools. Top of Page Home\n\n1996 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nSan Diego, California, was the setting for the 1996 Republican convention which convened on August 12th and ended on August 15th. Robert \u201cBob\u201d Dole of Kansas, the longest serving Republican leader in the Senate until his resignation to run for the presidency, was the frontrunner for the presidential nomination. Dole was a World War II veteran, who at seventy-three was the oldest man in United States history to run for president. He had served in the Kansas State Legislature and then in the House of Representatives. Dole ran for the Senate in 1968, serving until June of 1996. In 1976, Dole ran as the vice presidential candidate with President Gerald Ford, but was defeated by the Democratic ticket of Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale. Bob Dole won on the first ballot receiving 1,928 of the 1,990 delegate votes. The theme of the 1996 Republican convention was \u201ccompassion and conservatism.\u201d\n\n\n\nDole chose as his vice presidential candidate former Representative Jack Kemp, a conservative from New York. Kemp was a former NFL quarterback for the Buffalo Bills football team, who had served nine consecutive terms in the House of Representatives. A proponent of tax cuts and reduced regulation to stimulate economic activity, Kemp reflected the economic philosophy of former president Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\nDespite the emphasis on inclusion, moderation, and diversity reflected in the speeches given at the convention, the Republic platform was strictly conservative and reflected the views of the ideological right wing of the Party. The abortion plank had been the subject of a long and protracted behind-the-scenes struggle in the platform deliberations held the week before the convention. The conservative stance advocating the rights of the unborn prevailed and was included in the platform. Other planks called for tax relief, balancing the budget, improving education, affordable health care, regulatory reform, rejecting statehood for the District of Columbia, and support for the official recognition of English as the nation\u2019s common language. Top of Page Home\n\n2000 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 2000 Republican convention was held in Philadelphia on July 31-August 3. The 2,066 delegates nominated Texas Governor George W. Bush for President. The Republican Party attempted to make history with this nomination. The election of Bush, the son of the 41st President, George H.W. Bush, would give America its second father-son presidential pair. Richard \u201cDick\u201d Cheney, former U.S. Secretary of Defense, was nominated as vice president.\n\n\n\nThe year 2000 was considered a time of economic prosperity and budget surpluses. The nominees\u2019 speeches were highly critical of the Clinton-Gore Administration, accusing it of squandering the surplus for no great purposes. They focused on ways to use these surpluses chiefly through tax cuts, which would benefit all taxpayers and not just the wealthy. The campaign reaffirmed their opposition to homosexuality in the military but also showcased Bush\u2019s slogan of \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d\n\n\n\nTraditionally, the convention holds its \u201croll call\u201d in one night. In 2000, the Bush campaign arranged for the voting to take place over several nights in order to build support for Bush throughout the week, ending with vice presidential nominee Richard Cheney\u2019s home state of Wyoming.\n\n\n\nAfrican American General Colin L. Powell gave the keynote address to the Republican delegates, of whom only four percent were black. Among the other speakers were the nominee\u2019s wife, Laura, as well as Hispanics and a gay House member, Jim Kolbe. Top of Page Home\n\n2004 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 2004 Republican Convention was held in New York City on August 30 - September 2.\n\nIncumbent George W. Bush was nominated for president, and Vice President Richard \u201cDick\u201d Cheney also won renomination.\n\n\n\nThe theme of the convention was \u201cFulfilling America\u2019s Promise by Building a Safer World and a More Hopeful America.\u201d Mr. Bush outlined his plans to create jobs, expand health care, and broaden educational opportunities while criticizing John Kerry, his Democratic opponent, for his weak and wavering record on national security and the economy. With the approaching third year anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, Mr. Bush reminded the country that he was the only safe choice in an age of terrorist threats.\n\n\n\nThe keynote address was given by Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat who\n\nvoted with the Republicans. Not in attendance was highly respected Nancy Reagan, the widow of President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the Republican Party platform included a reaffirmation of the fight against terrorism, and a call for constitutional amendments to guarantee that the \u201cunborn child has a fundamental individual right to life,\u201d and to protect marriage by defining it as a union between a man and a woman. Top of Page Home\n\n2008 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION\n\nThe 2008 Republican Convention met in St. Paul, Minnesota on September 1-4. The first day proceedings were greatly curtailed due to concern over Hurricane Gustav. Gustav had come ashore in Louisiana and was threatening the city of New Orleans, which is still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Arizona Senator John McCain, the impending Republican presidential nominee, monitored hurricane developments while First Lady Laura Bush and Cindy McCain, the nominee\u2019s wife, made short speeches to the delegates at the abbreviated session. The convention was able to resume a normal schedule on September 2, when it was apparent that the hurricane damage was not as extensive as originally forecast.\n\n\n\nSenator McCain won 1,504 delegates in state primaries and caucuses, to secure the nomination, beating his primary opponents, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and former Arkansas Governor Michael \u201cMike\u201d Huckabee. During the roll call of states on Wednesday, September 3, Senator McCain won the nomination when his home state of Arizona was allowed to vote out of order giving him more than the required number of delegates to declare him the winner on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nSenator McCain\u2019s surprise and historic choice for vice president was Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. Sarah Palin is the first woman governor of Alaska, first elected in 2006. Prior to becoming governor, Ms. Palin served two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska, city council and two terms as mayor/manager. The married mother of five children, Sarah Palin is only the second woman to appear on a national party presidential ticket. Former vice president Walter Mondale selected Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate for the Democratic Party ticket in the 1984 presidential election. Governor Palin gave her acceptance speech before the convention delegates on Wednesday, September 3, prior to her nomination by acclamation on Thursday, September 4.\n\n\n\nThe 2008 Republican platform called for an increase in personnel and resources for intelligence gathering capabilities in order to combat terrorism and provide security for all Americans; support for the Armed Forces, including better economic opportunities and health and disability care for veterans; opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants and support for legislation to designate English as the official language of the United States; United Nations reform; tax relief to grow the economy and promote small business; and government reform, including the adoption of a balanced budget act and ending earmarks in legislation. With respect to energy needs and global climate change, the platform plank supported nuclear energy and off-shore and on-shore drilling for oil within the United States, alternative energy resources, and the promotion of international cooperation for solving the problem of global warming.\n\nTop of Page Home"}, {"url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/74190780/", "page_content": "The books in this collection are in the public domain and are free to use and reuse.\n\nCredit Line: Library of Congress\n\nMore about Copyright and other Restrictions.\n\nFor guidance about compiling full citations consult Citing Primary Sources."}, {"url": "https://digital.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-lincoln%3A37432", "page_content": "1\n\nFIRST DAY\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, HELD AT CHICAGO, MAY 16, 17 and 18, 1860.\n\nAt 12 o'clock on Wednesday, the 16th day of May, 1860, the delegations from various states of the Confederacy, appointed in pursuance of a call issued by the Republican National Committee, assembled in the Wigwam, at Chicago.\n\nHON.

He said:\n\nOn the twenty-second of December last, the Republican National Committee, at a meeting convened for the purpose in the city of New York, issued a call for a National Convention, which I will now read:\n\n\"A National Republican Convention will meet at Chicago, on Wednesday, the 16th day of May next, at twelve o'clock, noon, for the nomination of candidates to be supported for President and Vice-President at the next election.\"\n\n\"The Republican electors of the several states, the members of the People's Party of Pennsylvania and of the Opposition Party of New Jersey, and all others who are willing to cooperate with them in support of the candidates which shall there be nominated, and who are opposed to the policy of the\n\n2\n\n3\n\npresent administration, to federal corruption and usurpation, to the extension of slavery into the territories, to the new and dangerous political doctrine that the constitution of its own force carries slavery into all the Territories of the United States, to the opening of the African slave trade, to any inequality of rights among citizens; and who are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas into the Union, under the constitution recently adopted by its people, of restoring the federal administration to a system of rigid economy and to the principles of Washington and Jefferson, of maintaining inviolate the rights of the states and defending the soil of every state and territory from lawless invasion, and of preserving the integrity of this Union and the supremacy of the constitution and laws passed in pursuance thereof against the conspiracy of the leaders of a sectional party, to resist the majority principle as established in this government even at the expense of its existence, are invited to send from each state two delegates from every congressional district, and four delegates at large, to the Convention.\"Edwin D. Morgan, New York, Chairman.Joseph Bartlett, Maine.George G. Fogg, New Hampshire.Lawrence Brainard, Vermont.John Z. Goodrich, Massachusetts.Gideon Welles, Connecticut.Thomas Williams, Pennsylvania.George Harris, Maryland.Alfred Caldwell, Virginia.Thomas Spooner, Ohio.Cassius M. Clay, Kentucky.James Sherman, New Jersey.Cornelius Cole, California.James Ritchey, Indiana.Norman B. Judd, Illinois.Zachariah Chandler, Michigan.John H.

Schoolfield, Tennessee.E. D. Williams, Delaware.\n\nIn compliance therewith, the people have sent representatives here to deliberate upon measures for carrying into effect the objects of the call.\n\nUsage has made it my duty to take the preliminary step toward organizing the Convention--a Convention upon the proceedings of which, permit me to say, the most momentous results are depending. No body of men of equal number was ever clothed with greater responsibility than those now within the hearing of my voice. You do not need me to tell you, gentlemen, what this responsibility is. While one portion of the adherents of the National administration are endeavoring to insert a slave code into the party platform, another portion exhibits its readiness to accomplish the same result through the action of the Supreme Court of the United States [applause]; willing by indirection to do that which, if done directly, would bring a blush even to the cheek of modern Democracy. [Cheers and laughter.]\n\nWhile these and other stupendous wrongs, absolutely shocking to the moral sentiment of the country, are to be fastened upon the people by the party in power, if its leaders are able to bring the factious elements that compose it into any degree of unanimity, there seems left no ray of hope except in the good sense of this Convention. [Great applause.]\n\nLet me then invoke you to act in a spirit of harmony, that by the dignity, the wisdom and the patriotism displayed here you may be enabled to enlist the hearts of the people, and to\n\n4\n\nstrengthen them in the faith that yours is the constitutional party of the country, and the only constitutional party; that you are actuated by principle, and that you will be guided by the light and by the example of the fathers of the republic. [Renewed cheers].\n\nFortunately you are not required to enunciate new and untried principles of government. This has been well and wisely done by the statesmen of the revolution. [Applause.] Stand where they stood, avowing and maintaining the like objects and doctrines; then will the end sought be accomplished; the constitution and the Union be preserved; and the government be administered by patriots and statesmen.\n\nFor temporary President, I now nominate Hon. David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania. [Great and prolonged applause.]\n\nThe nomination was acceded to by the unanimous voice of the Convention, and the Chairman appointed Hon. WM. L. Marshall, of Maryland, and Hon. C. F. Cleveland, of Connecticut, to conduct the temporary President to the Chair.\n\nThe appearance of Mr. Wilmot was made the opportunity for loud and prolonged manifestations of applause.\n\nIn introducing the temporary President to the Convention Gov. Cleveland said:\n\nGentlemen of the Convention: I have now the high honor of introducing to the Convention a gentleman whose name is known to every lover of liberty throughout this land, the Hon. David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania--a man who dares to do the right, regardless of consequences. With such men for our leaders and spokesmen, there is no such word as fail. [Loud cheers.]\n\nOn taking the Chair, Mr. Wilmot said:\n\nI have no words in which properly to express my sense of honor--and the undeserved one, I think it is--of being called upon to preside temporarily over the deliberations of this Convention. I shall not attempt a task which I feel\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\ninadequate to perform. Be sure, gentlemen, that I am not insensible to this high and undeserved honor. I shall carry the recollection of it, and of your manifestation of partiality, with me until the day of my death. It is not necessary for me, gentlemen, delegates, to remind you of the importance of the occasion that has called this assemblage together; nor of the high duties which devolve upon you. A great sectional and aristocratic party, or interest, has for years dominated with a high hand over the political affairs of this country. That interest has wrested, and is now wresting, all the great powers of this government to the one object of the extension and nationalization of slavery. It is our purpose, gentlemen, it is the mission of the Republican party and the basis of its organization, to resist this policy of a sectional interest. It is our mission to restore this government to its original policy, and place it again in that rank upon which our fathers organized and brought it into existence. It is our purpose and our policy to resist these new constitutional dogmas that slavery exists by virtue of the constitution wherever the banner of this Union floats. It is our purpose to restore the constitution to its original meaning; to give to it its true interpretation; to read that instrument as our fathers read it. [Applause ] That instrument was not ordained and established for the purpose of in trenching slavery within the limits of this country; it was not ordained and established for the purpose of giving high guarantees and securities to that institution. Our fathers regarded slavery as a blot upon this country. They went down into their graves with the earnest hope and confident belief that but a few more years and that blot would be extinguished from our land. [Much applause.] This was the faith in which they died. [Applause.] Had the proposition been presented to them in the early conflicts of the revolution, or outside of that grand movement, that they were called upon to endure the hazards, trials and sacrifices of that long and perilous contest for the purpose of establishing on this continent a great slave empire, not one of them would have drawn his sword in such a cause. [Greatapplause] No, citizens! This republic was established for the purpose of securing the guarantees of liberty, of justice and of righteousness to the people and to their posterity. That was the great object with which the revolution was fought, these were the purposes for which the union and constitution were formed. Slavery is sectional. Liberty national. [Immense applause.] Fellow citizens: need I remind this intelligent and vast audience--need I call to mind to the intelligent gentlemen who represent the various states represented upon this floor--manifestations of lawless violence, of tyranny such; is the world never saw in a civilized and Christian land that is manifested by this spirit of slavery. Whose rights are secure where slavery has the power to trample them under foot? Who to-day is not more free to utter his opinions within the empire of Russia, or under the shadow of the despotism of Austria than he is within the limits of the slave states of this Republic? Will their tyranny be confined to those states when they have the power to enforce it upon us? [Voices--\"No! never!\" We owe the liberty which we to-day enjoy in the free states, to the absence of slavery. And, fellow citizens, shall we, in building up this great empire of ours, in fulfilling that high and sacred trust imposed upon us by our fathers--shall we support this blighting, this demoralizing institution throughout the vast extent of our borders? [Voices, loudly--\"No!\"] Or shall we preserve this land as a free land to our posterity forever? These are the principles for which the Republican party is struggling. Fellow citizens, the safety of our liberty, the security of all we hold valuable, demands that we should take possession of this government and administer it upon those broad constitutional doctrines that were recognized for the first sixty years of the existence of our government -- that were recognized by Washington, by Jefferson, by Adams, by Madison, by Monroe, by Adams the younger, by Jackson, by Van Buren, even down to the time of Polk, when this new dogma was started that the constitution was established to guarantee to slavery perpetual existence and unlimited empire. Invoking, fellowcitizens, a spirit of patriotism and harmony, and trusting that that spirit will guide us to a fortunate result in our deliberations, I will now enter upon the discharge of the duties which have been assigned to me. [Great applause.]\n\nHon. Thomas Spooner, of Ohio, moved that Frederick Hassaurek, of Ohio, Theodore M. Pomeroy, of New, York, and Henry T. Blow, of Missouri, be elected temporary Secretaries.\n\nThe motion was carried unanimously.\n\nThe President then introduced the Rev. Z. H. Humphrey, Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, of Chicago, who addressed the Throne of Grace in the following prayer:\n\nOh, Lord God! Thou art great and greatly to be praised. We come before Thy Throne to worship and also to learn Thy will. We invoke Thy presence and Thy blessing, as we gather beneath this roof to-day. We praise Thee for what Thou art, and for what Thou hast done for us. Verily, \"our lines have fallen to us in pleasant places, and we have a goodly heritage.\" Thou hast strengthened the bars of our gates, and placed our children within them. Thou hast made peace in our borders, and filled us with the finest of the wheat. Thou hast not dealt so by any nation. As for Thy judgments we have not known them; and yet we confess that we have deserved to suffer for we have sinned against Thee. We entreat Thy forgiveness for all our transgressions, and Thy protection from all consequences of sin. We pray for our common country. We ask that Thou wilt deliver us from all the evil to which we are exposed, and that Thou wilt make us to shake off and put away all those evils which we are too apt to cherish. Wilt Thou bless our rulers, and teach them to govern in the fear of God, and in the love of man. Wilt Thou deliver us from corruption, from oppression and from selfish ambition. Show us Thy way of rescuing the oppressed from the house of bondage, and of making this country truly and consistently free. We crave Thy blessing upon this Convention, and pray that Thou wilt enable all those who are\n\n8\n\nhere gathered to act, amid the excitements of the hour, as feeling their responsibility to their fellow men, and as knowing that they will one day stand before Thee. Wilt Thou bless us in all that we do? Wilt Thou rule amid all the conflicts of opinion and the strifes of parties; and may the issue be for Thy glory, and for our good. May there be no strife, but that of brethren loving, while yet in opinion disagreeing. Let not the ploughshare of division be permanently driven through our fair land. May we live as a Christian country; and though we put not our trust in princes, may we be that happy land whose God is the Lord, which we ask through Jesus Christ, our Saviour: Amen!\n\nMr. Norman B. Judd, of Illinois, moved that a committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory represented in the Convention, or selected by the delegates thereof, who should report officers to the Convention for its permanent organization.\n\nThe motion was carried.\n\nMr. Judd moved that the roll of both states be now called for the purpose of selecting the committee.\n\nThe motion was carried.\n\nThe states were then called, and the committee constituted as follows:\n\nMaine, Leonard Andrews. Vermont, Hugh L. Henry. New Hampshire, Aaron H. Cragin. Massachusetts, Linus B. Comins. Connecticut, Arthur B. Calef. Rhode Island, Simon H. Greene. New York, Henry H. Van Dyck. New Jersey, Ephraim Marsh. Pennsylvania, T. J. Coffey. Delaware, Joshua T. Heald. Maryland, James Jeffries. Virginia, Edward M. Norton.\n\n9\n\nOhio, V. B. Horton. Indiana, P. A. Hackleman. Illinois, William Ross. Michigan, Walter W. Murphy. Wisconsin, John P. McGregor. Iowa, James F. Wilson. Minnesota, Simeon Smith. Missouri, Allen Hammer. Kansas, A. C. Wilder. California Samuel Bell. Oregon, Frank Johnson. Kentucky, Allen A. Burton. Texas, M. T. E. Chandler. Nebraska, O. H. Irish. District Columbia, George B. Hall.\n\nA delegate from Kentucky suggested that the names of all the states of the Union be called.\n\nThe President then proceeded to call Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nNo responses were made to the calls.\n\nHon. Jacob Benton, of New Hampshire, moved that a committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory represented in the Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, to act on the credentials of delegates, rules and appointments, and that they be instructed to make a report of the number, name and post office address of each delegate, together with rules for the government of the Convention.\n\nA delegate from Indiana suggested that the motion of Mr. Benton be divided--that two committees be appointed, one on credentials, and the other on the order of business.\n\nMr. Spooner, of Ohio: If I understand, it is intended that we should have two committees, or it was so suggested by\n\n10\n\nthe Executive Committee, and we had acted in accordance with that suggestion. I would suggest that there be simply a Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Benton accepted the amendment proposed by the delegate from Indiana, and the President called the will of the states, and the committee was constituted as follows:\n\nMaine, Rensselaer Cram. New Hampshire, Jacob Benton. Vermont, Edward C. Redington. Massachusetts, Timothy Davis. Connecticut, E. K. Foster. Rhode Island, Benedict Lapham. New York, Palmer V. Kellogg. New Jersey, Moses M. Webb. Pennsylvania, J. N. Purviance. Delaware, Lewis Thompson. Maryland, William E. Cole. Virginia, Jacob Hornbrook. Kentucky, Charles Pendley. Ohio, Samuel Stoksley. Indiana, John R. Cravens. Illinois, Stephen T. Logan. Michigan, Frank Quinn. Wisconsin, H. L. Rann. Iowa, C. F. Clarkson. Minnesota, John McCusick. Missouri, James G. Gardenhire. Kansas, William A. Phillips. Nebraska, John R. Meredeth. California, Charles Watrous. Oregon, Joel Burlingame. Texas, D. Henderson. District Columbia, James A. White.\n\n11\n\nMr. Noble, of Iowa, moved that a committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory, represented in the Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, to prepare the order of business for the Convention. The motion was carried.\n\nOn calling the roll of the states by the president, the following gentlemen were constituted such committee:\n\nMaine, John L. Stevens. New Hampshire, B. F. Martin. Vermont, Edward D. Mason. Massachusetts, Samuel Hooper. Connecticut, George H. Noble. Rhode Island, Nath. B. Durfee. New York, A. B. James. New Jersey, H. N. Congar. Pennsylvania, William D. Kelly. Delaware, John C. Clarke. Maryland, William P. Ewing. Virginia, John G. Jenks. Ohio, R. M. Corwine. Kentucky, Louis M. Dembitz. Indiana, Walter March. Michigan, Austin Blair. Illinois, Thomas A. Marshall. Wisconsin, Elisha Morrow. Minnesota, S. P. Jones. Iowa, Reuben Noble. Missouri, Thomas G. Fletcher. California, J. C. Hinckley. Oregon, Eli Thayer. Kansas, A. G. Proctor. Nebraska, Samuel H. Elbert. District Columbia, Joseph Gerhard. Texas, G. Moyers\n\n12\n\nA delegate from Pennsylvania moved that the rules of the House of Representatives be adopted for the government of the Convention until otherwise ordered. The motion was carried.\n\nHon. Ephraim Marsh, of New Jersey, moved that the Secretary call the names of the respective States in the order in which they are called in the Congress of the United States, and that as they were called the delegates from each State present their credentials.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I supposed that we had just constituted a Committee on Credentials, and my purpose for voting for that committee was to get rid of all the labor of doing their work. Now it is proposed to take the labor out of their hands and do it here in the Convention. Having voted it once to be done by the committee I do not want it brought back here, and I shall vote against any such proceeding. I move to lay the motion on the table.\n\nMr. Marsh: I withdraw the resolution.\n\nMr. Greeley, of Oregon: I would like to move a substitute to that resolution. In place of it I move that the roll of the States be now called over, and as each is called the chairman of that delegation present the credentials of that delegation, and if any question arises as to the credentials, or right of any to sit here, let it be referred to the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Carter: I move an amendment. I move to amend the proposition of the gentleman from Oregon, or New York, (Mr. Greeley,) I am not sure which [Laughter], that instead of each delegation presenting their credentials here, they present them to the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Greeley: I accept the amendment of the gentleman from Maryland, or Rhode Island, I am not particular which. [Laughter and applause.]\n\n13\n\nThe motion of Mr. Greeley was then carried.\n\nMr. Carter inquired if the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Greeley) adopted his amendment.\n\nMr. Greeley replied that he had.\n\nA gentleman from Pennsylvania inquired who the chairman of the Committee on Credentials was.\n\nThe President stated that the committee would be announced soon.\n\nMr. Greeley: Now I trust that the Convention sees the propriety of the course I suggested, of producing the credentials at once, here, and referring disputed questions to the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Evarts, of New York: Upon this Committee of Credentials each state and territory has a member; why should not, then, each state and territory commit, its credentials to its member of that committee, to be presented to it?\n\n[Voices: That's the way.]\n\nMr. Evarts: I move accordingly, that the credentials of each delegation be handed to its member of the Committee on Credentials, to be presented to that body.\n\nA delegate of Ohio: A resolution has already passed requiring that the credentials be committed to the chairman of the Committee on Credentials, and I rose to suggest that what is done by an agent is done by the party, and without this motion at all they can pass them through their committee man to the chairman of the committee.\n\nThe President: Is the gentleman from New York satisfied that his resolution is covered by the one passed?\n\nMr. Evarts: Undoubtedly, if it is understood that no call of the states is necessary.\n\n14\n\nThe President: No call is necessary under any resolution yet passed.\n\nThe President announced the reception of the following invitation:\n\nChicago, May 16, 1860.\n\nTo the President of the Republican Convention: The Board of Trade of this city hereby invite the delegates to your Convention, and other visitors to our city, to a short excursion on Lake Michigan; the excursion to leave the dock at Bush Street bridge, near the Richmond House, at five o'clock this afternoon.\n\nSigned, J. S. RAMSEY,\n\nChairman of the Committee.\n\nHon. Aaron Goodrich, of Minnesota: I have been requested, in behalf of the Board of Trade of this city, to elicit, so far as may be by a mere remark and not a speech, what shall be the sentiment of this Convention touching that proposition from the Board of Trade. When I cast my eye about this vast tabernacle, that has been reared by the skill, the taste and the munificence of the ladies and gentlemen of Chicago, and which has been tendered to the great Republican cause without money and without price [great applause], I apprehend that every delegate in this Convention will respond aye to the invitation. I have nothing more to say. [Great applause.]\n\nMr. Dudley, of New Jersey: I move, Sir, that there be a committee of five appointed to inform the Board of Trade that we accept the invitation for five o'clock, and that the committee be appointed by the Chair.\n\nA delegate from Iowa: I move you that it be embraced in that resolution that the thanks of this Convention be tendered to the Board of Trade for their very liberal offer.\n\nAmendment accepted, and resolution as amended adopted.\n\n15\n\n[Three cheers for the ladies of Chicago were called for and heartily responded to.]\n\nMr. Greeley: Have we provided for the Committee on Platform?\n\nThe president: We have not.\n\nMr. Greeley: Then I move we have a call of the states for the purpose of appointing a Committee on Platform.\n\nThe President: Will that be in order until after the permanent organization?\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I move the appointment of a committee of one from each state by the respective delegations from the several states, to report resolutions and a platform, and that the committee be made up in the ordinary manner by calling the roll of the states.\n\nThe President: The gentleman from Oregon has already moved that.\n\nMr. Greeley: I withdraw mine.\n\nMr. B. Oyler, of Indiana: I move to lay the motion on the table, until after the permanent organization.\n\nGov. Reeder, of Pennsylvania: Will the Chair inform the Convention what motion is before it?\n\nThe president stated the motion of Mr. Carter.\n\nGov. Reeder: I rise to oppose the motion. It is the business of this Convention now to perfect its organization. You have appointed a Committee on Credentials, on the Order of Business, and on Permanent Organization, and because we are not organized it seems to me improper.\n\nA voice (on the opposite side of the house): Speak louder--we cannot hear you.\n\n16\n\nGov. Reeder: All I have to say is not worth talking to those at the other end of the platform. I merely desire to say, that I think this motion, at this time, is out of place. It will be time enough to provide for a platform and resolutions when we shall have organized this Convention, and we are appointing committees now simply because we are not organized. This matter of a platform and resolutions is not a preliminary affair. It is not at all necessary to our organization, and therefore it is upon the same footing with the Domination of a candidate, and should wait until the permanent and perfect organization of the Convention before it should be entered upon.\n\nMr. Carter: I made that motion with the view of putting the Convention at work; whether the resolution is passed to-day or to-morrow, it will be passed by the same body of men, and with the view to the declaration of their sentiments. It is a laborious work, and ought to be performed while the Convention is in its vigor. The Chairman cannot fail to have remarked the indisposition to labor, when within fifteen minutes after getting together, a pleasure excursion is voted here. I hope it will be a pleasant one, but I think before we take it, we had better designate those who will enter upon the performances of the sphere of labor in this Convention, and we can do it as well now as at any time.\n\nMr. Eli Thayer, of Oregon: I am opposed to the amendment which has been offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I do not consider that the mere appointment of this committee is at all inconsistent with the preliminary business of this Convention. It is not proposed and it is not expected that this committee will report to-day. It is important, as the gentleman who preceded me has said, that this committee should have ample time to consider what shall be the platform of the Republican party in the coming campaign. This, sir, is the great burden of the work of this Convention, and I hope there will be no time lost in appointing\n\n17\n\nthis committee, and that they themselves will lose no time in the labor that is entrusted to their hands. I am, therefore, opposed to this amendment, which proposes delay. The states and territories are ready to name the man who shall constitute for each a member of this committee. The State of Oregon is ready now. [Cries of \"Question.\"]\n\nMr. Hazard, of Rhode Island: The gentlemen who advocated the postponement are right in theory, but it is obvious that the practical operations of this Convention would be retarded by a postponement. I hope, therefore, the motion to postpone will be withdrawn.\n\nGov. Reeder: The gentleman says we are right. If we are right why should we be voted down? It seems to me that when gentlemen concede that we are right, there is generally nothing remaining to do but to carry out the right. We are transgressing the right here, and for the purpose of what? For the purpose of convenience, and because it can make no difference. It may make no difference now, but the time may come, and will come, when it will make a difference, and then this action will be cited as a precedent. I am opposed to making bad precedents. I believe that the only way to pursue is to do it right and in order. If you appoint a committee, what is to prevent that committee from reporting to this Convention before, you have made a permanent organization? And if they do so report, what is to prevent a majority of this Convention passing upon the resolutions and platform before you are organized? Do the gentlemen desire to see that? Do they desire to establish a precedent such as that, which may be used at some great crisis in the future for purposes of evil? It is admitted that we are right, and it seems to me that there the question ends.\n\nMr. Carter: The gentleman from Pennsylvania is begging a little more than I am willing to grant. I do not feel that the first movement is right. There is no such concession in\n\n18\n\nthis quarter of the hall. [Loud cries of \"Question,\" which interrupting the speaker, he took his seat.]\n\nThe motion of Mr. Oyler, of Indiana, to lay over the motion to appoint a Committee on Platform and Resolutions until after the permanent organization of the Convention, was then put to vote and lost.\n\nHon. J. T. Hogeboom, of New York: I move to amend the motion to appoint a Committee on Platform and Resolutions, by adding, \"that the committee report as soon as convenient after the permanent organization of the Convention.\"\n\nMr. Carter: I accept the amendment.\n\nMr. Oyler: We have already appointed a Committee on Credentials, and for what? To know authoritatively and legally who have a right to a seat upon this floor. Now, sir, we are going on to provide for the most important thing that this Convention will do, except the designation of the man who shall bear our standard. I shall not attempt to say that there is one man on this floor not legally entitled to his seat; but we have no evidence of the fact. It is true, we have entered upon this floor, and have arranged ourselves at the different points which we designated by the names of the states, and the fair presumption is, that the men who fill these seats are honestly entitled to them; but that is no proof of the fact, and I undertake to say that this proceeding is against all precedent, and a bad precedent to be set by a Republican Convention. Why this haste? We will \"work in haste and repent at leisure.\" What harm can be done by deferring this until after the Committee on Permanent Organization report, and the Convention organizes itself as a Republican National Convention? We are not that yet. I hope the delegates will consider--that they will stop. Let us be organized before we do, or undertake to do, the most important work we have met to accomplish.\n\n19\n\nMr. Greeley: If there is any question here as to the right of any delegation on this floor, I am willing that this matter should not be urged. But if there is none, then let us have this committee appointed. It will take thirty-six hours for the committee to prepare their report, and the committee should be appointed now so they can have full opportunity. If there is any question as to the right of any delegates, we will waive it.\n\nGov. Boutwell, of Massachusetts: The first thing for us is to be right. We are assembled not for deliberation, but for organization. Let us organize and then deliberate; and until we have perfected our organization, it will be a dangerous precedent to set up here, with reference to a new party that is organized for the government of this country, through a generation, to establish a precedent which, when contestants come here from the Pacific and the South, will lead to difficulties on the floor. We have time enough. Better devote it to the organization of this convention rather than to an. excursion; thankful as we are for the hospitality of the city, we have a greater duty to perform to this country. I move to lay this (Mr. Carter's) resolution on the table.\n\nThe motion of Gov. Boutwell to lay on the table was carried. [Loud cheers.]\n\nMr. Sweetzer, of Massachusetts: I move that when this convention adjourn, it adjourn to meet at 3 o'clock this afternoon. The reason why I move this is, that it seems to me desirable that we should sometime proceed with the business of the convention. If we are going to take up the time in excursions on the lake, I do not know when we will have time for business. I am willing to change the time, if anybody can tell us that we can return from the excursion in time for a meeting of business this evening.\n\nMr. Ben. Eggleston, of Ohio; I move to amend by making the time 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. Now, Mr.\n\n20\n\nPresident, I am very well satisfied that the motion just voted down, in reference to the resolution, will make the convention one day longer, and we delegates from Ohio, some of us, are running out of funds. [Laughter.] It will take a day or two longer. It takes an hour and a half to seat the delegates, and to seat outsiders from two to four hours. [Laughter.] I want it understood that I came here to work, and am not going on the lake; nor is any delegate who came here to work. But I am willing to amend my motion by making it 5 o'clock if desired.\n\nHon. A. B. James, of New York: If we had appointed the Committee on Platform and Resolutions, then we could have with safety adjourned until to-morrow morning; but we have voted that down. We want to make a permanent organization in order that the committee may be appointed, so that it may have the resolutions ready to present to us tomorrow morning.\n\nMr. Judd, of Illinois: It seems to me, sir, if you undertake to assemble this Convention at three o'clock, the business for which the Committee on Credentials and the Committee on Permanent Organization have been appointed will not be accomplished.\n\nA delegate from Minnesota: Make it four, five or six.\n\nMr. Judd: My reason for making the suggestion is, I believe every man here wants his dinner, and they are scattered over the entire city of Chicago, and if they are hungry, as I think they are, before they can get their dinners and meet at the committee room the time will have expired, and the duties will not be performed by the committees unless some gentleman has in his pocket a programme to be followed without consulting anybody in regard to what is to be done by the committee. I say, sir, you must give them time if you expect them to act understandingly; and there is no time now,\n\n21\n\nbetween two and three o'clock, to accomplish the purposes for which these committees have been appointed.\n\nMr. Goodrich, of Minnesota: I would ask the gentleman to name the hour of seven this evening.\n\nMr. Judd: I accept the amendment.\n\nHon. W. D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: This hall is engaged for to-night, as I observe by a notice in the city papers this morning, for an exhibition of the Zouave drill.\n\nMr. Judd: I beg leave to say that this hall is under the control of this Convention whenever they want it, day or night. [Applause.]\n\nMr. Eggleston: I accept the amendment to meet at 7 o'clock this evening.\n\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: There is a large portion of this Convention who cannot be got out to a night session. The number is too large to get together for a deliberative Convention at night. I am opposed to a night session, and I hope the proposition for it will be voted down. I am in favor of 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\nMr. James, of New York: If any gentleman who voted for the resolution that was last passed against appointing a Committee on Resolutions will move to reconsider that vote, there will be no difficulty in making an adjournment until tomorrow morning, unless the motion to reconsider is voted down. We will lose less time by this course. I cannot make the motion as I voted against laying on the table.\n\nA delegate: I move to take the resolution from the table.\n\nThe President: I understand the motion to be to reconsider the vote by which the resolution to appoint a Committee on Platform was laid upon the table.\n\n22\n\nA delegate from Michigan: I rise to make that motion. I move that the motion to lay on the table be reconsidered, and the appointment of the Committee on Resolutions be now taken from the table.\n\nMr. Oyler, from Indiana--[Amid cries of \"Question!\" \"Question!\"]: I rise to a point of order. The point I make is this: Is a motion-to reconsider the last resolution passed while there is a motion pending for our adjournment that has not been withdrawn.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I rise to make an inquiry, if it is in order, whether it is in order to reconsider the vote of this Convention when there is a Lake Excursion pending. [Laughter.]\n\nThe President: It is the opinion of the Chair that the motion to reconsider is not in order, for this reason: That there was pending before this Convention at the time a resolution to adjourn until 7 o'clock this evening, and to that there was an amendment that the hour be fixed at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\nA Voice: That motion is now withdrawn.\n\nThe Chair: Then the other is in order.\n\nA Delegate: I renew the motion.\n\nThe Chair: The question is, shall the vote to lay on the table be reconsidered.\n\nMr. Preston King, of New York: I am satisfied that one of the difficulties in the progress of our business is this excursion on the lake; a very pleasant one, and for which I feel, and I have no doubt the entire Convention feels indebted to the hospitality and generosity of the citizens of Chicago. But our object here is business, and not pleasure. I trust, therefore, that we may make an adjournment which will conform\n\n23\n\nto the convenience of all. If we have old gentlemen here, or others, who, from any cause, do not desire to have an evening session, let us adjourn to meet again at 5 o'clock, and we can, between that time and dark, perform the acts necessary to a complete organization, and thus save at least a day's time of the Convention. If we adjourn until to-morrow we lose certainly an entire day. There is no doubt of that. This Committee on Platform and Resolutions ought to have this evening to sit; and while I did not regard it as material whether that committee was appointed before or after organization, I am willing to concede that it is more regular and more in accordance with the parliamentary usage that we should take the course that was suggested here. Let us now act with a spirit of conciliation and unanimity if we can. I think if we adjourn to 5 o'clock we may get together and then organize and appoint our committees and be prepared to-morrow morning to go to work. That will make it, of course, impossible or inconvenient to go on this excursion, but that we must defer. I move we adjourn to 5 o'clock.\n\nMr. W. E. Coale, of Maryland: I hope members of this Convention will not stultify themselves by first accepting the invitation so kindly tendered to us and then immediately declining it.\n\nMr. King: I am going to move that the proposition in relation to this excursion be referred to our Business Committee, between whom and the Board of Trade an arrangement can be made convenient for both sides.\n\nThe President: The gentleman from New York will please understand there is still pending a motion to take from the table the resolution heretofore laid upon the table.\n\nMr. King: If that is insisted upon we must take the voice of the Convention upon it. My object in making this motion was to see if we could not come to some understanding or reach some conclusion with unanimity. [Cries of \"Question,\" \"Question.\"]\n\n24\n\nThe President: The question is, shall the resolution laid upon the table respecting the platform be now taken from the table?\n\nGov. Reeder: Does it not require a two-third vote under the rules of the House of Representatives to do that?\n\nThe President: I think not.\n\nMr. Sweetzer, of Massachusetts: I moved to adjourn until 5 o'clock; somebody else moved to amend, and adjourn until 9 or 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. My original motion has never been withdrawn.\n\nThe Chair: I understood it to have been.\n\nMr. Sweetzer: The gentleman withdrew his motion. I still ask to have my motion put.\n\nThe Chair: The question is, shall this Convention when it adjourns, adjourn to meet at 5 o'clock this afternoon; and the amendment is to 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\nGov. Cleveland, of Connecticut: I am sure, gentlemen, that you are all disposed to act as you look, as gentlemen. I desire to say to you that we have a very polite and gentlemanly communication from the Board of Trade, and we have by a vote, accepted it. Now, I agree with my friend from New York [Mr. King] that we had better not do it, but to get out of it and treat them fairly, we have only to make a motion to reconsider, and then we can dispose of it in such a manner as the Convention shall see fit, and in such a manner as is consistent with the gentlemanly character of those who made the invitation. In passing a motion to accept it, and then voting to adjourn till 5 o'clock, we seem to throw contempt upon their very civil invitation. If the gentleman will withdraw his motion for the purpose of making a motion to reconsider, I will make that motion, and then we can get out of the trouble.\n\n25\n\nMr. Sweetzer: I withdraw the motion only for that purpose.\n\nThe President: The difficulty is here: If you withdraw your motion touching the hour of adjournment then comes before the Convention, as I understand it, the motion to take from the table the resolution concerning the platform. The motion before the Convention is that we adjourn, when we do adjourn, until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.\n\nMotion to adjourn was put and lost. [Applause.]\n\nThe President: Now the proposition before the Convention is that when this Convention adjourns, it adjourns to meet at 5 o'clock this afternoon.\n\nHon. Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio, appeared on the platform amid loud cheers. He said: I rise for the purpose of moving a reconsideration of the vote accepting the invitation received from the Board of Trade to meet there at 5 o'clock for a pleasure excursion I do this, sir, from a sincere conviction that every gentleman who has come here, has come impressed with the solemnity of the business before us. Knowing that we are here to perform high and solemn duties to our country and ourselves, and in justice to our own position and the cause in which we are employed, we should be zealously engaged in the business before us; and here I will take leave to say we have had a precedent recently set before us, far south of this, which should caution us about spending our time here to the wearying of the public mind in witnessing our discussions. If we can close up our business to-morrow by two or three o'clock, it will tell upon the community with a moral force that is incalculable. [Loud and prolonged applause.] Now, Mr. Chairman, I will labor from this time until three o'clock to-morrow in order to attain the object of a final adjournment at that time. [Renewed cheering.] Then, sir, I am willing to accept the kind invitation of the Board of Trade here, and enjoy the pleasure of going upon the proposed excursion.\n\n26\n\nFor the purpose of reconsidering this vote, and then referring it to a committee that they shall make the arrangements with the Board of Trade, so that at our adjournment we will meet them and accept cordially the invitation and take this excursion, I now move that we reconsider the vote by which that motion was carried, accepting the pleasure excursion.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Giddings to reconsider was then put to vote and carried.\n\nMr. Lowey, of Pennsylvania: I move you, sir, that a committee of one from each State be appointed by the Chair to confer with the Board of Trade.\n\nVoices: Make it a committee of five.\n\nMr. Lowry: I will modify my resolution and make it a committee of five.\n\nMr. Hopkins, of Massachusetts: We have already a committee of five appointed upon the order of business, and I suggest that this matter of the invitation of the Board of Trade, of Chicago, can be referred to it. I will make the motion that that reference be had.\n\nA delegate from Vermont: I hope that the committee will at once notify the Board of Trade, as they are already making their preparations for the excursion.\n\nMotion of Mr. Lowry to appoint a committee of five to confer was adopted.\n\nThe chair then appointed the following gentlemen to act as such committee:\n\nMorrow B. Lowry, Of Pennsylvania\n\nAaron Goodrich, Of Minesota\n\nJoshua R. Giddings, Of Ohio\n\nF. P. Blair, Of Maryland\n\nC. F. Cleveland, Of Connecticut\n\n\n\n27\n\nThe Convention then, on motion, adjourned until 5 o'clock, P. M.\n\nAFTERNOON SESSION.\n\nThe Convention was called to order at 5:15, P. M., by the temporary President.\n\nTHE INVITATION.\n\nMr. Lowey, of Pennsylvania: In behalf of the committee appointed to confer with the Board of Trade, I would ask leave to make a report. The committee have called upon our friends, the Board of Trade, who invited us to the excursion. They extended to us an invitation and we accepted it. They left immediately and prepared themselves to carry out the arrangement that they had proposed for our enjoyment. They have a perfect fleet down there now in readiness. Before I could get there--before I could find the committee and the parties who have invited us, they had their fleet ready to carry us and large enough to carry us all. They say that if we are so pressed with business we can hold the Convention on the decks of their vessels, if we desire it--and we can, so they say, have their cabins for rooms to caucus in. They are very much disposed to press us and will wait one hour, that will make it six o'clock. We can have ample time to do here this afternoon all that is necessary and then go on the excursion. Now, inasmuch as the people of Chicago extend to us this invitation, I hope it will be unanimously accepted for 6 o'clock.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I rise to a question of order. There is one question already before the house.\n\nMr. Goodrich, of Minnesota: Say \"as soon thereafter as possible.\" We may, perhaps, have to wait fifteen or twenty minutes thereafter. I hope that we shall go on and perfect our organization, and I believe that can be done within the\n\n28\n\ntime named. I hope the Convention will get ready at once to take the excursion.\n\nMr. Hazard, of Rhode Island: The proposition now made as I understand it, differs only from that of the morning in this: it is now said that it will not interfere with the progress of the meeting--that we may go on and complete our business just as well as not, and take this excursion. [Cries of \"Never mind,\" and much confusion.] But it does not meet the case. I suppose that we are here on important business. We are here, believing as was said this morning [much confusion], believing that the government is pressed on both sides, one half of the Democratic party threatening us with annihilation--and the other [amid loud cries of \"Question,\" the remainder of the sentence was lost.] Suppose you were standing by the sick bed. [Cries of \"Question,\" and great confusion, amid which the speaker took his seat.]\n\nThe question to adjourn to 6 o'clock being submitted, was lost amid much applause.\n\nThe President announced that the reports of the committees were in order, and asked for the report of the Committee on Permanent Organization. [Cries of \"Good.\"]\n\nMr. Hinckley, of California: I ask if it is not in accordance with usage that the Committee on Credentials be called, so that we may know who are members of the Convention.\n\nThe President: I do not know that there is any special order in which committees should report.\n\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: I move that the report of the Committee on Credentials be called, so that we may know who are members of the Convention.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Kelley was carried.\n\nMr. Comins, of Massachusetts stated, that the Committee\n\n29\n\non Permanent Organization had agreed upon a report, and that its Chairman would be present very soon to present the report to the Convention.\n\nThe President called for the report of the Committee on Credentials, if the Chairman was present.\n\nJudge Tracy, of California: I understand that the Committee on the Order of Business are ready to report in part; and inasmuch as no other committee seems to be ready to report, I propose that the Chair call for the report of that committee.\n\nThe President: I think that if the Committee on Permanent Organization is ready to report, it would be best to receive that.\n\nJudge Tracy: Certainly, if they are in a state of crystallization. [Laughter.]\n\nThe President: I understand that they are ready. Mr. Horton, of the Committee on Permanent Organization, makes a report in part that they have agreed upon Mr. Ashmun, of Massachusetts.\n\nA voice: George?\n\nThe President: Hon. George Ashmun [a voice, \"Good boy\"--Laughter], of Massachusetts, for President of the Convention. [Prolonged cheers.]\n\nThe report in reference to the selection of Permanent, President was unanimously adopted.\n\nA Voice: Nary a \"no.\" [Laughter.]\n\nThe Temporary President appointed Hon. Preston King, of New York, and Carl Schurz, of Wisconsin, to wait upon and conduct the President to the chair. The appearance of Mr. Schurz was the signal for loud cheers.\n\nThe President was conducted to the chair amid enthusiastic\n\n30\n\napplause. When this had subsided he addressed the Convention.\n\nSPEECH OF HON. GEORGE ASHMUN.\n\nGentlemen of the Convention--Republicans, Americans:\n\nMy first duty is to express to you the deep sense which I feel of this distinguished mark of your confidence. In the spirit in which it has been offered I accept it, sensible of the difficulties which surround the position, but cheered and sustained by the faith that the same generosity that has brought me here will carry me through the discharge of the duties. I will not shrink from this position, at the same time the post of danger as well as the post of honor. [Applause.] Gentlemen, we have come here to-day at the call of our countrymen from widely separated homes, to fulfill a great and important duty. No ordinary call has brought us together. Nothing but a momentous question would have called this vast multitude here to-day--nothing but a deep sense of the danger into which our government is fast running could have rallied the people thus in this city to-day, for the purpose of rescuing the government from the deep degradation into which it has fallen. [Loud applause.] We have come here at the call of our country, for the purpose of preparing for the most solemn duty that freemen have to perform. We are here in the ordinary capacity as delegates of the people, to prepare for the formation and carrying on of a new administration, and with the help of the people we will do it. [Applause.] No mere controversy about miserable abstractions has brought us here to-day; we have not come here on any idle question. The sacrifice which most of us have made in the extended journey, and in the time devoted to it, could only have been made upon some solemn call; and the stern look which I see, the solemn look which I see on every face, and the earnest behavior which has been manifested in all the preliminary discussions, shows full well that we all have a true and deep sense of the solemn obligation which is resting upon us. Gentlemen, it does not belong to\n\n31\n\nme to make an extended address; it is for me rather to assist in the details of the business that belong to the Convention. But allow me to say that I think we have a right here to-day, in the name of the American people, to say that we impeach the administration of our General Government of the highest crimes which can be committed against a constitutional government, against a free people, against humanity. [Prolonged cheers.] The catalogue of its crimes it is not for me to recite. It is written upon every page of the history of the present administration, and I care not how many paper protests the President may send into the House of Representatives [Laughter and applause], we, here, the grand inquest of the nation, will find out for him and his confederates, not merely punishment terrible and sure, but a remedy which shall be satisfactory. [Prolonged cheers.] Gentlemen, before proceeding to the business of the Convention, allow me to congratulate you and the people upon the striking feature which, I think, must have been noticed by everybody who has mixed in the preliminary discussions of the people who have gathered in this beautiful city. It is that brotherly kindness, and cordial and generous emulation, which has marked every conversation and every discussion, showing a desire for nothing else but their country's good. Earnest, warm and generous preferences are expressed, ardent hopes and fond purposes are declared, but not within the three days I have spent among you all, have I heard one unkind word, uttered by one man towards another. I hail it as an augury of success, and if, during the proceedings of tins Convention, you will unite to perpetuate that feeling, and allow it to pervade all your proceedings, I declare to you, that I think it is the surest and brightest promise of our success, whoever may be the standard bearer in the contest that is pending. [Applause.] In that spirit, gentlemen, let us now proceed to the business--to the great work, which the American people have given into our hands to do. [Applause.]\n\n32\n\nTHE OFFICERS OF THE CONVENTION.\n\nMr. Marsh, of New Jersey: The Committee on Permanent Organization having reported in part, desires to complete its report.\n\nThe committee appointed to recommend officers for the permanent organization of this Convention, have attended to that duty, and report that the officers shall consist of a President, twenty-seven Vice-Presidents and twenty-six Secretaries; and the following gentlemen are recommended to fill the offices respectively named:\n\nVICE-PRESIDENTS. Maine, Samuel F. Hersey New Hampshire, William Haile. Vermont, William Hebord. Massachusetts, Ensign H. Kellogg. Rhode Island, Rowland G. Hazard. Connecticut, Chauncey F. Cleveland. New York, William Curtis Noyes. New Jersey, Edward Y. Rogers. Pennsylvania, Thaddeus Stevens. Delaware, John C. Dark. Maryland, William L. Marshall. Virginia, Richard Crawford. Ohio, George D. Burgess. Indiana, John Beard. Illinois, David Davis. Michigan, Thomas W. Ferry. Wisconsin, Hans Crocker. Iowa, H. P. Scholte. Minnesota, Aaron Goodrich. Missouri, Henry T. Blow. Kentucky, William D. Gallagher. Texas, William T. Chandler. California, A. A. Sargent. Oregon, Joel Burlingame. District of Columbia, George Harrington. Kansas, William W. Ross. Nebraska, A. S. Paddock.\n\n33\n\nSECRETARIES. Maine, Charles A. Wing. New Hampshire, Nathaniel Hubbard. Vermont, John W. Stewart. Massachusetts, Charles O. Rogers. Rhode Island, Rowland R. Hazard. Connecticut, H. H. Starkweather. New York, George William Curtis. New Jersey, Edward Brettle. Pennsylvania, J. Bowman Bell. Delaware, Benjamin C. Hopkins. Maryland, William E. Coale. Virginia, A. W. Campbell. Ohio, H. G. Beebe. Indiana, D. D. Pratt. Illinois, O. L. Davis. Michigan, William S. Stoughton. Wisconsin, L. F. Frisbie. Iowa, Wm. B. Allison. Minnesota, D. A. Secombe. Missouri, J. K. Kidd. Kentucky, Stephen J. Hawes. Texas, Dunbar Henderson. California, D. J. Staples. Oregon, Eli Thayer. Kansas, John A. Martin. Nebraska, H. P. Hitchcock.\n\nOn motion of Mr. Stone, of Iowa, the report of the Committee on Permanent Organization was adopted.\n\nHon. F. P. Tracy, of California, moved that a, committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory represented in the Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, to report resolutions and platform.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio, moved to amend, by requiring that\n\n34\n\nall resolutions submitted to the Convention be referred to the proposed committee without debate.\n\nJudge Tracy accepted the amendment.\n\nMr. Judd, of Illinois: I ask the gentleman to suspend for one moment while I make a presentation to the President of the Convention. I am directed, Mr. President, on behalf of one of the working mechanic Republicans of Chicago, to present to you, sir, this emblem of your authority. [Exhibiting a beautifully wrought oak gavel, finished and ornamented with ivory and silver.] It is not, sir, the wood and the ivory and the silver--\n\nMr. Hinckley, of California: [Interrupting.] I rise to a point of order. [\"Sit down;\" \"Go on with the presentation,\" and great confusion.] The Committee on Order of Business has not yet reported; when that committee reports perhaps the Convention will find the adoption or rejection of that report will settle the controversy in reference to the appointment of the Committee on Platform and Resolutions.\n\nThe Chair: The chair holds that that is not a point of order. [Applause.] It may be a ground for the rejection of the proposition of the gentleman from California (Judge Tracy).\n\nMr. Judd: I would not, sir, have attempted to have made this presentation, if I had not supposed that I had the unanimous consent at this time of the Convention. [Applause and cries of \"Go on,\" \"Go on.\"] I was saying to you, sir, that it was not the wood or the ivory, or the silver, of which that little instrument is composed, that renders it valuable. It has, like the Republican party, a history. It is a piece of oak taken from Commodore Perry's flag ship--the Lawrence. [Applause.] It is not from its size that its power is to be felt. It is like the Republican rule, strong but not noisy. [Great enthusiasm.] It is not, that the Republicans require\n\n35\n\na noisy and violent government, or that they require riotously to put down the sham Democracy; but they require and intend to apply to them, and to all those persons who seek disunion, and keep up a cry about destroying our government, the little force necessary to control and restrain them, like the little force which will be necessary for you, Mr. President, to use in presiding over the deliberations of this Convention. [Great cheers.] There is a motto, too, adopted by that mechanic, which should be a motto for every Republican in this Convention--the motto borne upon the flag of the Lawrence--\"Don't give up the ship.\" [Great applause.] Mr. President, in presenting this to you, in addition to the motto furnished by the mechanic who manufactured this, as an evidence of his warmth and zeal in the Republican cause, I would recommend to this Convention to believe that the person who will be nominated here, can, when the election is over in November, send a dispatch to Washington in the language of the gallant Perry: \"We have met the enemy, and they are ours.\" [Terrific cheering.] Voices, \"Name, name.\" Mr. President, in the beginning I should have named Mr. C. G. Thomas, of Chicago. [Hearty applause.]\n\nThe president: In behalf of the Convention, I accept from the hands of the gentleman from Illinois the present made by the Chicago mechanic; and I have only to say today that all the auguries are that we shall meet the enemy and they shall be ours. [Loud cheers.]\n\nMr. Dembitz, of Kentucky, announced that the Committee on Rules and Order of Business, had matured a partial report, defining the manner in which votes should be taken in the Convention. He moved that that report be now taken up.\n\nThe President announced that the question on the appointment of a Committee on Resolutions and Platform was pending.\n\nMr. Dembitz moved that the question on the appointment\n\n36\n\nof a Committee on Platform and Resolutions be postponed until the report of the Committee on Rules and Order of Business had been received.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Dembitz was lost.\n\nThe president: The question is now on the appointment of a Committee on Resolutions and Platform, to whom to refer, without debate, all resolutions or propositions.\n\nGov. Reeder: Mr. President-- voices: \"Name.\"\n\nThe president: Gov. Reeder, of Pennsylvania. [Prolonged cheers.]\n\n\n\nGov. Reeder: I understand the resolution before the Convention to be that a committee of one from each state be appointed for the purpose of drafting a Platform and Resolutions. Am I right?\n\nThe president: You are, substantially.\n\nGov. Reeder: Then I move to amend so that it may include the territories.\n\nJudge Tracy: That is the language of the motion. The motion to appoint a Committee on Platform and Resolutions was then carried.\n\nThe President suggested to the Convention the propriety of having a roll of the Convention, arranged under the heads of the different states, made out by the Secretaries, and to be printed for the use of the Convention. He then proposed to call the states for the appointment of a Committee on Resolutions and Platform.\n\nMr. James, of New York: Before that is put, I would suggest that the Committee on Credentials report. We refused to adopt this very resolution before dinner.\n\n37\n\nThe Chair: The Chair is about to call the roll of the states, for the purpose of receiving the names of gentlemen to constitute a Committee on Resolutions.\n\nCOMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS, &c.\n\nThe roll was then called, and the committee constituted as follows:\n\nMaine, George F. Talbott. New Hampshire, Amos Tuck. Vermont, Ebenezer Briggs. Massachusetts, George S. Boutwell. Rhode Island, Benjamin T. Eames. Connecticut, S. W. Kellogg. New York, H. R. Selden. New Jersey, Thomas H. Dudley. Pennsylvania, William Jessup. Delaware, N. B. Smithers. Maryland, F. P. Blair. Virginia, Alfred Caldwell. Ohio, Joseph H. Barrett. Kentucky, George D. Blakey. Indiana, William T. Otto. Michigan, Austin Blair. Illinois, Gustavus Kaerner. Wisconsin, Carl Schurz. Minnesota, Stephen Miller. Iowa, J. A. Kasson. Missouri, Charles L. Bernays. California, F. P. Tracy. Oregon, Horace Greeley. Texas, H. A. Shaw. District of Columbia, G. A. Hall. Nebraska, A. Sidney Paddock. Kansas, John P. Hatterscheidt.\n\nMr. R. H. Corwine, of Ohio: The Committee on Business have a report prepared, but it will be necessary for them to\n\n38\n\nmodify their report in consequence of the action of the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Hopkins, of Massachusetts: In response to the suggestion from the Chair, I move you that the Secretaries of this Convention be directed to prepare a full list of the delegates to this Convention.\n\nA Delegate from Missouri: I would move, as an amendment, that it contain their post office addresses.\n\nThe Chair: That, I suppose, will be attended to. It will be done under the direction of the Secretaries. Motion to print adopted.\n\nThe President then announced the reception of the following communication, which was read to the Convention:\n\nArmory of the Zouave Cadet Guard, May 16, 1860.\n\nTO THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.\n\nGentlemen: In compliance with the wishes of the citizens, we are, through the courtesy of the Committee, permitted to occupy the \"Wigwam\" this evening for an exhibition drill, to which we beg to return an invitation to the members of your honorable body. We shall feel highly honored by the presence of all who can find leisure to attend. Tickets of admission will be found at the head-quarters of the different delegations. I have the honor to be,\n\nYour obed't servant,\n\nE. E. ELLSWORTH,\n\nCommander U. S. Zouave Cadets.\n\n\n\nOn motion, the invitation to be present was accepted with thanks.\n\nMr. Kaufmann, of Pennsylvania: I would suggest to the\n\n39\n\nCommittee on Platform, before they present to the Convention their report, that they have a large number printed and distributed to all members, so that they can see it. It will be impossible to have it read here so that we can understand it clearly, and members will not know if they are in favor of it or against it. I will make a motion to that effect. The motion was carried.\n\nMr. Voorhies, of Indiana: I move that when this Convention adjourns, it do adjourn until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.\n\nMany voices--\"Make it ten.\"\n\nThe Chair: It is moved to amend by substituting 10.\n\nMr. Tracy, of California: Nine o'clock is too early. I have come a long way, many thousand miles, to attend this Convention, and am tired, and I can't get up so early.\n\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: There are several committees who have business to attend to; one of which I know meets at eight, and another at half past eight, and it will be impossible for them to get through their business by nine o'clock. In endeavoring to save an hour, I think the Convention will waste much more time. I think that it would be more judicious to meet at 10 o'clock, when the committees can come in with their reports.\n\nThe motion to fix 10 o'clock as the hour for re-assembling prevailed.\n\nMr. Rollins; of New Hampshire, offered the following resolution:\n\nResolved, That the delegations from each state and territory, represented in this Convention, be requested to designate and report the name of one individual to serve as a member of the National Republican Committee, for the ensuing four years.\n\n40\n\nMr. Nourse, of Iowa, moved to amend the resolution so that the delegations should be left to select members of the National Committee who were not members of the Convention.\n\nThe amendment was accepted, and the resolution adopted.\n\nThe Convention then, on motion, adjourned to Thursday morning, at 10 o'clock.\n\nSECOND DAY.\n\nThe Convention re-assembled at 10 o'clock, pursuant to adjournment. After some time spent in securing to delegates the possession of their seats on the platform, many of which had been taken by persons not delegates, Rev. W. W. Patten, Pastor of the Second Congregational Church, of Chicago, offered the following prayer:\n\nGreat God! Thou art the blessed and the only potentate, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Thou only hast immortality. Thou dwellest in light that no man can approach unto Thee, whom no man hath seen nor mortal vision can see. We are Thy weak and Thine erring creatures, and we draw nigh unto Thee in all our dependence, that we may avail ourselves of Thine almighty strength and boundless wisdom. We thank Thee that Thou hast given us the great boon of existence; that Thou hast created us in Thine own image; that Thou hast sent us into this world to work out our destiny and to do Thy will; privileging us with the opportunity of being co workers with Thee in Thy benevolent and wise plans. We thank Thee that we had our birth and residence in this land; and that we have come into the world to act our part in these latter days of its history. We pray Thee to qualify us to act that part aright, as men should act who live in this nineteenth\n\n41\n\ncentury. And we pray Thee, oh God, that Thy blessing may rest upon our country. We thank Thee that our fathers who came over here, and laid the foundations of our country in prayer and in faith, desiring here to serve God and benefit their fellow men. And we pray Thee that that same spirit may dwell in their children; and may lead them to bring forth the fruits of righteousness. Help this great people to remember that it is righteousness that exalteth a nation, while sin is a shame unto any people. We thank Thee that Thou hast permitted us to witness this great convocation of the friends of freedom and humanity. We pray for Thy blessing to rest upon all in this Convention who have come hither to represent the friends of freedom in this nation. We beseech of Thee that Thou wilt give them the wisdom which is from above, which begins in the fear of God. Grant that they may be saved from the fear of man, which Thy word declares bringeth a snare; and we pray Thee that they may be enabled to act in manner worthy of the responsibility which has been committed to them. Grant that in their deliberations they may be aided by the spirit, and may be brought to such conclusions as shall be for the furtherance of the cause of liberty and of humanity in this great nation, so that they shall not only acquit themselves to the commendation of their fellow men. but shall be prepared to meet God, and that slave, whose friend God is, at the great day of account. And these mercies we ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!\n\nThe President announced the reception of the following communication, which was read to the Convention: Chicago, May 17, 1860.\n\nHon. George Ashmun, President of the Republican Convention, Chicago.\n\n\n\nDear Sir: The members of the Convention are invited to an excursion over the Chicago and Rock Island railroad, to the City of Rock Island, crossing the Mississippi river bridge to the City of Davenport, Iowa, any day during their stay in Chicago which the Convention may designate. The hour of\n\n42\n\nleaving Chicago and returning subject to the wishes of the Convention. I am respectfully yours,HENRY FARNUM,\n\nOn motion the communication was laid on the table, to be taken up and considered at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\nThe Chair announced the reception of the following communication, which he read to the Convention:\n\nTo the Honorable president of the Republican National Convention.\n\nSir: Can you arrange to send out some effective speakers, to entertain 20,000 Republicans and their wives, outside the building? [Great applause, and cries for \"Gorwin,\" and others.]\n\nThe President announced that the first business in order would be to hear the report of the Committee on the Order of Business.\n\nMr. R. H. Corwine, of Ohio, chairman of the Committee on Rules and the Order of Business, reported the following rules, which were read to the Convention:\n\nRule I. Upon all subjects before the Convention, the states and territories shall be called in the following order: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, Iowa, California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, Nebraska, District of Columbia.\n\nRule 2. Four votes shall be cast by the delegates at large of each state, and each Congressional district shall be entitled to two votes. The votes of each delegation shall be reported by its chairman.\n\nRule 3. The report of the Committee on Platform and Resolutions shall be acted upon before the Convention proceeds\n\n43\n\nto ballot for candidates for President and Vice-President. [Applause.]\n\nRule 4. Three hundred and four votes, being a majority of the whole number of votes when all the states of the Union are represented in this Convention, according to the rates of representation presented in Rule 2, shall be required to nominate the candidates of this Convention for the offices of President and Vice-President. [ Applause and cries of \"No! no!\"]\n\nRule 5. The rules of the House of Representatives shall continue to be the rules of this Convention, in so far as they are applicable and not inconsistent with the foregoing rules.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nMr. James, of New York: Before we proceed to act on those rules, I wish to say, that when this committee met there were but seventeen out of twenty-three members present. That the Fourth Rule, which has been adopted, was only adopted by one majority, and as a member of that committee I propose to offer a substitute, which I will now read, as follows:\n\nThe President: Will the gentleman waive it until the Fourth Rule, comes before the meeting?\n\nMr. James: I suppose the amendment should be submitted before we enter upon the duty of considering the report.\n\nThe President: It will be much more convenient for the gentleman to present his amendment when it comes up.\n\nMr. James : It is a minority report.\n\nThe President: Then it is in order.\n\nMr. James: The minority of the Committee on Business and Rules, propose the following amendment to the Fourth Rule, as a minority report:\n\n4. That a majority of the whole number of votes represented\n\n44\n\nin this Convention, according to the votes prescribed by the Second Rule, shall be required to nominate a candidate for President and Vice-President. [Applause, and cries of \"No! No! \"]\n\nThe President: The first question is upon the first rule.\n\nMr. Reeder, of Pennsylvania: I desire to ask this House a question.\n\n\n\nThe President: Mr. Carter, of Ohio, has the floor.\n\nMr. Reeder: I beg the gentleman's pardon; I had not seen him.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: We are approaching a labor that is going to involve our constituencies in this Convention, and there is no report from the Committee on Credentials. [Voices: \"We can't hear you.\"] Before entering upon the consideration of this report, which I perceive is to be litigated, I propose to go into the battle with the army organized. [Voices: \"That's correct,\" \"Good,\" and so on.] Therefore, I move the postponement of the consideration of the report of the Committee on the Order of Business, until we have a report from the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Reeder: That is precisely the suggestion I was going to make.\n\nMr. Carter: I knew you were thinking just about right.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Carter, to postpone the consideration of the report of the Committee on the Order of Business, was carried.\n\nMr. Benton, of New Hampshire, and the Chairman of the Committee on Credentials, ask leave to submit the following report:\n\nThe Committee on Credentials report herewith the names and number of delegates from the several states as being elected, and deem it proper to say that the States of Pennsylvania\n\n45\n\nand New Jersey have appointed four delegates from each Congressional District, and eight Senatorial delegates, instead of appointing delegates and alternates; and Iowa has appointed eight delegates from each Congressional District, and sixteen Senatorial delegates. [Laughter.] The Committee also present the names of the delegates present and duly elected from the District of Columbia and the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, leaving it for the Convention to decide whether they shall be permitted to vote in this Convention.\n\nAll of which is respectfully presented in behalf of the Committee.\n\nMr. Benton: The states and territories are specified, and I can read them if the Convention desire it, although the chairman did not deem it necessary, as they are in the specification accompanying the report.\n\nGov. Reeder: I desire to know if this committee has reported what states are represented and entitled to a vote in this Convention. Have they so reported?\n\nMr. Benton: They have so reported.\n\nMr. Davis, of Massachusetts: I desire to have that portion of the report read, stating which states are represented and entitled to a vote in this Convention, with the number of votes to each.\n\nMr. Benton: In accordance with the suggestion, I will read:\n\nMaine, 16 New Hampshire, 10 Vermont, 10 Massachusetts, 26 Rhode Island, 8 Connecticut, 12 New York, 70 New Jersey, 28 Pennsylvania, 54\n\n46\n\nMaryland, 10 Delaware, 6 Virginia, 20 Kentucky, 24 Ohio, 46 Indiana, 26 Missouri, 18 Michigan, 12 Illinois, 22 Texas, 8 Wisconsin, 10 Iowa, 8 California, 8 Minnesota, 8 Oregon, 5 Kansas, 6 Nebraska, 6 District of Columbia, 4\n\nHon. Timothy Davis, of Massachusetts, moved that so much of the report as related to the delegation from Texas be referred back to the committee.\n\nMr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania: I move to amend the motion of the gentleman from Massachusetts, so as to include the States of Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia. I had foreseen, before I came to this Convention, that the question would very properly arise as to the propriety of admitting those states to a full vote in this Convention. We are a Convention of delegates representing a party having constituencies at home. This is not a mass convention, in which each man's voice is to be heard, and in which a mere numerical majority of all who choose to attend controls the result, but this is a Convention of delegates representing a constituency, and having constituents at home to represent. [Great applause.] Now, sir, can it be possible that those gentlemen who come here from states in which they cannot maintain an\n\n47\n\n48\n\norganized party--is it possible that they are to come here and by a full vote control the action of the Convention? I can see nothing better calculated to demoralize a party, and to break it up, than just such a proceeding. Why, sir, this nomination is to be the nomination of the Republican party in the Union, not the nomination of respectable gentlemen who may belong to the Republican party in Virginia, Maryland or Kentucky. What are the facts in Maryland? In Maryland, thirty gentlemen assembled in Baltimore for the purpose of sending a delegation to this Convention. Did they assemble as the representatives of a party? Not at all. They have never had a Republican party in Maryland, and, in my judgment, there will be no such party there until the people of the free states shall place this government in different hands, and relieve them from the tyranny which now weighs them down. There are respectable gentlemen in Maryland, many of them who sympathize with us and our cause; and so there are in every Southern State; but they have not the power to maintain a party organization. These gentlemen are not here as the representatives of any organized party at all. If this thing is to be done, the result of the deliberations of this Convention, respecting its nominee, may be anything other than such a result as would be produced by the voices of those only who are properly represented upon this floor. Admit this precedent, sir, and hereafter some candidate, or rather the friends of the candidate, may, in their anxiety to procure a result favorable to their wishes, at the next Convention we shall have, carrying this thing still further, delegates not representing any party--but there will be gentlemen, excellent gentlemen, no doubt, coming in here from every state of the Union, brought here by influences from the North, but not sent here by a party at home. That will be the result. [Applause.] Sir, they may possibly come here in this manner, in a situation of this kind. I cast no imputation upon the gentlemen who come here to this Convention. I have full confidence in their integrity and in the earnestness and zeal with which they are enlisted in the cause;but, sir, in another Convention that may assemble here, gentlemen may come from South Carolina, from Alabama, from Arkansas, and from Mississippi, for the express purpose of controlling, demoralizing and breaking up the Republican party. [Loud cheering.] Now, sir, if this is not stopped, there is no help for us. The true policy of the Republican party is to allow all its members a voice, but in proportion to their numbers. The committee have reported here that three hundred and four votes shall be necessary to a choice--a majority of the votes of all the states, when a large portion of those states are not represented here. Why have they done that? Why have they broken down the plain old Republican rule, that the majority--the real majority--shall control? Because they know it is necessary for the accomplishment of some object. That rule, if adopted, would establish one precedent in the admission of men here to vote who are not representatives of a party; and then they adopt another mischievous rule for the purpose of rectifying the first. What we want is, that the representatives of the Republican party here should vote for a candidate for President, and that the majority should control. [Tremendous cheering.] That is what we desire. The rule that is proposed, would introduce upon us thirty or forty votes that do not represent any party whatever. They are gentlemen of character, gentlemen of worth, gentlemen who sympathize in this movement heartily; but they represent no organized party--they have no constituency at home. You admit them here, and then to avoid the consequences of your first wrongful act, you require three hundred and four votes for the nomination of a candidate. I, therefore, move that this question respecting Texas, embraced in the first motion, embrace, also, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, the territories of Nebraska and Kansas, and the District of Columbia, and all be referred back to this committee.\n\nMr. Ewing, of Pennsylvania: I deprecate the sentiment of my friend from Pennsylvania. [Voice--\"That's the talk.\" Applause.] We all come here as Republicans, and those men\n\n49\n\nwho came here from the slave states named deserve tenfold more credit than those who come here from the free states. Why, sir, disfranchise our friends from Virginia, a border state--a free state so far as concerns Western Virginia--my neighbors! Sir, shall they be disfranchised in this Convention of Republicans, [voices--\"No, no!\"] by Pennsylvania, New York or New England, because they have the courage to stand up in a slave state for Republicanism and for free thought? [Applause] While, sir, we may not be willing to give those states the full power of the whole delegation of the whole state, yet in the name of God shall they not represent their immediate districts? It cannot be that a Convention of Republicans, assembled here from the whole United States, will ever adopt such a doctrine as to disfranchise our friends that come from the Southern States. Why, sir, I was mortified at such a sentiment coming from my distinguished friend from Pennsylvania,these gentlemen who have come here in defiance of the sentiment which prevails in their own states; have come here as bold and independent Republicans, and who are as good Republicans at home as here, should be voted out. They are representatives of the party so far as there is a party in those states, and we wish to build up the party in these states. I hope that this Convention never will adopt the principle to exclude these gentlemen who come here from the Southern States, because we may yet take a candidate from one of those Southern States. I know not what may be the result.\n\nMr. Armour, of Maryland: Mr. Chairman, I stand before this Convention and this assembled host of freemen a representative from the State of Maryland. [Applause and three cheers for Maryland.] I claim to be as true a Republican as the distinguished member of the \"People's\" party from Pennsylvania. [Laughter and much applause.] I have dared more than he has ever dared. [Applause.] I have periled more than he has ever periled. He lives in a free state; he breathes the pure air of the gallant old Keystone State, and\n\n50\n\n51\n\nyet they have not arrived at a condition in which they are willing to avow themselves Republicans. [Great applause.] I faced the mob in Baltimore; I faced the mob urged on by the aristocracy of the custom house, menial hirelings of this corrupt administration. I went to my home and found that I had been burned in effigy and suspended by the neck because I dared to avow myself the friend of freedom. We met in Baltimore in obedience to the call of the National Committee. We have a party in Maryland, and we can poll from three to four thousand votes, [a voice, \"good for you,\" and applause,] and if ever we expect Republican principles to prevail all over this land, we must organize, and you who live in the northern states must fraternize with us, and not despise the day of small things. [Applause.] There is the coat of arms of my grand little commonwealth, \"CRESCITE ET MULTIPLICAMINI,\" and that shall be the motto of the Republicans of Maryland. We will grow, and we will increase, until Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and all the states of the northwest will welcome our gallant little commonwealth to the band of states which have ever been unshrinking in their devotion and their loyalty to the cause of human freedom. I scorn the idea. I am proud to despise the sentiment which says that northern influences have been brought to bear upon us. We are unpurchased and unpurchaseable. [Loud applause.] And we tell Pennsylvania to put that in her pipe and smoke it. [Laughter and applause] Exclude us from the Convention if you will--turn us out of these doors; [cries of \"No,\" and \"we won't,\"] we will go home, notwithstanding, and nominate an electoral ticket, and under the blessing of Heaven we will do all that we can do to advance the common cause of humanity. I beg not for northern votes to sustain us here. I am sure there will be a spontaneous outburst of the free sentiments and the true sympathy of the people here. And if this Convention attempts to exclude us, that large assemblage of people will frown it down. [Applause.] I have vindicated myself. I have vindicated my co-delegates.I have vindicated my state. Your applause assures me of the fact, and I will give way. [Three cheers for Maryland.]\n\nMr. James Wyse, of District of Columbia: Mr. President, I come from the capital of this great and mighty republic, and like my friend, I am descended from old Maryland. [Applause.] I stand in this mighty Convention congregated in the queen city of the great west, the representative from the District of Columbia, of the great Republican party. [Loud cheers.] I stand here the representative of the persecuted and down-trodden and disfranchised people that have no vote for President, no voice in Congress, and no voice anywhere to legislate for us, and yet our territory contains a hundred thousand freemen. I came to this city as a representative of the Republican party for no sinister purpose, but for the people of that disfranchised district. We claim from the people of this country the right of franchise; we claim the right of citizenship; we claim to be heard in this discussion, and not to be silent longer in this republic. We have no legislature. We ask of Congress a legislature, and we intend that they shall give us a territorial legislature and a representation in Congress--that we shall have our own laws, and that Congress will confirm them--that we will be a people, and have a voice in this great republic. I come here to tell this people that they have trodden down the Republican party with the iron heel of despotism, worse and more tyrannical than that of Russia or the Austrian Empire. What has the Buchanan administration done? Why sir, they have gone into the workshops of the government to seek out a Republican, and then turn him out to grass, taking the bread from his family if he did not bow down to the slave power. But thanks be to God, we come here like the gentleman from Maryland, daring to be Republicans; and we will baptize that District of Columbia over again; and, by the help of God, we will exclude slavery from it in less than two years.\n\nMr. Blakey, of Kentucky: Having just arrived from a meeting of the Committee on Platform, I understand that a proposition\n\n52\n\nhas been made that this Convention shall exclude the delegates from the state which in part I represent. I should not have been more surprised had I been told that a proposition had been gravely made that the ashes of Washington should have been placed without the pale of this continent. [Cheers.] I should not have been more surprised had I been told that a proposition had been gravely made that the remains, the precious remains, now silently resting under the shade of Ashland, be removed from the precious soil of Kentucky; nor should I have been more surprised had I been informed that it had been gravely proposed that Cassius M. Clay [Applause.] should be buried. Who dare propose, I say, to institute a proposition here that the free born sons of Kentucky and of Virginia, and of Maryland, and of the District of Columbia, or even of Georgia, or any southern state, have not just as good a right to be Republicans and breathe free air, and be free men upon American soil as the old Keystone State. [Applause.] Gentlemen, I have but one word more to say, and I want it to be heard, and I wish it could be heard from one end of the continent to the other. I had the honor of a seat and a prominent position, it was a position of which my children and their children will be proud, in the Republican Convention of 1856. [Applause.] When the vote of Kentucky was called for, for candidate for the Vice Presidency I had the honor then and there to announce that Kentucky had been experimenting; that we had held up the Declaration of Independence before the mirror, and saw reflected the platform of the 17th of June, 1856; that we held up the precious ordinance of 1787, and saw reflected the Wilmot proviso; [applause,] and that Kentucky cast her vote for David Wilmot. [Laughter and applause.] Thus stood Kentucky in 1856 ! Can I be forgiven for that sin? [Applause and laughter.]\n\nMr. Wm. A. Phillips, of Kansas: Mr. President and gentlemen of the Republican Convention, I stand here with my fellow colleagues to represent the people of Kansas. The\n\n53\n\n54\n\nRepublicans of Kansas, whom we have the honor to represent upon this floor, sent us here expecting that we would have several grave issues to meet, but they did not expect that the representatives of Kansas would have to appear upon this floor with proof that Kansas is an integral part of the Republican party. Kansas and the Republican party were born together. [Hearty applause.] Its first impulses were stirred by the wrongs of her people; the party was baptized in her blood. [Rapturous applause.] The people of Kansas in 1856 appeared in the National Republican Convention and threw a vote for the then Republican nominee. The people of Kansas throughout the whole of their struggle have vindicated in Kansas the Republican party, their cause and their principles. It may be said to-day that Kansas is not a state--Kansas is not a territory--it is scarcely a state; but the cause of liberty is identified with her history. She has a history and a glorious one. This administration, whose duty it was to foster this infant state, has dealt with Kansas with a harsh rule. The hand of the administration, that she has felt so often, has been a hard, stern hand; and all has been done to keep her back, and prevent her from rising and bearing aloft the banner of Republican liberty. If Kansas had accepted the Lecompton bribe she would have been a state to-day. If Kansas had not been one of the strongest and best united organizations in the Republican party, she would have been received into the Union years ago by the Democrats at Washington. [Applause.] But Kansas scorned the Lecompton bribe, and stands there to-day, and will stand forever, a Republican state. [Great cheers.] Mr. Chairman, Kansas does not expect to come into this Convention and be alienated from the Republican party. She stands now a territory because she would not share or accept the spoils of the Democratic party. She has alienated herself from everything to identify her people and her destiny with the cause of the National Republican party; and now I don't think the time has come when the Republicans can alienate her from them. [Loud cheers.] I do not wish to consume the time of thisConvention by arguing this point. I do not think the gentlemen of this Convention will demand that Kansas shall be excluded. She has come here to say if she have preferences she will exercise these preferences or leave this hall. Kansas believes in the right, which has carried her through many a dark hour; and she believes that it is principle alone which will carry the Republican cause through in triumph.\n\nMr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania: I regret exceedingly that I was misunderstood by the gentlemen who have responded to me in behalf of the States of Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky. I made no proposition to exclude those gentlemen from a fair representation upon this floor--[Applause]--none at all. I proposed that certain states be referred back to the committee for the purpose of an investigation, to see what vote they are entitled to on this floor.\n\nMr. Blakey: I was not present when the proposition was made.\n\nMr. Wilmot: In the course of my argument, for the purpose of enforcing the propriety of my amendment, I presented certain considerations that seemed to me to be entitled to weight, to wit: that gentlemen who come here representing no party--having no constituencies--were not entitled to vote for their states upon this floor. That was the simple proposition that I made. Now, I desire that the facts be inquired into. Will it be pretended that thirty gentlemen meeting at the city of Baltimore, not delegates from the counties of the state, but gentlemen assembling together--have a right to represent and select twenty delegates?\n\nMr. Armour: Will you allow me to correct you?\n\nMr. Wilmot: Certainly.\n\nMr. Armour: There has existed in Baltimore city, for a number of years, a Republican association. That association, in obedience to the call of the National Executive Committee,\n\n55\n\nissued calls for the Republicans of Maryland to meet in Baltimore, at such a time specified in the call, for the purpose of nominating an electoral ticket and sending delegates to this Convention. When that Convention met every Congressional district in the State of Maryland was represented. [Applause.] There were gentlemen from the eastern shore and the western shore--from the extreme east to the extreme west. There were, perhaps, only thirty-five or forty delegates; but there were at least 150 or 200 Republicans in the Convention. Baltimore city sent only eleven delegates, and therefore she was entitled to only eleven votes, yet the hall was full of Republicans. My town is full of Republicans, and I wish to say in reference to the remark of Judge Wilmot, that we have no party in Maryland, I have the assurance of a gentleman, and know it to be true, that in my town--which polls only about 900 votes--we can poll 300 votes at the next election, nearly half the votes of the town--not of the district. That is all I have to say.\n\nMr. Wilmot: The explanation that the gentleman has made, if it does anything, would enforce the propriety of my motion. What I have desired is that the committee should investigate this subject and report the facts in respect to these states. That is what I have desired. If Maryland be properly represented here; if there be a party in Maryland, whether great, large or small, that stands as an organized party in the field, that is the point; not that there maybe Republicans scattered over the state. There may be a majority in the town in which the gentleman lives. There may be individual Republicans scattered over that state in every county, but have they combined together in a Republican organization, and do they come here representing an organized party? This is the question I desire this committee to inquire into, and that is the very object of the motion. The committee might report that Maryland was entitled to her senatorial votes on this floor, and that she was entitled to a vote from such and such a district. If they so reported upon the facts\n\n56\n\n57\n\n58\n\nbefore them I shall be willing to accept that report. So too, as to Virginia, if the committee reported that certain districts in Virginia took regular action as an organized party and elected their delegates, and were entitled to so many votes in virtue of the delegates from such districts, I should be willing to accept that report, and in addition, I should stand ready to give them the two electoral votes of their state. So in respect to Texas. But what are the facts about her, gentlemen? I speak of it upon nothing but rumor and as a rumor --I don't assert the fact, for I know nothing about it--but I am told that the gentlemen who are here from Texas, or a majority of them, are not residents of the state at all, and that they have no Republican organization in that state. It may be said that the delegates of Oregon are not residents of that state. But we know that Oregon has a formidable party--a minority it is true; but we know that they held a regular State Convention, and that they elected their delegates regularly, and that some of those gentlemen have given deputations to certain distinguished gentlemen here, and that these gentlemen are entitled to their seats; so if Texas has held a regular convention and elected her delegates, and they find it inconvenient to attend as delegates, and they have deputed others to represent them, then, gentlemen, they are entitled to seats upon this floor. But if there has been no convention --no movement in Texas, if nothing having the semblance of a party has taken action in the State of Texas, and certain gentlemen are here for the purpose of controlling this result, then I say it is mischievous, it is demoralizing; it will break up any party under God's Heaven. Will the distinguished gentleman, a candidate before this Convention, or rather his friends, consent that they shall be overslaughed or defeated by the votes of gentlemen representing no party, by gentlemen having no constituents? Will the friends of the candidate which Pennsylvania will present submit to such a procedure? If they do, it would be extremely hard--it would be difficult to enforce submission. This was the object of my proposition. I wish, gentlemen, instead of indulging indeclamation and rhetorical flourishes, in appeals to the ashes of Washington, had consented to meet the question fairly by argument. I raised no question with the good gentleman from Maryland as to who has dared more or suffered more in this cause. I concede to him and his associates the palm of victory in that. But if every Republican who has suffered in the cause of freedom is to come in to settle this question, then the little territory of Kansas can control this Convention-- under that rule she has the right to control it. She has poured out her blood freely in this cause. The graves of our murdered sons are scattered all over her territory. If the question is as to those who have suffered in the cause of Republicanism, who have been mobbed, and those are to come here and control this Convention, then let us adjourn and invite Kansas to come here in a body, man, woman and child, and let them say whom the Republican party shall nominate as candidate for President. The simple question is, are all the \"good men\" here from Virginia, Maryland, Texas and certain other districts as representatives, or are they here as individual Republicans? I don't question their Republicanism. I have no doubt upon that point. I did not intimate that they had been purchased by money; I cast no imputations upon their integrity; but this I do assert, that if this precedent be adopted, that at the next Convention the sympathies or the anxiety of friends to secure their candidate may be employed to secure delegations here from every state of the Union, not because there is a party there to represent, but because the anxiety of the friends of candidates will bring men here. Would it be difficult to find twelve men in the State of Tennessee who are Republicans? I doubt not if inducements were held out to them they could come here from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and all the southern states. Then what would be the result? Instead of requiring 304 votes, you would have to require that there should be 400 votes. Why require 400, or why require 304, except that you have already virtually demoralized the Convention? If you have men here who do not represent an organized party at home, they shouldnot cast votes for their states for a Republican President. It was for the purpose of inquiry, not to proscribe or disfranchise anybody, that my motion was made.\n\nMr. Montgomery Blair, of Maryland: Will you permit a delegate from Maryland to say one word. I wish merely to say to the Convention--[Voices \"Louder!\"] I can only make myself heard over a small space. But I must say one word, and that is, so far as my feelings are concerned, and of a large majority of those with whom I am associated on this floor, the sentiments uttered by the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania meet our entire accord. [Applause.] We wish no larger voice in this deliberation than the gentlemen of the Convention with whom we are associated shall deem our members and those whom we represent entitled to have on this floor. [Cheers.] We do not come here, (and I speak for myself and, I believe, a large portion of those representing slave states on this floor,) we do not wish to stand here as dictating to those who have to elect the candidates. We are willing, we ask only to be heard, and if permitted we will give our votes in the direction which we think ought to be taken by the Convention; but we do not wish, and we will endeavor so to act--and I am sure I represent the sentiments of those who are associated with me--upon this point as not to give any controlling voice in the Convention. [Applause.] That is all I have to say upon the subject. I would be glad to have some action, if the Convention deem it necessary, taken upon the point which the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania has, I think, timely made before this body, and I therefore second his motion. [Applause.]\n\nGov. Cleveland, of Connecticut: I regret exceedingly the remarks of the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Montgomery Blair; I can see imminent danger in this movement now made, and"}, {"url": "https://thecjn.ca/perspectives/opinions/uncle-lewis-changed-american-zionism/", "page_content": "As many of us follow the election campaign south of the border with apprehension and amusement, it\u2019s worth recalling that the voting process has undergone significant changes over time. Indeed, the concept of an anonymous voting system was introduced in the United States only toward the end of the 19th century. The secret ballot was drafted by a legal scholar named Lewis Naphtali Dembitz to meet the growing public demand for the protection of voters. The basic idea was a closed voting box, with the only hole being a small slit at the top.\n\nPolitically active \u2013 he was a delegate to the 1860 Republican national convention \u2013 Dembitz retained his connection to Judaism and was considered an Orthodox Jew, despite the fact that all his colleagues, neighbours and family members in Louisville, Ky., were secular and assimilated. His steadfastness and fidelity inspired others, especially his nephew, Louis, who many years later would reminisce vividly about spending Shabbat at his uncle\u2019s house, recalling \u201cthe joy and awe with which my uncle welcomed the arrival of the day and the piety with which he observed it. I remember the extra delicacies, lighting of the candles, prayers over a cup of wine, quaint chants, and Uncle Lewis poring over books most of the day. I remember more particularly an elusive something about him which was spoken of as the \u2018Sabbath peace\u2019\u2026 Uncle Lewis used to say that he was enjoying a foretaste of heaven.\u201d\n\nYoung Louis admired his uncle greatly. He even changed his middle name from David to Dembitz in his honour, and chose law as his profession because of him.\n\nMany years later, in 1910, the successful and well-known Louis was being interviewed by Jacob de Haas, the editor of a Boston Jewish newspaper and an early leader of the Zionist movement, on the subject of legal matters and life insurance. During their conversation, de Haas asked Louis if he was related to Lewis Dembitz. After hearing of the connection, the editor said to the nephew that his uncle was \u201ca noble Jew,\u201d for he \u201chad been one of the first Americans to support Theodor Herzl,\u201d the father of modern Zionism.\n\nREAD: A TRUE ROLE MODEL HAS LEFT US\n\nAt that point in time, most major American Jewish leaders and organizations were either lukewarm or openly opposed to the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine and considered it a conflict to their American identity. Many stated publicly that support for the Zionist idea would be viewed by the gentiles as disloyalty to the United States. It was a common belief that if Jews wanted to become accepted by the American public, their only loyalty had to be to the United States of America and not to any other country. But Jacob de Haas was searching for a person to ignite the spirit of Zionism in the United States.\n\nFor Louis, hearing from de Haas that his beloved uncle was a supporter of Zionism was a momentous revelation. Shortly after, he became heavily involved in the project and became an ardent, committed Zionist. Louis was able to show that Zionism and American patriotism did not conflict. This broad support led to president Woodrow Wilson\u2019s endorsement of the Balfour Declaration.\n\nMany historians note that it was due to his backing of the endeavour that a significant shift occurred, leading Zionism to become popular and acceptable to the majority of American Jews.\n\nThus the contribution of Lewis Naphtali Dembitz did not end with the secret ballot. His commitment to tradition inspired his nephew to support a homeland for the Jewish People and change the attitude of American Jewry and the stance of the White House.\n\nIn 1916, Louis became the first Jewish Justice of the United States Supreme Court, known to us all as Louis D. Brandeis.\n\nRabbi Yirmiya Milevsky is spiritual director of Congregation B\u2019nai Torah in Toronto."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/southern-delegates-and-republican-national-convention-politics-18801928/540F518E6A0CC59C52FFE7D002474F97", "page_content": "More generally, we enhance scholarly understanding of the relationships among internal Republican politics, presidential elections, and Southern strategies, by showing that these Southern strategies have been more persistent and developmentally significant than previously assumed. Footnote 6 The term Southern strategy was first used to describe the electoral strategies of post\u2013World War II presidential hopefuls Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan\u2014but in fact, as we illustrate, Southern strategies have been of constant importance to the Republican Party since its founding. Footnote 7 In the post-Reconstruction decades, the Southern strategy sometimes had internal organizational logics, vote-getting logics, and party-building logics all working simultaneously, while at other times the strategy just had nomination and party-building logics. We also show that group and minority representation\u2014usually associated with the contemporary Democratic Party\u2014played a key role in the evolution of the Republican Party and shaped the candidate nomination processes. In all these ways, we believe that this article highlights and illuminates the evolution of the party system and presidential politics.\n\nIn laying out this history, we add significantly to the literature on national party organization in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Many of the details we present here were previously recorded only in historical case studies, focusing on specific election years or individual political actors, and thus a coherent story of how Republican leaders dealt with Southern delegations in the aftermath of Reconstruction has never been told. In presenting such a story, we consider how leadership incentives changed, as the likelihood of a viable Southern wing of the GOP waned over time (even as the party grew in strength in other parts of the country) and Southern delegates were increasingly seen as votes to be purchased by the highest bidder.\n\nIn short, in the first two decades after Reconstruction, concerns about Southern representation at the National Convention were raised occasionally, but they never generated much support. Hope still existed that a Southern wing of the party could be rebuilt, and the link to the past (as the \u201cParty of Lincoln\u201d) along with basic concerns of fairness were enough to stymie the desire for a meaningful change. With Republican electoral ascendancy at the turn of the century, a new focus on Southern representation at the convention was established. Soon, the \u201cappropriate\u201d size of the Southern delegations became a bargaining chip in intraparty power struggles. While several meaningful changes were discussed, only one significant alteration in representation was made\u2014in December 1913, in advance of the 1916 Republican National Convention. Here, in response to progressive complaints following the heated Taft\u2013Roosevelt campaign in 1912, representation for former Confederate delegations was finally reduced\u2014which had the effect of dampening Southern strength at the GOP convention by nearly 6 percentage points. A further reduction was adopted by the Republican National Committee (RNC) in 1923, but was quickly rescinded and never went into effect.\n\nAs the twentieth century dawned, however, the Republicans began to think with one mind (electorally speaking) with regard to the South. McKinley's smashing presidential victory (and electoral coattails) in 1896, and his reelection four years later, cemented the GOP's dominance in most regions of the country. Footnote 4 Under the \u201cSystem of 1896,\u201d Republicans could easily win presidential elections and congressional majorities without Southern support, even as their vote total in the former Confederacy decreased even further. Consequently, any remaining Stalwart considerations melted away, as the South could be comfortably ignored without damage to the GOP's national fortunes. Footnote 5 This new reality helped frame how Republican delegations from the South would be viewed by various elements in the party.\n\nThere is sometimes a danger in reading back in history, such that we (as scholars) impart a complete knowledge of the future to the political actors in question. In this case, for many Republican politicians in the late nineteenth century, it wasn't clear that the Democratic resurgence in the South was unassailable. True Jim Crow restrictions would not start to be implemented until the 1890s, and Republicans continued to have some success at various levels of government (often through fusion arrangements with third parties) in states like Virginia and North Carolina through the end of the century. Indeed, the Stalwart faction of the GOP continued to pursue a Reconstruction policy through 1890, when a new Enforcement Act (which would have placed voting rights' enforcement power in the federal courts) was passed in the House but went down to defeat (narrowly) in the Senate. This victory for white Southerners hastened the adoption of Jim Crow and encouraged the remaining vestiges of Reconstruction to be eliminated\u2014for example, the Enforcement Acts of the early 1870s were formally repealed in 1894, when the Democrats enjoyed unified control of the federal government for the first time since the antebellum era.\n\nAs the apportionment of states' delegations to Republican National Conventions had traditionally been determined by the size of their congressional delegations (regardless of party distribution), it is perhaps tempting to claim that \u201cpath dependence\u201d overrode the growing disconnect between convention delegation size and electoral performance. However, we argue that two other (related) explanations better capture the historical reality: (1) the ongoing hope in the late nineteenth century for a resurgence of the Republican Party in the South and (2) the continuous incentive for Republican presidents and other ambitious party leaders to treat Southern convention delegations as \u201crotten boroughs,\u201d that is, as sizable voting blocs that could be bought (controlled) via patronage and bribery.\n\nWith the South once again closed off to the GOP, Republican Party leaders had to figure out how to deal with the former Confederate states. Footnote 3 Answers varied by context and took many forms. In this article, we examine how the Republicans dealt with the South in terms of GOP National Convention politics in the decades following the end of Reconstruction. The role of Southern delegations at Republican conventions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries presents something of a puzzle: while the probability of any Southern states having a hand in the election of a Republican to the presidency declined (and approached zero) in the years after Reconstruction, these same states were consistently allotted sizable delegations to the Republican convention. Indeed, we show that Southern delegates in several election years represented the deciding votes in ballots selecting the presidential and vice presidential candidates for the Republican ticket. This raises the question of why Republican Party leaders from other parts of the country would allow a region in which the GOP was increasingly nonexistent to continue to have a strong say in the selection of presidential candidates and other major decisions made during national conventions.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, during the period in U.S. history known as Reconstruction, the Republican Party successfully established a wing in the former Confederate states, a portion of the nation that had been effectively closed off to the party in its early years. Footnote 1 With various voting restrictions placed on much of the Southern white population, the Grand Old Party's (GOP's) \u201cDixie wing\u201d flourished through 1870, as state governments were firmly in Republican hands and the party controlled a majority of seats in the U.S. Congress. In the early 1870s, however, things changed: the onset of violent repression of African American voting, the resurgence of white voting in the South (by 1871), and the elimination of the ban on office holding for most ex-Confederates (via the Amnesty Act of 1872) combined with a severe economic depression following the Panic of 1873 to foster a Democratic revival. Footnote 2 The Democrats regained majority control of the U.S. House in the midterm elections of 1874, and by 1876 had taken back most of the Southern state governments. With the Compromise of 1877, and the eventual election of Rutherford Hayes to the presidency, the Democrats' consolidation of the former Confederacy was complete\u2014in historical parlance, and in the minds of whites in the region, the South had been \u201credeemed.\u201d\n\nWe will recount the political details surrounding the various reapportionment motions in the next few sections. For now, though, it is helpful to get a sense of what was at stake in the reapportionment conflicts, and the extent to which the Republican Party found itself marginalized electorally in the South. Figure 1 details the percentage of the two-party vote that GOP presidential candidates received both nationally and regionally (South vs. non-South) for elections from 1880 through 1928, while Table 1 lays out the state delegation totals at the Republican National Convention from 1880 through 1928. Throughout this period, Republican presidential candidates won landslide national victories (especially from 1896 onwards), despite dramatically underperforming in the South. Yet, for most of these years, the former Confederate states constituted around one-quarter of the GOP convention delegates, a substantial total for a region that provided the party with nothing on Election Day. (This percentage declined slightly until 1912, thanks mostly to the South losing House seats in a relative sense after each congressional reapportionment.) Beginning in 1916, the GOP's new delegate reapportionment scheme went into effect, and the South saw its representation at the National Convention drop by nearly 6 percentage points. The region would lose an additional half percentage point (roughly) in the three succeeding conventions (1920, 1924, and 1928).\n\nDuring a June 1921 meeting, the RNC agreed to another reapportionment scheme, which provided states with one delegate for each congressional district that maintained a Republican organization and had cast at least 2,500 votes for any Republican in the most recent presidential election plus one additional delegate for each district that cast at least 10,000 such votes. If implemented, this plan would have resulted in a further reduction in Southern delegates, drawing the total down by 40 percent since 1912. Footnote 17 During an RNC meeting in December 1923, however, the previously agreed-upon reapportionment was abandoned and the system of one delegate for each congressional district was reinstated, while the representation of the thirty-seven states that voted Republican in 1920 was increased by three at-large delegates each. Footnote 18\n\nAs a result, motions began to be offered at the Republican National Convention to tie states' delegate allotment in part to party strength, as measured by state votes cast for the most recent Republican presidential nominee. The first motion, made in 1900, would have provided each state with four at-large delegates and one additional delegate for each 10,000 votes (or majority fraction thereof) cast for the Republican nominee at the last presidential election. (Note that the 1900 motion was based on a similar motion first introduced in 1884, at a time when the Republicans were not yet ready to give up on a Southern wing.) The 1900 motion was quickly dropped, but it surfaced again in the same form in 1908 and generated a close roll-call vote (failing 471\u2013506). A similar motion was offered four years later, in 1912, which would have provided one delegate for each congressional district within a state, along with one additional delegate for each 10,000 votes (or majority fraction thereof) cast for the Republican nominee at the last presidential election. Footnote 14 While this motion was tabled at the convention, a breakthrough finally occurred in December 1913, when the RNC agreed to adopt the 1912 proposal. Footnote 15 This rules change was subsequently ratified by Republican organizations in states that produced GOP electoral majorities in 1908, and at the 1916 Republican National Convention\u2014and went into effect at that time. Footnote 16\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, opponents of the pro-Southern status quo began to gain some traction. Arguments about a Republican resurgence below the Mason-Dixon line had lost credibility, as GOP electoral gains in the South\u2014which had produced some successes in the late 1870s and early 1880s, through fusion arrangements with various independent movements\u2014were largely stymied by the mid-1880s. The Republicans' last statutory stand occurred in 1890, during the Harrison Administration, when the party controlled both chambers of Congress and Rep. Henry Cabot Lodge (R-MA) pushed a new enforcement bill that sought to resuscitate black voting rights in the South by granting new oversight powers to the federal judiciary. The Lodge Bill passed in the House, but was stopped in the Senate when \u201csilver\u201d Republicans in the West defected from the party position. Footnote 10 The Democrats responded to this GOP near miss by adopting state-level constitutional restrictions on African American voting rights in the South (Jim Crow laws) and repealing the existing Reconstruction-era Enforcement Acts at the federal level that were still on the books. Footnote 11 In addition, while the Democrats were consolidating their hold on the South, Republicans made popular vote gains in every other region of the country in the 1894\u20131896 elections; Footnote 12 once these initial gains were seen as stable, following McKinley's reelection in 1900, the GOP leadership was comfortable in asserting the party's national dominance. As a result, fewer and fewer Northern Republicans had any instrumental reason for working to maintain a foothold in the South and, perhaps more importantly, for honoring the decades-old status quo arrangement that disproportionately benefited the South at the National Convention. Footnote 13\n\nEven as the political reality changed in the post-Reconstruction years, the status quo arrangement proved impervious to change. Basic beliefs regarding fairness and inclusion continued to hold strong appeal, in part because a sizable segment of the GOP\u2014the Stalwart wing, predominantly, which was the keeper of the radical flame on Reconstruction policy and black civil rights\u2014held out hope that the Democratic resurgence in the South could be reversed. Southern Republicans themselves also lobbied to maintain their position in the GOP governing hierarchy. And, of course, Northern Republican politicians who benefited from a sizable and stable Southern delegation at the convention also opposed a change in the status quo arrangement.\n\nThus, in subsequent years, these two sets of decisions\u2014(1) equality/size driving a state's delegation allocation and (2) convention inclusivity, regardless of a state's receptivity to Republican tenets\u2014would steer Republican National Convention politics down a certain path. With each new convention, and the readoption (tacit or otherwise) of the two aforementioned sets of decisions, precedents were set that would be hard to alter later. For example, an apportionment rule divorced from party strength and a general policy of fairness and inclusion were not problematic during the Civil War and early Reconstruction years, when the Republican Party was present and dominant in every region of the country. In this case, real influence in the convention was in keeping with real influence in presidential selection (in the Electoral College). With the declining fortunes of the GOP in the South following the end of Reconstruction, a fissure opened between the two modes of influence\u2014Southern delegations retained their ability to affect Republican presidential nominations even as they lost all ability to affect outcomes on Election Day.\n\nWhile the decision to adopt an equality/size model was straightforward, the decision to provide representation to every state in the Union was not. Some states, primarily in the South, were effectively closed off to the Republican Party\u2014the question then was, should a party built consciously on free soil principles afford slave states representation at its National Convention? This issue was brought to the forefront in 1860, when the convention's Committee on Credentials proposed a delegate count that included several slave states and territories. Amendments were quickly offered that would have recommitted (i.e., eliminated) several slave-state delegations (Texas, Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, the Nebraska and Kansas Territories, and the District of Columbia). A spirited debate then ensued, with those seeking to exclude the slave-state delegations expressing concerns about the Republican mission being (potentially) undermined by their inclusion (per the belief that members from pro-slavery regions might work to destroy the party from the inside) and those seeking to seat the slave-state delegates stressing fairness and the need for the party to be truly national in scope (and not just a sectional party, as many had claimed). In the end, the pro-inclusion position won out, as the convention adopted a report advocating the seating of all the delegations, including the slave states and territories. The allocation changed slightly from 1856, with each state given four at-large delegates and two for every congressional district it possessed\u2014which was equal to twice its number of votes in the Electoral College. Footnote 9\n\nTo understand the problem of Southern representation at the Republican National Convention in the post-Reconstruction era requires a comprehension of how the GOP apportioned delegates. From the Republican Party's inception, representation was based on a dual equality/size model, where all states would be provided with a baseline delegate level that was then enhanced in proportion to the number of congressional districts each state possessed. Footnote 8 In 1856, for example, the rule chosen at the first Republican convention was that each state would receive six at-large delegates plus three for every one of its congressional districts. Incorporating such an equality/size model was pragmatic, as the Republicans in 1856 were a brand new party, so there was no obvious measure of party strength that could be used in the delegate allocation process.\n\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION POLITICS AND SOUTHERN REPRESENTATION, 1880\u20131928\n\nWith the South \u201credeemed\u201d by white Democrats, the Republicans' approach to the region changed over time. In the early years after the collapse of Reconstruction, hope for a revitalized Southern GOP lingered\u2014and this limited the degree to which Republican leaders viewed the former Confederate South as a collection of rotten boroughs. As a result, only one serious effort to reduce Southern representation at the National Convention was made in the pre-1900 period\u2014in 1884\u2014and it was defeated quickly. That said, attempts to buy Southern convention delegations clearly originated in these early years, before becoming standard practice as the century turned. Indeed, by 1900, GOP leaders had given up on a Southern wing of the party, and pragmatic vote buying of Southern state delegates\u2014and attempts by Republican factions to limit Southern representation at the National Convention, as both a ploy in a larger intrapartisan bargaining game and a sincere institutional strategy\u2014had become commonplace.\n\nThe 1880\u20131896 Period The 1880 presidential election was the first after the disputed outcome of 1876\u20131877, and the first after the South as a whole had fallen back into Democratic hands. Yet, in the wake of Reconstruction's demise, Republicans still believed that a Southern wing of the party could be maintained. President Hayes endeavored to construct a \u201cNew Departure\u201d in the South, by reaching out to white, conservative Southern Democrats on economic grounds.Footnote 19 As a result, his vision of maintaining a Southern wing meant reconfiguring it to reflect the political realities of the day. The Stalwart wing of the party rejected the Hayes plan and sought instead to keep the traditional Republican organizations alive. As the end of Hayes's term neared\u2014he announced early on that he would not seek reelection\u2014recurrent press stories of violence and intimidation toward black voters largely discredited his New Departure strategy and helped to solidify the need for stronger voting rights protections in the South. As the 1880 Republican National Convention approached, John Sherman had the upper hand vis-\u00e0-vis the South. Thanks to his position as Treasury Secretary under Hayes, Sherman controlled a massive patronage operation\u2014an enterprise that could keep a Southern wing of the GOP alive generally and tied to his presidential aspirations specifically.Footnote 20 As Kenneth D. Ackerman notes: \u201cSherman \u2026 had used Treasury Department employees\u2014all political appointees under his thumb\u2014to pack local caucuses across the South and guarantee a harvest of friendly delegates.\u201dFootnote 21 Unfortunately for Sherman, his chief opponents at the convention\u2014Senator James Blaine (ME) and former President Ulysses S. Grant\u2014commanded the support of a considerably larger group of delegates. Sherman hoped that if he could stay in the race, he would emerge as a compromise candidate. That did not come to pass, as his Ohio colleague Rep. James Garfield would eventually become the convention dark horse. Still, Sherman's Southern delegates stuck by him to the end, rather than backing Grant (who, as leader of the Stalwarts, was quite popular in the South), which had been a significant concern among the non-Grant party managers.Footnote 22 Part of this loyalty was related to Sherman's reputation as a strong civil rights advocate and, before that, a strong antislavery advocate. The results of the 1880 election kept the White House in Republican hands, as Garfield defeated the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock. But Republican leaders' fears were realized when the entirety of the former Confederate South broke for Hancock\u2014not a single electoral vote was cast for the GOP below the Mason-Dixon line. As a result, some party members called for a reconsideration of electoral apportionment rules that governed GOP representation at the National Convention. If the South was lost to the Republicans, these individuals argued, shouldn't those states that could support the party on Election Day have a stronger hand in nominee selection and platform design? The first major challenge to the fairness and inclusion status quo arrangement at the Republican National Convention occurred in 1883\u20131884, as a move was made to tie a portion of a state's delegate allotment to its GOP presidential vote total from the previous election. The new initiative was introduced by Senator William P. Frye (ME) at an RNC meeting in December 1883. Frye's plan would provide each state with four at-large delegates, one delegate for each congressional district and one additional delegate for each 10,000 votes (or majority fraction thereof) cast for the Republican nominee at the last presidential election. If implemented, Frye's plan would have had an immediate negative impact on the former Confederate South's level of representation at the 1884 convention, reducing its delegate percentage from 26.1 percent (214 of 820) to 18.4 percent (160 of 870).Footnote 23 After some discussion, the RNC members voted 25\u201318 to refer the decision to the convention\u2014which, for the time being, forestalled any change.Footnote 24 The sitting president, Chester A. Arthur, was opposed to such a change. Arthur was seeking the nomination in 1884, after ascending to the presidency following Garfield's assassination in 1881. Arthur was a machine politician, rather than an ideological or inspirational leader, who believed that his best chance at retaining the office was to establish a clear following among some element of the GOP. He considered the South to be his best bet and invested considerable time trying to build (or perhaps rebuild) a Southern wing of the party. His strategy was to back various independent movements in the Southern states, in the hope that a combined Independent\u2013Republican coalition would be sufficient to defeat the Democrats.Footnote 25 He also believed that the attention he showed Southern Republican leaders would yield direct benefits at the convention. His choice of adding William E. Chandler of New Hampshire\u2014a favorite of Southern Republicans for his condemnation of white Democrats' actions in the South\u2014to his cabinet was a fundamental part of this strategy. As Vincent P. De Santis notes, Chandler was chosen in part \u201cto conduct the 1882 congressional elections in the South,\u201d but perhaps more importantly, Chandler was also given the job of rounding up southern delegates for Arthur at the 1884 national convention. The Washington correspondent of the New York Age reported that it was an open secret that Arthur had taken Chandler into the cabinet for this express purpose. \u2026 Chandler had the full authority to barter away federal patronage and to use southern offices where they would do the most good in picking up delegates for the President.Footnote 26 While Frye's motion resonated with many in the party, it would not in the end be implemented. Arthur and Chandler saw to that. As noted, important segments within the GOP still believed that Republican electoral success in the South was possible. They merely had to look at the victories achieved by William Mahone in 1879 and 1881 in Virginia for evidence; his \u201cReadjuster\u201d organization\u2014in alliance with state Republicans\u2014successfully defeated the Democrats in the Old Dominion. Arthur and Chandler used Mahone's victory and highlighted their own (somewhat successful) efforts to back fusion tickets in other states in 1882, to counter Frye's challenge.Footnote 27 When Frye's initiative was proposed once again in June 1884 at the Republican National Convention, it elicited sharp debate. The issue of fairness was raised on both sides, by those who believed that state representation at the convention should better mirror state influence on Election Day as well as by those who sought to avoid blaming Southern Republicans for the disfranchisement efforts of Southern Democrats. John Lynch (R-MS), a black delegate and temporary chairman of the convention, spoke passionately about maintaining the South's level of representation in the GOP convention and suggested instead that Southern representation in Congress should be reduced because of disfranchisement, in accordance with the provisions of the 14th Amendment. In the end, the proponents of the Frye plan sensed that they lacked a majority and dropped their challenge, and the status quo arrangement was maintained.Footnote 28 With state apportionment reform defeated, Arthur could focus on retaining his hold on the presidency in 1884. Thanks to his and Chandler's strategic use of patronage appointments, he entered the convention with a solid foundation of Southern support.Footnote 29 Unfortunately, Arthur could not muster much of an additional following, and the nomination eventually went to James Blaine on the fourth ballot.Footnote 30 Nevertheless, Arthur's support among Southern delegates largely held throughout the balloting. As Charles W. Calhoun notes: \u201cFrom the first to the fourth and last ballot, 82 percent of Arthur's supporters from the states of the old Confederacy stuck by the president.\u201dFootnote 31 As the 1888 presidential election approached, the Republicans found themselves in a different situation\u2014being the \u201cout\u201d presidential party for the first time in three decades. Grover Cleveland bested Blaine in 1884, and the GOP's efforts in the South had trailed off after their moderate success in 1882. By 1888, while the protection of civil and voting rights continued to be mentioned by Republican politicians, the basis of national party politics had inevitably turned to substantive differences on major economic policy (for example, the tariff would be the critical issue in the 1888 general election campaign).Footnote 32 The front-runner for the Republican nomination in 1888 was once again John Sherman of Ohio (now back in the U.S. Senate). His long history of support for black civil rights once again gave him an edge in the South.Footnote 33 However, Southern Republicans had been denied executive patronage since 1885, when Cleveland entered the White House; as a result, they were a beleaguered group, and some worried that they would sacrifice long-term loyalty for short-term benefit (in keeping with the shifting currents of nomination politics). And this is what seems to have occurred: while Sherman led the field for the first six ballots, he could not get much beyond the halfway mark in terms of winning the nomination. Moreover, he saw the Southern share of his delegate total decline, to the benefit of Russell A. Alger, lumber baron, former Union general, and former governor of Michigan, who possessed an \u201cample wealth [that] gave him the wherewithal to court delegates outside of Michigan, especially in the South.\u201dFootnote 34 That Alger \u201cbought\u201d Southern delegates who had previously been committed to Sherman became the narrative that emerged from the convention. As James A. Kehl recounts, In explaining Sherman's decline in the South, a subordinate complained that Alger \u2018bought our Negro delegates like sheep.\u2019 Under the guise of purchasing gallery tickets from southern blacks who desperately needed expense money, Alger literally purchased the delegates who transferred their allegiance from Sherman.Footnote 35 Sherman himself also subscribed to this narrative. In his memoirs, published in 1895, Sherman made clear that he felt Alger and his lieutenants were corrupt: \u201cI believe and had, as I thought, conclusive proof that the friends of General Alger substantially purchased the votes of many of the delegates of the Southern states who had been instructed by their conventions to vote for me.\u201dFootnote 36 Alger responded by saying such charges had \u201cno foundation\u201d and indicated that Sherman's brother, General William T. Sherman, harbored no ill will toward him.Footnote 37 Prior to 1888, there had been a general belief that Southern delegates could be plied with patronage appointments, and that established loyalties would be honored during the nomination balloting. Beginning in 1888, a more base belief about Southern delegates emerged, that is, that they were available continuously to the highest bidder. More generally, as the viability of the Southern wing of the GOP declined, the degree to which the Southern state organizations became rotten boroughs increased significantly. Benjamin Harrison, Senator from Indiana, eventually won the 1888 GOP nomination and went on to defeat President Grover Cleveland (and lead the Republicans' recapture of the House and Senate) in November.Footnote 38 All else equal, Harrison, as a sitting president, should have considered renomination in 1892 to be little more than a formality. However, he presided at a time when the party was in a state of disarray, as the Republicans were slaughtered in the 1890 midterms and lost majority control of the House. In addition, Harrison's cold, impersonal style and unwillingness to play ball with GOP party bosses like Tom Platt of New York and Matt Quay of Pennsylvania on matters of patronage created significant dissension within the Republican ranks. Finally, Harrison became estranged from James Blaine, his Secretary of State, who resigned days before the Republican National Convention. As a result, a movement\u2014led by Quay\u2014to replace Harrison at the top of the ticket gained momentum. And Blaine appeared ready to accept the nomination, if it came to him.Footnote 39 In the end, Harrison was saved by the South. His ability to control Southern delegates with patronage was something Platt, Quay, and others could not overcome. The first hint of Harrison's convention strength came on a contest regarding the seating of delegates from Alabama, which Harrison's side won.Footnote 40 This led Quay to remark, \u201cThe Harrison people have bought up the colored fellows, and we must try to get them back.\u201dFootnote 41 Quay then frantically tried to convince enough delegates to back Blaine or William McKinley, then a Senator from Ohio, to prevent a Harrison first-ballot majority; his hope was to extend the contest, and by doing so, steadily build a coalition against Harrison. And while he was able to whittle away at some of Harrison's strength, Quay was ultimately unsuccessful\u2014Harrison received a 59 percent majority on the first ballot and captured the nomination. Table 2 provides a breakdown of the balloting by region. As the numbers make clear, Harrison dominated the South, winning 164.16 of 224 delegate votes, or 73.3 percent. Moreover, those 164.16 votes constituted just under 31 percent of his entire delegate total. Given that 454 votes were necessary for a convention majority, Harrison's Southern support was crucial\u2014as he was able to manage only 371 votes outside of the former Confederacy. As James Kehl notes, \u201cHarrison's patronage power, particularly in the South, was the decisive factor. \u2026 In the South, Blaine could attract only 10 percent of the delegate support necessary to acquire the nomination and had no asset comparable to patronage when he went forth to corner the other 90 percent.\u201d Summing things up, with an assist from Quay himself, Kehl states, \u201cWith the Republican electoral potential of the South almost nonexistent, Quay commented that \u2018the President has been renominated by the powers which cannot give him an electoral vote.\u2019\u201dFootnote 42 The divisive nature of Harrison's renomination would work against the Republicans in the 1892 general election, as GOP party bosses provided only tepid support in mobilizing voters. The result was that Cleveland would regain the presidency in his rematch with Harrison. This left the Republicans looking ahead to 1896 as the \u201cout party\u201d once again. The GOP frontrunner in 1896 would be William McKinley, who had been a (reluctant) candidate for the nomination in both 1888 and 1892. His campaign manager, Mark Hanna, had been positioning McKinley for the presidency for some time, and Hanna set out to build a majority coalition for McKinley well in advance of the convention. And having witnessed Harrison defeat a renomination challenge in 1892, and watching how he accomplished it, Hanna understood that \u201ccultivating a strong relationship with southern Republicans [needed to be] a large part of his plan.\u201dFootnote 43 As a result, he decided to \u201chunt where the ducks were\u201d (more than a half-century before Barry Goldwater would make such a quip) and rented a house in Thomasville, Georgia, so that he and McKinley over several weeks in the winter of 1895 could host Southern GOP delegates\u2014both black and white\u2014and \u201cdiscuss patronage and other political possibilities in a relaxed atmosphere.\u201dFootnote 44 Hanna and McKinley had hoped to keep their Thomasville strategy as inconspicuous as possible, but word eventually leaked out, and other Republican nomination hopefuls attempted to countermobilize. But such efforts were in vain, as Hanna and McKinley's first-mover advantage paid off\u2014McKinley went on to control the votes of 196.5 of the former Confederacy's 224 votes on his way to a landslide victory at the 1896 convention. New York GOP party boss Tom Platt showed Hanna some grudging respect in the aftermath, saying: \u201cHe had the South practically solid before some of us awakened.\u201dFootnote 45\n\nThe 1900\u20131908 Period The presidential elections of 1896 and 1900 established the Republicans as the majority party across most of the United States for the better part of the next three decades. While the Republicans expanded their dominance in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, however, the South remained almost exclusively Democratic throughout this period. As a result, the traditional argument that a GOP revival in the solid South remained a possibility\u2014which, in part, validated the sizable Southern presence at Republican conventions\u2014increasingly lost its value. As Richard M. Valelly argues, the Republican Party's ability after 1897 to win the presidency and Congress without achieving electoral success in the South produced an \u201cabrupt change in the costs and benefits of the party's historical southern policy.\u201dFootnote 46 That is, Republican leaders concluded that the cost of maintaining a party organization in the South fit to contest elections in the face of an unbeatable (and very hostile)Footnote 47 Democratic majority outweighed the increasingly slim chances at Republican electoral success there.Footnote 48 In this context, the intra-Republican struggle over the South increased after the 1896 election, and the party saw a series of clashes between camps, some of which benefited from the presence of Southern delegates. Republican administrations continued to use their control of patronage in the South to produce a reliable and sizable voting bloc that played a significant role in the selection of presidential candidates in 1908, 1912, 1924, and 1928. However, in the same period, several moves were made by competing party factions to reduce the size of Southern delegations. Not all of these moves were entirely genuine; rather, some represented attempts to use the threat of reapportionment against Southern delegates to force compliance on other issues. Additionally, Republican leaders were far from consistent in their support of or opposition to Southern delegates, and were prone to changing their positions depending on whether they controlled federal patronage or not. After the 1896 election, McKinley and Hanna increased their control over the Southern GOP through the use of federal patronage. While McKinley's renomination was never in doubt, the 1900 convention, and the period leading up to it, saw two major public attempts to reduce Southern representation at the Republican National Convention. The first came in December 1899, during a two-day RNC meeting at which the convention city of 1900 was to be selected. Henry Clay Payne, RNC member from Wisconsin and an important actor in McKinley's 1896 campaign, proposed to replace the existing division of delegates (in which states received two delegates for each senator and representative they had in Congress, regardless of partisan affiliation) with a new scheme in which each state would receive four at-large delegates and one additional delegate for each 10,000 votes that it had contributed to the Republican presidential ticket in the most recent election. If passed, the plan would have significantly reduced Southern representation at the 1900 convention\u2014from 224 delegates (25 percent of the total), under the existing rules, to 126 delegates (14 percent of the total), based on the 1896 presidential vote totals.Footnote 49 ,Footnote 50 From Payne's perspective (at least as stated publicly), this decrease in Southern representation was simply a case of fairness. He argued the necessity of such a change by asking \u201cwhy the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, casting 200,076 Republican votes at the last Presidential election, should have 124 delegates in the National Convention, while New Jersey, casting 221,367 Republican votes, should have but twenty delegates?\u201dFootnote 51 Unsurprisingly, Southern Republicans were not enthused with Payne's proposal; black Southern GOP members, in particular, charged Payne with attempting to drive out black delegates from the party entirely.Footnote 52 Nonetheless, Payne's proposal was considered reasonable by non-Southern party leaders given that, as the Charlotte Daily Observer noted, \u201cthe counsels of white Southern Republican delegates are lightly esteemed in the national conventions of their party and the colored delegates are regarded as so many chattels to be purchased by the highest bidder.\u201dFootnote 53 While black Southern Republican leaders had \u201clittle hope of success\u201dFootnote 54 in opposing Payne's proposal, it in fact never came to a vote during the RNC meeting. Instead, the selection of the 1900 convention city and the decision on Payne's delegate plan (the two crucial issues of the meeting) were settled as part of a logroll between the different regional camps. The committee members from Pennsylvania were willing to oppose the Payne plan if Philadelphia were chosen as the 1900 convention city. Meanwhile, Southern members of the RNC decided to vote as one unit on the selection of a convention city and planned to decide their preferences as to the \u201csubject of the selection of the place of meeting in such a way as will win for them most support in their fight against reapportionment.\u201dFootnote 55 ,Footnote 56 These negotiations were concluded successfully, as Philadelphia was selected over Chicago. The Southern bloc played a crucial role in this process\u2014without unanimous Southern support, Pennsylvania would have lost its bid to Illinois, as the outcome was decided by a single vote. After the selection of Philadelphia, Payne was shuttled to the White House for late night meetings with McKinley and Hanna, during which he came to understand that \u201ccommitteemen who had favored [the reapportionment plan] in private correspondence, had been stormed into opposition by letters and telegrams from every source.\u201dFootnote 57 As a result, Payne withdrew his proposal the following day, stating that while he had not \u201cin the slightest degree changed [his] conviction as to its justice,\u201dFootnote 58 the opposition to the plan had convinced him not to offer it to a committee vote. Whether Payne himself understood the proposal to be a mere bargaining chip (all along) remains unclear, but by the end of the two-day RNC meeting, Philadelphia had been named the host of the 1900 convention with Southern support and Payne's plan for reducing Southern representation had been abandoned. During the 1900 GOP convention, Pennsylvania's Boss Matt Quay resuscitated the Payne plan, but here too the size of future Southern delegations was used as a bargaining chip to achieve a different goal\u2014to influence the choice of the Republican vice presidential candidate. That is, with McKinley's renomination assured, the only major issue before the convention was who would become the vice presidential candidate after Garret Hobart's death in 1899. Among the most discussed options was New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt, although he was on record as having no interest in the nomination. Nonetheless, Roosevelt's candidacy was pushed by members of the New York Machine, as they sought to rid themselves of their increasingly powerful and independent governor.Footnote 59 While McKinley and Hanna had expressed no interest in having Roosevelt on the ticket, New York's Boss Platt sought Quay's help to ensure that Roosevelt would be nominated.Footnote 60 Quay believed Roosevelt's selection was possible\u2014but only if he could win over Western and Southern delegates. The latter, however, were firmly under Hanna's control. During the second day of the convention, Quay introduced the Payne proposal to reapportion delegates but, admitting that it \u201cinvolves a very radical change in the base of representation,\u201dFootnote 61 called for a vote on the proposal to be postponed until the next day. This delay, according to Quay, would give delegates time to educate themselves on the specifics of the plan. With black Southern Republicans already frustrated at the seating of several rival \u201clily-white\u201d slates (reportedly due to pressure from Quay and PayneFootnote 62 ), the Quay proposal was met with \u201cmanifest uneasiness\u201d and the belief that its passage would result in the \u201cdeath of Republicanism in the South\u201d altogether.Footnote 63 With only hours before a scheduled vote on the matter, Southern delegates lobbied other regional delegations in an attempt to prevent the proposal's passage. Quay's introduction of the Payne delegation plan can be understood as something of a hostage situation: By proposing a change but immediately postponing further debate, Quay successfully stirred discontent among Northern delegates vis-\u00e0-vis the South, while simultaneously threatening Southern delegates with a loss of influence in the future. With Southern desperation rising, \u201cQuay quietly leaked to Southern delegates the idea that he was prepared to withdraw the resolution if they swung their support to the New York governor.\u201dFootnote 64 The move worked as planned: Southern delegates traded their votes for vice president in exchange for Quay dropping his reapportionment proposal.Footnote 65 Sensing imminent defeat, Hanna and McKinley accepted Roosevelt as the vice presidential nominee. At the beginning of the third day of proceedings, Quay withdrew the delegate proposal without further comment and Theodore Roosevelt was selected as McKinley's running mate. After McKinley's assassination in September 1901, Roosevelt was elevated to the presidency and, while maintaining a cordial relationship with Hanna, understood that he faced a likely challenge to the Republican nomination from the Ohio senator in 1904.Footnote 66 To build majority support at the convention, Roosevelt sought to gain control over Southern delegates through federal patronage, mostly by distributing postmaster positions. While Roosevelt (like Hayes before him) attempted to improve the standing of the GOP in the South through his willingness \u201cto appoint Democrats rather than some of the old party hacks,\u201dFootnote 67 he simultaneously frustrated white Southerners in both parties by appointing several black officeholders. In trying to manage the Republican Party in the South, Roosevelt therefore found himself ensnared in the expanding conflict between lily whites, who sought to make the Southern GOP a \u201cwhite man's party,\u201d and black & tans, who sought to maintain an active role for African Americans, over the control of these organizations.Footnote 68 As a result, Hanna, while no longer in direct control of patronage, remained popular in the South and a potential challenger to Roosevelt.Footnote 69 However, Hanna's sudden death in February 1904 changed things. Roosevelt's personal popularity left no credible challengers, and he was nominated unanimously during the 1904 convention. In the four years that followed, Roosevelt expanded his control of Southern GOP organizations and, during the run-up to the 1908 convention, pushed Southern delegates to support William Howard Taft's candidacy. The Roosevelt administration's use of (Southern) patronage was one of the key factors that would lead to Taft's successful nomination. Postmaster General George von Lengerke Meyer in particular played an important role in this regard: recipients of postmaster positions in the South were \u201cselected with Mr. Taft's nomination in mind,\u201d and while postmasters were \u201cdiscouraged from being officers of the conventions or of the committees, \u2026 they could work behind the scenes and could also attend, as delegates, the national convention.\u201dFootnote 70 Indeed, a congressional investigation of the Roosevelt administration in 1909 concluded that \u201cthe officeholders in the South practically control the Republican Party organization in their respective states\u201d and that \u201cnearly one in three [Southern delegates], and of some Southern states more than half\u201d at the 1908 Republican convention were federal officeholders.Footnote 71 While Taft himself had been critical of the Southern rotten boroughs and held that votes at the Republican convention should be proportional to the party's vote share,Footnote 72 the Southern delegates proved to be a reliable base for him\u2014of the 240 Southern delegates at the 1908 convention, 223 (an impressive 93 percent) voted for Taft on the first (and only) presidential ballot. Meanwhile, delegates from other regions that Roosevelt controlled defended the South against an attempt by anti-Taft forces to reduce Southern representation. This was done with long-term rather than short-term consequences in mind\u2014Taft could have been nominated without this Southern support on the first ballot\u2014as Roosevelt \u201cwas not prepared to see his successor deprived of so useful a political device\u201dFootnote 73 as a reliable Southern voting bloc. This would have dramatic consequences for Roosevelt himself: While the outcome of the 1908 convention was one of party unity behind its new leader, the 1912 convention would see Southern delegates play a crucial role in preventing Roosevelt from regaining the leadership of the GOP.\n\nStanding at Armageddon: The South and the 1912 Republican National Convention The 1912 convention presented a crucial test of a Republican administration's ability to control Southern delegates and use them to produce a majority. With President Taft up for reelection but facing a challenge from the progressive wing of the party, his lieutenants began organizing the Republican old guard conservatives in 1911. By early 1912, Taft's reelection came to face an even bigger hurdle when Roosevelt announced that he would challenge him for the nomination. While Roosevelt had anointed Taft as his chosen successor in 1908, their relationship had soured during that campaign and Taft's subsequent presidency. Roosevelt, increasingly restless and frustrated in his exile from power, began in 1911 to consider challenging Taft's reelection.Footnote 74 On the urging of his supporters, Roosevelt in February 1912 finally decided to insert himself into the race, stating that he would not be \u201cunresponsive to a plain public duty.\u201dFootnote 75 Roosevelt's ability to prevent Taft's renomination was limited, however, because of the relatively low number of primaries held in 1912. Only thirteen states held a primary, and the New York election was controlled by the local Republican machine, which was hostile to Roosevelt.Footnote 76 Additionally, Roosevelt struggled to unite Republican progressives due to a clash with Senator Robert La Follette (R-WI), who claimed that Roosevelt had encouraged him to challenge Taft before Roosevelt himself jumped in. This clash made a coherent progressive coalition unlikely during the delegate selection period and the subsequent Republican National Convention. Nonetheless, Taft's ability to survive the progressive challenge would rest, at least in part, on his capacity to produce a reliable Southern bloc. As these party organizations \u201cwere kept alive on a diet of federal patronage in order to secure favorable delegates at national conventions,\u201dFootnote 77 and because Roosevelt posed such a serious threat to Taft's renomination, near unanimous Southern support for Taft would be necessary. Charles D. Hilles, Taft's private secretary and campaign manager, was tasked with securing the South and sought to forestall the Roosevelt campaign by compelling the state committees to select their delegates as early in the election year as possible. Hilles's endeavor proved successful, with eight Southern committees choosing to select their delegates in February and March 1912, and two others selecting theirs in early April. In contrast, only four non-Southern committees held their state conventions before April.Footnote 78 This approach resulted in a predominantly pro-Taft Southern delegation: The New York Times reported that (prior to both the convention and the RNC's decisions on contested delegates) 569 delegates had been pledged to Taft or had been instructed to support him, of which 214 came from Southern states. Based on these numbers, Taft had received the support of 85 percent of all Southern GOP delegates.Footnote 79 Taft's domination of Southern delegates appears to have followed mainly from the distribution of federal patronage.Footnote 80 Indeed, evidence that the South's support for Taft was closely linked to the federal government's provision of employment is suggested by Wilensky's study of 884 Taft supporters (defined as \u201cmen and women who gave their time and money to the regular Republican cause\u201dFootnote 81 ) in the contest for the Republican nomination. While Taft supporters who held federal offices in other regions of the country made up no more than 12 percent of his support in the sample, 44 percent of Southern supporters were federal officials (see Table 3).Footnote 82 Roosevelt, in advance of the convention, decried the role Southern delegates would play for exactly this reason. Writing in the progressive publication Outlook, Roosevelt argued that the Southern delegates \u201crepresent nothing but Mr. Taft's own officeholders and the survivors of the carpetbag regime.\u201dFootnote 83 In the same vein, historian William Garrott Brown, a native of Alabama and a strong advocate of a competitive Republican Party in the South, asserted in an article in Harper's Weekly that \u201cthe mass of Southern Republican delegates chosen this year are not merely products of the same old methods employed in 1908\u201d but represented a scandal that \u201chas been flagrant for decades, but this year it is so very flagrant that one cannot help hoping something will at last be done about it.\u201dFootnote 84 With Taft seemingly controlling more delegates than the 540 needed for a majority, the Roosevelt campaign attempted to forestall defeat by challenging a large number of Taft's pledged Southern delegates. Additionally, the Roosevelt camp proposed a cut in the total number of Southern delegates that would be admitted to the convention. Both approaches failed: with Taft in control of the RNC, only nineteen of the 254 contested delegates were awarded to Roosevelt in advance of the convention, while the proposal to decrease Southern representation was voted down 39\u201314.Footnote 85 The next crucial test of Taft's strength was the selection of a temporary chair at the beginning of the convention. On a close vote (570\u2013501), conservative Senator Elihu Root (R-NY) was elected. Taft's control of the South was crucial to this success: 199 of the delegates who voted for Root were from former Confederate states (comprising 79 percent of all Southern delegates).Footnote 86 On a subsequent vote to refer all debate regarding contested delegates to the convention's Credentials Committee, the South again largely aligned with Taft: 78 percent of Southern delegates voted in favor of tabling discussion on the contested delegates.Footnote 87 Root's selection was consequential: In his role as temporary chairman, he helped the Taft camp by deciding that contested delegates had the right to vote on all of the convention's decisions, even those confirming the RNC's prior decisions on contested delegates (except those that concerned themselves).Footnote 88 This decision resulted in a majority approving the national committee's support for the Southern Taft delegates.Footnote 89 With Taft's victory now all but assured, Roosevelt called upon his delegates to bolt the convention and leave the Republican Party for a new, progressive alternative. As a result, Taft was easily renominated on the first convention ballot, while many of Roosevelt's supporters (who were still in attendance) voted \u201cpresent\u201d in protest.Footnote 90 While Taft succeeded in winning the GOP nomination, thanks in part to his solid Southern delegate bloc, the contentious 1912 convention would trigger the long-debated reapportionment of delegates. With Roosevelt running on a third-party ticket, the Republican vote in the 1912 presidential election was split, which provided Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson with a landslide victory in the Electoral College. Taft ran third behind Wilson and Roosevelt, receiving only eight electoral votes and a mere 23.2 percent of the national vote. In the aftermath of the election, both conservatives and many of the progressives who had bolted the GOP for Roosevelt realized that some form of unification between the two camps was needed to prevent a permanent Democratic majority. Shortly after Wilson's inauguration, Republican members of Congress gathered to discuss reorganization of the party and, in the words of Senator Lawrence Sherman (R-IL), \u201cagreed that Southern representation in the convention should be cut down according to the strength of the party in each Southern state.\u201dFootnote 91 ,Footnote 92 In December 1913, the RNC followed the Republican congressional recommendation and voted unanimously to reduce Southern representation by adopting a new apportionment scheme, wherein each state would receive two at-large delegates, but congressional districts would only receive a delegate if the GOP vote in the 1914 midterms was 7,500 or higher. The committee's decision would require ratification by those states that voted Republican in the 1908 election (of which two-thirds would be required to support the proposed reapportionment).Footnote 93 Without a Republican president in the White House to protect Southern delegates against the proposal, RNC Chairman Hilles announced in October 1914 that the plan had been ratified, and thus the division of delegates at the 1916 convention would be based upon the new apportionment scheme.Footnote 94 As a result, Southern representation at the 1916 convention declined relative to 1912: Every former Confederate state lost delegates (a total of seventy-eight for the South as a whole), and the South's proportion of convention delegates decreased from 23.4 percent to 17.6 percent."}, {"url": "https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/07/14/gop-convention-1860-abe-lincoln", "page_content": "\u201cGo to the devil\u2014what do I want to eat for?

When Octavian and Antony reconciled, a centurion murdered Cicero on Antony\u2019s order. Cicero\u2019s head and hands were nailed to the rostra in the Roman Forum.\n\nIn his youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero was instructed by the famed rhetorician Molon of Rhodes. Molon did not stick to any one style, instead drifting between florid and concise language. Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/1860_Republican_National_Convention", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nThe 1860 Republican National Convention, also known as the 2nd Republican National Convention, was a nominating convention of the Republican Party of the United States, held in Chicago, Illinois from May 16 to 18, 1860. The gathering nominated former U.S. Representative Abraham Lincoln of Illinois for President of the United States and Senator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine for Vice President.\n\nLincoln's nomination was a surprise, as the favorite before the convention had been former Governor of New York and U.S. Senator William H. Seward. Lincoln's campaign manager, David Davis, is credited for Lincoln's victory.\n\nLincoln-Hamlin went on to defeat three other major tickets that year, including Democratic nominee Stephen A. Douglas, U.S. Senator from Illinois.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nFile:Chicago Wigwam.png Rare photograph of the wooden frame \"Wigwam\" building specially designed and constructed for the 1860 Republican Convention in Chicago.\n\nBy 1860 the dissolution of the Whig Party in America had become an accomplished fact, with establishment Whig politicians, former Free Soilers, and a certain number of anti-Catholic populists from the Know Nothing movement flocking to the banner of the fledgling anti-slavery Republican Party. While the Republican Presidential effort on behalf of the 43-year-old Colonel John C. Fr\u00e9mont in the 1856 election had met with failure, party gains were made throughout the Northern United States as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified.\n\nParty leaders sought to hold their 1860 nominating convention in the burgeoning Middle Western trade center of Chicago, then a city of little more than 110,000 people. Unfortunately, the growing city did not at that time have a meeting hall of sufficient size for a national political convention, so an appropriation was made for the construction of a new temporary wooden frame assembly hall to seat 10,000 delegates, guests, and observers \u2014 a facility known as the \"Wigwam\".[1] The rapidly designed and constructed building proved to well fit for purpose, featuring excellent lines of sight and stellar acoustics, allowing even an ordinary speaker to be heard throughout the room.[2]\n\nThe Convention was the object of the interest and attention of a multitude of curious citizens who crowded the \"Wigwam\" to the rafters. Delegations seated by state and were virtually devoid of Southern participation, with no delegations attending from the slave states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida.[3]\n\nDelegation voting strength was loosely based upon the size of each state's congressional delegation, subject to some modification by the Credentials Committee, with the Northeastern delegations of New York (70), Pennsylvania (54), Massachusetts (26), and New Jersey (14) constituting the largest regional bloc, surpassing the Midwestern states of Ohio (46), Indiana (26), Illinois (22), and Iowa (8).[4] Some 86 votes were apportioned to the six states of New England.[4] Slave and border states with substantial delegations under the rules (but with small actual party organizations) included Kentucky (23), Virginia (23), and Missouri (18).[4] The total of all credentialed delegate votes was 466.[5]\n\nDaily affairs\n\nWith the convention called to order on May 16, former U.S. Representative David Wilmot of Pennsylvania was elected temporary chairman of the gathering. He had been the author in 1848 of the Wilmot Proviso which would have banned slavery from new states incorporated into the Union,[2] Upon his election, Wilmot delivered the keynote speech to the Convention, in which he declared that:\n\nA great sectional and aristocratic party, or interest, has for years dominated with a high hand over the political affairs of this country. That interest has wrested, and is now wresting, all the great powers of this government to the one object of the extension and nationalization of slavery. It is our purpose, gentlemen, it is the mission of the Republican Party and the basis of its organization, to resist this policy of a sectional interest.... It is our purpose and our policy to resist these new constitutional dogmas that slavery exists by virtue of the constitution wherever the banner of the Union floats.[6]\n\nOrganizational tasks filled the rest of the first day's activities, including the appointment of a Credentials Committee and a Resolutions Committee.[2] There were no contested seats although a delegation purporting to represent the state of Texas was ruled ineligible by the Credentials Committee.[2] A Platform Committee was also named, including one delegate from every state and territory in attendance.[2] This committee began its work at once and completed its task with a report on the evening of the second day, May 17.[2]\n\nPlatform\n\nThe reading of the platform, as drafted by the Platform Committee chaired by Judge William Jessup of Pennsylvania, was received with stormy applause and an immediate move followed to adopt the document unanimously and without amendments.[2] An effort followed to amend the platform after adoption with insertion of famous language from the Declaration of Independence that \"All men are created equal; and they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights...\"[2] This Amendment was initially rejected by the convention, prompting a walkout by its proposer, long time Ohio Congressman Joshua Reed Giddings.[2] The matter was hastily reconsidered by the Convention, and with the addition of the amendment the disgruntled Mr. Giddings returned to his seat, crisis resolved.[2]\n\nThe 1860 Republican platform consisted of 17 declarations of principle, of which 10 dealt directly with the issues of free soil principles, slavery, the Fugitive Slave Act, and the preservation of the Union, while the remaining 7 dealing with other issues.\n\nClauses 12 through 16 of the platform called for a protective tariff, enactment of the Homestead Act, freedom of immigration into the United States and full rights to all immigrant citizens, internal improvements, and the construction of a Pacific railroad.[7]\n\nIn addition to the preservation of the Union, all five of these additional promises were enacted by the Thirty-seventh Congress and implemented by Abraham Lincoln or the presidents who immediately succeeded him.\n\nBallot counts\n\nFile:Sauganash4b.jpg Drawing of the Wigwam interior during the 1860 nominating convention. Note the second story gallery and curved ceiling structure to allow for better acoustics.\n\nThe convention met in mid-May, after the Democrats had been forced to adjourn the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina without a nominee and had not yet re-convened in Baltimore, Maryland. With the Democrats in disarray and with a sweep of the Northern states possible, the Republicans were confident of victory. Senator William H. Seward of New York was generally expected to get the nomination.\n\nOther candidates seeking the nomination at the convention included Lincoln, Governor of Ohio Salmon P. Chase, former U.S. Representative Edward Bates of Missouri, and U.S. Senator Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania.\n\nAs the convention developed, however, it was revealed that Seward, Chase, and Bates had each alienated factions of the Republican Party. Delegates were concerned that Seward was too closely identified with the radical wing of the party, and his moves toward the center had alienated the radicals. Chase, a former Democrat, was opposed by many of the former Whigs who had become Republicans, was thought to be too radical on slavery, had opposed tariffs wanted by Pennsylvania manufacturing interests, and critically, had opposition in his own delegation from Ohio. Bates outlined his positions on extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens, positions that alienated his supporters in the border states and southern conservatives. German-Americans in the party opposed Bates because of his past association with the Know-Nothings.\n\nIt was essential to carry the West (what would today be considered the Middle West), and Lincoln was a prominent Westerner. He had a national reputation from his debates and speeches, in which he eloquently opposed slavery while avoiding any of the radical positions that could alienate moderate voters. He had the support of the Illinois and Indiana delegations before the convention, and was the strongest candidate other than Seward.\n\nNonetheless, Seward's prestige appeared likely to carry him to the nomination.\n\nLincoln was represented at the convention by his friends Leonard Swett, Ward Hill Lamon, and David Davis. During the night of May 17\u201318, they worked frantically to win anti-Seward delegates for Lincoln. They showed that Lincoln already had the most support after Seward, which persuaded some. They also made a deal with Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, who recognized that he had no chance of winning the nomination himself. Cameron controlled the Pennsylvania delegation, and he offered to trade his support for the promise of a cabinet position for himself and control of Federal patronage in Pennsylvania. Lincoln did not want to make any such deal; from Springfield, he telegraphed to Davis \"I AUTHORIZE NO BARGAINS AND WILL BE BOUND BY NONE\".[8] Despite this restriction, Davis reached an understanding with Cameron, which eventually led to Cameron's appointment as Secretary of War.\n\nThe next day (May 18), when voting for the nomination began, Seward led on the first ballot with Lincoln a distant second. But on the second ballot, the Pennsylvania delegation switched to Lincoln, putting him in a near-tie with Seward. On the third ballot many additional delegates switched to Lincoln, and he won the party's nomination.[9]\n\nPresident\n\nAmong other accounts, an article, entitled \"The Four Votes\", published in the May 19, 1860 edition of the Chicago Press and Tribune attests that after seeing how close Lincoln was to the 233 votes needed, Robert K. Enos, a member of the Ohio delegation, was responsible for getting three fellow Ohio delegates to shift their four votes to Lincoln. This triggered an avalanche towards Lincoln with a final count of 364 votes out of 466 cast.[10]\n\n1860RepublicanPresidentialNomination1stBallot.svg 1st Presidential Ballot\n\n1860RepublicanPresidentialNomination2ndBallot.svg 2nd Presidential Ballot\n\n1860RepublicanPresidentialNomination3rdBallot.svg 3rd Presidential Ballot Before Shifts\n\n1860RepublicanPresidentialNomination3rdBallotAfterShifts.svg 3rd Presidential Ballot After Shifts\n\n1860RepublicanVicePresidentialNomination1stBallot.svg 1st Vice-Presidential Ballot\n\n1860RepublicanVicePresidentialNomination2ndBallot.svg 2nd Vice-Presidential Ballot\n\nVice President\n\nSenator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was nominated for vice president, defeating Cassius M.

The party had previously been known as \u201cRepublican Delegates from the Several States.\u201d The convention nominated President Andrew Jackson for a second term and nominated Martin Van Buren of New York for vice president.\n\n\n\nDelegates to the 1832 Democratic convention refused to renominate John C. Calhoun as vice president. Many Democrats opposed Calhoun because of his tariff policy and his defense of the doctrine of nullification, which claimed that a state had a right to nullify federal laws within its own borders. South Carolina, with Calhoun\u2019s backing, supported the nullification doctrine. The nullification debate foreshadowed the slavery controversy that would become the most divisive national political issue in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nThe 1832 conventions played a crucial role in making organized parties a fixture of the U.S. political system. The Democratic convention adopted rules that succeeding conventions retained well into the 20th century. One rule based each state\u2019s convention vote on its electoral vote, an apportionment method that remained unchanged until 1940. The 1832 convention also adopted the procedure of having one person from each delegation announce the vote of his state. Top of Page Home\n\n1835 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\n\n\nThe second Democratic National Convention was held in Baltimore on May 20 - 23. It was held a year and a half before the election in order to prevent the emergence of opposition to President Andrew Jackson\u2019s hand-picked successor, Vice President Martin Van Buren. There were 265 delegates from twenty-two states and two territories. Alabama, Illinois, and South Carolina were unrepresented at the convention. The nomination of Van Buren was unanimous on the first ballot. However, Jackson\u2019s favorite for Vice President, Richard M. Johnson, barely reached the necessary two-thirds majority on the first ballot, receiving 178 votes, just one over the required minimum.\n\n\n\nNo platform was passed at the convention. The convention debated the issues that were most pressing in 1835; slavery and states rights were major ones. There was a consensus for a moderate position on slavery. In order to maintain the support of southern states, a majority of the delegates felt that the decision to keep or abolish slavery should be made by the states and not the federal government. In a letter accepting the nomination Van Buren wrote that he would generally continue the political policies of the Jackson administration. Top of Page\n\nHome\n\n1840 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was held in Baltimore on May 5 - 6. President Martin Van Buren was renominated by acclamation. However, the convention refused to nominate a vice president in response to controversy regarding Vice President Richard M. Johnson. He had been a weak candidate in the general election of 1836 which had led to his distinction as the only vice president elected by the U. S. Senate under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment. A large contingent of delegates was opposed to renominating him because of growing dissatisfaction regarding his personal life. Johnson had lived for many years with Julia Chinn (deceased in 1833), a slave he inherited from his father. They had lived together with their two daughters whom Johnson educated. This relationship was unacceptable to southern Democrats; at the same time, Johnson continued to own slaves which led to a loss of support for Johnson in the North. The convention decision was to allow state Democratic leaders to select the vice-presidential candidates for their states.\n\n\n\nThe 1840 convention is notable for being the first in which a party platform was adopted. The delegates clearly stated their belief that the Constitution represented the primary guide for political affairs in all of the states. Where the Constitution did not define a role for the federal government, the delegates determined that states should take the lead. For example, the platform stated that the federal government should not become involved in subsidizing the building of roads and canals. The delegates adopted a moderate stand on slavery. Once again slavery was said to be an issue which should be decided by the states. Regarding taxes the platform stated that no more should be raised than was necessary to defray the necessary expenses of the government. Once again the Democrats opposed the establishment of a national bank. The platform said that such an institution would concentrate monetary power in Washington in such a way that would be harmful to the best interests of the people. Top of Page Home\n\n1844 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nDelegates from every state except South Carolina assembled in Baltimore on May 27 - 29 for the Democratic convention. The frontrunner for the presidential nomination was former president Martin Van Buren, whose status was threatened on the eve of the convention by his statement against the annexation of Texas. Van Buren\u2019s position jeopardized his support in the South, and with a two-thirds majority apparently necessary, diminished his chances of obtaining the presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nVan Buren led the early presidential balloting, but on succeeding roll calls, his principal opponent, Lewis Cass of Michigan, gained strength and took the lead. Neither candidate, however, approached the 178 votes needed for the nomination. With a deadlock developing, delegates began to look for a compromise candidate. James K. Polk, former speaker of the Tennessee House and former governor of Tennessee, emerged as an acceptable choice and won the nomination on the ninth ballot. This marked the first time in U.S. history that a dark-horse candidate had won a presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nSen. Silas Wright of New York, a friend of Martin Van Buren, was the nearly unanimous nominee of the convention for vice president. But Wright refused the nomination, quickly notifying the delegates by way of Samuel Morse\u2019s new invention, the telegraph. George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania was then chosen as Polk\u2019s running mate. The 1844 Democratic convention was the first to be reported by telegraph. Top of Page Home\n\n1848 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s fifth national convention welcomed all 30 states of the union to Baltimore, Maryland on May 22 - 25, 1848. The front runner for the nomination was Lewis Cass, a former Michigan senator, with a respected career in the military, cabinet and international diplomacy. A full field of contenders arose after Polk declined to run for a second term, but the numbers thinned by early 1848. Running against Cass were Secretary of State, James Buchanan of Pennsylvania and U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire. Cass won the nomination on the fourth ballot. Two ballots assured William O. Butler of Kentucky of the vice-presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nThe most contentious issue of the 1848 convention and campaign was slavery. A Democrat had introduced the controversial Wilmot Proviso into Congress, which, if passed, would have prevented the introduction of slavery into the western territories acquired from Mexico. Cass had favored the Wilmot Proviso, but later realized its divisiveness for the northern and southern states. His nomination may, in part, have been due to his choice to support the ambiguous position of Congressional and government nonintervention or \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d - leaving the choice for or against slavery to the territories themselves.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform set limits on federal power over commerce, internal improvements, and slavery, noting that \u201cStates are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs.\u201d The platform decried the concept of a national bank and applauded the Mexican war as \u201cjust and necessary.\u201d The 1848 convention is noteworthy for the formation of a national committee which would attend to party business between conventions. Top of Page Home\n\n1852 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nBenjamin F. Hallett of Massachusetts, the first national chairman, called the Democratic Party to order on June 1 - 5, 1852, again in Baltimore, Maryland. Procedural matters, including the retention of the two-thirds rule, were quickly handled. The balloting for the nomination, however, took two long days and 49 ballots. The major contenders were Lewis Cass of Michigan who had won the 1848 nomination along with James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, William L. Marcy of New York and the much younger Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. Each candidate represented the views of a section of the fractionalized democratic party and traded front-runner status as the balloting continued, none gaining enough votes to meet the two thirds needed to win the nomination.\n\n\n\nIn pre-conference discussions New England Democrats had persuaded dark-horse candidate Franklin Pierce to consider running for the nomination. Pierce, an affable, undistinguished party follower with two terms in the House and one in the Senate, agreed - against his wife\u2019s wishes to run for the nomination if a stalemate occurred. His name was entered on the thirty-fifth ballot as a compromise choice. He gained support in subsequent ballots and won on the forty-ninth vote. Senator William R. King from Alabama was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform reiterated many of the party\u2019s resolutions from the previous convention, including limits to the power of the federal government, the right of states to manage their own affairs and opposition to a national bank. Exhausted by years of wrangling over the economic, political and emotional issues of slavery, they resolved \u201cThat the democratic party will resist all attempts at renewing, in congress or out of it, the agitation of the slavery question, under whatever shape or color the attempt may be made.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1856 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nOn June 2 - 6, the delegates to the 1856 Democratic convention gathered in Cincinnati, Ohio. This was the first Democratic convention to be held outside of Baltimore. Three men were in contention for the party\u2019s presidential nomination: President Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, James Buchanan of Pennsylvania and Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. The Democratic Party platform consisted of two segments, with the domestic and foreign policy sections debated separately. Dominating the domestic section was the Democrats\u2019 concept of a limited federal government and the slavery question. The foreign policy section expressed a nationalistic and expansionist spirit that was absent from previous Democratic platforms.\n\n\n\nAfter 15 ballots, none of the three candidates had received the number of votes necessary to win the nomination. On the 16th ballot, Stephen Douglas withdrew, and on the 17th roll call, James Buchanan received all 296 votes, securing the nomination. Buchanan was popularly known as \u201cOld Buck.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the first ballot for the vice presidency, 11 individuals received votes. Representative John A. Quitman, Mississippi, led with 59 votes, followed by Representative John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, with 50. Early in the second ballot, the New England delegations voted overwhelmingly for Breckinridge, resulting in his nomination for the vice presidency. Breckinridge was in the convention hall and announced his acceptance of the nomination. His presence for both of these events was unusual during the early conventions. Top of Page Home\n\n1860 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nRarely in U.S. history has a convention been as tumultuous as the Democratic Party convention of 1860. It was clear that the explosive question of slavery would be the dominant issue. Delegates to the national Democratic convention met in Charleston, South Carolina on April 23 May 3. A bitter dispute between Northern and Southern delegates over the wording of the platform\u2019s slavery plank resulted in a walkout by several dozen Southern delegates. The remaining delegates, led by Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, supported the Supreme Court decision in the 1857 Dred Scott case, which nullified the Missouri Compromise\u2019s provisions giving Congress the authority to prohibit slavery in the territories. The convention adjourned on May 3 without making any nominations.\n\n\n\nOn June 18 - 23, the Democratic convention reconvened in Baltimore with less than two-thirds of the delegates to the original convention present. The delegates nominated Senator Douglas for president and Herschel V. Johnson, the former governor of Georgia, for vice president. The platform adopted acknowledged the difference of opinion on slavery among delegates to the Democratic Party and underscored that the party would abide by the decision of the Supreme Court regarding the question of congressional authority over the issue of slavery within the territories.\n\n\n\nThe Southern Democrats who had walked out of the convention in Charleston met later that June in Richmond, Virginia. Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky won the presidential nomination, and Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon was chosen as his running mate. Their platform supported slavery in the territories. The failure to reach agreement on the slavery question was the most disruptive sectional split in the history of U.S. political parties. Top of Page Home\n\n1864 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1864 Democratic national convention was held in the Amphitheatre, Chicago, Illinois on August 29 - 31. George B. McClellan and George H. Pendleton were nominated as the presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party was splintered by opposing views of the ongoing Civil War. There had been no clear leader of the party since Stephen A. Douglas had died in 1861. Those party members wishing to see the Union preserved, even at the expense of war, allied themselves with the Republicans as War Democrats or Unionists. Other Democrats (anti-war, often called Copperheads) were willing to allow Southern independence including a return to antebellum conditions. The lack of success in local elections by the anti-war Democrats weakened their standing and the more moderate Democrats had a greater voice at the 1864 convention. These moderates were willing to allow Southern independence but realized this was an unpopular idea among the public and instead tried to play upon Northern discomfort with wartime restrictions and changes. They appealed to Northern white social and economic fears regarding emancipated African Americans.\n\n\n\nEven with the party being divided, Democrats attending the 1864 convention had high hopes of winning the upcoming election. The Republican Party was badly fractured along ideological lines as well and faced a restless northern populace and an increasingly unpopular war.\n\n\n\nGeorge B. McClellan, former commander of Union armies, was nominated on the first ballot. McClellan had not thought the war unwinnable, but believed Republican interference had cost the North victory in the field. Democrats could now offer McClellan as a patriot who had tried to win the war but now would end it by any means, even if it meant allowing the South its independence. George H. Pendleton, an anti-war Democrat, was chosen as McClellan\u2019s running mate.\n\n\n\nThe party platform focused on the failure of the war, Republican excesses in the curtailing of individual and state\u2019s rights, and called for an immediate armistice with the South. The platform decried the altering of pre-war racial balances through emancipation of slaves. McClellan would later disavow the peace before reunion platform plank, and instead called for reunion to be a condition of peace, in hopes of appealing to public sentiment. Top of Page Home\n\n1868 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1868 Democratic national convention was held in Tammany Hall, New York, NY on July 4-9, 1868. Horatio Seymour and Francis P. Blair, Jr. were nominated as the presidential and voice presidential candidates.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party suffered from remaining internal fractures that did not split the party but caused party disharmony. The party\u2019s depiction as the party of wartime disloyalty was an image rightly or wrongly reinforced by the fact it was more popular and stronger in the South. President Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat and Abraham Lincoln\u2019s successor, sought to unify with other Democrats and was at odds with Republicans, who eventually impeached him. Reconstruction of the South and African American civil rights were important issues in 1868.\n\n\n\nAt the convention, Democrats emphasized their party\u2019s stand for constitutional conservatism and advocacy of limited government. A petition presented by the Women\u2019s Suffrage Association asking for the party\u2019s support in gaining women the right to vote was not seriously considered. Economic issues in the 1868 platform such as lower taxes, a low tariff, and a plan to pay off the public debt were considered more important by the party. Slavery and secession were considered closed matters. Immediate restoration of Southern states to the Union, amnesty for political offenses, state regulation of suffrage, a reduction in the size of the military, and equal protections for native and foreign-born U.S. citizens were other platform planks. Convention attendees included William M. \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed, Clement L. Vallandigham, and former general Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\n\nEight nominees were considered for the presidential slot, including Horatio Seymour, Andrew Johnson, General Winfield Scott Hancock and Supreme Court Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase.\n\n\n\nAfter twenty-three ballots a reluctant Seymour won the nomination. Seymour was seen as an acceptable alternative for each faction rather than having to acquiesce to another\u2019s candidate. Francis P. Blair, Jr., a close associate of President Johnson was quickly chosen as Seymour\u2019s running mate. Top of Page Home\n\n1872 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nDemocrats convened on July 9 - 10 in Baltimore, Maryland, for one of the strangest political conventions in history. In truth, the Democrats did not offer a candidate as the party was in deep disarray. Instead, the Democrats endorsed the presidential and vice presidential candidates representing the Liberal Republican Party, demonstrating their belief that this was the only way to defeat a second presidential term for Ulysses S. Grant. The Liberal Republican Party, which was short-lived, was created by members of the Republican Party who were disgusted with the corruption and policies of the Grant administration. In particular, the Liberal Republican Party objected to the \u201ccarpetbag\u201d governments established in the South following the Civil War, advocating the restoration of home rule in the southern states.\n\n\n\nThe presidential candidate selected by the Liberal Republican Party and endorsed by the Democratic Party was Horace Greeley, who founded the New Yorker in 1834, and in 1841, the New York Tribune, which became one of the most influential dailies of the nineteenth century. Through editorials in his publications, Greeley advocated the rights of workingmen, promoted a protective tariff, encouraged development of the frontier, and opposed slavery. At the Democratic convention nominating speeches were forbidden and Greeley won on the first ballot with 686 votes of the allotted 732. Governor B. Gratz Brown of Missouri, again the Liberal Republican nominee for vice president, was the unanimous choice of the Democrats with 713 votes.\n\n\n\nDebate on the Democratic platform was limited to one hour, and once again the delegates endorsed the same platform approved by the Liberal Republic Party. Key elements of the platform included a call for the end of reconstruction and complete amnesty for citizens of the South, a limit on the powers of the federal government, civil service reform, adoption of a hard-money policy, and bringing to an end the policy of giving grants of public land to railroads and corporations. The platform was adopted by a vote of 671 to 62. In all, the delegates to the 1872 Democratic convention met, voted, and completed their work in a total of six hours. Top of Page Home\n\n1876 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1876 Democratic Convention was held on June 27 - 29 in St. Louis, Missouri. This marked the first time that a national convention was held west of the Mississippi River. Reconstruction, the corruption of the Grant administration and the lingering sectional animosity between the North and the South following the Civil War were dominant themes at the convention.\n\n\n\nTwo governors, Samuel J. Tilden of New York and Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana, were the principal contenders for the presidential nomination. Tilden, a proven reformer and enemy of corruption, was elected on the second ballot. Hendricks, the runner-up, was the nearly unanimous choice of the delegates for the vice presidency.\n\n\n\nDemocratic platform issues included a call for the repeal of the Resumption Act of 1875, a hard-money measure that called for the payment of Civil War bonds in coin rather than paper money, and extensive civil service reform. In addition, the platform called for restrictions on Chinese immigration and a new policy on the distribution of public land that would benefit homesteaders and not the railroads. Top of Page Home\n\n1880 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nCincinnati, Ohio was the setting for the 1880 Democratic convention, which was held June 22 June 24 in the modernized Gothic Music Hall. As delegates walked into the hall\u2019s auditorium, they were greeted with a gigantic blue and white streamer which read \u201cOHIO GREETS THE NATION.\u201d No one candidate stood out to the generally apathetic delegates. The decision of Samuel J. Tilden, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1876, not to seek renomination allowed new prospective candidates to emerge.\n\n\n\nOn the first ballot, General Winfield Scott Hancock, from Pennsylvania, took the lead in delegate votes. General Hancock had earned his reputation during the Civil War, earning the nickname \u201cSuperb\u201d Hancock for his valiant stands in battle. Other nominees were Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, and former Representative Henry G. Payne of Ohio. General Hancock won on the second ballot, when the Wisconsin delegation spearheaded a series of vote switches that provided him with the votes needed for the nomination. The vice-presidential nomination had only one candidate, former Representative William H. English of Indiana, who was elected by acclamation.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform was approved without debate or opposition. It called for decentralization of the federal government with increased local government, currency based on hard money, a revenue only tariff, civil service reform, and an end to Chinese immigration.\n\n\n\nThe most severe language in the platform concerned the presidential election of 1876, which the Democrats had labeled \u201cthe great fraud.\u201d In that election, the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden had beaten Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes in the popular vote. Republican leaders challenged the vote results from Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina on the grounds that African-Americans had been intimidated from going to the polls. Southern Republican election officials from the three states disqualified votes from Democratic precincts, thus providing a victory for Hayes. The turmoil and accusations of fraud resulting from the Hayes victory ultimately forced the Congress to determine the election outcome. A deal was made whereby Democratic Members of Congress agreed to the formation of an election commission that favored the Republicans in return for private assurances that federal troops would be withdrawn from the South. Hayes was officially declared president by the election commission on March 4, 1877. Top of Page Home\n\n1884 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nChicago, Illinois, was the setting for the 1884 Democratic convention, which was held on July 8 11. A highlight of this convention was the extension of delegate voting rights to the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories. On the first day of the gathering, delegates from Tammany Hall, the New York political machine, attempted to break the unit rule which bound all delegates to their state convention and mandated that they vote as a unit. The Tammany Hall delegates were in the minority in the New York delegation. Their attempt to break the unit rule was defeated by the convention as a whole, thus limiting their powers and assuring the nomination of the Governor of New York, Grover Cleveland, a Tammany Hall enemy.\n\n\n\nGovernor Cleveland was the front runner for the presidential nomination after the first ballot. His opposition consisted of Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware and former Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio. On the second ballot, a shift by the North Carolina delegation to Cleveland gave him the two-thirds majority needed to secure the nomination. Senator Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was nominated for the vice presidential half of the ticket, winning by an almost unanimous vote.\n\n\n\nThe platform produced by the Democrats in 1884 was one of the longest adopted by the Party during the nineteenth century, with a substantial portion containing a list of alleged Republican failures and misdeeds. The main issue in the Democratic platform concerned tariff revisions that would provide revenue for the federal government, but also protect and promote domestic industries. One of the tariff revisions called for taxes \u201cbearing heaviest on articles of luxury, and bearing lightest on articles of necessity.\u201d Other issues addressed in the platform expressed support for the rights of organized labor, and the continuation of restrictions on Chinese immigration into the United States. Top of Page Home\n\n1888 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic convention assembled in St. Louis on June 5 - 7. The Democratic Party, in control of the White House for the first time since the beginning of the Civil War, renominated by acclamation the incumbent President Grover Cleveland. The country had been without a vice president since the death of Thomas A. Hendricks in 1885. Former senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio was the favorite for the vice presidential nomination and won easily on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nTariff reduction was the predominant issue on the Democratic platform, along with tax reform. Growing divisions between conservative and populist wings of the Democratic Party threatened party unity. The conservative wing sought to place states rights at the top of the agenda, while the populist wing proclaimed that the free coinage of silver was the main issue.\n\n\n\nWhile president, Cleveland had also angered many Democratic partisans who believed that he had not made full use of his patronage powers to reward his Democratic supporters. Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party political machine that greatly controlled New York City politics, was a bitter foe of the reform-minded Cleveland. Its influence undermined his campaign in his home state of New York, denying him the state\u2019s 36 electoral votes that would have assured his reelection. Top of Page Home\n\n1892 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1892 Democratic convention met in Chicago, Illinois on June 21 - June 23 with frequent interruptions from storms and a leaky roof. Delegates all received special invitations to visit the Jackson Park fairgrounds of the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, the Chicago World\u2019s Fair, to be dedicated in October of that same year.\n\n\n\nGrover Cleveland, having served as the 22nd President of the United States from 1885 to 1889, won a narrow first ballot victory over Governor David B. Hill of New York and Governor Horace Boies of Iowa, a former Republican and populist. Cleveland was vehemently opposed by his own New York delegation which was packed with Tammany Hall men, the New York political machine, supporting Governor Hill. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a former representative and assistant postmaster general, was the convention favorite for vice president, winning over Isaac P. Gray of Indiana who was favored by the Cleveland supporters.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform of 1892 called for the construction of a Central American canal through Nicaragua; opposed sumptuary laws (prohibition) as interference with individuals\u2019 rights; supported antitrust laws, federal aid to education, improvement of the Mississippi River, and statehood for New Mexico and Arizona; demanded the rigid enforcement of the laws against Chinese immigration while denouncing attempts to restrict the immigration of the \u201cindustrious and worthy of foreign lands;\u201d and straddled the currency debate with a policy favoring stable money and the coinage of both gold and silver equally. The sharpest platform debate focused on the tariff plank, ultimately calling for a tariff for revenue only and \u201cdenouncing Republican protection as a fraud, a robbery of the great majority of the American people for the benefit of the few. ... a fundamental principle of the Democratic party that the Federal Government has no constitutional power to impose and collect tariff duties, except for the purpose of revenue only, and we demand that the collection of such taxes shall be limited to the necessities of the Government when honestly and economically administered.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1896 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nChicago was the setting for the July 7 - 11,1896 Democratic convention. The issue of currency dominated the proceedings. The party was split along regional lines, with Eastern delegations favoring a hard-money policy with maintenance of the gold standard and most Southern and Western delegations supporting a soft-money policy with the unlimited coinage of silver. As a delegate to the convention, 36-year-old William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska was determined to write a free-silver plank into the party platform.\n\n\n\nIn perhaps the most memorable address ever delivered before a political convention, Bryan captivated the delegates with a blistering attack on the gold standard, stating, \u201cYou shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\u201d Bryan\u2019s speech moved him into the front ranks of candidates for the nomination. The other leading contender was Rep. Richard \u201cSilver Dick\u201d Bland of Missouri. William Jennings Bryan received enough votes to secure the nomination on the fifth ballot. With Bryan declining to indicate a preference for vice president, 16 candidates received votes for the office on the first ballot. On the fifth ballot, Arthur Sewell of Maine prevailed. Top of Page Home\n\n1900 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic Convention of 1900 was held in Kansas City, Missouri. Although the meeting hall was destroyed by a fire on April 4, 1900, it was rebuilt in 90 days time to house the convention delegates and candidates on July 4 - 6. King David Kawananakoa, heir to the throne in Hawaii, was the first member of royalty to attend a political convention as a delegate at this event.\n\n\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan received the presidential nomination unopposed, and allowed the delegates at the convention to choose his running mate. Seven names for vice-president were placed in nomination and two candidates withdrew prior to the balloting. Adlai E. Stevenson, who had served as Vice President under Grover Cleveland, led on the first roll-call vote and was selected as the vice-presidential nominee after a series of vote switches.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party platform of 1900 named anti-imperialism as the most important issue. The platform also denounced colonial policies enacted by the current Republican administration after the Spanish-American War and condemned post-war expansionism. During the 1896 campaign silver coinage and adoption of the gold standard were divisive issues. By 1900 discovery of additional gold deposits and an increase in currency diminished the silver issue. Although there was some controversy about the mention of silver coinage, Bryan threatened to withdraw his candidacy unless a silver plank was included in the platform. The silver plank was accepted without protest by the delegates. Top of Page Home\n\n1904 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic convention convened in St. Louis on July 6 - 9, with the currency question still a major issue. Eight candidates were nominated for president. Alton B. Parker, chief justice of the New York Court of Appeals, was the conservative front-runner but was not supported by the still-influential William Jennings Bryan. Parker, who had not actively worked for the nomination, was supported by conservatives and the top officials of Tammany Hall. He was elected on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nFormer senator Henry G. Davis of West Virginia was nominated for vice president. At 81 years of age, he was the oldest major party candidate ever nominated for national office. Davis was a man of great wealth, and the Democrats hoped that he would give freely to their campaign.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform deliberately omitted reference to the currency issue; however, to make his position clear, Alton Parker, after his nomination, informed the convention by letter that he supported the gold standard. Additionally, the platform called for a reduction in government expenditures, a congressional investigation of corruption in the executive departments, construction of a Panama Canal, statehood for the Western territories and the direct election of senators. The convention ended July 9. Top of Page Home\n\n1908 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic convention of 1908 was held July 7 - 10 in Denver. This was the first convention held by a major party in a Western state and the first national political convention to accredit women, with five women credentialed as delegates or alternate delegates. For a third time, the Democrats turned to William Jennings Bryan as their nominee. He was easily elected on the first ballot.\n\n\n\nBryan had learned a lesson from his stubborn silver fixation and advocacy against the gold standard during the campaign of 1900. He now advocated a more balanced and varied set of reforms reflecting the prevailing progressive mood. Bryan focused on his dedication to a social agenda, which insisted that material prosperity should be pursued and gained but accompanied by charitable programs for the poor. He insisted on only \u201cnecessary\u201d taxation, advocated nationalization of the railroads and denounced U.S. imperialism by calling for independence for the Philippines.\n\n\n\nJohn W. Kern, a former gubernatorial candidate from Indiana, was chosen by acclamation to be Bryan\u2019s running mate. The New York Times sarcastically described the compatibility of the Democratic ticket as follows: \u201cFor a man twice defeated for the presidency was at the head of it, and a man twice defeated for governor of his state was at the tail of it.\u201d Top of Page Home\n\n1912 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1912 Democratic Convention was held on June 25 - July 2 in Baltimore, returning to that city for the first time since 1872. There were a number of presidential candidates, including House Speaker Champ Clark of Missouri, Rep. Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama, Gov. Judson Harmon of Ohio and Gov. Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey. William Jennings Bryan was not a candidate himself, but as the titular head of the Democratic Party he was the key to the\n\nnomination. Six names were placed in nomination for the presidency. After 10 ballots, Champ Clark had the most votes, but when Bryan learned of Clark\u2019s collaboration with the New York political machine Tammany Hall and Wall Street forces, he addressed the convention announcing that he was switching his support to Woodrow Wilson. On the 46th ballot, Wilson finally received enough votes to secure the nomination. The 46 roll call votes represented the highest number of presidential ballots taken at any convention, Republican or Democratic, since 1860.\n\n\n\nWilson preferred Oscar Underwood for vice president; however, the Alabama congressman was not interested in second place on the ticket. Wilson then agreed to accept the convention favorite, Gov. Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform called for a lower, revenue-only tariff, as Democrats felt that the high cost of living was a result of the existing protective tariff. Passage of stronger antitrust legislation, regulation of the railroads, a constitutional amendment providing for a federal income tax, a workmen\u2019s compensation law, stricter pure food and public health laws, extension of the presidential primary system, and a call for a single presidential term were all issues included in the 1912 platform. Top of Page Home\n\n1916 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\n\n\nSt. Louis was the setting for the 1916 Democratic convention, held June 14 - 16. Support for the renomination of President Woodrow Wilson was nearly unanimous. Wilson won on the first ballot with a vote of 1,092 ayes to 1 nay \u2013 the lone dissenting vote coming from an Illinois delegate who disapproved of a motion to nominate Wilson by acclamation. With Wilson\u2019s approval, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall was renominated by acclamation.\n\n\n\nWilson had planned to showcase the theme of Americanism and national unity at the convention. Americanism was Wilson\u2019s approach to the future role of the United States as a key world power. However, it was pacifism and Wilson\u2019s commitment to keeping the United States out of the raging conflict in Europe that dominated the convention. By the second day, Wilson\u2019s determined neutrality regarding the war became the theme of the convention, and the slogan \u201cHe kept us out of the war\u201d became the battle cry of the delegates.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform included a call for military preparedness and the progressive reforms made by the Wilson administration, particularly with respect to tariffs, banking, labor and agriculture. The only section of the platform brought to a floor vote was the plank on women\u2019s suffrage. The majority plank favored extending the vote to women, while a minority plank advocated leaving the matter to the individual states. The minority plank was defeated by a vote of 888 \u00bd to 181 \u00bd. The Democratic position on women\u2019s suffrage contrasted with that of the Republicans, who proposed leaving the matter up to the individual states. Top of Page\n\nHome\n\n1920 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nSan Francisco hosted the 1920 convention on June 28 - July 6, the first time a convention of one of the major parties was held west of the Rockies. The November 1920 election would also be notable as the first election allowing women to vote for president. For the first time in a generation the party had no recognized leader such as Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan or Woodrow Wilson. Retiring President Wilson\u2019s refusal to endorse a candidate prevented the emergence of any one candidate as the front-runner.\n\n\n\nTwenty-four candidates received votes on the first presidential roll call, with no candidate reaching the 729 votes needed for the nomination. After several ballots, four candidates emerged as the leaders: William Gibbs McAdoo, Wilson\u2019s son-in-law and former treasury secretary; Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer; Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York; and Gov. James M. Cox of Ohio. On the 44th ballot Governor Cox received 699 \u00bd votes, and with victory assured a motion was adopted to declare the Ohio governor the unanimous nominee. Cox\u2019s choice for the vice presidential nomination, Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York, the 38-year old assistant secretary of the Navy, was nominated by acclamation.\n\n\n\nThe 1920 Democratic platform\u2019s major plank expressed the party\u2019s endorsement of the League of Nations as the \u201csurest, if not the only, practicable means of maintaining the permanent peace of the world.\u201d Additionally, the plank called for supporting President Wilson\u2019s call for U.S. membership in the League. Enforcement of prohibition under the Volstead Act, the continuation of progressive reforms on labor, government regulation of industry and transportation, conservation and reclamation of natural resources and immigration were issues also included in the platform; however, praise of Wilson\u2019s leadership and legislative accomplishments was the central theme. Top of Page Home\n\n1924 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nNew York City\u2019s old Madison Square Garden was the site of the 1924 Democratic convention. The convention convened on June 24th and adjourned on July 9th, a total of sixteen days making it the longest in American history. The prolonged brawl for the presidential nomination was the result of the conflict between the Party\u2019s rural and urban factions. Candidate Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York represented the urban faction of the Democratic Party, which opposed Prohibition and the Klu Klux Klan. Former Treasury secretary William Gibbs McAdoo of California was the candidate of the rural faction, which supported Prohibition and tolerated the Klu Klux Klan. Fourteen other candidates were also nominated.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, June 30th, balloting for the presidential nominee began. After 69 ballots, William Gibbs McAdoo had the most votes, but not enough to secure the nomination. Negotiation began on compromise proposals to break the deadlock, but continuous balloting still could not produce a winner. Finally, after nine days and 103 ballots, a winner emerged, John W. Davis of West Virginia, a former Member of Congress and U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. Davis\u2019s core support came from rural delegates, but it was the votes of urban delegates that provided his margin of victory.\n\n\n\nThe vice presidential nomination was won by Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska, the younger brother of William Jennings Bryan. One of the vice presidential nominees was Mrs. Lena Springs, a South Carolina delegate-at-large and chairman of the credentials committee, who would be the first woman to be proposed for vice-president of the United States. Mrs. Springs\u2019 name was placed on the ballot by her fellow South Carolina delegates as a way to pay tribute to her service to the state of South Carolina as well as to the national Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nThe battle for the 1924 Democratic platform was almost as intense as the presidential nomination marathon conflict. The first subject of debate focused on American entry into the League of Nations, with the majority report favoring that entry be determined by a national referendum, and the minority report supporting American entry without reservation into the League of Nations and the World Court. After vigorous debate, the minority report was defeated by a vote of 742 \u00bd to 353 \u00bd. The second contentious issue was the controversial religious liberties plank. Debate focused on the Klu Klux Klan, not mentioned in the majority report, but opposed by name in the minority report. Voting on this plank produced one of the closest votes in convention history, with the rural delegates supporting the majority report (thus supporting the Klu Klux Klan) and urban delegates supporting the minority plank. The minority report was defeated literally by a fraction of a vote, 543 7/20 to 543 3/20. Top of Page Home\n\n1928 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nHouston, Texas was the site for the June 26 - 29, 1928 Democratic national convention marking the first time since 1860 the party met in a southern city. Four term Governor of New York, Alfred E. Smith, was the frontrunner for the presidential nomination. William Gibbs McAdoo, Smith\u2019s main competitor, dropped out of the race in the interest of promoting party unity. On the first ballot Governor Smith came within ten votes of the required two thirds needed to win the nomination. Ohio then switched its forty-four votes to Smith making him the nominee and the first Roman Catholic nominated for President. Senate Minority Leader Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas was nominated on the first ballot for vice president.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform focused on agriculture more than any other issue. Agriculture was the most depressed part of the economy in 1928. The Democrats called for the establishment of a Federal Farm Board to oversee loans to farmers. On foreign policy the platform favored keeping the United States out of entangling political alliances, including the League of Nations, and mentioned specifically Latin America. The Republicans were criticized for their ineffective sponsoring of weak disarmament agreements. The Democrats proposed the establishment of major public works programs to help resolve the unemployment problem. Flood control projects were specifically mentioned as being a priority in a Democratic administration. Top of Page\n\nHome\n\n1932 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democrats came to the 1932 convention in Chicago hopeful that their presidential candidate would have a very good chance of unseating President Herbert Hoover. The convention, held June 27 - July 2 began with Franklin D. Roosevelt controlling a majority of the delegates. The Roosevelt forces argued for abandonment of the rule that required two-thirds of the delegates to vote for a candidate in order for him to become the nominee. However, Roosevelt dropped this demand when it became clear that he risked losing the support of Southern states. The first ballot, held in the early morning of July 1, showed Roosevelt ahead of Alfred E. Smith and John Nance Garner with 666 delegate votes; 777 votes were needed for nomination. On the evening of July 1, during the fourth ballot, Garner released his delegates and quickly there was a movement to make Roosevelt the nominee. He won on that ballot with 945 votes. Garner was the unanimous choice for vice president.\n\n\n\nRoosevelt broke a tradition by coming to Chicago to appear before the convention and accept the nomination. His speech promised Americans a \u201cNew Deal\u201d that would change political institutions in Washington forever to better serve the people. The platform included proposals for federal unemployment relief for the needy and new public works projects to provide jobs. There was also a plank calling for the repeal of Prohibition. Top of Page Home\n\n1936 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1936 Democratic convention was held in Philadelphia June 23 - 27. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner were renominated by acclamation. The major issue at the convention, initiated by President Roosevelt, was the elimination of the rule requiring a candidate for President to receive votes from two-thirds of the delegates. Starting in 1936 a nominee only needed the support of a majority of the delegates. President Roosevelt appeared in person to accept the party\u2019s nomination. In his acceptance speech Roosevelt declared that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform in 1936 emphasized the success of expanded federal public works programs to help resolve unemployment. It stated that the federal government should continue to stimulate private industry, resolve labor disputes, and oppose monopolies through the vigorous enforcement of anti-trust laws. The agricultural policies of the Roosevelt administration were credited with doubling the net income of farmers. It vowed that programs to reduce the indebtedness of farmers would be maintained. National defense was not specifically mentioned in the platform. The foreign policy of the United States was based on neutrality in foreign disputes and the continued expansion of foreign trade. Top of Page Home\n\n1940 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nWhen the delegates to the Democratic Convention of 1940 met in Chicago on July 15 -18, the prospect of U.S. involvement in the conflict in Europe was the major influence upon presidential politics. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had already served two terms as president and had indicated ambivalence about seeking a third term. As the threat to U.S. security increased and the party appeared to be unable to find an adequate New Deal proponent as a successor to Roosevelt, the president began to indicate that he would accept the nomination for a third term in office. This would break the precedent set by the first president, George Washington, to serve only two terms.\n\n\n\nOn the third day of the convention, Roosevelt won easily on the first ballot. Although the delegates, who included seven African-Americans, were pleased to have President Roosevelt at the top of the ticket, they did not want his choice for vice president, Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace of Iowa. A former Republican and a leading liberal, Wallace was unacceptable to conservative Democrats. Delegates felt that the vice presidential nomination should be decided by the convention. A personal appearance at the convention by the first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and a threat by the president that he would not accept the nomination for president, persuaded delegates to vote for Henry Wallace. With so many of the delegates unhappy with the vice presidential nominee, Wallace was asked not to address the convention.\n\n\n\nThe party platform, adopted without a roll call vote, was divided into three sections. The first addressed U.S. military preparedness and foreign policy; the second outlined the benefits of the New Deal for the agricultural, labor and business segments of the economy; and the third enumerated New Deal welfare measures. The convention closed with the delegates listening to a radio address by Roosevelt, who stated that he had not wanted the nomination but accepted it because the existing world crisis called for personal sacrifice. Top of Page Home\n\n1944 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic convention was held in Chicago July 19 - 21 and renominated President Roosevelt for an unprecedented fourth term. However, Vice President Henry A. Wallace was not renominated for his office. Acknowledging there was dissent in the party concerning Wallace, Roosevelt refused to publicly support anyone. Wallace received the most votes on the first ballot, but Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman was a strong second. On the second ballot Truman passed Wallace, but he did not receive a majority. However, Alabama shifted its votes to Truman and this started a bandwagon of support for his candidacy. Roosevelt stated that he was happy to have Truman as his running mate.\n\n\n\nThe platform of the Democratic Party pledged the successful completion of the great crusade to end tyranny in the world and proposed the establishment of a United Nations organization to provide a forum for the peaceful resolution of conflicts between nations in the future. It acknowledged that the United States had built the best trained and equipped army in the world, the most powerful navy in the world, and the greatest air force in the world. It called for legislation to assist the transition of ex-servicemen and women to civilian life with special consideration for the disabled. It favored unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment there of a free and democratic Jewish state. It called for maximum self government in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and for the extension of the right of suffrage to the people of the District of Columbia. Top of Page Home\n\n1948 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nDelegates attending the 1948 Democratic convention, which met July 12 - 14 in Philadelphia, were in a somber mood. Franklin D. Roosevelt had died in office in 1945; the Republicans had regained control of Congress in 1947; and Harry S. Truman, who succeeded to the presidency after less than two months as vice president, had not been able to stop the loss of massive numbers of liberals and Southern conservatives from the New Deal coalition. The displeasure of Southern delegates with the national policies of the Democratic Party intensified at the convention, with the civil rights issue becoming the source of heated debate among the delegates.\n\n\n\nWhen the presidential balloting began, 13 members of the Alabama delegation and the entire Mississippi delegation withdrew from the convention in opposition to the party\u2019s stand on civil rights. This did not prevent President Truman from winning a clear majority on the first ballot, defeating Georgia Senator Richard B. Russell, who received the votes of more than 90 percent of the remaining Southern delegates. Kentucky Senator Alben W. Barkley, the keynote speaker at the convention, was nominated for vice president by acclamation.\n\n\n\nThe fight over the civil rights issue in the Democratic Party platform brought national attention to the young mayor of Minneapolis, Hubert Humphrey. He led the successful fight for a civil rights plank, which asserted that \u201cracial and religious minorities must have the right to live, the right to work, the right to vote, the full and equal protection of the laws on a basis of equality with all citizens as guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d The Southern delegates who had walked out of the convention met three days later in Birmingham, Alabama, along with other invited Southern Democrats. They formed the States\u2019 Rights Party, known as the Dixiecrats, and elected Gov. J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina as their candidate for president. Top of Page Home\n\n1952 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1952 Democratic convention in Chicago on July 21 - 26 was marked by a sitting president who, constitutionally, could have run for reelection but instead chose retirement. A fractious floor fight over both the seating of alternative delegations and a requirement that all delegations take an oath of allegiance to the party and its platform were highlights of the convention. There was much behind-the-scenes maneuvering of party leaders to select a candidate who would be acceptable to both the Northern liberal and Southern conservative factions, thereby avoiding a schism similar to 1948, when a splinter group of Democrats nominated Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to run as the States\u2019 Rights (Dixiecrat) Party\u2019s nominee.\n\n\n\nPresident Truman declined to make an early endorsement, and 11 candidates were nominated, including Governor Adlai Stevenson, who was drafted as the compromise candidate. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, who had great success in the primaries but was running without party support, and Senator Richard Russell of Georgia were also on the ballot. After placing second to Kefauver on the first two ballots, Stevenson was nominated on the third. He chose Senator John Sparkman of Alabama as his vice presidential running-mate, who was nominated by acclamation.\n\n\n\nThe platform included planks on continuing agricultural price supports, repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, which greatly restricted labor union activities, and the eradication of discrimination -- basically, a continuation of the programs of Roosevelt and Truman. There were also speeches vigorously defending the Korean War. Top of Page Home\n\n1956 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago on August 13 - 17, 1956. Adlai E. Stevenson, the unsuccessful 1952 Democratic candidate, easily won nomination on the first ballot. In an unusual move, Stevenson decided not to choose a running mate, but to leave the selection to the convention. The major candidates for Vice President on the first ballot were Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, Tennessee Senator Albert A. Gore, New York City Mayor John F. Wagner, and Minnesota Senator Hubert H. Humphrey. Kefauver won the first ballot but fell short of the 687 votes needed to nominate. Kennedy won the second ballot with 618 votes. Following the second ballot Gore withdrew and gave his support to Kefauver. This started a bandwagon movement for Kefauver that led to his winning the nomination.\n\nThe Democratic platform in 1956 criticized the Republicans for destabilizing world peace by reducing the strength of U.S. armed forces. It stated that the survival of democracy worldwide required stronger leadership by the United States and better coordination in defense relationships with U.S. allies. The problems mentioned included aggressive actions by the Soviet Union, the tragedy of Cyprus, French forces in North Africa, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and the growth of anti-Americanism in Asia. Although the United States was the most prosperous nation in the world, the Democrats argued that the economic growth rate was less under the Republicans than under the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. Top of Page Home\n\n1960 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1960 Democratic convention met on July 11 - 15 in Los Angeles -- the first time that a national political convention was held there. The front-runner for the presidential nomination was Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, having won each of the seven primaries he entered and whose support from Democratic Party urban leaders was strong. Kennedy\u2019s principal rival was Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, but also in the running was Adlai E. Stevenson, the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956. Kennedy won on the first ballot. This was the first time since 1920 that a senator had been nominated for the presidency by either the Democrats or the Republicans and the first time since 1928 that a Roman Catholic was chosen to lead a national ticket for one of the two major parties.\n\n\n\nSenator Kennedy\u2019s choice for a running mate was Lyndon Johnson, whose nomination was approved by acclamation. This choice was a surprise to many liberals, but Kennedy chose Johnson to improve his prospects in the South, particularly in Texas, which would be a key state in the election. It was also said that Kennedy wanted to get Johnson out of the Senate so that he would be unable to hinder or undermine Kennedy\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\n\n\nIssues on the Democratic platform included national defense, disarmament, civil rights, immigration, foreign aid, the economy, labor and tax reform. It was the longest platform yet written by the party. The greatest controversy was caused by the civil rights plank. Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North Carolina introduced motions to delete several portions including ones to set 1963 as the deadline for the initiation of school desegregation plans, to make the Civil Rights Commission a permanent agency, and to grant the attorney general the power to file civil injunction suits to prevent discrimination. Speaking in favor of the civil rights plank was delegate and future member of Congress Patsy Mink of Hawaii, who gave an impassioned speech before 10,000 delegates and a national television audience. Senator Ervin\u2019s motions were defeated by voice vote and the entire plank was approved by a vote of 66-to-24. Top of Page Home\n\n1964 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1964 Democratic National Convention met in Atlantic City, New Jersey on August 24 - 27. In attendance were 5,260 delegates and alternates. The nomination of the incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson, who had assumed the presidency after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous year, was not in question. Johnson and his vice-presidential choice, Minnesota senator Hubert H. Humphrey, were nominated by acclamation, without roll call votes (previously only the 1936 Democratic convention had used this approach). The lengthy platform document was designed for broad appeal and was moderate in tone, condemning extremism of both right and left and praising the accomplishments of the Kennedy-Johnson administrations. A convention highlight was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s speech introducing a documentary film about his late brother\u2019s achievements as president.\n\n\n\nA contentious issue at the convention was the seating of the delegation from Mississippi. The recently formed Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent a racially integrated delegation to the convention, contesting the legitimacy of Mississippi\u2019s all-white delegates chosen in the regular Democratic primary since African Americans had been prevented from registering to vote. The credentials committee of the convention listened to eloquent testimony (notably from civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer) concerning racial discrimination in the electoral process and stipulated that future conventions would not accept delegates chosen through discriminatory procedures. As a compromise, the credentials committee offered two at-large seats to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation. Top of Page Home\n\n1968 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1968 Democratic convention met on August 26 - 29 in Chicago, with protestors and police clashing in the streets over the Johnson administration\u2019s policies concerning the Vietnam War and unprecedented security precautions instituted at the International Amphitheater. The 1968 assassinations of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the race riots in more than 100 hundred cities following the King assassination all combined with the protest over the Vietnam War to make this the most divisive and contentious Democratic convention since the Civil War.\n\n\n\nWith the decision by President Lyndon B. Johnson not to seek reelection, the three major candidates were Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Sens. Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota and George McGovern of South Dakota. Humphrey won on the first ballot by winning the votes of party moderates, Northern big-city political organizations and Southern conservatives. Also receiving votes on the first ballot was the Rev. Channing E. Phillips of the District of Columbia, who became the first African-American ever nominated for the top of the ticket at a national convention.\n\n\n\nHumphrey chose Maine Sen. Edmund S. Muskie as his running mate, whose nomination was approved by acclamation before the balloting was complete. A film tribute to Robert Kennedy was shown to the delegates prior to the vice presidential nomination, sparking a prolonged standing ovation and the singing of \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrior to the heated debate over the platform and the nomination process, the convention committee had fought over what was known as the \u201cunit rule.\u201d This rule allowed some states to instruct that the entire vote of their delegation be cast as determined by the majority of the delegates. For more than a century this rule had been enforced at national Democratic conventions, but the supporters of McCarthy attacked the rule as a device for denying representation of minority viewpoints. Humphrey had indicated his support for reform of this rule, and ultimately the convention approved a motion to abolish it at the 1968 convention, and forbidding its use in future years. The defeat of the rule allowed the seating of a number of disputed Southern delegations that had faced credentials challenges, in particular a new Mississippi Democratic loyalist group, whose membership included the American voting rights activist and civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer.\n\n\n\nThe 1968 Democratic platform, which contained planks on many issues, including crime, gun control, housing, welfare reform and foreign policy, was not contested by the delegates on any issue except the U.S. policy in Vietnam. The administration plank did not support a halt to the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam or a withdrawal of U.S. troops before the end of the war. A minority plank, drafted by McCarthy and McGovern, called for an immediate halt to the bombing and a negotiated troop withdrawal. The bitter debate on these two proposals raged over two days, with the final roll call vote defeating the minority plank by a vote of 1, 567 \u00be to 1,041 \u00bc. Top of Page Home\n\n1972 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe Democratic national convention was held in Miami Beach, Florida on July 10 - 13, 1972, with 3,203 delegates attending. Rules changes dramatically increased the participation of women, youth, and blacks. In the primaries the major candidates were South Dakota Senator George McGovern, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. On the first day of the convention challenges to the seating of McGovern delegates won in the primary were settled in favor of McGovern. The next day Humphrey and Muskie withdrew from the race which assured McGovern the nomination. McGovern won the nomination on the first ballot with the support of 1,865 delegates. McGovern chose Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton as his running mate. Eagleton won the nomination for Vice President with 1,742 votes on the first ballot. Ten days after the convention Eagleton disclosed that he voluntarily had hospitalized himself three times between 1960 and 1966 for nervous exhaustion and fatigue. The controversy caused by this disclosure led to Eagleton\u2019s withdrawal from the ticket. McGovern then chose R. Sargent Shriver to be his Vice Presidential running mate.\n\n\n\nThe 1972 platform of the Democratic Party called for the unconditional withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Vietnam. It stated that the war had cost the lives of 50,000 soldiers, drained more than $150 billion in resources, and inflicted untold damage to the national will. It called for the overhaul of the current welfare system to guarantee each family receiving federal support had an income substantially above the poverty level. The platform called for handgun legislation to include a ban on Saturday night specials; favored the passing of an Equal Rights Amendment, and called for the elimination of the electoral college in order to give every voter a direct and equal voice in Presidential elections. Top of Page Home\n\n1976 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nOn July 12 - 15 the Democratic convention met in New York City with delegates showing a unity that had not been present during the turbulent and conflict-ridden conventions of 1968 and 1972. Former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter, a dark-horse candidate who had surprised everyone by winning the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, came to the convention with more than the 1,054 delegates needed to win the presidential nomination. Carter, a moderate, pledged to restore honesty and integrity in government. This appealed to the delegates in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, which had resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Carter won on the first ballot with 2,238\u00bd votes. His closest rivals were Representative Morris Udall of Arizona and Governor Jerry Brown of California. Carter\u2019s perception as a unity candidate was cemented with the image, broadcast on national television, of Carter, George Wallace, Coretta Scott King and other prominent African-Americans joining him on the victory platform.\n\n\n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s choice for a running mate was Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, who had impressed Carter with his experience and political philosophy. Mondale won overwhelmingly on the first ballot, but two other individuals received votes: House Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma and Representative Barbara C. Jordan of Texas, an African-American who had given a memorable keynote speech.\n\n\n\nThe platform was designed to be noncontroversial and consisted of wide-raging Democratic goals, as opposed to specific legislative initiatives and hard-line stands on issues. Democrats were determined to avoid the platform fights on divisive issues that had crippled the party in the two previous elections. Specific goals in the platform called for a comprehensive national health insurance system with universal and mandatory coverage, welfare reform, a commitment to the environment, energy conservation, the exploration and development of new energy sources and support for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Top of Page Home\n\n1980 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1980 Democratic Convention met in New York City on August 11 - 14, with President Jimmy Carter facing a strong challenge from Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts for the presidential nomination. Runaway inflation, high interest rates and slow economic growth, coupled with the continuing Iranian hostage crisis and the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan, were issues and events that had dominated Carter\u2019s presidency. Carter\u2019s preoccupation with both foreign and domestic crises had resulted in his presidential campaign being conducted from the White House instead of on the road. Although Kennedy had not won the required number of delegates in the primaries and caucuses, he attempted to take the nomination from Carter by working to defeat a rule adopted by the Democratic National Committee in 1978 and on the agenda for adoption at the 1980 convention.\n\n\n\nThe proposed rule bound delegates to vote on the first ballot for the candidates to whom they were pledged during the primaries and caucuses. After much debate and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, the rule finally came to a vote. The attempt to overturn the proposed rule was defeated, resulting in Kennedy\u2019s announcement that his name would not be placed in nomination. President Carter won renomination on August 13, with Senator Kennedy making an awkward and brief appearance on the platform with Carter to give the appearance of party unity. Walter Mondale was renominated for vice president with no opposition.\n\n\n\nConflict between the Carter and Kennedy camps over the 1980 Democratic platform was as intense as the struggle for the presidential nomination. The battle over the platform was one of the longest in convention history, filling 17 hours of debate and roll call votes that stretched over two days. Senator Kennedy succeeded in crafting the party platform to reflect his liberal ideology in the platform planks, particularly with respect to economic policy. Kennedy\u2019s rousing speech to the delegates on behalf of his economic minority plank provided the most exciting moments of the convention, prompting a 40-minute emotional demonstration on the convention floor. Top of Page Home\n\n1984 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1984 Democratic convention met in San Francisco on July 16 - 19 with 3,933 delegates in attendance. A difficult and contentious primary season had ended only on June 5, when a final round of primaries gave the victory to Walter Mondale, Jimmy Carter\u2019s former vice president. Among the strong competitors had been Gary Hart, former Colorado senator, and Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader from Chicago who hoped to build a \u201crainbow coalition\u201d of diverse supporters.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, as a result of reforms completed in 1982 by the Hunt Commission, the Democrats admitted to the 1984 convention a new group of \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d Democratic Party leaders and elected officials who attended the convention as uncommitted delegates and controlled about 14 percent of the ballots. The Hunt Commission was named for its chairman, Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina. The commission was formed to address the bitter fight over the nomination in 1980, when Sen. Edward Kennedy challenged President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\n\nMondale selected as his vice president New York Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman to run on the presidential ticket of a major party. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo delivered the keynote address. The lengthy platform document pledged to reduce the budget deficit, particularly that portion resulting from increased military spending sponsored by incumbent President Ronald Reagan, to make the tax system fairer to disadvantaged and middle-class socioeconomic groups and to control health care costs. The platform opposed passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and supported the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights for women. Top of Page Home\n\n1988 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nIn 1988 the Democratic National Convention was held in Atlanta, Georgia on July 18 -21. Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis had won enough delegates in the primaries to guarantee his nomination for President. The only controversy at the convention concerned Jesse Jackson\u2019s bid for the Vice Presidential nomination. Dukakis had chosen Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen for a running mate. Jackson, however, had won the second largest number of delegates in the primaries. In a meeting with Dukakis and Bentsen on July 18, Jackson agreed to support the ticket in the interest of party unity. It was also agreed that Jackson\u2019s name would be placed in nomination. The vote on the first ballot was 2,876 for Dukakis and 1,219 for Jackson.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform emphasized the need for a national health care program which would provide federal coordination to restrain rising health care costs while insuring quality care for all Americans. It pledged to better balance national priorities to increase federal funding for education. It called for the establishment of a national office to coordinate federal, state, and local efforts to control illegal drugs. It criticized the Republicans for wasting money on unnecessary weapons and advocated investing more money in training the armed forces for various types of conflicts. It called for a stronger national policy to promote peace in the Middle East. Top of Page Home\n\n1992 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nDemocrats meeting in New York City on July 13 - 16 sought to nominate a candidate who would reverse their presidential fortunes after 12 years of Republican control of the White House. Delegates felt that the way to win the presidency was to nominate a party moderate and adopt a platform largely influenced by the centrist ideas of the Democratic Leadership Council. The DLC had been established almost a decade earlier in an effort to move the party from the left to a more centrist viewpoint. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, who had taken a leading role in building the DLC and used it to become a key player in the party, came to the convention as the leading candidate for the nomination. Other candidates on the ballot were former California Governor Edmund G. \u201cJerry\u201d Brown Jr. and former Massachusetts Senator Paul E. Tsongas.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton was formally nominated by New York Governor Mario M. Cuomo, who saluted him as the \u201ccomeback kid,\u201d a reference to his comeback after the loss of the New Hampshire primary and media attention on allegations of infidelity and his lack of service in the Vietnam War. Clinton won by a vote of 3,372 votes, and subsequently the nomination was approved by acclamation. He surprised the delegates by selecting as his running mate another Southerner, Tennessee Senator Albert Gore Jr. The Clinton-Gore ticket was the youngest in the 20th century, with Clinton, age 45, and Gore, age 44.\n\n\n\nDemocratic women played a major role at the convention, with the opening program highlighting leading female Senate candidates and the discussion of issues of concern to women from the podium. In a change from the usual single keynote speaker, the delegates heard three keynote addresses: Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Governor Zell Miller of Georgia and former Texas representative Barbara Jordan. The Democratic platform reflected the new centrist philosophy emphasizing the need for economic growth, use of military force overseas when necessary, a cutoff of welfare benefits after two years and support for the right of states to enact death penalty statutes. Top of Page Home\n\n1996 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 1996 Democratic national convention was held in Chicago on August 26 - 29. The highlight of the convention was the renomination of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.\n\n\n\nFormer Reagan press secretary James Brady and actor Christopher Reeve appeared on the first night of the convention. Brady, paralyzed by a bullet in a 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan, praised Clinton\u2019s gun control legislation and called for increased action to reduce gun violence. Reeve, paralyzed by a horse riding accident in 1995, spoke for expanded research into diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, spinal cord injuries, and AIDS. The second night of the convention featured an emphasis on families. It ended with a speech by First Lady Hillary Clinton on family values. On the third night Vice President Al Gore spoke about the Democratic Party leading the nation into the 21st Century. The voting for President that night resulted in Clinton receiving the unanimous support of the convention\u2019s delegates. On the fourth night President Clinton addressed the convention and highlighted his first administration\u2019s achievements.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic platform in 1996 proposed ending deficit spending by the U.S. government and balancing the federal budget. This proposal was accompanied by a pledge to maintain Social Security and Medicare at the levels needed by the public. In education, the federal government should promote national standards for primary and secondary schools to guarantee students have learned the skills required to advance to the next grade. In welfare, attempts should be made to get people into respectable jobs and reduce the number in need of public funds. Environmental protection was also advocated, especially protection of the National Parks and opposition to new offshore drilling in environmentally critical areas. Top of Page Home\n\n2000 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 2000 Democratic convention convened in Los Angeles, California, August 14 - 17, to nominate Vice President Albert \"Al\" Gore, Jr., as the Democratic presidential candidate. Gore had served two terms with President Bill Clinton as his vice president (1993-2000), and had represented the state of Tennessee as both a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate from 1976 through 1992. During the presidential campaign of 2000, Gore had secured the presidential nomination by defeating former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries. Gore's name was the only one placed in nomination and on the ballot at the convention, and he won by a total of 4,339 votes. Gore's name was placed in nomination by his friend, Harvard roommate and Hollywood actor Tommy Lee Jones, and Gore was introduced by his wife, Tipper, before making his acceptance speech.\n\n\n\nGore had chosen Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman was the first Jewish American to run on a major party's national ticket. Serving in the Senate since 1988, Lieberman had earned a reputation as a centrist who worked well with both Democratic and Republican members of Congress. Senator Lieberman was unanimously approved by the convention delegates by voice vote.\n\n\n\nThe 2000 Democratic platform included planks on fiscal discipline, education, health care, campaign finance reform, support for a woman's right to choose, protecting and strengthening Medicare, fighting crime, transforming the military, and valuing families. No floor fights occurred over any of the platform planks; however, outside the convention hall protestors demonstrated, sometimes violently, during all four days of the convention. Protest groups included pro-life supporters, homeless activists, anti-globalization protestors, and anarchists. Top of Page Home\n\n2004 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nThe 2004 Democratic national convention was held at the Fleet Center in Boston, Massachusetts, July 26 - 29, amid concerns about terrorism, protests, and impossibly snarled traffic, the latter due to the closure of major traffic arteries near the convention center. Enhanced security and a designated area for protesters, at some distance from the convention proceedings and surrounded by a fence topped with razor wire, added to the controversy.\n\n\n\nThe opening address was delivered by former President Bill Clinton and the keynote address by Barack Obama, at the time a candidate for the United States Senate in Illinois. Other notable speakers included former President Jimmy Carter, Senator Hilary Clinton of New York, former Vice President and 2000 Democratic nominee Al Gore, Reverend Al Sharpton, and retired General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The speeches addressed the foremost topics of terrorism and the war in Iraq, health care, taxes, and economic revival. Perhaps the most poignant speech was given by Ron Reagan, son of former President Ronald Reagan who had died a month earlier of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Reagan urged the delegates to support increased funding for stem cell research.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic nominee for President was Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who had fought an uphill battle to win the Party\u2019s nomination against a large field of candidates. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina was Kerry\u2019s choice for the vice presidential half of the ticket. Major planks in the Democratic Party platform (which was accepted unanimously) included energy independence, environmental protection, strengthening the military, and homeland security. Top of Page Home\n\n2008 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\n\nDenver, Colorado, was the site of the 2008 Democratic Convention, held on August 25-28. The last time that Denver had hosted a national political convention was in 1908, when the Democratic Party nominated William Jennings Bryan as their candidate for president. The 2008 Democratic Convention was historic for two reasons \u2013 Senator Barak Obama of Illinois, an African-American, won the nomination for president, and New York Senator Hillary Clinton\u2019s name was placed in nomination in recognition of her momentous achievement in winning 1,896 delegate votes and over 18,000,000 popular votes in the state presidential primaries and caucuses. Senator Obama had secured the nomination prior to the convention by winning 2,201 of the 2,118 delegate votes needed to win. During the roll call of the states on Wednesday, August 27th, Senator Clinton stood among the New York State delegation on the convention floor and asked that the convention suspend the rules and nominate Senator Obama by acclamation.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama selected Senator Joseph \u201cJoe\u201d Biden from Delaware as his vice presidential running mate. Senator Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and is a past chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Initially a candidate for president in the 2008 campaign, Biden ended his run for the presidency in January of 2008. Senator Biden\u2019s nomination for vice president was also approved by acclamation by the convention delegates.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the 2008 Democratic Convention included speeches by former President Bill Clinton, Senator Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama, wife of Senator Barak Obama. The most poignant moment of the convention occurred when Massachusetts Senator Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy made an appearance and gave a short speech before the delegates. Senator Kennedy, who was undergoing treatment for a malignant brain tumor, paraphrased both his brother\u2019s 1961 inaugural address and his own 1980 convention speech, with the statement:\n\n\n\nThis November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans, so with Barack Obama and for you and me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on.\n\n\n\nIssues in the Democratic platform for 2008 included the redeployment of American troops serving in Iraq, support for a woman\u2019s right to choose, a promise of \u201ctough and practical\u201d immigration reform, affordable access to health care, and the development of alternative energy technologies. Planks also called for the United States to assume a leadership role in the fight against global warming, amending NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) to reflect concerns about labor and the environment, and a call for more service through an expansion of the AmeriCorps and Peace Corps programs.\n\nTop of Page Home"}]}
