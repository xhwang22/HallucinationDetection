Hatfield is a former war correspondent who rose to prominence for his solid reputation and commentary. However, he has recently been smeared by a radical leftist media group and he loses his job. He\u2019s now working as a freelance news producer in San Francisco and goes on a ride-along with the SFPD bomb squad. A routine carjacking turns into something much more and several pounds of military-grade explosives are found. The FBI wants him to stay out of it, but Hatfield won\u2019t be stopped so easily and begins an investigation into something that may be bigger than 9/11.\n\nThe second book in the series is called A Time for War. This book sees a series of seemingly unrelated events \u2013 a helicopter filled with Navy Seals crashing, a FBI car is mysteriously rendered immobile, a Chinese agent is found floating in the bay of San Francisco \u2013 that only Jack Hatfield sees as the conspiracy that it is.

He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine.

Instead, what he delivers is a manifesto accusing the Obama administration of fomenting just such a war\u2014a war only far-right ideologues like himself can prevent.\n\nNone of this is really a surprise given Savage\u2019s long history of incendiary right-wing extremism and hateful rhetoric. In recent months, though, Savage has been ratcheting up attacks to extraordinary levels, claiming that President Obama is trying to wipe out Americans by allowing migrant children to bring disease and culture across the border; that he is trying to bring an Ebola epidemic to the United States; and that soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder\u2014who he called \u201ca bunch of losers\u201d\u2014are weaklings symptomatic of the forces he believes are destroying the country. He also wants the new Republican Congress to promptly arrest the president.\n\nTrue to form, Stop the Coming Civil War is replete with the usual right-wing attacks on Obama, who he claims is \u201ca metrosexual\u201dintent on destroying the nation and placing it under a dictatorship. True patriots, he claims, will rise up to resist this.\n\nIndeed, the book is an endless parade of classic far-right conspiracy theories and vicious, factually groundless fear mongering. From the idea that \u201ccultural Marxism\u201dis a force hellbent on ruining the world, to attacks on Obama as a \u201csocialist\u201dpresident, Savage covers the gamut of far-right conspiracy theories in fine fashion.Perhaps most notable among Savage\u2019s claims is that the Obama administration is preparing to wage a \u201cwar on white people\u201dthat will give the government a pretext for imposing a dictatorship with global players, including the Roman Catholic Church and Pope Francis.\n\nIn the opening chapter, Savage intones:\n\nRight now the nation is a tinderbox that can easily go up in flames, because we\u2019re increasingly under the thumb of an administration that is destroying our two-hundred-year-old tradition of defending our borders, language, and culture and replacing it with a culture of statelessness and corruption.\n\nSavage writes that \u201cwe\u2019re living in a nation more divided than any since Lincoln\u2019s presidency, and we\u2019ve entered a time and place that may be as dangerous as it was during the Lincoln years. I worry, though, that as happened in Lincoln\u2019s time, we\u2019re moving not toward expanded freedom but toward civil war.\u201d\n\nKeeping true to that antigovernment line of logic, Savage claims the administration wants to spark such a civil war in order for \u201cthis crony government to consolidate the power it has already granted itself through the broad use of executive orders, the power granted to Cabinet secretaries and other political appointees, and the unwillingness of our lawmakers to step in and put a halt to this takeover.\u201d\n\nWith our nation divided, the government could marshal all of those on its side\u2014the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), street gangs, the National Guard, a military now purged of patriotic generals and without a command structure loyal to the Constitution--against those who would stand up to the oppression.\n\nWhile promoting the book, Savage has been more explicit about just who the government will be waging this civil war against: white Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to understand this. This entire federal government is geared up to fight a war against white people,\u201d Savage told his listeners recently. He also warned them that the administration is \u201cplanning to mow down all you white crackers.\u201d\n\nAlong with his fellow conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones, Savage believes that the global economy is on the verge of a massive collapse that will bring about social chaos and violence, leaving ordinary people with no choice but to submit to a globalist \u201cNew World Order\u201d government.\n\n\u201cThe United States,\u201d Savage writes, \u201cmay well be in the midst of a military, economic, and cultural collapse that is turning us into a country in danger of catastrophic failure and leading to the nightmarish scenario of a civil war.\u201d\n\nSavage claims that the entire Obama presidency is the product of a massive conspiracy: \u201cThe financial crash of 2008 was engineered by an elite group of financial professionals in order to help ensure the election of Barack Obama and guarantee the continued complicity of the U.S. government and its cadre of economic advisors,\u201d he writes.\n\nSavage contends that the nefarious driver behind this \u201ctakeover\u201d is \u201ccultural Marxism,\u201d a concept that has enjoyed favor on the extremist right for over a decade as an umbrella for conspiracist beliefs that liberals intend to destroy America from within. Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian terrorist who slaughtered 77 people during a 2011 rampage, devoted much of his manifesto explaining his actions to his obsession with \u201ccultural Marxism.\u201d Savage, unsurprisingly, claimed that Breivik\u2019s rampage actually was the result of a left-wing conspiracy.\n\nBut unlike many of his fellow civil war enthusiasts on the right, Savage only hints at offering any kind of armed resistance to the Obama administration. At one point he says: \u201cWe need a national group of Green Mountain Boys,\u201dreferring to a \u201cmilitia group headed by Ethan Allen\u201d he describes.\n\nMostly, he enthusiastically foments the idea of a modern civil war by claiming that it is liberals and the left who are attempting to force such a conflict on Americans:\n\nThe Savage Truth of the matter is that our government is preparing for nothing less than the next civil war. It\u2019s marshaling forces to be used against the American people, but the very divisions that the government is creating are causing many Americans to think about what we must do to resist this government takeover.\n\nThere is no small irony in this, given that up to this point, Americans have been hearing in from a variety of conservative and far-right ideologues that a civil war is needed from the right in order to resist the democratically elected Obama administration and its policies.\n\nIndeed, far-right hero Cliven Bundy\u2014the Nevada rancher whose standoff in April with federal agents nearly resulted in a shootout\u2014claimed afterwards to his fellow \u201cPatriots\u201d that the Lord told him that he needed to face down the agents, or the nation would need to \u201cface these arms in a civil war\u201dwith the federal government. A speaker at Bundy\u2019s ranch, militia figure Mike Vanderboegh, ranted that \u201cwe are still staring a civil war in its bloody face.\u201d\n\nLike his fellow right-wing extremists, Savage makes clear in his book that he too is an enthusiast about the idea of a civil war as a form of political resistance to a democratically elected president. His book\u2019s half-clever conceit\u2014that it\u2019s about heading off a civil war, so that Savage can\u2019t be accused of fomenting civil unrest\u2014rests entirely on the risible contention that Obama administration policy is intended to inflame tensions and drive angry Americans to violence.\n\nThere is a well-known psychological term for this: projection."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Michael_Savage", "page_content": "U.S. radio talk show host and author\n\nFor other people named Michael Savage, see Michael Savage (disambiguation)\n\nMichael Alan Weiner (born March 31, 1942), known by his professional name Michael Savage, is an American right-wing author, political commentator, activist, and former radio host.[1][2] Savage is best known as the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2021, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.[3][4] From October 23, 2012, to January 1, 2021, Michael Savage had been syndicated by Cumulus Media and Westwood One.

Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970, and his mother died in 2003.[9][8]\n\nAfter graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958,[13][14] Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963.[8] After college, Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time, Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD.[10] Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972.[15][16] He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine.[17][18] His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.[19]\n\nShift in political opinions [ edit ]\n\nSavage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s.[20] He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University.[10][21] One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\"[11] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.[10]\n\nAcquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.[20] Schwartz[who?] stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.[20] When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\"[11] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker.[22] He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.[23] Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \"political opposition\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic.[24] In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.[25] In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The university instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the university, contending discrimination for being conservative.[20] Savage later dropped the lawsuit.[26]\n\nRadio [ edit ]\n\nThe rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.[20] On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for liberal Ray Taliaferro's overnight show and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" The show quickly became a local hit.\n\nLater in 1994, KGO parent company Capital Cities/ABC Inc. purchased the station KSFO and changed it to a conservative talk format.[27] On January 2, 1995, the first day of KSFO's new format, Savage debuted as host of afternoon drive time show The Savage Nation.[27][28] By 2000, Savage was the most popular afternoon drive host among all adults in San Francisco Arbitron ratings.[29]\n\nIn 1999, Talk Radio Network began syndicating part of The Savage Nation nationally.[30] Starting September 21, 2000, The Savage Nation became an entirely national show distributed by TRN.[31]\n\nIn mid-2006, Savage had 8\u201310 million listeners per week,[32] which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He has described his show's production as one with a \"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\"[33] Mark de la Vi\u00f1a of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: \"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\"[11]\n\nBy 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.[3][4] Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled \"Party of One\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.[8][34]\n\nOn September 10, 2009, KNEW (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI (640 kHz)\u2014Los Angeles.[35] John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an email that the station was headed \"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\"[36] According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.[37]\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \"rattle\" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010.[23] He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \"real writer\" who had understood his subject.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were underway.[38] Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.[39] By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners.[40] On September 26, 2013, Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.[41]\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.[42]\n\nIn January 2019, Savage in collaboration with Westwood One introduced a podcast format with a mixture of live-broadcast and studio material.[43]\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Savage celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the radio show.[44]\n\nOn January 1, 2021, The Savage Nation was discontinued by Cumulus Media and Westwood One.\n\nTV [ edit ]\n\nSavage had a brief political talk show on MSNBC beginning March 8, 2003, and ending July 7, 2003. Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do the one-hour show despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees. Sorenson called Savage \"brash, passionate and smart,\" and promised that he would provide \"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\"[45] After four months, Savage was fired from the show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, caused controversy in the gay community.\n\nSavage is a regular guest on Newsmax television with appearances on \"Stinchfield\" and \"The Count.\"\n\nPodcast [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019 Savage launched a podcast.[46] The Savage Nation Podcast posted episodes on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.[47][48]\n\nPolitical views [ edit ]\n\nMichael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\"[33] In a 2006 interview, Savage cited Barry Goldwater as an influence, saying \u201cI\u2019m a Goldwater conservative\u2026. If [another] Goldwater appeared, I\u2019d work for him, I\u2019d give money to him\"[49]\n\nSavage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture;[17] those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.[50]\n\nWildlife conservation [ edit ]\n\nSavage is a longtime advocate of wildlife conservation, and often points out that \"conservative\" and \"conservation\" have the same root, meaning \"to conserve\". He argues that conservatives should \"own\" environmental protection and conservation of wildlife resources. A December 2017 Huffington Post article quotes Savage regarding President Trump's revoking of an Obama-era trophy hunting ban: \"... long-time animal activist Michael Savage ... implored the president to reconsider:\n\n'Not all Obama legislation was bad,\u201d said Savage. 'Some of it (like this) was grand.' \"\n\nThe article continues ... \"Savage also addressed the (biblical) aspects of killing an elephant, lion or giraffe, animals that we don\u2019t normally hunt.\n\n'Dominion over animals doesn\u2019t mean destroying or terrorizing them,' he said.\"[51]\n\nA March 2018 article at The Hill quotes him at greater length: \"Conservative radio host Michael Savage has also spoken out against the Fish & Wildlife Service proposed policy this week, writing in a blog post Wednesday that he 'felt betrayed' by the administration\u2019s secret decision after having previously spoken in person with Trump on the issue.\n\n'I had spent a dinner talking to the President about environmental issues, and especially this, and this is what happened anyway,' Savage wrote. 'I made it clear that this was a red line that could not be crossed, that now elephants, lions and other big game had a target painted on them. I explained that the root of \u2018conservative\u2019 is the same as \u2018conservation\u2019 and the two do not need to be diametrically opposed. I explained what was meant by dominion, as I carefully spelled out in God Faith and Reason.' 'We hope that the president will step in here and overrule this order,' he added.'[52]\n\nThe private meeting with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago[53] followed a series of pleas on his radio show for Trump to support legislation that protected wildlife.[54] In August 2019, following the Trump administration's reauthorization of the use of cyanide bombs against wild animals,[55] Savage called on the White House and the US Environmental Protection Agency to reverse approval.[56]\n\nImmigration [ edit ]\n\nSavage opposes immigration, citing the black tar heroin epidemic, large percentage of immigrant prisoners, illegal use of public services, and diminishing American nationalism.[57] in a tweet on May 17, 2019, Michael said, \"Read my lips: no new immigrants.\"[17] He frequently warns that migrants carry diseases.[17] On March 28, 2006, following pro-immigration rallies in California, he encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags as an act of American nationalism to protest illegal immigration from Mexico.[58][59]\n\nEuropean Union [ edit ]\n\nSavage describes the European Union as \"Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control.\" He equates Britain's vote to leave the Union with the Second World War, saying it was \"in many ways the Battle of Britain all over again.\" Savage foresees that, after Brexit, the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of \"a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books.\"[60]\n\nIn 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\"[61] In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.[50] Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.[62]\n\nSavage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election.[citation needed] Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.[63]\n\nSavage has disagreed strongly with some of Trump's actions and policies, including the appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor, the bombings of Syria, what Savage describes as a failure to get illegal immigration to the United States under control, and failure to protect endangered and vulnerable wild animals. Nevertheless, he has endorsed Trump for president in the 2020 United States presidential election.[64]\n\nDubai Ports World controversy [ edit ]\n\nIn early 2006, the administration of President George W. Bush approved sale of a port security contract to a company, Dubai Ports World (DP World), headquartered in The United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nMichael Savage was highly influential in the defeat of the deal. On February 13, the first day it was reported in the news, \u201cSavage used his radio show to attack the transfer of American homeland assets to a company owned by an Arab state.\u201d[65] Savage's concerns were based in part on the fact that \u201ctwo of the 9/11 suicide hijackers came from the United Arab Emirates, and much of the funding for the attacks flowed through United Arab Emirates banks.\u201d[66] On his February 17 radio show, Savage interviewed Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a longtime nemesis with whom Savage otherwise agreed on the Dubai ports issue.[67]\n\nThe White House was listening to Savage: \u201cThough the deal had received some newspaper attention before then, Mr. Savage's angry message raised early concerns inside the Bush White House about trouble ahead.\"[65] Savage and other opponents of the deal \u201cgenerated a wave of anger from Americans across the country that left lawmakers in Washington -- by their own admission -- following their constituents much more than leading them.\u201d Lawmakers said the negative response from constituents was overwhelming. Congressional offices on Capitol Hill were deluged by phone calls and emails protesting the deal, and congressmen told of being pulled aside wherever they went in their districts. Rep. Don Manzullo, a Republican from Illinois who is chairman of the House subcommittee on small business, said \"I got stopped all over the place,\" he said. \"People are big-time upset.\"[65]\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Savage subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory,[68] a white nationalist belief, which claims that white people are becoming extinct through forced assimilation or violent genocide. Savage blames Barack Obama[69] and the Democratic Party for promoting the concept within the United States.[70] He has claimed there is a \"cultural genocide being promulgated against Caucasians\".[71]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and positions on vaccines [ edit ]\n\nA January 31, 2020, article in Stat News quoted Savage's call for a stop to flights from China: \u201cQUARANTINE! STOP TRAVELERS FROM CHINA NOW!\"[72] Two months later, an April 16, 2020 New York Times feature article credited Savage for being one of the first in the media, especially the conservative media, to take the COVID-19 epidemic seriously. On his radio show Savage used his credentials\u2014a PhD with training in epidemiology\u2014to speak to his fans on coronavirus research: How the virus is transmitted; which treatments were proving effective; and the difference between morbidity and mortality rates. \"Savage's views were a departure from those of other conservative commentators, who made a concerted effort to deny that they downplayed the epidemic. Savage attacked their credibility and demanded that they be held accountable for misleading millions of Americans.\"[73] As early as February 24, 2020, Savage was saying of Limbaugh and Hannity: \u201cHow can we not let our side be called on the carpet when they lie to the people?\u201d[73] Savage is also sharply critical of the Director of the NIAID, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissing him as \u201ca grandstander\u201d who mishandled the AIDS epidemic by refusing to close down the gay bathhouses. Savage believes that one-size-fits-all lockdowns are a threat to individual liberty, and calls instead for selective quarantine of at-risk populations.[73]\n\nIn a May 4, 2020, article in the Washington Examiner, Savage is quoted as saying he will refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine, saying that it will likely be \"ineffective and dangerous.\"[74] Savage has a history of opposing the flu vaccine, for reasons he outlined in a January 15, 2013, interview. Savage argued that the Centers for Disease Control authorities have to guess what the vaccine should be made of. \u201cSo they choose five strains out of 250-plus strains of Influenza A, and if they don\u2019t choose the right one, you\u2019re going to get sick,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re putting your faith in the CDC\u2019s ability to guess the one that might be a pandemic.\" He said that \"this year\" (2013), the CDC guessed right on two of the strains and wrong on one of them.[75]\n\nIn contrast to his views on the flu vaccine, Savage supports vaccines, such as for polio, that last for many years because they address an infectious agent with a low mutation rate. A 2013 Ethics Alarms article recounts Savage saying that \"...one of his heroes growing up was Jonas Salk, not because he invented the first effective polio vaccine, but because he refused to patent it, and gave it to the world for the benefit of humanity. A bit later, Savage noted that Albert Sabin, Salk\u2019s bitter rival who later invented the oral vaccine, also declined to profit from his invention. Could all this be true, I wondered? If it is true, why did I not know about it? Why doesn\u2019t everybody know about it? It is true. Asked why he didn\u2019t patent his vaccine, Salk famously answered, \u201cCan you patent the sun?\u201d[76][77]\n\nSavage opposes wearing masks to slow the spread of COVID-19 in both indoor and outdoor settings.[citation needed] Recently, he accepted wearing masks in indoor public places.[78]\n\nActivism [ edit ]\n\nLegal defense contributions [ edit ]\n\nSavage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the U.S. Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton.[79] Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center[80] On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.[81] The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nOn November 17, 2016, Savage was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.[82] Savage describes this event as \"The capstone of my career.\"\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Savage was named by President Trump to serve on the Board of Directors of The Presidio Trust, which teams with the National Park Service to manage the Presidio of San Francisco, the former military fort that is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Savage stated that he hopes \"to help save this great legacy while also reminding the public of the military significance of this land.\u201d[83] Once on the board, he regularly protested what he believed to be the museum's overemphasis on the facility's use as a Japanese American internment camp during World War II, an action he insisted was not motivated by racism but military necessity. He also did not get along with other board members, often writing them angry ALL CAPS emails about small things that greatly angered him; in turn, the rest of the board felt he could have lobbied the administration for additional funding far more intensively than he ever did, given his connections.[84] On May 20, 2021, he was ordered to resign from the Board of Directors of The Presidio Trust or he would be fired by the end of the workday. The current website for the Presidio Trust Board of Directors no longer shows him as a board member.\n\nCriticism and controversies [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that \"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\"[85] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation \"is an act, a put-on.\"[49] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[86][87][88]\n\nOn April 17, 2006, Savage said on the topic of Muslims, \"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?\"[89] The remarks made by Savage were seriously criticized worldwide and was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.[90]\n\nIn the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \"aggressive act\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.[91] The assertion prompted criticism.[91]\n\nControversial MSNBC exchange [ edit ]\n\nSavage was hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show which began in March 2003. Controversy arose four months later over remarks made in response to a caller who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage responded by asking if the caller was a \"sodomite\", and when the caller replied that he was, Savage said:\n\n\"Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig. How's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage. You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now, do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another- put another sodomite on ... no more calls? I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.\"[87]\n\nThe interchange created a firestorm of protest including calls for his firing by the LGBT group GLAAD.[87] Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS. Nevertheless, MSNBC fired him within days of the event.[92]\n\nCatholic Church and immigration [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \"pastoral support\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.[93]\n\nC-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award [ edit ]\n\nWhen Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.[94]\n\nDispute with CAIR [ edit ]\n\nIn early November 2007, the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \"need deportation\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \"take your religion and shove it up your behind\" because \"I'm sick of you.\"[95] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.[96]\n\nSavage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.[97] The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate\". CAIR called the suit \"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\".[98] On July 25, 2008, United States district court Judge Susan Illston dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under fair use.[99] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.[100] CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage; Judge Illston denied that request.[101]\n\nAutism [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \"a racket\" designed to get disability payments for \"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\"[102] He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:\n\nNow, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, \"Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot.\"[103]\n\nIn July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.[103][104] WOR issued a statement saying, \"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\"[102] Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising,[105] and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show.[106] Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \"ripped out of context\" by \"far left Stalinists\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.[102] On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, The Home Depot, and DirectBuy, would discontinue their support for Savage's show.[107]\n\nSavage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.[108]\n\nPermanently banned from entering the United Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith of the Labour party that Savage was on a list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\".[109][110][111][112] During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \"lunatic\".[113]\n\nDuring a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\".[114] Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\"[115] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.[114]\n\nOf the banning, the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: \"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\"[116] After Johnson became Prime Minister in 2019, Savage's attorney requested the ban be overturned, however no action has been taken by the Conservative government as of 2020.[117][118] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: \"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\"[119] Sam Leith wrote: \"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\"[90]\n\nVeteran PTSD [ edit ]\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of posttraumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \"weakness\". According to Savage, \"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\"[120]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nWhile in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji.[26] That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.\n\nSavage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter Rebecca Lin Weiner Yops born on March 2, 1967, and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, born on February 15, 1970, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.[121] Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.[10] In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California, after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii.[20] Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills, California, and West Palm Beach, Florida.[20][122][123]\n\nDuring the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Jewish Synagogue Chabad house in Berkeley.[8] In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.[124] In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: \"... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"[125] In his podcast aired 25 November 2020, Savage stated: \"Trust in God. God leads my footsteps. God has determined that I will be on podcast come January. God determines a lot of things in our lives and you have to trust in God and just say its fate at a certain point. Now, I've always believed that we make our own fate. I've not been one of these leaves-in-a-stream type of personalities...\"[126]\n\nIn December 2019, Savage notably suffered a heart attack, but subsequently recovered and returned on air.[127]\n\nSavage has had many pet dogs throughout his life. His beloved toy poodle Teddy died in late 2021.[128]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nIn total, Savage has written 44 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty-four under the pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times Best Sellers and three additional books which made The New York Times Best Seller list.[129][130][131] have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.\n\nHis earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., draw on his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and HIV/AIDS.[132] He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.[132]\n\nHis more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.\n\nIn 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books.[133] In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action \"reverse discrimination\", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.[134]\n\nIn January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book directs attacks at \"liberal media bias\", the \"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\", gay activists, and liberals.\n\nIn January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.[citation needed]\n\nIn April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in caricature as animals in the \"Political Zoo\", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper.\n\nIn October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\"[135]\n\nIn November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on \"My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know\", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \"the Hand of Allah\". The publisher has described the novel by saying, \"will make 9/11 look like child's play\".[136]\n\nIn 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth, in which Savage writes in part, \"We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies.\"[137]\n\nIn 2015, Savage released another a book titled Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture. In it he writes that the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, \"borders, language and culture,\" and describes what he calls the destruction that the Presidency of Barack Obama brought to the country. He offers several solutions to rebuild the nation.[138]\n\nIn 2016, Savage's book Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama. This work was a blueprint for how then candidate Donald Trump could help get the country back on the right track should he win the election.[139]\n\nIn March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller List.[140]\n\nIn November 2017, Savage released a non-political book on his search for spiritual truth, God, Faith, and Reason.[141]\n\nIn October 2018, Savage published a book on American psychology, Stop Mass Hysteria: America's Insanity from the Salem Witch Trials to the Trump Witch Hunt. [142] In it he discusses what he calls the many \"loud flashpoints\" that he believes have engulfed American thought over the nation's history, and relates those phenomena to what he describes as a current obsession with Trump hatred.\n\nIn June 2019, Savage published a new book of stories and anecdotes entitled A Savage Life.\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nLiterature as Michael A.

He went on, \u201cShe\u2019s basically unhitched herself from her own people, her own culture, her own heritage in order to appease the masses who keep her in power.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy of white genocide contends that there is a deliberate scheme underway to exterminate white people, or white culture, by overwhelming Western populations with non-whites. White supremacists typically accuse Jewish people of engineering this plot. Savage, who is Jewish, blamed Democrats.\n\n\u201cUnless we stand up to the racists and the genocidal maniacs who are attacking, attacking, attacking,\u201d Savage said, \u201cthere will be nothing left to protect, there will be nothing left to save. Everything of our culture will be gone.\u201d\n\nThe irony of a self-described \u201cstudent of the Holocaust\u201d deploying a traditionally antisemitic talking point may have been lost on Savage, but it wasn\u2019t lost on Vandal, a racist ex-Marine who, along with his twin brother Vanzetti Vandal, runs a blog advocating that whites return to the \u201cbarbarity\u201d of their past and \u201crape, pillage and plunder\u201d like their ancestors.\n\n\u201cRight now, the most outspoken and ardent opponents of White Genocide\u2026generally reserve their most scathing ire for the people-race-nation-church seemingly most responsible for perpetuating White Genocide: Jews,\u201d Vandal wrote on his blog, VandalVoid. \u201cBut here we have Michael Savage, a Jew, leading the charge against these anti-Whites\u2014the sole national figure, with the exception of maybe Alex Jones (albeit Savage goes even further than Jones), to do so.\u201d\n\nVandal is perhaps best known for originating the misogynist meme \u201cwhite sharia,\u201d proponents of which argue that white women should be subjected to the same kind of brutality perpetrated by the Taliban.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim world is the only civilization left on Earth today where an extreme and rigidly codified patriarchy still exists,\u201d Vandal wrote. \u201cSharia law, though practiced today by some of the world\u2019s most despicable races, is the only living example of anything that even remotely approximates the patriarchal society that Western man once had himself.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Savage has discussed white genocide on his show. He talked about it multiple times when President Barack Obama was in office. In those days, he said Obama was behind it. Once, he even attributed his claim to a Mayan prophecy.\n\nSavage is no stranger to bigoted rhetoric. In 2003, he lost his job at MSNBC after only a few months when he told a prank caller, \u201cOh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that?\u201d In 2014, he targeted U.S. veterans with PTSD, saying they were giving into \u201cweakness\u201d and being allowed \u201cto cry like a little baby in bed.\u201d\n\nHe reaches as many as 10 million listeners through his radio show, nationally syndicated by Cumulus Media, Inc."}, {"url": "https://deadorkicking.com/michael-savage-dead-or-alive-2/", "page_content": "How Old Is Michael Savage?

But on the subject of the coronavirus, Mr. Savage has become one of the loudest voices of dissent on the right.\n\nHis views are a striking departure from the accepted version of events among Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalists in the media, who have made a concerted effort to deny that they downplayed the epidemic. Mr. Savage has attacked the credibility of the conservative media, accused its biggest stars of being too rote and unthinking in their defense of the president, and demanded that they be held accountable for misleading millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a terrible time in America where truth has died,\u201d Mr. Savage, who was one of the first conservative media stars to urge Mr. Trump to run for president, told his audience. \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d he added, pointing to the way the president\u2019s defenders always accuse the left of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we not let our side be called on the carpet when they lie to the people?\u201d\n\nThat was Feb. 24.\n\nAt the time, coronavirus outbreaks were largely limited to a handful of countries like China, South Korea and Italy.

He was born in the year 1942 and this means that he is over 73 years old at this moment. By his age, he has been able to achieve many things that he had dreamed about.\n\nMichael Savage was born in the city of Bronx in the area of New York in USA. Because of his birth place, he is American by nationality. His ethnicity is of white and he got the degree in the University of New York. He appeared in different TV shows for the entire life and the one that became the most known is the Larry King Live and he hosted it together with Glenn Beck.\n\nAfter the death of actor Robin Williams, Michael Savage made a video to his tribute and it was uploaded on the Youtube.

But to others, Savage's astounding bigotry was simply money in the bank. Savage had lost his shot at big-time television, but all was not over for the man whose bestselling 2003 book, The Savage Nation, was still bringing in sizable royalty checks.\n\nOriginating station KNEW-AM 910 in San Francisco, station owner Clear Channel Communications, and the Talk Radio Network syndication group chose to keep Savage's immensely popular radio show, also called \"The Savage Nation,\" on the air. After all, KNEW had just lured Savage away from local rival KSFO-AM a month before his firing.\n\nAnd Savage was, as knew understood, a cash cow. His drive-time program, aired for four hours a day, five days a week from a station in what is arguably America's most liberal metropolitan area, is ranked No. 4 among the nation's radio talk shows.\n\nAs many as 7 million people around the country \u2014 most of them white men aged 35 to 55, according to the industry-watching Talkers Magazine \u2014 listen to \"The Savage Nation\" through some 330 affiliated stations. To them, Savage is a celebrity.\n\nThat Savage is also a bigot is well known. He has called inner-city victims of gunfire \"ghetto slime.\" He refers to non-white nations as \"Turd World\" countries. Latinos, he says, \"breed like rabbits.\" He regularly bashes gays and liberals.\n\nBut there is one type of group hatred that Savage, who claims to have coined the phrase \"compassionate conservative\" in 1994, long held in relative check.\n\nAlthough he called Jewish talk show host Jerry Springer \"hook-nosed,\" attacked a fictional ACLU lawyer named \"Mark Nobodyberg,\" and referred to Sen. Joseph Lieberman as \"throwing his bagel into the ring\" of the presidential campaign, Savage avoided sustained, on-air expressions of anti-Semitism.\n\nNot any more.\n\n'Jews From New York'\n\nLast November, Savage went after the Southern Poverty Law Center's president, Richard Cohen. Savage's ire came in response to the Center's lawsuit against former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore for installing a Ten Commandments monument in the state's judicial building. After vowing to defy a federal appeals court, Moore was removed from office by fellow Supreme Court justices despite protests from some Christian Right activists and others.\n\nOn Nov. 13, during one of many furious tirades that month about the Southern Poverty Law Center, Savage responded to a caller who seemed to agree with him about the case, but who questioned what appeared to be Savage's Jew-baiting.\n\n\"What do you mean I am trying to stir it up?\" Savage demanded. \"A guy like Cohen, who is obviously a Jew from New York, is going after a decent Christian man. What am I supposed to do? Sit here and take crap from him? I think he is a vile human being who ought to be arrested for a hate crime.\n\n\"And I am not going to mince words. And I guarantee you that he says 'goy' behind the scenes.\" (\"Goy\" is a Hebrew word for a non-Jew that, depending on its usage, can be derogatory. Savage also uses the plural \"goyim.\")\n\nAt one point in the exchange, Savage seemed ready to advocate violence against Jews. But he stopped short of spelling it out.\n\n\"I'll tell you the truth, it's enough to break your heart to see what this country has become,\" he said. \"And I have a lot of things that I really want to say today, that I'm going to have to control myself and not say, because there are things that need to be done that I can't say. But the country's at a terrible, terrible balancing point.\"\n\nSavage's self-control didn't last long. Later in the same broadcast he mocked Jews in a fake Brooklyn accent and laid out a justification for anti-Semitism.\n\n\"That's next isn't it?\" Savage asked. \"From these verminous Brooklyn College lawyers, isn't it? Go down South and have a tee-hee over the goyim. Laugh at the goyim. Go down there and take away the crosses and they can't touch you, huh Mr. Cohen? [Mock laughter.]\n\n\"Mr. Cohen, and you wonder where anti-Semitism comes from. Let me strip the mask off it for you today, because if you think I'm going to mince words you are mistaken. It comes from situations like this, when you have a New York Jew like Cohen going down South into the heartland of Christianity and stealing the religious symbol from Christians.\"\n\nThe Wiener Nation\n\nThere's just one thing. Savage is himself \"a New York Jew,\" a man who was born \u2014 and legally remains \u2014 Michael Alan Wiener. According to the liberal media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), Savage is the son of Jewish parents in the Bronx. He adopted his pseudonym in 1994, with his first major radio show.\n\nDespite that, Savage frequently talks about Christianity as \"our\" religion and bitterly criticizes those he characterizes as \"Christophobes.\" Now, with his attacks on Cohen, FAIR's Steve Rendall says Savage has crossed a new line.\n\n\"Savage's anti-Semitism is nothing new,\" said Rendall, a long-time analyst of Savage's show. \"But this takes him a step beyond, into the company of neo-Nazi conspiracists like [hate group leader] Matt Hale and [former Klansman] Don Black.\n\n\"What's most remarkable, though, is how Savage has put the blatant racism and anti-Semitism of the shortwave dial onto commercially sponsored am stations.\"\n\nThat doesn't seem to bother his backers.\n\n\"It's hard for us to comment on anything other than Michael is just wildly popular,\" KNEW-AM spokesman Ken Kohl told the Report. \"You don't achieve this kind of success in markets like New York and San Francisco unless you are wildly entertaining to huge numbers of people.\"\n\nFor their part, officials at Clear Channel Communications, after reviewing Savage's remarks about Cohen, limited themselves to a simple statement. \"Clear Channel's radio stations,\" it said, \"are operated and programmed locally based on extensive audience research.\"\n\nTalk Radio Network (TRN), a radio syndicator based in Central Point, Ore., and featuring an array of hard-right hosts, did not respond to requests for comment. But it has defended Savage from the start. Last May, it went to federal court to sue the operators of three small Web sites critical of their leading host in a bid to shut them down.\n\nAfter the public interest group Public Citizen stepped in to help defend the case, however, TRN seemed to crumble. On the December day that they were to respond to a defense motion to dismiss the case, TRN's attorneys instead asked the judge for permission to drop their own case. It was granted.\n\nNone of this has turned off Savage's publisher at WND Books, a new publishing house that is a partnership between the far-right World Net Daily Web site and Thomas Nelson Inc., a Nashville-based publisher of Christian books. WND Books also published Savage's latest book, The Enemy Within, which debuted this January at No. 8 on The New York Times' bestseller list.\n\n\"I can only say that I am a bit mystified by your assertion that Dr. Savage is anti-Semitic,\" David Dunham, who identified himself as WND Books publisher and a senior vice president at Thomas Nelson, Inc., said after reading transcripts of Savage's rhetoric.\n\n\"I would suppose that you are extrapolating this from his repeated comments that, 'Mr. Cohen is a Jew from New York.' That's no more anti-Semitic than if he said, 'David Dunham (me) is a Christian from Nashville.'\"\n\nExcept for one thing. Cohen was born and raised in Virginia."}], "Michael Savage is a conservative political commentator.": [{"url": "https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Michael_Savage", "page_content": "Michael Alan Weiner (born 31 March 1942), better known by his professional name Michael Savage, is a Jewish American radio host, writer, nutritionist, and conservative political commentator.

He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written several political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nSavage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. He has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as \"fostering extremism.\"[5] He supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.\n\nIn 2009, Savage was placed on a list of people permanently banned from entering the United Kingdom by British Home Secretary for \"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred.\"[5][6][7]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nSavage was born Michael Alan Weiner[8] in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin Weiner, a Jewish immigrant from Russia.[9][10][8][11] His mother, Rae, was from Montreal, Canada.[12]\n\nHe described his childhood as difficult, with a \"gruff, profane\" father who would frequently criticize and belittle him.[10] His younger brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak. Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970, and his mother died in 2003.[9][8]\n\nAfter graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958,[13][14] Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963.[8] After college, Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time, Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD.[10] Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972.[15][16] He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine.[17][18] His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.[19]\n\nShift in political opinions [ edit ]\n\nSavage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s.[20] He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University.[10][21] One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\"[11] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.[10]\n\nAcquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.[20] Schwartz[who?] stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.[20] When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\"[11] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker.[22] He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.[23] Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \"political opposition\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic.[24] In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.[25] In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The university instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the university, contending discrimination for being conservative.[20] Savage later dropped the lawsuit.[26]\n\nRadio [ edit ]\n\nThe rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.[20] On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for liberal Ray Taliaferro's overnight show and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" The show quickly became a local hit.\n\nLater in 1994, KGO parent company Capital Cities/ABC Inc. purchased the station KSFO and changed it to a conservative talk format.[27] On January 2, 1995, the first day of KSFO's new format, Savage debuted as host of afternoon drive time show The Savage Nation.[27][28] By 2000, Savage was the most popular afternoon drive host among all adults in San Francisco Arbitron ratings.[29]\n\nIn 1999, Talk Radio Network began syndicating part of The Savage Nation nationally.[30] Starting September 21, 2000, The Savage Nation became an entirely national show distributed by TRN.[31]\n\nIn mid-2006, Savage had 8\u201310 million listeners per week,[32] which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He has described his show's production as one with a \"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\"[33] Mark de la Vi\u00f1a of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: \"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\"[11]\n\nBy 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.[3][4] Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled \"Party of One\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.[8][34]\n\nOn September 10, 2009, KNEW (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI (640 kHz)\u2014Los Angeles.[35] John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an email that the station was headed \"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\"[36] According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.[37]\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \"rattle\" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010.[23] He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \"real writer\" who had understood his subject.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were underway.[38] Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.[39] By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners.[40] On September 26, 2013, Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.[41]\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.[42]\n\nIn January 2019, Savage in collaboration with Westwood One introduced a podcast format with a mixture of live-broadcast and studio material.[43]\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Savage celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the radio show.[44]\n\nOn January 1, 2021, The Savage Nation was discontinued by Cumulus Media and Westwood One.\n\nTV [ edit ]\n\nSavage had a brief political talk show on MSNBC beginning March 8, 2003, and ending July 7, 2003. Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do the one-hour show despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees. Sorenson called Savage \"brash, passionate and smart,\" and promised that he would provide \"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\"[45] After four months, Savage was fired from the show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, caused controversy in the gay community.\n\nSavage is a regular guest on Newsmax television with appearances on \"Stinchfield\" and \"The Count.\"\n\nPodcast [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019 Savage launched a podcast.[46] The Savage Nation Podcast posted episodes on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.[47][48]\n\nPolitical views [ edit ]\n\nMichael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\"[33] In a 2006 interview, Savage cited Barry Goldwater as an influence, saying \u201cI\u2019m a Goldwater conservative\u2026. If [another] Goldwater appeared, I\u2019d work for him, I\u2019d give money to him\"[49]\n\nSavage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture;[17] those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.[50]\n\nWildlife conservation [ edit ]\n\nSavage is a longtime advocate of wildlife conservation, and often points out that \"conservative\" and \"conservation\" have the same root, meaning \"to conserve\". He argues that conservatives should \"own\" environmental protection and conservation of wildlife resources. A December 2017 Huffington Post article quotes Savage regarding President Trump's revoking of an Obama-era trophy hunting ban: \"... long-time animal activist Michael Savage ... implored the president to reconsider:\n\n'Not all Obama legislation was bad,\u201d said Savage. 'Some of it (like this) was grand.' \"\n\nThe article continues ... \"Savage also addressed the (biblical) aspects of killing an elephant, lion or giraffe, animals that we don\u2019t normally hunt.\n\n'Dominion over animals doesn\u2019t mean destroying or terrorizing them,' he said.\"[51]\n\nA March 2018 article at The Hill quotes him at greater length: \"Conservative radio host Michael Savage has also spoken out against the Fish & Wildlife Service proposed policy this week, writing in a blog post Wednesday that he 'felt betrayed' by the administration\u2019s secret decision after having previously spoken in person with Trump on the issue.\n\n'I had spent a dinner talking to the President about environmental issues, and especially this, and this is what happened anyway,' Savage wrote. 'I made it clear that this was a red line that could not be crossed, that now elephants, lions and other big game had a target painted on them. I explained that the root of \u2018conservative\u2019 is the same as \u2018conservation\u2019 and the two do not need to be diametrically opposed. I explained what was meant by dominion, as I carefully spelled out in God Faith and Reason.' 'We hope that the president will step in here and overrule this order,' he added.'[52]\n\nThe private meeting with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago[53] followed a series of pleas on his radio show for Trump to support legislation that protected wildlife.[54] In August 2019, following the Trump administration's reauthorization of the use of cyanide bombs against wild animals,[55] Savage called on the White House and the US Environmental Protection Agency to reverse approval.[56]\n\nImmigration [ edit ]\n\nSavage opposes immigration, citing the black tar heroin epidemic, large percentage of immigrant prisoners, illegal use of public services, and diminishing American nationalism.[57] in a tweet on May 17, 2019, Michael said, \"Read my lips: no new immigrants.\"[17] He frequently warns that migrants carry diseases.[17] On March 28, 2006, following pro-immigration rallies in California, he encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags as an act of American nationalism to protest illegal immigration from Mexico.[58][59]\n\nEuropean Union [ edit ]\n\nSavage describes the European Union as \"Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control.\" He equates Britain's vote to leave the Union with the Second World War, saying it was \"in many ways the Battle of Britain all over again.\" Savage foresees that, after Brexit, the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of \"a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books.\"[60]\n\nIn 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\"[61] In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.[50] Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.[62]\n\nSavage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election.[citation needed] Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.[63]\n\nSavage has disagreed strongly with some of Trump's actions and policies, including the appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor, the bombings of Syria, what Savage describes as a failure to get illegal immigration to the United States under control, and failure to protect endangered and vulnerable wild animals. Nevertheless, he has endorsed Trump for president in the 2020 United States presidential election.[64]\n\nDubai Ports World controversy [ edit ]\n\nIn early 2006, the administration of President George W. Bush approved sale of a port security contract to a company, Dubai Ports World (DP World), headquartered in The United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nMichael Savage was highly influential in the defeat of the deal. On February 13, the first day it was reported in the news, \u201cSavage used his radio show to attack the transfer of American homeland assets to a company owned by an Arab state.\u201d[65] Savage's concerns were based in part on the fact that \u201ctwo of the 9/11 suicide hijackers came from the United Arab Emirates, and much of the funding for the attacks flowed through United Arab Emirates banks.\u201d[66] On his February 17 radio show, Savage interviewed Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a longtime nemesis with whom Savage otherwise agreed on the Dubai ports issue.[67]\n\nThe White House was listening to Savage: \u201cThough the deal had received some newspaper attention before then, Mr. Savage's angry message raised early concerns inside the Bush White House about trouble ahead.\"[65] Savage and other opponents of the deal \u201cgenerated a wave of anger from Americans across the country that left lawmakers in Washington -- by their own admission -- following their constituents much more than leading them.\u201d Lawmakers said the negative response from constituents was overwhelming. Congressional offices on Capitol Hill were deluged by phone calls and emails protesting the deal, and congressmen told of being pulled aside wherever they went in their districts. Rep. Don Manzullo, a Republican from Illinois who is chairman of the House subcommittee on small business, said \"I got stopped all over the place,\" he said. \"People are big-time upset.\"[65]\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Savage subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory,[68] a white nationalist belief, which claims that white people are becoming extinct through forced assimilation or violent genocide. Savage blames Barack Obama[69] and the Democratic Party for promoting the concept within the United States.[70] He has claimed there is a \"cultural genocide being promulgated against Caucasians\".[71]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and positions on vaccines [ edit ]\n\nA January 31, 2020, article in Stat News quoted Savage's call for a stop to flights from China: \u201cQUARANTINE! STOP TRAVELERS FROM CHINA NOW!\"[72] Two months later, an April 16, 2020 New York Times feature article credited Savage for being one of the first in the media, especially the conservative media, to take the COVID-19 epidemic seriously. On his radio show Savage used his credentials\u2014a PhD with training in epidemiology\u2014to speak to his fans on coronavirus research: How the virus is transmitted; which treatments were proving effective; and the difference between morbidity and mortality rates. \"Savage's views were a departure from those of other conservative commentators, who made a concerted effort to deny that they downplayed the epidemic. Savage attacked their credibility and demanded that they be held accountable for misleading millions of Americans.\"[73] As early as February 24, 2020, Savage was saying of Limbaugh and Hannity: \u201cHow can we not let our side be called on the carpet when they lie to the people?\u201d[73] Savage is also sharply critical of the Director of the NIAID, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissing him as \u201ca grandstander\u201d who mishandled the AIDS epidemic by refusing to close down the gay bathhouses. Savage believes that one-size-fits-all lockdowns are a threat to individual liberty, and calls instead for selective quarantine of at-risk populations.[73]\n\nIn a May 4, 2020, article in the Washington Examiner, Savage is quoted as saying he will refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine, saying that it will likely be \"ineffective and dangerous.\"[74] Savage has a history of opposing the flu vaccine, for reasons he outlined in a January 15, 2013, interview. Savage argued that the Centers for Disease Control authorities have to guess what the vaccine should be made of. \u201cSo they choose five strains out of 250-plus strains of Influenza A, and if they don\u2019t choose the right one, you\u2019re going to get sick,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re putting your faith in the CDC\u2019s ability to guess the one that might be a pandemic.\" He said that \"this year\" (2013), the CDC guessed right on two of the strains and wrong on one of them.[75]\n\nIn contrast to his views on the flu vaccine, Savage supports vaccines, such as for polio, that last for many years because they address an infectious agent with a low mutation rate. A 2013 Ethics Alarms article recounts Savage saying that \"...one of his heroes growing up was Jonas Salk, not because he invented the first effective polio vaccine, but because he refused to patent it, and gave it to the world for the benefit of humanity. A bit later, Savage noted that Albert Sabin, Salk\u2019s bitter rival who later invented the oral vaccine, also declined to profit from his invention. Could all this be true, I wondered? If it is true, why did I not know about it? Why doesn\u2019t everybody know about it? It is true. Asked why he didn\u2019t patent his vaccine, Salk famously answered, \u201cCan you patent the sun?\u201d[76][77]\n\nSavage opposes wearing masks to slow the spread of COVID-19 in both indoor and outdoor settings.[citation needed] Recently, he accepted wearing masks in indoor public places.[78]\n\nActivism [ edit ]\n\nLegal defense contributions [ edit ]\n\nSavage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the U.S. Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton.[79] Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center[80] On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.[81] The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nOn November 17, 2016, Savage was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.[82] Savage describes this event as \"The capstone of my career.\"\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Savage was named by President Trump to serve on the Board of Directors of The Presidio Trust, which teams with the National Park Service to manage the Presidio of San Francisco, the former military fort that is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Savage stated that he hopes \"to help save this great legacy while also reminding the public of the military significance of this land.\u201d[83] Once on the board, he regularly protested what he believed to be the museum's overemphasis on the facility's use as a Japanese American internment camp during World War II, an action he insisted was not motivated by racism but military necessity. He also did not get along with other board members, often writing them angry ALL CAPS emails about small things that greatly angered him; in turn, the rest of the board felt he could have lobbied the administration for additional funding far more intensively than he ever did, given his connections.[84] On May 20, 2021, he was ordered to resign from the Board of Directors of The Presidio Trust or he would be fired by the end of the workday. The current website for the Presidio Trust Board of Directors no longer shows him as a board member.\n\nCriticism and controversies [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that \"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\"[85] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation \"is an act, a put-on.\"[49] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[86][87][88]\n\nOn April 17, 2006, Savage said on the topic of Muslims, \"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?\"[89] The remarks made by Savage were seriously criticized worldwide and was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.[90]\n\nIn the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \"aggressive act\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.[91] The assertion prompted criticism.[91]\n\nControversial MSNBC exchange [ edit ]\n\nSavage was hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show which began in March 2003. Controversy arose four months later over remarks made in response to a caller who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage responded by asking if the caller was a \"sodomite\", and when the caller replied that he was, Savage said:\n\n\"Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig. How's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage. You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now, do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another- put another sodomite on ... no more calls? I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.\"[87]\n\nThe interchange created a firestorm of protest including calls for his firing by the LGBT group GLAAD.[87] Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS. Nevertheless, MSNBC fired him within days of the event.[92]\n\nCatholic Church and immigration [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \"pastoral support\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.[93]\n\nC-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award [ edit ]\n\nWhen Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.[94]\n\nDispute with CAIR [ edit ]\n\nIn early November 2007, the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \"need deportation\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \"take your religion and shove it up your behind\" because \"I'm sick of you.\"[95] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.[96]\n\nSavage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.[97] The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate\". CAIR called the suit \"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\".[98] On July 25, 2008, United States district court Judge Susan Illston dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under fair use.[99] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.[100] CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage; Judge Illston denied that request.[101]\n\nAutism [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \"a racket\" designed to get disability payments for \"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\"[102] He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:\n\nNow, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, \"Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot.\"[103]\n\nIn July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.[103][104] WOR issued a statement saying, \"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\"[102] Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising,[105] and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show.[106] Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \"ripped out of context\" by \"far left Stalinists\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.[102] On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, The Home Depot, and DirectBuy, would discontinue their support for Savage's show.[107]\n\nSavage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.[108]\n\nPermanently banned from entering the United Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith of the Labour party that Savage was on a list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\".[109][110][111][112] During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \"lunatic\".[113]\n\nDuring a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\".[114] Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\"[115] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.[114]\n\nOf the banning, the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: \"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\"[116] After Johnson became Prime Minister in 2019, Savage's attorney requested the ban be overturned, however no action has been taken by the Conservative government as of 2020.[117][118] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: \"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\"[119] Sam Leith wrote: \"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\"[90]\n\nVeteran PTSD [ edit ]\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of posttraumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \"weakness\". According to Savage, \"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\"[120]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nWhile in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji.[26] That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.\n\nSavage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter Rebecca Lin Weiner Yops born on March 2, 1967, and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, born on February 15, 1970, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.[121] Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.[10] In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California, after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii.[20] Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills, California, and West Palm Beach, Florida.[20][122][123]\n\nDuring the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Jewish Synagogue Chabad house in Berkeley.[8] In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.[124] In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: \"... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"[125] In his podcast aired 25 November 2020, Savage stated: \"Trust in God. God leads my footsteps. God has determined that I will be on podcast come January. God determines a lot of things in our lives and you have to trust in God and just say its fate at a certain point. Now, I've always believed that we make our own fate. I've not been one of these leaves-in-a-stream type of personalities...\"[126]\n\nIn December 2019, Savage notably suffered a heart attack, but subsequently recovered and returned on air.[127]\n\nSavage has had many pet dogs throughout his life. His beloved toy poodle Teddy died in late 2021.[128]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nIn total, Savage has written 44 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty-four under the pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times Best Sellers and three additional books which made The New York Times Best Seller list.[129][130][131] have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.\n\nHis earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., draw on his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and HIV/AIDS.[132] He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.[132]\n\nHis more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.\n\nIn 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books.[133] In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action \"reverse discrimination\", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.[134]\n\nIn January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book directs attacks at \"liberal media bias\", the \"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\", gay activists, and liberals.\n\nIn January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military.

The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in caricature as animals in the \"Political Zoo\", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper.\n\nIn October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\"[135]\n\nIn November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on \"My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know\", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \"the Hand of Allah\". The publisher has described the novel by saying, \"will make 9/11 look like child's play\".[136]\n\nIn 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth, in which Savage writes in part, \"We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies.\"[137]\n\nIn 2015, Savage released another a book titled Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture. In it he writes that the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, \"borders, language and culture,\" and describes what he calls the destruction that the Presidency of Barack Obama brought to the country. He offers several solutions to rebuild the nation.[138]\n\nIn 2016, Savage's book Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama. This work was a blueprint for how then candidate Donald Trump could help get the country back on the right track should he win the election.[139]\n\nIn March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller List.[140]\n\nIn November 2017, Savage released a non-political book on his search for spiritual truth, God, Faith, and Reason.[141]\n\nIn October 2018, Savage published a book on American psychology, Stop Mass Hysteria: America's Insanity from the Salem Witch Trials to the Trump Witch Hunt. [142] In it he discusses what he calls the many \"loud flashpoints\" that he believes have engulfed American thought over the nation's history, and relates those phenomena to what he describes as a current obsession with Trump hatred.\n\nIn June 2019, Savage published a new book of stories and anecdotes entitled A Savage Life.\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nLiterature as Michael A.

His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.\n\nShift in political opinions\n\nSavage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a \"calling card.\" Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\" Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.\n\nAcquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\" Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \"political opposition\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit.\n\nRadio\n\nThe rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal aliens and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro. At the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.\n\nIn mid 2006, Savage had 8\u201310 million listeners per week, which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He has described his show's production as one with a \"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\" Mark de la Vi\u00f1a of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: \"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\"\n\nBy 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time. Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled \"Party of One\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed \"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\" According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \"rattle\" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010. He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \"real writer\" who had understood his subject.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.\n\nMSNBC television show\n\nSavage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, \"Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?\" Sorenson, at the time, called Savage \"brash, passionate and smart,\" and promised that he would provide \"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\"\n\nFour months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a \"sodomite\", to which the caller answered, \"Yes, I am.\" Savage then said to the caller,\n\nOh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.\n\nThe day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.\n\nPolitical views\n\nMichael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\" He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence. Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.\n\nIn 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\" In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush. Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.\n\nRegarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had \"great ideas\" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee. On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich \"1 million dollars\" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a \"quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist\" and a possible foreign usurper, in the 2012 election.\n\nSavage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.\n\nActivism\n\nLegal defense contributions\n\nSavage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton. Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund. The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.\n\nIn November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.\n\nLieutenant Michael Behenna\n\nOn his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.\n\nMichael Savage Scholarship\n\nIn July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question \"What Does It Mean to Be an American?\" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.\n\nAwards and criticism\n\nAwards\n\nOn June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.\n\nNational Radio Hall of Fame\n\nIn 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]\n\nCriticism\n\nIn July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that \"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\" David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation \"is an act, a put-on.\" Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.\n\nOn April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, \"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?\" This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.\n\nIn the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \"aggressive act\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - \"you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem\" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.\n\nCatholic Church and Immigration\n\nIn March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \"pastoral support\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology.\"\n\nOn March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California\n\nC-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award\n\nWhen Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Michael Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage stated that C-SPAN's decision was \"censorship\" and he told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.\n\nDispute with CAIR\n\nIn early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \"need deportation\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \"take your religion and shove it up your behind\" because \"I'm sick of you.\" On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.\n\nSavage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate\". CAIR called the suit \"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to \"comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations.\" The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.\n\nAutism\n\nIn July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \"a racket\" designed to get disability payments for \"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\" He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:\n\nNow, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, \"Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot.\"\n\nIn July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children. WOR issued a statement saying, \"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\" Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising, and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show. Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \"ripped out of context\" by \"far left Stalinists\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits. On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.\n\nSavage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.\n\nBanned from entering the United Kingdom\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\". During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \"lunatic\".\n\nDuring a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\" When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.\n\nOf the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: \"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\" In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: \"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\" While Sam Leith wrote: \"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.\n\nVeteran PTSD\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \"weakness\". According to Savage, \"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhile in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji. That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.\n\nSavage and his second wife Janet have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink. Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009. Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher. In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii. Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley. In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year. In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: \"... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"\n\nLiterary works\n\nIn total, Savage has written 36 works, twenty-one under his real name of Michael Weiner, and fifteen under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include a #1 New York Times bestseller and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list. Two of his books as Michael Weiner, Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's and Healing Children Naturally have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.\n\nHis earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.\n\nHis more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.\n\nIn 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books. In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action \"reverse discrimination\", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.\n\nIn January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at \"liberal media bias\", the \"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\", gay activists, and liberals.\n\nIn January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.\n\nIn April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the \"Political Zoo\", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.\n\nIn October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\"\n\nIn November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on \"My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know\", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \"the Hand of Allah\". The publisher has described the novel by saying, \"will make 9/11 look like child's play\".\n\nIn October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments \"[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country.\" It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List for six weeks.\n\nSavage's latest political book is entitled Government Zero - a critique of the Obama Administration's foreign and domestic policies including Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/michael-savage-trump-coronavirus.html", "page_content": "Much of the time, Mr. Savage still sounds like any other right-wing shock jock \u2014 making fun of Nancy Pelosi and doubting the validity of the #MeToo movement.

Mr. Savage has attacked the credibility of the conservative media, accused its biggest stars of being too rote and unthinking in their defense of the president, and demanded that they be held accountable for misleading millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a terrible time in America where truth has died,\u201d Mr. Savage, who was one of the first conservative media stars to urge Mr. Trump to run for president, told his audience. \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d he added, pointing to the way the president\u2019s defenders always accuse the left of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we not let our side be called on the carpet when they lie to the people?\u201d\n\nThat was Feb. 24.\n\nAt the time, coronavirus outbreaks were largely limited to a handful of countries like China, South Korea and Italy.

Serving as resident biologist and zookeeper, Dr. Savage asks that you watch your step when approaching the widemouth copperhead Ted Turner (also known as Mouthus desouthus), do not feed the ego of stuffed turkey Alec Baldwin (Notalentus anti-americanus), and please keep your children with you at all times around wolf boy Bill Clinton (Fondlem undgropeum).\n\n\"The world of politics is filled with uncivilized, snarling, rapacious beasts that, like untrained mutts, raise their legs and urinate on everything we hold dear,\" says Savage.

Michael Savage is most widely recognized for his radio show, \"Savage Nation\", and the related series of books he has released promoting \"conservative nationalism\".\n\nEarly Life\n\nSavage was born Michael Alan Weiner in The Bronx, New York on March 31, 1942. He is one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner, Jewish emigrants from Russia. Savage has described his childhood as difficult with a \"gruff, profane\" father who would often criticize him. His younger brother Jerome was born unable to hear or speak and died in 1969. His father died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970.\n\nHe graduated from Jamaica High School in 1958 and attended Queens College, earning a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After earning his B.S., he taught high school for several years in New York City. During this time, he worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as a keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate, to which Leary had been given access. He hired him to the post specifically because Savage did not use LSD. Savage holds a Ph. D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine and master's degrees in medical botany and medical anthropology from the University of Hawaii.\n\nRadio Career\n\nIn 1994, Savage's manuscript about illegal immigration was rejected by publishers. This prompted him to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk host about the contents of his work. He mailed the tape to 250 radio stations across the country in an attempt to change the course of his career and become a radio talk show host. In March 1994, Savage began his radio career on San Francisco's KGO as a fill-in host for liberal Ray Taliaferro's overnight show. At the time, Savage's slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" The show quickly became a local hit.\n\nLater that year, KGO's parent company purchased the station and changed it to a conservative talk format. On January 2, 1995, Savage debuted as host of afternoon drive time show The Savage Nation. In 1999, Talk Radio Network began syndicating the show nationally. In September 2000, The Savage Nation became an entirely national show. By mid-2006, Savage had 8-10 million listeners per week, making his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the country at that time. By 2009, the show was being played on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened to radio talk show in the nation.\n\nIn September 2009, Savage's home market of San Francisco announced it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM in Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an email that the station was headed \"\u2026 in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\" However, Savage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract and won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, which led to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but was required to agree to a four-week non compete clause, which prevented Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.\n\nThe show was revived on Cumulus Media Networks on October 23, 2012. It aired a new time slot, 9:00 P.M. to Midnight ET. The following year, Savage changed back to afternoon drive hours, replacing Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks, thus inciting a feud between the two talk show hosts. In 2016, Savage was widely credited with helping Donald Trump become the President of the United States. He is known as \"The Godfather of Trumpmania.\"\n\nIn January 2019, Savage Nation was cut to two hours, only one of which is carried on terrestrial radio, with the second hour exclusively carried as a podcast. In September 2020, Savage announced that he would Westwood One would be withdrawing the radio show from syndication at the end of the year, leaving only the podcast, and that Savage was under a gag order as to why the change was being made\n\nAt the peak of \"Savage Nation\", his show had an audience of nearly 10 million per day and was broadcast on 400 radio stations in the United States. Michael Savage has written 40 books including two #1 New York Times bestsellers. In March of 2017, Savage released what he professed would be his last book in the political sphere: Trump's War: His Battle For America.\n\nPolitical Views\n\nHe characterizes his views as conservative nationalism and has said he can describe his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. He supports the English-only movement, opposes illegal immigration to the U.S., and says that progressivism and liberalism are degrading our American culture.\n\nControversies\n\nIn 2009 Savage was banned from entering the United Kingdom. In 2014, Savage aroused even further controversy by setting his sights on sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder, calling sufferers of that condition \"weak\" and drawing parallels between their plight and the Obama administration. As of 2020, Savage vehemently opposes wearing masks in public to slow the spread of COVID-19 in both indoor and outdoor settings. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Savage subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory, a white national belief. Throughout his career, he has often been under fire from LGBT groups for various insulting statements.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHis first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. He and Janet have two children, a daughter and a son. Interestingly. Michael's son Russ Weiner is the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink.
